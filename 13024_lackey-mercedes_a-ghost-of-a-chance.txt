a ghost of a chance by mercedes lackey a voice an icy whispering voice came out of the darkness from all around her from everywhere yet nowhere it could have been born of her imagination yet rune knew the voice was the ghosts and that to run was to die instantly but in terror that would make dying seem to last an eternity why have you come here stupid child it murmured as fear urged her to run away why were you waiting here for me foolish child do you not know what i am what i could do to you rune had to swallow twice before she could speak and even then her voice cracked and squeaked with fear ive come to fiddle for yousir she said gasping for breath between each word trying to keep her teeth from chattering the ghost laughed a sound with no humor in it the kind of laugh that called up empty wastelands and icy peaks well then girl fiddle then and pray to that sacrificed god of yours that you fiddle well very well if you please me if you continue to entertain me until dawn i shall let you live a favor i have never granted any other but i warn youthe moment my attention lags little girlyoull die like all the others and you will join all the others in my own private little hell chapter one the attic cubicle was dark and stuffy two conditions the tiny window under the eaves did little to alleviate rune reached up to the shelf over her pallet for her fiddle case and froze with her hand less than an inch away her mothers nasal whine echoed up the stairs from the tavern sleeping rooms below rune rune rune sighed and her hand dropped to her side yes mother she called over her shoulder shed hoped to get a little practice in before the evening customers began to file in have you swept the tavern and scrubbed the tables when stara said the tavern she meant the common room the kitchen was not in runes purview the cook annie who was also the stablemans wife reigned supreme there and permitted no one within her little kingdom but herself and her aged helper known only as granny no mother rune called down resignedly i thought maeve maeves doing the rooms get your behind down there the sooner you get it over with the sooner you can get on with that foolish scraping of yours then as an afterthought as rune reached the top step and dont call me mother yes mstara stifling another sigh rune plodded down the steep dark attic stairs hardly more than a ladder down the back wall as she passed the open doors she heard maeves tuneless humming and the slow scrape of a broom coming from the one on her right from the bottom she crossed the hall to the real stairs taking them two at a time down into the common room the shutters on the windows on two sides of the room had been flung wide to the brisk spring air a light breeze slowly cleared out the last of the beer fumes a halfworn broom leaned against the bar at the back of the room where maeve had undoubtedly left it when stara ordered her upstairs rune took it her first glance around had told her that nothing more had been accomplished except to open the shutters the benches were still stacked atop the tables and the latter pushed against the walls the fireplace was still full of last nights ashes nothing had been cleaned or put into order and the only sign that the tavern was opening for business was the open shutters probably because that was all anyone had thought to tell maeve to do rune went to the farthest corner of the room and started sweeping digging the worn bristles of the broom firmly against the floorboards the late rose wife of innkeeper jeoff had called maeve an innocent annie said she was a little simple what stara called her was a great lump poor maeve was all of those rune reflected she lived in a world all her own that was certain she couldand did if left to her own devicesstand in a window for hours humming softly with no discernible tune staring at nothing but if you gave her clear orders she would follow them to the exact letter told to sweep out a room she would do so that room and no more leaving a huge pile of dirt on the threshold told to wash the dishes she would wash the dishes all right but not the pots nor the silverware and she wouldnt rinse them afterwards of course if anyone interrupted her in the middle of her task she would drop what she was doing follow the new instructions and never return to the original job still without her help rune would have a lot more to do shed never have time to practice her fiddling rune attacked the dirt of the floor with short angry strokes wishing she could sweep the troubles of her life out as easily not that life here was bad precisely rune stara called down the stairs are you sweeping i cant hear you yes mstara rune replied the worn bristles were too soft to scrape the floor the way maeves broom was doing but it was pointless to say anything about it so stara didnt want to be called mother anymore rune bit her lip in vexation did she really think that if rune stopped referring to her as mother people would forget their relationship not here rune told herself sourly not when my existence is such a pointed example of why good girls dont do that without wedding banns being posted even though stara was from a village far from hereeven though she wore the braids of a married woman and claimed that runes father had been a journeyman muleteer killed by banditsmost of the village guessed the real truth that stara was no lawfully wedded widow that rune was a bastard stara had been a serving wench in the home of a master silversmith and had let the blandishments of a peddler with a glib tongue and ready money lure her into his bed the immediate result had been a silver locket and scarlet ribbons from his pack the longterm result was a growing belly and the loss of her place stara lived on the charity of the church for a time but no longer than she had to after rune had been born stara had packed up her belongings and her meager savings and set out on foot as far as her money would take her hoping to find some place where her charm her ability to wheedle and her soft blond prettiness would win her sympathy protection and a new and better place rune suspected that she had soon discoveredmuch to her shockthat while her looks as always won her the sympathy of the males of the households she sought employment with she got no favor from the females certainly on the rare occasions when she talked to her daughter about those longago days she had railed against the jealous old bitches who had turned her out again after they discovered what their spouses had hired and so would i have rune thought wryly as the pile of dirt in front of her broom grew to the size of her closed fist the girl stara had been was all too likely to have a big belly again as soon as shed wormed her way into the household and this time the result would have been sure to favor the looks of the master of the house she had no credentials no referencesinstead of applying properly to the women of the household she went straight to the men stupid mother but then you never have paid any attention to women when there were men around but finally stara had wound up here at the hungry bear the innkeepers wife rose was of a credulous generous and forgiving nature innkeeper jeoff a pious churchman and charitable that alone might not have earned her the place as the servingmaid in the tavern but luck had been with her this time their potboy had signed with the army and gone off to the city and there was no one in the village willing or able to take his place staras arrival even encumbered as she was must have seemed like a gift from god and they had needed her desperately enough to take her story at face value although the villagers guessed most of the tale easily enough they too were obliged to accept the false story outwardly at least since jeoff and rose did but rune was never allowed to forget the truth stara threw it in runes face every time she was angry about anythingand the village children had lost no opportunity to imply she was a bastard for as long as she could remember they only said openly what their parents thought stara didnt seem to care wearing lowcut blouses and kiltedup skirts when she went into the village on errands flirting with the men and ignoring the sneers of the women back in the tavern under roses eye however she had pulled the drawstrings of her blouses tight and let her skirts down acting demure and briskly businesslike in all her dealings with males rune had more than once heard rose defending her foundling to her friends among the villagers telling jeoff afterwards that they were just envious because of staras youth and attractiveness and that much was certainly true the village women were jealous stara was enough to excite any womans jealousy other than a tolerant easygoing lady like rose with her long blond hair her plump prettiness her generous breasts and her willingness to display her charms to any eye that cared to look of course none of this did any good at all for her reputation in the village but stara didnt seem to concern herself over trifles like what the villagers thought it was left to rune to bear the brunt of her mothers reputation to try to ignore the taunts and the veiled glances stara didnt care about that either so long as nothing touched or inconvenienced her directly stara was relatively content only relatively since stara was not happy with her life as it was and frequently voiced her complaints in long afterhours monologues to her daughter with little regard for whether or not rune was going to suffer from loss of sleep the next day last night had been one of those nights and rune yawned hugely as she swept rune wasnt precisely certain what her mother wantedbesides a life of complete leisure just what stara had done to deserve such a life eluded runebut stara seemed to feel quite strongly that she deserved it and had gone on at aggrieved and shrill length about it last night rune yawned again and swept the last of the nights trodin dirt out into the road it would of course find its way right back inside tonight only in the great cities were the streets paved and kept clean it was enough that the road through the village was graveled and graded from one end to the other it kept down the mud and kept ruts to a minimum as well wish for stara to become a pious churchgoer as to wish for a paved road the second was likelier to occur than the first rune propped the broom in a corner by the fireplace and emptied the ashes and clinkers into the ashpit beneath the fireplace floor every few months the candlemaker came to collect them from the cellar once a year the inn got a halfdozen bars of scented soap in exchange a lot of the inns supplies came from exchange strawberries for manure hay and straw for use of the donkey and pony help for room and board and clothing there were four folk working under that exchange right now of the six employees only two annie cook and tarn hostler received wages the rest got only their rooms two suits of clothing each year and all they could eat while rune had been too young to be of much help shed had to share her mothers room but now that she was pulling her share of her load she had a room to herself there wasnt a door just a curtain and there was no furniture but the pallet she slept on but it was hers alone and she was glad of the privacy not that stara ever brought men up to her roomshe wouldnt have dared even the easygoing rose would not have put up with thatbut it was nice to be able to pull the curtain and pretend the outside world didnt exist provided of course stara didnt whine all night there was no escaping that with the fireplace swept and logs laid ready to light rune fetched a pail of water a bit of coarse brown soap and a rag from the kitchen with a nod to granny who sat in the corner peeling roots annie cook was nowhere in sight she was probably down in the cellar from the brick ovens in the rear wall came a wave of heat and the mouthwatering smell of baking bread rune swallowed hard as her stomach growled breakfast had been a long time ago and dinner too far away she was always hungry these days probably because she was growing like a saplingthe tooshort cuffs of her shirt and breeches gave ample evidence of that if i hurry up maybe i can get granny to give me a bit of cheese and one of yesterdays loafends before annie makes them all into bread pudding with that impetus in mind rune quickly hauled the tables and benches away from the walls got the benches down in place and went to work on the tabletops scouring with a will fortunately there werent any bad stains this time she got them done faster than shed expected and used the last of the soapy water to clean herself up before tossing the bucketful out the door but when she returned the bucket to the kitchen annie was back up from her journey below her stomach growled audibly as she set the bucket down and annie looked up sharply her round face red with the heat from the oven what she said her hair coming loose from its pins and braids and wisping damply about her head you cant be hungry already rune nodded mutely and tried to look thin and pathetic she must have succeeded for annie shook her head shrugged and pointed her round chin towards the pile of ingredients awaiting her attention two carrots one loafend and a piece of cheese and get yerself out of here the cook said firmly more than that cant be spared and mind that piece is no bigger than your hand yes cook rune said meeklyand snatched her prizes before annie changed her mind but the cook just chuckled as she cut the cheese i should ha known from yer breeches darlin yer into yer growth come back later if yer still hungry an ill see if sommat got burnt too much fer the custom she thanked annie with an awkward bob of her head took her food out into the common room and devoured it down to the last crumb waiting all the while for another summons by her mother but no call came only the sound of stara scolding maeve and maeves humming rune sighed with relief maeve never paid any attention to anything that wasnt a direct order let stara wear her tongue out on the girl the scolding would roll right off the poor things backand maybe stara would leave her own daughter alone for once rune stuffed that last bite of bread and cheese in her mouth and stole softly up the stairs if she could just get past the sleeping rooms to get her fiddleonce she began practicing stara would probably leave her alone after all shed done her duty for the day sweeping and cleaning the common room was surely enough especially after all the cleaning shed done in the kitchen this morning sometimes she was afraid that her hands would stiffen from all the scrubbing she had to do she massaged them with the lotion the farmers used on cows udders reckoning that would help and it seemed tobut she still worried from the sound of things in the far room stara had decided to turn it out completely she must have set maeve to beating the straw tick that monotonous thumping was definitely following the rhythm of maeves humming and it was a safe enough task for even maeve to manage this time she got to her fiddle and slipped down the stairs without being caught she settled herself into a bench in the corner of the room out of direct lineofsight of the stairs it hadnt always been this hard to get her practice in when rose was alive the afternoons had always been her own yes and the evenings too as long as rune helped rose had made it very clear that she was to be considered as full an employee as staraand rose had counted entertainment as helping rose had forbidden staraor anyone elseto beat rune after the one time rose had caught her mother taking a stick to her for some trifle rune carefully undid the old clasps on the black leatherandwood case they were stiff with age and hard to get open but better too stiff than too loose rose had taken a special interest in rune for some reason maybe because rose had no children of her own but when rose died of the cough last winter everything changed at first it hadnt been bad really it made sense for rune to take over some of staras duties since stara was doing what rose had done and work in the winter wasnt that difficult hardly anyone came in for midmeal there were very few travelers to mess up the rooms and people came for their beer and a bit of entertainment but didnt stay late there wasnt any dirt or mud to be tracked in just melting snow which soaked into the old worn floorboards fairly easily really winter work was the lightest of the four seasons and rune had assumed that once the initial confusion following roses death resolved itself jeoff would hire someone else to help another boy perhaps a boy would be just as useful inside the inn as a girl and stronger too there had even been a couple of boys passing through earlier this month on the way to the hiring fairs whod looked likely theyd put in a good days work for their meal and corner by the fireand theyd even asked rune if she thought jeoff would be interested in hiring them on permanently but jeoff always found some excuse not to take them onand rune kept losing a little more of her free time with every day that passed now she not only found herself scrubbing and cleaning she was serving in the common room at night something she hadnt had to do since she was a good enough fiddler to have people ask her to play that was one of the reasons the hungry bear was so popular even when there werent any traveling musicians passing through people could always count on rune to give em a tune to sing or dance to why people sometimes came from as far away as the next village of beeford because of her but nowshe was allowed to play only when the crowds asked jeoff for her music if they forgot to ask if there was no one willing to speak upthen she waited on them just like silly maeve while stara presided in roses place over the beer barrels and jeoff tended as always to the cashbox rune bit her lip beginning to see a pattern in all this there were more changes and they were even more disturbing there was no doubt in runes mind that her mother had set her sights on jeoff aiming no doubt for matrimony when rose was alive stara had kept herself quietly out of sight her hair tightly braided and hidden under kerchiefs wearing her blousestrings pulled tight her skirts covering her feet and keeping her eyes down rune knew why toostara flung it in her face often enough stara had one bastard she was not minded to attract the masters eye only to find herself in his bed and saddled with another bastard but since jeoff put off his mourning bands stara had transformed from a drab little sparrow to a bird of a different feather entirely she was rinsing her hair with herbs every night to make it yellow as newminted gold and smell sweet she had laced the waist of her skirts tight kilted them up to show ankles and even knees and pulled her blouses low and she was painting her face when she thought no one could see her red on the lips and cheeks blackening her lashes with soot trying to make herself look younger where she got the stuff rune had no idea possibly a peddler though there hadnt been any with things like that through here since before winter stara didnt like being reminded that she had a fourteenyearold daughter and she certainly didnt want jeoff reminded of the fact it helped that rune looked nothing like her mother rune was tall thin with light brown curly hair and deep brown eyes she couldand occasionally didpass for a boy in the crowded commonroom she was nothing at all like soft round dollpretty stara which was exactly as stara wanted things rune was sure of it for there was a race on to see whod snare jeoff maeve was no competition the girl was plain as well as simplealthough it was a good thing she was plain or she would have been fair game for any fellow bent on lifting a skirt rune wasnt interestedand half the time jeoff absentmindedly called her lad anyway staras only competition would come from the village there were a couple of young women down there in westhaven of marriageable age whose fathers saw nothing wrong with running a good clean inn fathers who would not be averse to seeing their daughters settled in as the innkeepers wife none were as pretty as starabut they all had dowers which she did not and they were younger with plenty of childbearing years ahead of them much younger some of them one of the possible prospects was only sixteen not that much older than staras daughter no wonder stara wanted to be thought younger than she was rune got out her fiddle and began tuning it it was a little too cold to be playing outsidebut jeoff liked hearing the music and once she started playing it was unlikely that stara would order her to do something else the gift of the fiddle had been roses idea shed watched as rune begged to play with traveling minstrels instrumentsand had begun to coax something like music out of them right awayshed seen rune trying to get a good tune out of a reed whistle a blade of grass and anything else that made a noise perhaps she had guessed what rune might do with a musical instrument of her own for whatever reason when rune was about six a peddler had run off without paying leaving behind a pack filled with trash he hadnt been able to sell one of the few things in it worth anything was the fiddle given immediately to rune which rune had named lady rose in honor of her patron it had taken many months of squealing and scraping out in the stable where she wouldnt offend any ears but the animals before she was able to play much but by the time she was eight minstrels were going out of their way to give her a lesson or two or teach her a new song by the time she was ten she was a regular draw rune was smart enough to remember what the common room had looked like on any day other than a marketday before she had started to play regularlyand she knew what it was like now roses investment had paid off handsomely over the yearsgaining in new business several times over the worth of the old fiddle but staraand there was no doubt in runes mind who was behind all the changesevidently didnt see things that way or thought that now that the extra custom was here it would stay here rose could have told her differently told her how it wasnt likely the hungry bear would hold anyone who didnt actually belong in westhaven if there wasnt something beyond the beer to offer them but rose wasnt here and jeoff was not the kind to worry about tomorrow until it arrived on the other hand although stara was behind the changes jeoff was behind the cashbox if rune pointed out to him that he was losing money right now that people werent coming from outside the village bounds and that those within the village werent staying as long of an evening because she wasnt playing well maybe hed put a stop to this and hire on a good strong boy to do some of the work she thought again about going outside to practice but the breeze coming in the window decided her against the idea it was really too cold out there her fingers would stiffen in no time she tuned the fiddle with care for its old strings she wanted to replace them but strings were hard to come by in this part of the world if she was lucky maybe a peddler would have a set until then shed just have to make sure she didnt snap one she closed her eyes for a moment and let her fingers select the first couple of notes the tune wandered a bit before it settled on a jig a good fingerwarmer and one of the earliest melodies shed learned heart for the ladies it was called and folks around here usually called for it twice or three times a night when they were in the mood for dancing rune closed her eyes again she remembered the woman who had taught it to her as clearly as something that had happened yesterday linnet had been her name so she said odd how many of the traveling players had birdnames or maybe they just assumed birdnames when they started playing linnet had been one of a trio of traveling minstrels doing the faire circuit a mandolin player herself on flute and a drummer linnet was a tiny thing always smiling and ready with a kind word for a child she had more hair than rune had ever seen let down on a woman she didnt wear it in a wifes braids nor loose under a coif like a maid the copperybrown tresses were twined with flowers and piled in loose coils about her head when rune first saw her and later it was tied in two long tails bound around with leather and thongs for traveling when she let it down it reached past her knees she had been as ready with her help as her smiles when rune brought out her fiddle and attempted to follow their tunes silently fingering but not bowing she had taken the girl aside and played heart for the ladies over and over until rune had gotten it in her head then helped her to find the fingerings for it on the fiddle and then the next day when the trio had gone their way rune had practiced the piece for hours until she got it right shed waited until someone in the crowd that night saw her and called out well little rune and have ye got a new piece for us to hear the way some of them used to half in earnest half to tease her this time shed answered yes and brought out her fiddle shed surprised them all with the jig so much so that theyd made her play it again and againand then several times more so that they all could dance to it that night had brought her a pair of copper bits the first time shed been paid for her fiddling it had been a heady moment made all the headier by the first money she had ever owned she played the jig over twice more until her fingers felt flexible and strong ready for anything she might ask of them but what she asked of them next was the very latest piece she had learned a slow languorous love song the lilting melody was the kind of song popular at weddings but mostly not in the tavern a real fiddler had taught her this one this and near two dozen more she smiled to think of him oh he was a villainouslooking lad with a patch over one eye and all in gypsycolors half a brigand by his looks but he had played like an angel he had and hed stayed several days the first time hed stopped at the bearbecause of the bad weather for traveling so hed said and indeed it had been raining heavily during all that time but hed had a horsea pony rathera sturdy beast that was probably quite capable of taking him through rain and snow and anything else he might ask of it it wasnt weather that had kept him but his own will the rains pounded the area for a week providing him ample excuse so he stayed and enlivened the tavern by night bringing folks in from all over despite the weather and hed schooled rune by day quite properly despite her early fears as to his behavior fearswell that wasnt quite true it was half hope actually for despite his rascally appearance or even because of it shed wondered if hed pay court to her she certainly knew at thirteen what went on between man and maid male and female she had taken some thought to it though she wasnt certain what it was she wanted the ballads were full of sweet courtings wild ones and no courtings at all but he was as correct with her as he had been bawdy with the men in the tavern the night before hed stopped her on her way to some trivial errand as he was eating his luncheon in the otherwise empty common room i hear you play the fiddle young rune hed said she had nodded suddenly shy feeling as awkward as a young calf well hed said then a twinkle in the one eye not covered with a patch are you going to go fetch it or must i beg you she had run to fetch it and hed begun her lesson the first of four and he had made her work too she worked as hard at her fiddling under his critical eye as shed ever worked at any task in the tavern he saved the love songs until the last daya reward hed said for being a good studentfor they were the easiest of the lot if hed introduced them at the beginning of the lessons she might have suspected them of being a kind of overture but hed waited until the last day of his stay when hed already told her that he was leaving the following morning so the songs came instead as a kind of gift from a friend for a friend was what raven had come to be and she treasured them as completely as she would have treasured any material gift hed returned over the winter and again the next summer and this winter again that was when he had taught her this melody fortune my foe he should be coming through again once the weather warmed she was looking forward to seeing him again and learning more things from him not just songsthough courting was not on her mind either there was so much she needed to learn about music about reading it and writing it there were songs in her head words as well as music but she couldnt begin to get them out she didnt know how to write the tunes down and she didnt have enough reading and writing of words to get her own down properly so that another could read them she had barely enough of writing to puzzle out bits of the holy book just like every other child of the village and there was no learned scholarpriest here to teach her more there must be more there must be a way to write music the way words were written and there must be more words than she knew she needed all of that needed to learn it and if anyone would know the way of such things raven would she sensed it in her bones raven was weeks away though and she would have to be patient and wait as the holy book said women must be patient even though she was almighty tired of being patient oh enough of such lazy tunes the trill of an early songbird woke another melody in her fingers and that led to many more all reels this time and all learned from a roughfaced bearded piper just a few weeks ago hed come to play for the wedding of some distant relations and though he had not made any formal attempt at giving her lessons when he watched her frowning and following his music silently hed played everything at least three times over until she smiled and nodded by way of a signal that shed got the tune straight in her head hed gone before nightfall not stayinghe couldnt have played at the tavern anyway the pipes were not an instrument for indoors but this winter after her fiddler had come and gone there had been a harper who had stayed for nearly two weeks he was a guild minstrel and was taking a position at the court of the sire he was ahead of time having come much faster than anyone would have ever expected because of a break in the weather and had taken the opportunity to rest a bit before taking the last leg of the journey he was an old man his hair half silver and he had been very kind to her hed taught her many of the songs popular at the courts and she had painstakingly adapted them for fiddle he hadnt had much patience but fortunately the melodies were all simple ones easy to remember and easy to follow but from those simple songs her fingers slowed and strayed into a series of laments learned from another harpist a real gypsy who would not come into the village at all rune had found her with her fellows camped beyond the bridge as she had returned from an errand unaccountably eerily the girl had known who she was and what instrument she played it still gave rune a chill to think of her and wonder how it was the other musician had known all about her shed stopped rune as the girl lingered watching the gypsies with burning curiosity i am nightingale bring your fiddle shed said abruptly with no preamble i shall teach you songs such as you have never heard before with a thrill of awe and a little fear rune had obeyed it had been uncanny then and it was uncanny now how had nightingale known who she was and what she did no one in the village would have told hersurely and indeed nightingale had taught her music the like of which she had never heard before the strange compelling dance music was too complicated to learn in a single afternoonbut the laments stuck in her mind and seemed to make her fingers move of their own accord rune she started and opened her eyes stara had a mug in one hand and most of the rest up on their pegs above the beer barrels and she had turned to stare at rune with a strange uneasy expression on her face rune got ready for a tonguelashing whenever stara was unhappy or uneasy she took it out on someone and maeve wasnt within reach right now havent you practiced enough for one day stara snapped crossly you give me the chills with that gypsy howling it sounds like lost souls wailing for the dead well that was what it was supposed to sound like or cats in heat stara concluded crudely havent you got anything better to do than to torture our ears with that i she began a cough interrupted her and she glanced over at the door to the kitchen jeoff stood there with a keg of the dark ale on one shoulder were going to be working in here for a while rune he said i dont want to sound mean butthat music bothers me its like youre calling something id rather not see meaning hes feeling superstitious rune thought cynically dont you think jib could use your help in the stables he saidbut it sounded like an order yes sir she said trying not to sound surly just when i was really getting warmed up it figures ill see to it master jeoff but as she put her fiddle away she couldnt help watching jeoff and her mother out of the corner of her eye there was something going on there and it had nothing to do with the music it looked like staras ploys were working the only question waswhere did that leave rune chapter two with her fiddle safely stowed away rune made her reluctant way to the stableyardsuch as it was this little road wasnt used by too many people certainly not the kind of people who would be riding highbred horses that required expensive stabling when the sire traveled he took the roads patrolled and guarded by the dukes men and when someone was sent to collect taxes and take the mancount it was never anyone important just a bailiff this village never gave any trouble always paid its taxes with a minimum of cheating and in general was easy to administer to there were robbers occasionally but when robbers cropped up a quick foray into the woods by the local men usually took care of them there were places said to be dangerous because of magic or supernatural menaces but the road bypassed them people who traveled between here and beeford were simple people without much in the way of valuables so the stable was a bare place nothing more than four walls and a roof with a loft and a dirt floor half of it was the storage place for hay and strawno grain the inn pony and donkey were sturdy enough to live on thistles if they had to hay and grass suited them very well the other half had been partitioned into rough stalls there was a paddock where beasts could be turned loose if their owners couldnt afford stablefees or the inn beasts could be put if their stalls were needed for paying tenants that had never happened in runes experience though they had come near to it in faire season the loft stood over the half where hay was stored and that was where jib slept hemmed in and protected by bales of hay and generally fairly snug tarn hostler the stablemaster slept with his wife annie cook in her room next to the kitchen in the winter jib slept next to the kitchen fire with granny rune hoped as she took herself out the kitchen door that jib wouldnt try to court her again today he was her best friendin point of fact he was her only friendbut he was the last person she wanted courting her shed been trying to discourage him teasing him ignoring his clumsy attempts at gallantry laughing at his compliments she could understand why he had the silly idea that he was in love with her and it had nothing to do with her looks or her desirability there were two available women here at the bear for jib was too lowly ever to be able to pay court to one of the village girls and of the two of them even a blind man would admit she was preferable to maeve jib was fine as a friendbut nothing more for one thing he was at least a year younger than rune for anotherhe just wasnt very bright he didnt understand half of what she said to him sometimes he wasnt at all ambitious either when rune asked him once what he wanted to be when he was a man hed looked at her as if she was crazed he was perfectly happy being the stableboy and didnt see any reason for that to change he didnt want to leave the village or see anything of the outside world but the faire at beeford the only wish hed ever expressed to her was to become a local horsetrader selling the locally bred sturdy little ponies and cobs to bigger traders who would take them to the enormous city faires he didnt even want to take the horses there himself andto be honestwhen a girl dreamed of a lover she didnt dream of a boy with coarse black hair buck teeth ears like a pair of jug handles a big round potato of a nose and spots of course hed probably grow out of the spots but the rest was there to stay all in all she wished hed decide to settle for maeve theyd probably suit one another very well as long as he told her exactly what to do the yard was deserted and tarn hostler was grooming the two beasts in the paddock alone but rune heard straw rustling and knew where shed find jib and sure enough when she entered the stable there he was forking straw into a pair of stalls she grabbed a pitchfork and went to help him filling the mangers with fresh hay and rinsing and filling the water buckets at the paddock pump the pony dumpling brown and round as one of cooks best dumplings and the donkey stupid which he was not watched her with halfclosed eyes as old tarn gave them a carefully currycombing brushing out clouds of winter hair they knew the schedule as well as anyone bring back loads of wood for the ovens on monday haul food for the inn on tuesday wood again on wednesday but this time for the baker in the village be hitched to the grindstone on thursday since the village had no watermill wood again on friday for the woodcutter himself odd jobs on saturday and be hitched to the wagon to take everyone to church on sunday theyd done their duty for the day now they could laze about the yard and be groomed then put in their stalls for the night once jib and rune finished cleaning them hey rune jib said after trying to get her attention by clearing his throat several times you ought to see annie about that cough youve got she interrupted him it sounds really bad my cough he replied puzzled i dont have a cough youve been hemming and hacking like a wheezy old man ever since i got out here she replied sharply of course you have a cough you ought to take care of it get annie to dose you ill tell her about it uh no please he said looking alarmed as well he might annies doses were fearsome things that took the skin off a persons tongue and left a nasty lingering taste in the back of the throat for days afterwards im fine really i am please dont tell annie im sick he babbled on about how healthy he was for some time rune paid scant attention simply pleased that shed managed to elude whatever hed planned to ask her with that much nervousness showing it had to be romantic in nature at least by jibs primitive standards of romance which were at best one step above dumplings she looked about for something else to distract him when he finally wound down but fate took a hand for herfor his babble was interrupted by the sounds of hooves on the hardpacked dirt outside and a strange voice they both ran to see who it was just as they had when they were children rune reaching the stable door a little before jib at first glance the newcomer looked to be a peddler his pony had two largish packs on its back and he was covered from head to knee in a dustcolored cloak but then he pulled the cloak off and shook it and rune saw he was dressed in a linen shirt with knots of multicolored ribbon on the sleeves a bright blue vest and fawncolored breeches only one kind of traveler would dress like that and her guess was confirmed when he pulled a lute in its case out of one of the packs he was very tall taller than rune and lanky with dustcolored hair and wonderfully gentle brown eyes the stablemaster saw them both gawking from the shelter of the doorway and waved them over abruptly they obeyed at once tarn told them to groom the minstrels pony and put it in one of the prepared stalls then come fetch the inn beasts when a third stall was ready he himself took the strangers packs leading him into the inn as if he owned it jib and rune eyed each other over the empty packsaddle flip you for it rune said jib nodded wordlessly and rune bent down long enough to fetch a pebble from the dust at her feet she spat on it and tossed it into the air calling out wet as it fell it landed wet side up and jib shrugged philosophically she led the visitors pony into one of the stalls unsaddled him and hung his tack over the wall of his stall and gave him a brisk grooming he seemed to enjoy it leaning into the strokes of the currycomb with an expression of bliss on his round little face when she had finished jib was still forking in hay for the new stall she turned the pony loose in this temporary home made sure that the door was secure some ponies were wizards at finding ways to escape and took herself back into the inn she was met at the inner door by her mother who barred the way with her arm across the doorway his name is master heron and hes on his way to the lycombe faire she said as rune fidgeted he promised jeoff hed play tonight and that means that you serve yes mstara she replied catching herself at the last minute before saying the forbidden word jeoff wants you to go down to the village and make the rounds of all the guildsmen stara continued he wants you to tell them all that master heron will be entertaining tonight from them it will spread to everyone else in westhaven yes stara rune said curbing her impatience he has to be on his way first thing in the morning if hes going to make the faire in time stara finished dashing runes hopes for a lesson and youd better be on your way now if were going to have the extra custom tonight rune sighed but said nothing more if she got down to the village before the men went home to their suppers theyd likely eat lightly or not at all those who could afford to then theyd come here and eat plates of saltladen sausage rolls and sharp cheese while they listened to the minstrel making themselves thirsty theyd drink plenty of beer tonight to drown the salty sausages jeoff was probably already hauling up extra kegs and putting them behind the bar it would be a good night for the inn and at least rune would hear some new songs if she was lucky the minstrel would repeat them enough for her to learn one or two she turned and started down the path to the village hoping to get back quickly enough not to miss anything the village of westhaven was set back from the road because there wasnt enough flat land for more than the inn right up beside it those who had business in westhaven itselfnot manytook the path up the valley to find the village rune usually enjoyed the walk although it was a bit long and a little frightening after the sun went down but today halfway between the inn and the first buildings of the village itself she stopped the path was blocked by two of westhavens girls joyse and amanda gossiping in the middle of the path and making no effort to move out of the way they knew she was coming they could hardly miss her but they pretended not to notice her clutching baskets of early flowers and keeping their heads close together joyse as blond as stara but thin was the bakers daughter amanda as round and brown as dumpling but without the ponys easygoing nature was the offspring of one of the local farmers joyse with her hair neatly confined under a pretty red scarf that matched her brand new kirtle was betrothed already to another farmers son amanda in a blue dress that looked almost as new but was already straining at the seams around her middle was one of the contenders to replace rose from the way it looked one or the other had been up to the inn possibly to spy on rune stara or both rune had the feeling that amanda would do just about anything to become the innkeepers new wife except surrendering her virginity before taking wedding vows both girls looked down their noses at rune as she approached slowly well i wish i had time to play games in the hay and flirt with boys amanda said nastily of course some people have lots of time some people have all the time they want not just to play games but to pretend theyre minstrels joyse laughed shrilly showing buckteeth and looking uncannily like a skinny old mare whinnying and some people are so lazy they pretend to be working when all they really do is stand around and make up stories because the truth is too dull rune said aloud to a squirrel in one of the trees beside her it chattered as if it was responding to her and some people are so fat they block the path so people with work to do cant travel it and of course some people are so badtempered that no one will have them for a wife not even with a big dower amanda squealed with rage turning to face her directly and rune pretended to notice her for the first time why amanda i didnt see you there i thought it was a pony blocking the path amandas round face turned bright red and her hands balled into fists beside her skirt you little bastardbratwere you talking about me talking about you rune shrugged and pretended surprise why would i bother theres nothing at all interesting about you id put myself and that squirrel to sleep talking about you besides you know what father jacob says about gossiping he says that women who spend their time in idle gossip spend three hundred years in hell when they die with their lips sewn shut she shuddered artistically id never want to end up like that ill show you how youll end up amanda hissed taking a step forward but joyse grabbed her shoulder bent to her ear and whispered something fiercely to her stopping her rune had a fairly good idea what the general gist of the advice was because the last time any of the westhaven youngsters had tried to turn a confrontation with rune into something physical it had ended with the girl getting her hair rubbed full of mud while rune sat on her back not even the boys wanted to risk a physical fight with her she was taller and stronger than most of them and knew some tricks of dirty fighting tarn had taught both her and jib though jib never kept his head long enough to use them that they didnt rune took one deliberate step forward then a second joyse whispered something else her eyes round with urgency and amanda backed upthen turned and the two of them flounced their way up the path rune watched them go seething inwardly but refusing to show it shed wonsort of in most ways though it had been a draw they could continue to pick on her verbally and she could do nothing and they all three knew it most of the time she couldnt even get her own hits in when it was a verbal confrontation it wasnt fair she waited a few more minutes for them to get far enough ahead of her that she shouldnt have to encounter them again then continued on her way slower this time trying to get her temper to cool by listening to the blackbirds singing their hearts out in the trees around her trying to win themselves mates there was this much satisfaction at least this time shed been able to give as good as she got and none of them would try to touch even jib these days not even in a group everyone knew she was jibs protector she wasnt averse to using teeth and feet as well as fists when she was cornered either they had to keep their abuse verbal one of these days im going to write a song about them she thought angrily about amanda joyse all of them all of them pretending to be so much better than me but amanda steals her mothers eggmoney and joyse only got thom because her father promised to help his father cheat on his taxes and they dont know i know about it thatd serve them right to go to a faire and hear some strange minstrel singing a song mocking them not a one of them ever missed a chance to tell her that she was scum it would be nice to watch their faces as someone told them exactly what they were and why not when raven came maybe she could get him to help her with that song with his help surely it would be picked up by other singers savoring that sweet thought she picked up her pace a little the first stop was going to be the chandlers shop maybe with luck shed get through this without having any more little encounters after the chandler she left her message at the tannery and the bakers wishing she could stay longer and savor the wonderful aromas there the baker said nothing about her little encounter with his daughter she hadnt really expected that he would if he knew about it hed likely just chalk it up to the bastardbrats bad breeding but since rune had gotten the better of that exchange and in fact had not said a single thing thattaken literallycould be called an insult she doubted either girl would even mention it to a parent in fact she thought as she crossed the lane to the smithy shed handled it rather well shed simply said that some people were fat were gossips and couldnt get a husband because they had such terrible tempers shed only repeated what the westhaven priestshared with beefordhad told all of them about the fate of gossiping women she hadnt once said that either amanda or joyse were anything other than dull and while that was an insult it was hardly one that was anything other than laughable the smithy was full hob and his two older apprentices hard at work on sharpening farm tools gone rusty after a winters storage they stopped work long enough to hear what she had to say she spoke her piece quickly for the forge was hot as a midsummer day and plain took her breath away all three men paid her little heed until they heard her news then they reacted with considerably more enthusiasm it had been several weeks since the last real minstrel had been through after all and spring had brought with the new growth a predictable restlessness on everyones part tonights entertainment would give them a welcome outlet for some of that restlessness the next stop on runes mental list as she passed behind the smithy and the blacksmith resumed his noisy work was the carpentershed take this shortcut behind the smithy between it and its storage sheds for the smithy and the carpenters shop lay a little to one side of westhaven proper on the other side of the tiny village pond out where their pounding wouldnt disturb anyone and where if the smithy caught fire thered be no danger of houses taking flame well look what jest wandered inta town the blacksmiths son jon stepped out from the side of the shop blocking her path she stopped he grinned showing a mouth with half the teeth missing and rubbed his nose on the back of his hand sniffing noisily his manners hadnt improved over the winter you lookin fer me girl he drawled she didnt answer and she didnt acknowledge him instead she turned slowly figuring that it would be bettermuch betterif she simply pretended to ignore him hed grown over the winter quite a bit in fact suddenly her feeling of superiority to the rest of the village youngsters began to evaporate as hill and warran two of the farm boys moved out from the other side of the blacksmith shop to block her escape the last of her assumption of superiority vanished theyd grown over the winter too all three of them were taller than she was and jon had huge muscles in his arms and shoulders that matched his fathers becoming his fathers apprentice on his fifteenth birthday had developed his body beyond anything she would have anticipated it hadnt done much for his mind though she whirled at a sound behind her and saw that he had already moved several paces closer what do you want jon she asked trying to sound bored im busy im supposed to be delivering messages from master jeoff i left one with your father she concluded pointedly whats the matter he asked scratching his behind with one sooty hand and grinning still wider you in a big hurry t get back t yer looover he laughed whats jib got huh nothin thats what so now it was out in the open instead of being sniggered about hinted at someone had finally said to her face what everyone in westhaven had been telling each other for a year hes not my lover she said as calmly as she could i dont have any lover then maybe its time you got one said hill snickering little lovin might do you some good string bean teach you what a womans for aww hill she just means she aint got a real lover jon said genially flexing the muscles of his shoulders presumably for her benefit she just means she wants one eh i meant what i said she told him defiantly ah dont fool around rune we know your mams been in ol jeoffs bed since rose died an we know bout you your mam wasnt any more married than m dads anvil he advanced and she backed upinto hills and warrans hands she suppressed a yelp as they grabbed her you got no call pretendin that youre all goodygood she struggled in the farm boys hands they simply tightened their grips she stopped fighting holding very very still part of her mind planning every second of the next few minutes the rest of her too scared to squeak let me go she said slowly clearly and sounding amazingly calm even to herself yer mams a whore jon said his grin turning cruel as he reached out for her yer mams a whore an yer a whores daughter an if yer not a whore now ye will be he grabbed her breast crushing it in his hand and hurting her as he slammed his foul mouth down on hers trying to force her lips open with his tongue she opened her mouth and let his tongue probe forwardand bit down on it quick and as hard as she could tasting blood briefly at the same time she slammed her knee up into his crotch as jon screamed and fell away from her she brought her heel down hard on hills instep and slammed her head back against his teeth that hurt and she reckoned shed cut her scalp a bit but it surely hurt him worse hill let out a hoarse cry and let go of her immediately and bumbled into warran she pivoted as much as she could with warran still holding onto her and kicked hill in the knee toppling him he went down taking warran with him as warran fell she managed to pull free of the last boys gripand she pelted away as fast as her legs would carry her never once looking back to see if shed hurt them seriously or not she ran all the way out of the village her side aching her head hurting half blinded with fright no matter who might have been following her she still had longer legs and better wind than any of them when she slowed and finally paused near where shed been stopped by the girls earlier she couldnt hear any pursuit that was when she started to shake she started to drop to her knees beside the path then thought better of the idea what if there was someone following what if the boys recovered and decided to come after her but she had one place of shelter one they wouldnt know aboutone that was completely defensible she got off the path somehow and fought her way through the brush some twenty or thirty feet into the forest and there was her shelter the biggest oak tree for miles around she forced her shaking legs to carry her up the side of the forest giant and into the huge fork completely hidden from below by the new young leaves of lesser trees there she curled up and let her mind go blank while she shook with reaction after a while her heart stopped pounding in her ears and she stopped feeling sick to her stomach mostly anyway her mind began to work again if slowly she put her hand to the back of her head but surprisingly didnt come away with any blood on it though she felt the hard lump of a rising goose egg back there that and a torn and dirty shirt were the worst shed taken out of the encounter this time she chewed some young leaves to get the nasty taste of jon out of her mouth but she couldnt get the nasty feel of him out of her mind one thing was certain her immunity had vanished with the snows of winter the girls might leave her alone but she was completely at the mercy of the boys even in daylight the girls might even have set their brothers on her that would certainly fit amanda and joyses personalities and that this attack had taken place in daylight meant that they were not particularly worried about hiding their actions from their parents that meant their parents didnt care what they were doing to her if anything happened to her nothing would be done to punish her attackers that had always been truebut the threat of attack had never included rape before the boys had said it all her mother was a whore she was the daughter of a whore therefore she was a whore no one would believe anything else anything that happened to her would be her own fault brought on her own actions or simply by being born of bad blood not even the priest would help unless she took holy vows and even thenhe might not believe that she was an innocent and he might refuse her the protection of the church she had nowhere to turn to for help and no one to depend on but herself how long was it going to be before she was cornered by a gang she couldnt escape it was only the purest luck and the fact that they hadnt expected her to fight back that had let her get away this time next time she might not be so lucky next time they might win the realization made her start to shake all over again it felt like hours later that she managed to get herself under control and climb down out of the treebut when she made her way back to the inn no one seemed to have missed her at least no one seemed to think she had taken an extraordinary amount of time to deliver her messages after much thought she had decided to keep quiet about the attack after all what good would complaining about it do none of this would have happened if the boys hadnt been sure they were safe from punishment jeoff wouldnt do anything to risk the anger of his customers stara and annie cook would be certain shed brought it on herself and jib would only get himself into fights he couldnt hope to win no one would care at least not enough to help protect her but she could protect herself in clever ways she could refuse to go into the village alone or better still she could send jib to run errands for her trading chore for chore even if it meant more of the kind of work that might stiffen her hands better that than the little entertainments jon and his friends had planned but she didnt have long to brood on her troubles for despite the fact that she hadnt been able to deliver more than half her messages word of the new minstrel had traveled all through the village and the men and their wives were already beginning to take their places behind the rough wooden tables there were three couples there already the baker and his wife and a couple of the nearer farmers and their spouses the place would be full tonight for certain she dashed upstairs to change her torn shirt for a clean older onea loose and baggy one that didnt show anything of her figuremaking sure no one saw her to ask about what had happened to the first shirt she stripped off the shirt and frownedmore in anger now than fearat the bruises on her breast she touched it gingerly it was going to hurt more later than it did now and it hurt bad enough now that she waited long enough to wrap her chest in a supporting and protectingand concealingband of cloth she slipped the new shirt over her head pledging herself that shed find a way to make jon hurt as much as hed hurt her if he didnt already she hoped devoutly that he did hed surely have a hard time explaining away his bitten and swollen tongue she was quite sure shed drawn blood for thered been blood on the back of her hand when shed wiped it across her mouth with any luck it would be so bad hed have to drink his meals tonight and tomorrow and she had a notion his privates ached more than her breast did right now the thought made her a little more cheerful she scraped her hair back and tied it into a severe knot at the nape of her neck there had been no sign from any of the adults today that they thought the way the boys did but she had no intention of finding out the hard way when she made herself look like a boy this way most of them actually forgot she was a girl and she didnt want to start anything among the beerhappy menshe knew for a fact that she wouldnt be able to defend herself from a grown man stara was safe enough behind the bar but she was going to be out in the open a few months ago with rose in charge anyone bothering the wenches would have found himself getting a rap on the head or hand with a spoonor invited to leave and not return which could be quite a punishment in a village with only one inn rune hadnt ever thought that the situation might change until this afternoon that changed everything now she wasnt taking any chances for a moment she hesitated at the foot of the stairs afraid to face the crowd afraid that she might see knowing looks in their faces afraid of what they might be thinking but annie cook seized her as soon as the redfaced woman spotted her and shoved a tray of sausage rolls into her hands not giving her a chance to think about anything else the young minstrel was in the common room tuning his instrument as she delivered the salty sausage rolls to the customers he glanced up at her as she passed and smiled the setting sun coming in through the inn windows and touching his hair and face with a gentle golden light it was a plain friendly smile unlike the leers of jon and his companions and it warmed a place within her that had been cold all afternoon the next time she passed this time with a tray full of beer mugs he stopped her on the pretense of getting a mugful of beer himself i understand youre a fiddler he said quietly taking his time about choosing a mug will you be playing tonight do you think youd like to try a duet if only i could but stara had given her direct orders she shook her head not trusting her voice thats too bad he answered making it sound as if he really was disappointed that she wouldnt be fiddling i was hoping to hear you well let me know if i do anything new to you all right ill make sure to try and repeat the new songs so you can pick them up speechless now with gratitude she nodded emphatically and he took his mug and let her go as the evening passedand the women leftthe atmosphere in the room changed some of the men from the village who a month ago would never have dreamed of taking liberties were pinching and touching maeve their hands lingering on her arm or shoulderor when they thought no one was watching her breasts maeve seemed oblivious as usual and neither jeoff nor stara were doing anything about it now more than ever rune was glad shed made herself less of a target as shed hoped some of the men with several mugs of dark beer in them were calling her boy as long as they thought her a boy shed probably be safe enough true to his promise master heron watched her closely at the conclusion of every tune he played if she nodded she could be sure hed play that song later in the evening and as the crowd grew more intoxicated he could repeat the songs a little more often his hat left at his feet was quite full of copper by now there was even a silver piece or two among the copper rune didnt know for certain what he was used to but by the standards of westhaven he was doing very well indeed finally he pled the need to take a break and as rune brought him more beer and a bit of bread and cheese and an apple the villagers gathered closer to ask him questions she ran into the kitchen and out again not wanting to miss a single word lad youre the best these parts have heard in a long while are you a guild bard the mayor wanted to know of course hed ask that rune thought cynically its always better if it comes from a guildsman as if the music cared who plays it no that im not he replied easily look you guildsmen always wear purple ribbon on their sleeves purple and gold for bards purple and silver for minstrels i doubt youd ever see a guildsman through here though theyre not for the likes of you and me they play for no less than sires and sure theyll tell you so quick enough he said it so lightly that no one took offense not even the mayor who looked a bit disappointed but not angered no now im just a rover a free bard seeing that everyone gets to hear a bit of a tune now and again he continued though after the faire ill admit to you ive been asked to play for the sire that put the mayor in a better humor so whats the difference lad he asked genially besides a bit of ribbon that is ah now that is the question he replied with his eyebrows raised as high as they could go and the answer to it is more than you might think its not enough to be able to play dye see the bardic guild seems to think thats only part of what a man needs to get into it youve all heard of the great midsummer faire at kingsford right by traen have you not all heads nodded who hadnt heard of the kings faire it was the greatest faire in the land and one or two of the crowd the mayor being chiefest had actually been there once so great a faire it was it couldnt be held inside the capital city of traen but had to be set up in its own temporary city of tents at kingsford nearby it lasted for six weeks three weeks on either side of midsummers day with a high holy mass celebrated on the day itself adding the churchs blessing to the proceedings well master heron said leaning back against the hearth so that the firelight caught all the angles of his face its like this on the second week of kingsford midsummer faire the guild comes and sets up a big tent hard by the cathedraltent thats where they hold trials and they go on for three days anyone who wants can sign up for the trials but there arent many that make it to the third day you didnt make it then said ralf the candlemaker insolently but master heron only laughed i never tried he said im too great a coward to face an audience all of musicians the others laughed with him and ralf had the grace to flush so heres what happens the minstrel continued the first day you sing and play your best instrument and you can choose whatever song you wish theres just one catchas you play the judges call out a kind of tune jig reel lamentand you have to play that song in that style and improvise on it the second day you sing and play your second instrument but you have to choose from a list of songs they pick then you drum for the next to play and the third day you go back to your first instrument or on to your third if you have one and you play and sing a song you have made and each day the list of those that get to go on gets shorter by half he laughed do you see now why i hadnt the courage to try tis enough to rattle your nerves to pieces just thinking on it the mayor whistled and shook his head as the crowd fell silent well thats a poser and all that just to get in as an apprentice aye master heron replied when i was young enough i didnt have the courage and now he spread his hands wouldnt i look foolish now as an apprentice the men nodded agreement as rune went back to the kitchen aflame with ambition but halfcrushed as well she could compose all rightyes and she played her fiddle well enough and drummed too and sang but hed said quite distinctly that you had to have two instruments or even a third and be proficient on all of them even if she could find someone with a lute or mandolin to sell she could never afford it she could never afford the lessons to learn to play it eitherand that was assuming she could find a teacher and if she waited for minstrels to come along to teach her the way shed learned fiddle shed be an old woman of eighteen or twenty by the time she was ready to go to the midsummer faire and the trials well she could play the shepherds flute and even she could make one of those no that was no kind of instrument for the trials before the guild these were people who played before princes and kings theyd hardly be impressed by someone tootling simple shepherds jigs on a twooctave pipe then the mayor put the crowning touch on her ambitions placing it out of the realm of want and into need for what he told the rest told her that this was the way out of all her problems apprenticeship to the guild would not only get her out of this village out of danger but it would place her in a position where no one would ever threaten her again i heard that no one touches a guild bard or a guild minstrel am i right master heron he asked the minstrel nodded though his face was in shadow now and rune couldnt read his expression his voice held no inflection at all thats the truth sir he replied only the church has a right to bring them to trial and if anyone harms a guild musician the church will see to it that theyre found and punished im told thats because a good half of the guild apprentices go into the church eventuallyand because musicians go everywhere sometimes into dangerous situations no one could ever harm her again she was so involved in her own thoughts that she hardly noticed when master heron resumed playing and had to forcibly drag her attention back to the music there had to be a way to get that second instrument to get to the trials there had to be chapter three the customers stayed later than usual and only left when master heron began pointedly to put his instrument away for travel by the time the evening was over rune was exhausted too tired to think very clearly arms aching from all the heavy trays and pitchers she had carried all night legs aching from the miles shed traveled between kitchen and tables bar and tables and back again from the look of him master heron wasnt in much better shape there were hundreds of things she wanted to ask him about getting into the bardic guild but she knew from experience how his arms must feel after a night of nonstop playing and how his tongue was tripping over the simplest of words if they werent in a song so she left him alone as she carried the heaps of dirty plates and mugs into the kitchen againand predictably was recruited as dishdryer and stacker for granny couldnt cope with putting the plates away so she walked several more miles returning mugs to the bar and dishes to the cupboard by the time she was able to leave the kitchen hed gone up to his room and his wellearned rest the common room was empty at last fire dying benches stacked atop tables and both pushed against the walls shutters closed and latched against the night she didnt see her mother anywhere about which in itself was predictable enough stara did not much care for kitchen and cleanup work and never performed either if she had a way out of doing so rune expected to find stara up in her own attic cubicle next to her daughters but when rune reached the top of the attic stairs the moonlight shining through the attic window betrayed the fact that staras bed was empty odd but shed probably gone to visit the privy before turning in rune stripped off her shirt and breeches and slipped into an old outworn shift of roses cut down to make a nightshift just before rose had taken sick expecting to hear her mother coming up the stairs at any moment and hoping this wasnt going to be another night of complaint but as rune crawled under the coarse sheet of her pallet she froze at the sound of murmuring voices in the hall outside jeoffs rooms below one was certainly jeoff and the other just as certainly was her mother suddenly rune was wideeyed no longer the least bit sleepy she had only time to register shock before the closing door below cut off the last sound of whispers staraand jeoff there was no doubt in runes mind what was going on stara had been unable to get jeoff to marry her by simply tempting him but remaining just out of reach so for some reason tonight she had decided to give the man what he wanted to see if that would bring him before the altar she must be desperate rune thought numbly shed never have gone to him otherwise she must think that if she lets him sleep with her guilt will make him want to make an honest wife of her in the morning or else she thinks she can seduce him into marrying her because shes such a fabulous lover or both whatever was going on in staras mind there were a number of possible outcomes for this encounter and they didnt auger well for rune the worst threat was that her mother would slip and become pregnant in all the time rune had been paying any attention stara had never once calculated anything correctly if it involved numbers greater than three that made a pregnancy horribly likelyif not this time then the next rune stared up blankly at the darkness of the roof above her if stara became pregnant married or not it would mean the end of runes free time shed have to take all of staras work as well as her own for months before the birth and after and doubtless the added expense of a nonproductive mouth to feed would convince jeoff there was no money to hire any more help and rune would have to help with the baby when it came as if she hadnt already more than enough to do there would be no time for anything but work dawn to dusk and past it there would be no time to even practice her fiddling much less learn new music or work out songs of her own no time for herself at all things were bad enough now but with stara pregnant or caring for another child theyd be infinitely worse her eyes stung and she swallowed a lump in her throat as big as an egg it wasnt fair stara had a perfectly good situation here she didnt need to do this she wasnt thinkingor rather she wasnt thinking of anyone except herself rune turned on her side as despair threatened to smother her choking her breath in her throat like a hand about it at least ill have a roof over my head she thought bleakly theres plenty that cant even say that and food i never go hungry around here but that wasnt the worst possible situation supposing staras ploy didnt work suppose she couldnt get jeoff to marry herand got with child anyway jeoff probably wouldnt throw them out of his own accord but there were plenty of people in the village whod pressure him to do so especially those with unmarried daughters he was a member of the church a deacon he had a reputation of his own to maintain he could decide to lie and say that stara had been sleeping with the customers behind his back so as to save that reputation then out shed go told to leave the village and not return just like the last time shed gotten herself with child oh yes and what would happen to rune then she might well be tossed out with her motherbut likelier far likelier was that jeoff would get rid of stara but keep her daughter after all the daughter was a proven hard worker with nothing against her save that she was a lightskirts daughter and possibly a bastard herself that wasnt her fault but it should give rune all the more reason that she should be grateful for a place and someone willing to employ her and what would that mean but the same result as if he married stara rune could predict the outcome of that easily enough shed wind up doing all her work and staras too eventually jeoff would marry some girl from the village like amanda whod lord it over rune and pile more work on her and probably verbal abuse as well if not physical abuse it would depend on just how much jeoff would be willing to indulge his wife how much hed support her against the hired help and when the new wife got pregnant thered be all the work tending to her precious brat or rather brats thered be one a year sure as the spring coming for that was the way the village girls conducted their lives it was proper for a wife to do her duty by her husband and make as many babies as possible no time for fiddling then for certain sure no time for anything at least stara was old enough that there likely wouldnt be another child after the first with a new young wife thered be as many as she could spawn with rune playing nursemaid to all of them unless rune told them all that she wasnt having any of that and went off on her own to try her hand at making a living with her fiddle and for a moment that seemed a tempting prospect until cold reality intruded oh surely she told herself cynically a fine living id make at it too im not as good as the worst of the minstrels whove been hereand surely they arent as good as the guild musicians or the folk who make the circuits of the great faires which means what that id starve most like what would be betteror worse starvation or the loss of music of a life of her own a dangerous life alone on the open road living handtomouth or a life of endless drudgery she sniffed and stifled a sob there didnt seem to be much of a choice no matter which way she turnedboth lives were equally bleak and what about stara herself stara was her mother how much did rune owe her if she did get with child and jeoff did throw her out stara would be in an even worse plight than rune faced she would be pregnant out of work nowhere to go and no longer young enough to charm her way however briefly into someones household for a moment rune suffered a pang of guilt and worry but no one forced her into jeoffs bed she told herself after a moment no one told her to go chasing after her master hoping for a wedding ring shes the one that made the decision to risk her future without even a thought for what might happen to me as well as her that killed any feelings of guilt if stara got herself into trouble it was her problem and she could get herself right back out again why should i suffer because my mothers a damn fool she doesnt even want me to call her mother any more but that brought up still another possibility there was no doubt of it that stara didnt like having a fourteenyearold daughter that she thought it made her look old if she decided that rune was a liability in her plan to capture jeoff and become his wife she might well do something to drive rune away herself it wouldnt even be hard to find an excuse all stara would have to do would be to tell him that rune was sleeping with jib or any of the boys from the villageor most likely of all with the musicians that had been passing through the villagers would be glad to believe such tales and might even make up a few of their own and jeoff was like any other man he was fallible and flawed and subject to making some irrational decisions even though he was enjoying himself with staraor perhaps because he was enjoying himself with starahe would never tolerate openly loose morals on his premises on the part of anyone else while the large innsso rune had heard from the female musicianswere tolerant of such things jeoff never had been he could get away with forbidding prostitutes to use his inn because most of his custom was local larger inns couldnt afford such niceties and in fact larger inns often kept whores to supply their clients but the folk needing rooms out here off the main roads most often traveled alone or with a longtime partner in a case like that if the partner was a female and the male of the pair said they were married then they might as well have posted the banns so jeoff didnt enforce his rule there was no inn nearer than beeford and that gave him something of a monopoly on trade those who needed jeoffs rooms had no choiceand the locals would come to drink his beer whether or not he allowed loose women about in fact jeoff and rose had been considered pillars of the community for their godly ways that was part of what made jeoff such a good marital prospect now and that was precisely what made it likely that hed dismiss her at the first complaint of looseness particularly if it came from her mother maybe i just ought to turn whore she thought with another stifled sob at least then id have something in the way of a trade despite jeoffs strictness she wasnt entirely innocent of the ways of lightskirts some few of the travelers men with gold and silver in their purses rather than copper and silver had brought with them their own brazen hardeyed women and once or twice other travelers in faire season had met such a woman here each departing in another direction after a single shared night jeoff had never turned these men away they paid well they often carried weapons or acted haughtily and as if they were either dangerous or important but he had served them himself not permitting either stara or rune anywhere near them and rose had always worn a frown the entire time such women were under her roof then there was the fellow who came through at fairetime with his own tents and wagons and a collection of freaks and dancing maidens his maidens were nothing of the sort whatever his freaks were there were always a lot of male visitors from the village to his tents after dark when the faire closed she turned on her back again biting her lip in remembrance that manhed made her feel so filthy just by the way he acted that shed wanted to bathe every time she had to be anywhere near him hed hired rune once when his own musician took sick having her play for the performances given during the day rose innocent of what those performances were like had judged she was unlikely to come to any harm during the daylight hours and had given her leave the dancers hadnt danced much their costumes seemed to consist of skirts and bodices made entirely of layers and layers of veils their movement was minimal and consisted of removing one veil after another while wiggling in a kind of bored pantomime of desire to the drumbeats it wasnt even particularly graceful rune hadnt said anything to anyone if jeoff knew what was going on he didnt bother to enlighten rose and rune doubted anyone else would tell her there wasnt any reason to rune sat behind a screen to play for the dancers and no one in the audience had any notion who the musician back there was shed needed the money rather badly for strings and a new bow the old one having cracked to the point that rune was afraid to subject it to too much stressand shed given her word that shed take the job and felt as if she couldnt walk out on it once shed agreed but shed been horribly uncomfortable embarrassed beyond words and feeling vaguely sickened by what she saw from her hiding place shed been glad when the regular musician recovered from his illness after two days and resumed his place it hadnt been the taking off of clothes that had bothered her it was the way the women had done it even at thirteen shed known there was something wrong with what was going on the church said displays like that of a womans body were forbidden and a sin rune had never quite reasoned out why that should be sofor the holy book said other things entirely about taking joy in the way of a man and a maid and celebrating the body and the spirit but the dancers certainly seemed to feel the same way as the churchyet they kept dancing as if they reveled in doing the forbidden and the men who came to watch them gave rune the same feeling there was something slimy about it all tawdry and cheap like the way jon had made her feel this afternoon the man who ran the show was horrible able to make almost anything sound like an innuendo he was using those women using them with the same callousness that kerd the butcher displayed with the animals he slaughtered but they in turn were using their audience promising something they wouldnt deliver not without a further price attached promising something they probably couldnt givepromising gold and delivering cheap gilded lead and the men in the audience were part of the conspiracy they certainly didnt care about the women they ogled or later bedded they cared only for the moments pleasure sating themselves without regard for the women using them as if they were soulless puppets things not human beings no she couldnt do that couldnt reduce herself to a creature there was something wrong about that and not the churchs notion of right and wrong either no matter what happened she could not put herself in the position of used and user and yet thats exactly the position that stara put herself in she was no different from any of those hardeyed women who stayed only the night from the dancers at the faire she had determined on a price for herself and she was using jeoff to get it with never any thought of love or joy involved and jeoff was most definitely using stara for he was taking advantage of her by demanding what he wanted without paying for it first forcing stara to put herself in the position of begging for that price it would be a different story if they had come together with care for one another not that it mattered in the end whatever came of this it would probably spell trouble for rune and with that comforting thought exhaustion finally got the better of her and she slept and when i got out of the kitchen he was already gone she lamented to jib as they raked the area in front of the stable clean of droppings and scattered water over the pounded dirt to keep the dust down i picked up a few songs from him but he really was awfully good and he knew more about the bardic guild than anyone i ever talked to before there was so much i wanted to ask him about i wish i hadnt had to work so hardi could have gotten a lesson from him it dont seem fair to me jib said slowly i know stara wasnt doin anythin she was just foolin around the common room actin like she was cleanin mugs and whatall but she werent doin nothin but fill pitchers now an again them mugs was still dirty when she was done cook was talkin about it this mornin t tarn i shouldnt have had to play server she complained bitterly swinging the watering can back and forth to cover as much ground as possible they shouldve let me fiddle like they used to you cant have a whole evening of music with just one musician not if you dont want him to wish hed never walked in before the nights over master heron was tired really tired by the time he was done if theyd let me play i couldve let him take a good long break or two and he wanted me to play he said so he wanted to know if i would play a duet with him he could have helped me taught me songs right well heckfire rune jib replied sounding for the first time in weeks like her old friend instead of the odd awkward stranger who wanted to court her i dunno what t say seems t me pretty rotten unfair ye know looks t me like your mam is gettin what she wants an ol jeoff is gettin what he wants an all youre gettin is hind teat evbody here is doin all right but you and yere th one pickin up the slack rune nodded unhappily as they walked back to the stable to put the watering cans away under the shelves by the stable door nobody ever asks me what i want she said bitterly anything that needs done they throw on me without ever asking if ive got the time they all seem to think they can do whatever they want with me because im not important im just a girl just staras brat and i dont count im whatever they want me to be with no say in it and that includes jon and his friends well ye got a roof an plenty t eat jib began echoing her pessimistic thoughts of last night this aint a bad life really its not enough she continued angry now i hate this place and i hate most of the people in it i dont want to be stuck here the rest of my life in this little hole back of beyond where everybody knows everything about everybody else or they think they do and they think that theyre so good gods keeping a special place in heaven for them i cant get anywhere here because no matter what i did id never be good enough for them to even be civil to jibs brow puckered as if he had never once thought that someone might want something other than the life they now shared that rune would want the freedom to play her fiddle he should have understoodshed dinned it into his head often enough but that shed want to leave was probably incomprehensible he certainly looked surprisedand puzzledby her outburst well he said slowly what do you want then rune flung her arms wide i want the world she cried extravagantly i want all of it i wanti want kings and queens at my feet i want wealth and power and na na rune jib interrupted laughing at her in a conciliating tone thats not sensible lass nobody can have that outside of a tale leastwise no musicker what is it ye really want well if i have to be sensible she paused a moment thought about what it was that was making her so unhappy it wasnt the drudgery so much as the loss of hope that thered ever be anything else and the confinement in a corner of the world where nothing ever happened and nothing ever changed and shed always be looked down on and taken advantage of jib i want to get out of here the people here think im scum you know that even if the high king rode up here tomorrow and claimed me as his longlost daughter theyd look down their noses at me and say eh well and shes a bastard after all like we thought jib nodded agreement and sighed he leaned up against the doorpost of the stable and selected a straw to chew on from one of the bales stacked there so he said scratching his head and squinting into the late afternoon sunlight if ye could go howd ye do it whered ye go then id want some money she said slowly enough to buy another instrument a guitar or a lute or even a mandolin and enough to keep me fed and under shelter and pay for the lessons id need i couldnt do that here it would have to be in a real city even if i had the money and the instrument i cant keep going on like i have been begging for time to play and making do with lessons snatched from other minstrels i need to learn to read and write better and read and write music too all right jib responded pushing away from the doorpost say youve got all that what then he led the way towards the door on the other side of the stableyard where they both had chores awaiting themher to clean the common room him to scrub pots for the cook then she paused just outside the inn door and looked off down the road with longing thenid go to the big midsummer faire at kingsford id march straight in there and id sign right up for the trials for the bardic guild and id win them too see if i wouldnt id win a place in the guild and a master and then just see what id do she turned to jib with such a fierce passion that he took an involuntary step back you said nobody had money and power and kings and queens at their feet outside of a tale well the guild bards have all that all that and more and when i was a guild bard thered be nobles come wanting me to serve them begging me to serve them right up to kings and even the high king himself i could come riding back in here with a baggage train a half dozen horses long and servants bowing to me and calling me my lady and a laurel and a noble title of my own and then these backwater blowhards would see oh would we now asked kaylan potter mockingly behind her she whirled already on the defensive kaylan and three of his friends lounged idly against the door to the common room kaylan and his friends were almost fully adult journeymen not prentices tall and strong they looked enough alike to be from the same family and indeed they were all distant cousins rawboned muscular and swarthy in wellworn smocks and leather vests and breeches she wondered frantically if she was in for another attempt like the one jon and his friends had made her heart raced with sudden fear surely not right here where shed thought she was safe no her heart slowed as the young men made no move towards her no they were older and smarter than jon they wouldnt risk their tavernprivileges by trying to force her on the doorstep in broadest daylight elsewhere perhaps they might have made some sort of movebut not here and now but they were not particularly amused at her description of themby implicationnor her assessment of their parents and neighbors wed see would we kaylan repeated looking down his snub nose at her and just what would we see wed see a braggart foolish girlchild with her head full of foolish fancies getting her comeuppance im thinking wed see a chit with a head too big for her hat learning just what a little fish she is wed see a brat who never was able to win even a village faire fiddling contest learning what it means to brag and fall thats what i think wed be seeing eh lads the other three nodded solemnly superior smirks on their dark faces her heart squeezed in her chest she felt her face grow hot then cold oh aye said thom beeson his hair falling into his eyes as he nodded aye that id say seein as the wee chit couldnt even win the harvest faire fiddlin contest four years agone and her only competition a couple of old men a lad claimin t be a guild prentice and a toymaker she gathered all her dignity about her and strode past them into the tavern there wasnt anyone in the common room but maeve who was sweeping the floor with a care that would have been meticulous in anyone but her the four young men followed her inside and threw themselves down on a bench their attitude betraying the fact that they figured they had her cowed now how about beer and a bit of bread and cheese for some hard workin men wench said kaylan carelessly you can be a firstrate servin wench even if youre only a secondrate fiddler she held her temper so as not to provoke them but it was a struggle she wanted to hit themshe wanted to throw their damned beer in their smug faces and she didnt dare do any of it thom was right damn him she had lost the harvest faire fiddling contest four years ago and it had been the last contest their little village faire had held shed never had another chance to compete and they all remembered her failure so did she the remembrance was a bitter taste in her mouth as she filled their mugs from the tap and took them to the table she thudded the filled mugs down in front of them so that they foamed over and turned on her heel so what else were you going to show us wench kaylan asked lazily is it true that youre takin after your mother that way someone else had been spreading tales it seemed already she was judged or are we gonna hear more boastin thom drawled empty air dont mean a thing wench if ye could fiddle as well as ye can yarn ye might be worth listenin to she lost the tenuous hold she had on her temper she spun let the words fly without thinking about the consequences they had challenged her too far in a way she couldnt shrug off what am i going to show you she hissed her hands crooked into claws her heart near bursting ill tell you ill do more than show you ill prove to you im the best fiddler these parts have ever seen and too good for the likes of you ill go fiddle forfor for who wench thom laughed snapping his fingers at her for the sire for the skull hill ghost she snarled without thinking i reckon hed know a good fiddler when he heard one even if a lout like you doesnt thom threw back his head and laughed from braggart t liar in one breath he said derisively you fiddle for the ghost yed never dare set foot on skull hill in daylight much less by night why ye never even step outside th building oncet the sun goes down i bet yere so fraid of the dark ye hide yer head under the covers sos th goblins don git ye liar liar taunted kaylan wagging his finger at her little girls shouldnt lie t their betters little girls should know their place specially when theyre old nuff t be big girls he grinned insinuatingly specially when theres big boys as can give em things an do nice things for em if theyve got the wit t be nice back if shed had any notion of backing down those words put the idea right out of her head ill show you whos a liar she shouted too angry to keep her voice down ill show you whos the better around here ill go tonight right now then well see whos the coward and who isnt she dashed for the stairs and took them two at a time grabbed her fiddle from the shelf and pelted down the stairs again as fast as her feet could take her without breaking her neck she burst into the common room to see jeoff just entering from the kitchen alerted by the shouting he turned around to see her hitting the bottom landing with a thud rune he called holding out a cautionary hand rune whats agoin on you tell him she spat at kaylan as she headed out the door fiddle in hand at a fast angry walk you started this you bullyyou tell him by then she was out the door and the walk had become a run and no one of jeoffs girth was going to be able to catch up with her she pelted down the dirt road as hard as she could run her fiddle case bumping against her back where shed slung it her heart burning within her and driving her to run even faster as if she could outdistance the cruel taunts at least her parting sally should get kaylan and his friends into a situation theyd have a hard time explaining themselves out of jeoff wasnt going to like losing his help for the night she took the road away from the village deeper into the forested hills slowing to a walk once she was out of sight of the inn and it looked as if there wouldnt be any immediate pursuit by then her side hurt and she was winded and sticky with sweat and road dust and by the time she reached the place where the old road joined the new one shed had ample chance to cool down and think about just how stupid shed been the old road represented a more direct path through the hillsbut one that was never taken after dark and more often than not local travelers avoided it even in daylight hence the overgrown condition of the old road the grasses sprouting in the eroded ruts the bushes creeping up onto it a little more every year even though the old road would save the weary traveler several miles no one took it who had the slightest chance of being on it after the sun went down for there was a ghost that haunted the place a vengeful angry ghost one that inhabited the skull hill pass it was no legend it had been seen reliably by the few very fortunate souls who had managed to elude his grasp by fleeing his pursuit past the running water of the stream at the foot of the hill the new road had been built fifty years ago or so rune had been told after father donlin went up on the hill to exorcise the ghost and was found up there in the morning stone cold dead with a look of utter terror on his face that in fact was how most of the victims were found and no one who ever went up there at night returned alive those few who had escaped death had been going down the hill when the sun set having miscalculated or suffered some mishap on the road that had delayed them past the safe hour there had been five victims besides the father that rune herself knew about and stories spoke of dozens no one knew how long the ghost had been there nor why he haunted and killed granny beeson thoms grandmother and the oldest person in the village said hed been there as long as she remembered and now rune was walking straight up the haunted hill into the ghosts power deliberately seeking the ghost out a spirit that had killed a holy priest as if her music had a chance of appeasing it with more than enough time as she climbed the uneven rootridged track to regret her impulse she squinted through the trees at the setting sun she reckoned by the angle that once she reached the top of the pass shed have a little more than half an hour to settle herself and wait for herhost there seemed fewer birds on this track than the other and they all seemed to be birds of illomen ravens corbies blackbirds black boattails she tried to think if any of the ghosts other victims had been female maybe he only went after men but no granny beeson had said that two of the dead had been lovers running off to get married against the girls parental wishes so the thing killed women too stupid stupid stupid she berated herself if i live through this i am never going to let my temper get me into this kind of mess again not ever i swear but first she was going to have to survive the rest of the night chapter four as sunset neared the few birds that had been about made themselves vanish into the brush and rune was left alone on skull hill without even a raven for company it might have been her imagination but the trees seemed a little starved up here a strange skeletal growth with limbs like bony hands clawing the sky it seemed colder up here as welland the wind was certainly stronger moaning softly through the trees in a way that sounded uncannily human and doing nothing for her confidence level she looked around at the unpromising landscape and chose a rock finding one with a little hollow she spent some time pulling up some of the dry grass of last years growth giving the rock a kind of cushion to keep the cold away and sat down to wait as the crimson sun touched the top of beacon hill opposite her perch and crept alltooquickly behind it she began to shiver half with cold and half with the fear she had no difficulty in admitting now that she was alone of all the stupid things ive ever done this was one of the stupidest it was not a particularly spectacular sunset no clouds to catch and hold the suns last rays just the red disk sinking towards and then behind the hill the pale sky growing darkerdeepening from blue to black and all too soon the stars coming out brightest first pinpoints of cold bluewhite light the wind died to nothing just at sunset then picked up again after the last stars appeared rune took out her fiddle with benumbed fingers and tuned it by feel then sat on her rock and fingered every tune she knew without actually playing to keep her fingers limber and still nothing happened she was tired cold and her fear was fading her bones began to ache with the cold it would be so easy to pack up creep down the hill and return to the inn claiming that shed fiddled for the ghost and gotten away the idea was very tempting butthat would be a lie and a cheat she swore shed do this she pledged her word and even if the villagers thought her word was worthless that didnt make it so if she broke her word if she lied about what shed done what would that make her as worthless as the villagers claimed she was besides they probably wouldnt believe me anyway the moon appeared its cold silver light flooding over the hills and making them look as if theyd been touched with frost she marked time while it climbed keeping her fingers warm by tucking them in her armpits and taking out the fiddle now and again to make sure it was still in tune there was a great deal more life around here than there had been in the daylightunless her presence had frightened everything away until she stopped moving owls hooted off in the distance and a few early crickets sang nearby frogs croaked in the stream below her as bats and a nighthawk swooped through the pass looking for flying insects and once a great hare loped lazily down the road pausing in surprise at the sight of her and standing up on his haunches to take a better look for all the world like a white stone garden statue of the kind the sire had in his pleasuregarden at the sight of him she lost the last of her fear he was so quizzical so comicalit was impossible to be afraid of a place that held an animal like this she chuckled at him and he took fright at the sound whirling on his hind feet and leaping into the underbrush in a breath she shook her head relaxing a little in spite of the chill there was no ghost most likely and perhaps there never had been perhaps the ghost had been no more than a particularly resourceful bandit perhaps the moon touched the highest part of her arc marking the hour as midnight just as the thought occurred to her and at that moment absolute silence descended on the hill as if everything within hearing had been frightened into frozen immobility the crickets stopped chirping altogether the owl hoots cut off even the wind died leaving the midnight air filled only with a stillness that made the ears ache as they sought after the vanished sounds then the wind returned with a howl and a rush blowing her shirt flat to her body chilling her to the bone and turning the blood in her veins to ice it moaned like something in pain something dying by inches then it changed and whipped around her twisting her garments into confusion it swirled around her picking up dead leaves and pelting her with them the center of a tiny yet angry cyclone that was somehow more frightening than the pounding lightning of the worst thunderstorm it lashed her with her own hair blinded her with dust then it whisked away to spin on the road in front of her twisting the leaves in a miniature whirlwind less than ten paces from her her skin crawled as if there were something watching her from the center of the wind malignant that was what it felt like as if this wind was a living thing and it hated every creature it saw she shook her hair out of her eyes hugged her arms to her body and shook with cold and the prickling premonition of danger she couldnt take her eyes off the whirlwind and the swirling leaves caught in it the leavesit was so strange she could see every vein of them a claw of ice ran down her spine as she realized that she could see every vein of thembecause they were glowing shed seen foxfirewhat country child hadntbut this was different each leaf glowed a distinct and leprous shade of greenishwhite and they were drawing closer together into a column in the center of the whirlwind forming a solid slightly irregular shape thicker at the bottom than at the top with a kind of cowllike formation at the very top kind of it was a cowl the leaves had merged into a cowled and robed figure like a monk but the shape beneath the robe suggested nothing remotely human and she knew with dread that she didnt want to see the face hidden within that cowl the wind swirled the apparitions robes as it had swirled the leaves but disturbed it not at all then suddenly the wind died the last of the leaves drifted to pile around the apparitions feet if it had feet and not some other appendages the cowl turned in runes direction and there was a suggestion of glowing eyes within the shadows of the hood a voice an icy whispering voice came out of the darkness from all around her from everywhere yet nowhere it could have been born of her imagination yet rune knew the voice was the ghosts and that to run was to die instantly but in terror that would make dying seem to last an eternity why have you come here stupid child it murmured as fear urged her to run anyway why were you waiting here for me foolish child do you not know what i am what i could do to you at least it decided to talk to me first rune had to swallow twice before she could speak and even then her voice cracked and squeaked with fear ive come to fiddle for yousir she said gasping for breath between each word trying to keep her teeth from chattering and its a good thing im not here to sing she held out lady rose and her bow fiddle the ghost breathed as if it couldnt believe what it had heard you have come to fiddle to play mortal music for me for the first time since it had appeared rune began to hope she might survive this encounter at least shed surprised this thing uhyes sir i did the glow beneath the hood increased she was not imagining it and the voice strengthened why mortal child why did you come here tofiddle for me she toyed with the notion of telling it that shed done so for some noble reason because she felt sorry for it or that she wanted to bring it some pleasure but she had the feeling that it would know if she lied to it she also had the feeling that if she lied to it it would not be amused and since her life depended on keeping it amused so she told it the truth it was on a dare sir she stammered theres these boys in the town and they told me i was a secondrater andi swore id come up here and fiddle for you and let you judge if i was a secondrater or a wizard with m bow the cowl moved slightly as if the creature were cocking its head a little sideways and why would they call you secondrate becausebecause they want me to be sir she blurted if im secondrate they can look down on me ando what they want to me for some reason the longer she spoke the easier it became to do so to pour out all her anger her fear all the bottled emotions she couldnt have told anyone before this the spirit stayed silent attentive through all of it keeping its attitude of listening with interest even sympathy this was by far the most evenhanded hearing shed had from anyone it was even easy to speak of the attack jon and his friends had made tears of rage and outrage stinging her eyes as she did finally her anger ran out and with it the words she spread her hands bow in one fiddle in the other so thats it sir thats why im here you and i have something in common i think did she really hear those barely whispered words or only imagine them she certainly didnt imagine the next ones so you have come to fiddle for me to prove to these ignorant dirtgrubbers that you are theirequal the ghost laughed a sound with no humor in it the kind of laugh that called up empty wastelands and icy peaks well then girl fiddle then and pray to that sacrificed god of yours that you fiddle well very well if you please me if you continue to entertain me until dawn i shall let you live a favor i have never granted any other and that should prove you are not only their paltry equal but their better but i warn youthe moment my attention lags little girlyoull die like all the others and you will join all the others in my own private little hell it chuckled again cruelly or you may choose to attempt to run away to outrun me to the stream at the bottom of the hill please notice that i did say attempt it is an attempt that others have made and failed she thought for a moment that she couldnt do it her hands shook too much she couldnt remember anythingnot a single song not so much as a lullabye running was no choice either she knew that so she tucked her fiddle under her chin anyway and set the bow on the strings and played one single trembling note and that note somehow called forth another and another followed that until she was playing a stream a cascade of bright and lively melody and then she realized she was playing guards farewell one of her early tunes and since it was a slipjig it led naturally to jennys fancy and that in its turn to summer cider by then she had her momentum and the tunes continued to come one after another as easily and purely as if she were practicing all by herself she even began to enjoy herself a little to relax at least since the ghost hadnt killed her yet this might work she just might survive the night the ghost stood in that listening stance she closed her eyes to concentrate better as she often did when practicing letting the tunes bring back bright memories of warm summer days or nights by the fire as she had learned them the memories invoked other tunes and more memories and the friendships shared with musicians who called themselves by the names of birds linnet heron nightingale and raven robin jay and thrush when only parts of tunes came halfremembered bits of things other musicians had played that she hadnt quite caught she made up the rest she cobbled together childrens gamerhymes into reels and jigs she played cradlesongs hymns anything and everything she had ever heard or halfheard the melody to when she feared she was going to run dry she played a random run improvised on that and turned it into a melody of her very own it happened with an ease that amazed her somewhere in the back of her mind shed wanted to write songs shed had them living in the back of her mind for so long and yet shed never more than halfbelieved that she was going to get them to come out it was a marvel a wonder and she would have liked to try the tune over a second and third time but the ghost was still waiting and she dared not stop hours passed longer than she had ever played without stopping before gradually the nonstop playing began to take its toll as she had known would happen her upper bowarm ached then cramped then her fingering hand got a cramp along the outside edge the spot below her chin in her collarbone felt as if she was driving a spike into her neck then her fingering arm burned and cramped and her back started to hurt spreading agony down her spine into her legs she fiddled with tears of pain in her eyes while her fingers somehow produced rollicking dance music completely divorced from the reality of her aching limbs her fingers were numb she was grateful for that for she was entirely certain that there were blisters forming on her fingertips under the calluses and that if she ever stopped shed feel them finally she played fields of barley and knew a moment of complete panic as her mind went blank there was nothing there to play shed played everything she knew and she somehow had the feeling that the ghost wouldnt be amused by repeating music and there was no sign of dawn she was going to die after all but her fingers were wiser than she was for they moved on their own and from beneath them came the wild sad wailing notes of the laments that the gypsy nightingale had played for her now for the first time the ghost stirred and spoke and she opened her eyes in startlement more it breathed more rune closed her eyes again and played every note she remembered and some she hadnt known shed remembered and the air warmed about her losing its chill her arms slowly grew lighter the aches flowed out of them until she felt as fresh as shed been when first she started this free from pain she gave herself up to the music playing in a kind of trance in which there was nothing but the music at last she came as far as she could there was no music left her own or anyone elses she played the last sobbing notes of the gypsy song nightingale had told her was a lament for her own longlost home holding them out as long as she could but they flowed out and away and finally ended she opened her eyes the first rays of dawn lightened the horizon bringing a flush of pink to the silverblue sky the stars had already faded in the east and were winking out overhead and somewhere off in the distance a cock crowed and a chorus of birdcalls drifted across the hills there was nothing standing before her now the ghost was gonebut he had left something behind where he had stood where there had once been a heap of leaves there was now a pile of shining silver coins more than enough to pay for that second instrument the lessons for it and part of her keep while she mastered it as she stared at the money in utter disbelief a whisper came from around her like a breath of the cool dawn wind coming up off the hills go child take your reward and go and do not look back a laugh a kindly one this time you deserved gold but you would never have convinced anyone you came by it honestly then nothing but the bird song she put her fiddle away first with hands that shook with exhaustion but were otherwise unmarred by blisters or any other sign of the abuse shed heaped on them then and only then did she gather up the coins one at a time each one of them proving to be solid and as real as her own hand one handful then twoso many she finally had to tear off the tail of her shift for a makeshift pouch coins so old and worn they had no writing left and only a vague suggestion of a face coins from places shed never heard of coins with nonhuman faces on them and coins minted by the sires own treasury more money than she had ever seen in her life and all of it hers she stopped at the stream at the foot of the hill the place that traditionally marked the spot where the ghosts power ended she couldnt help but stop she was exhausted and exhilarated and her legs wouldnt hold her anymore she sank down beside the stream and splashed cold water in her face feeling as if she would laugh cry or both in the next instant the money in a makeshift pouch cut from the tail of her shift weighed heavily at her belt and lightly in her heart freedom that was what the ghost had given herand from its final words she knew that the spirit had been well aware of the gift it had granted go and dont look back it had given her freedom but only if she chose to grasp itif she did go and didnt look back leaving everything behind her mother jib the tavern could she do that it had taken a certain kind of courage to dare the ghost but it would take another colder kind of emotion to abandon everything and everyone shed always known no matter what they had done to her could she leave them for the unknown her elation faded leaving the weariness she picked herself up and started for home at a slower pace sure only of her uncertainty goor stay each step asked the same question and none of the echoes brought back an answer the road was empty this time of the morning with no one sharing it but her and the occasional squirrel a cool damp breeze brought the scent of fresh earth and growing things from the forest on either hand it was a shame to reach the edge of the village and see where the hand of man had fallen heavily the inn with its worn wooden siding and faded sign seemed shabby and much much smaller than it had been when she left yesterday dust from the road coated everything and there wasnt even a bench outside for a weary traveler to sit on nor a pump for watering himself and his beast these were courtesies yes but they cost nothing and their absence bespoke a certain niggardliness of hospitality she found herself eyeing her home with disfavor if not dislike and approached it with reluctance prompted by a caution she didnt understand she left the road and came up to the inn from the side where she wouldnt be seen from the open door she walked softly making no noise when she heard the vague mumble of voices from inside the common room through the stillshuttered windows she paused just outside the open door and still hidden from view as the voices drifted out through the cracks in the shutters her bed wasnt slept in stara said and rune wondered why she had never noticed the nasal petulant whine in her mothers voice before but the fiddles gone i think she ran away jeoff she didnt have the guts to admit she couldnt take the dare and she ran away stara sounded both aggrieved and triumphant as if she felt rune had done this purely to make her mother miserable and as if she felt she had been vindicated in some way maybe shes been telling tales to jeoff herself the way i figured oh aye that im sure of kaylan drawled with righteous selfimportance young jon said she been aflirtin wi him day agone and she took it badly when he gave her the pass so that was how he explained it she thought seething with sudden anger despite her weariness but how did he explain his swollen tongue and bruised crotch that i hit him when he wouldnt lay with me anyways shes been causin trouble down to village insultin the girls and mockin the boys think she got too big fer her hat and couldnt take it t have her bluff called kaylan yawned hugely i think yere well rid of her mistress stara could be it was nobbut spring but could be the girls gone bad i dont know jeoff said uncertainly we need the help and theres no denying it if we can find her and get her back maybe we ought to a good hiding id turn the stick on you first she thought angrily well as to that kaylan said readily me das got a cousin down reedben way with too many kids and too little landhappen that he could send ye the twins to help out likely yere goin to want the extra help what with summer comin on boy and girl and bout twelve old nough to work young nough not to cause no trouble if they were willing to come for what rune got jeoff said with eagerness and reluctance mixed room board and two suits f clothes in the year havent got much to spare not even t take a new wife unless things get better rune looked down at the bag of silver coins at her belt hearing a note in jeoffs voice shed never noticed before a note of complaint and a tightfisted whine similar to the one in staras voice and as if she had been gifted with the sight of things to come she knew what would happen if she went into that doorway no one would ever believe that she had dared skull hill and its deadly ghost not even with this doublehandful of coins to prove it theyd think shed found it ormore likelythat she had stolen it jeoff would doubtless take it away from her and possibly lock her in her room if suspicion ran high enough against her at least until she could prove that shed stolen nothing then when no one complained of robbery they would let her go but shed bet they still wouldnt return her hardearned reward to her theyd figure she had found a cache of coins along the old road dug it up in the ruins in the skull hill pass or had found a newly dead victim of the ghost and had robbed the dead and with that as justification and because she was just a child stara and jeoff would take it all to keep it safe for her that would surely be the last she would see of it for stara would see to it that it was properly disposed of she would probably spend a long night closeted with jeoff and when it was over the money would be in his coffers shed promise it all to him as her dower if he agreed to marry her and since there wasnt a girl in the village who could boast a double handful of silver as her dower hed probably agree like a lightning strike stara would tell herself no doubt that since this ensured rune a home and a father it was in her best interest never mind that rune would be no better off than beforestill an unpaid drudge and still without the means to become a guild bard jeoff would hide the money away wherever it was he kept the profits of the inn rune would never get her lessons her second instrument she would always be at best the local tavernmusician she would still lack the respect of the locals although jeoff as her stepfather would provide some protection from the kind of things jon had tried shed live and die here never seeing anything but this little village and whoever happened to be passing through if she was very lucky jib might marry her in fact jeoff would probably encourage that idea it would mean that he would not have to part with any of the ghosts silver for runes dowerassuming she could induce any of the local boys to the wedding altarand he would then have jib as an unpaid drudge forever as well as rune and her mother he would do well all the way around she would still have the reputation of the tavern wenchs bastard she would still have trouble from the local girls and their mothers if not the local boys and there might come a time when beer or temper overcame someones good senseand she still might find herself fighting off a wouldbe rapist there would be plenty of opportunities over the next few years for just that kind of accident and the boy could always pledge shed lied or led him on and who would the sires magistrate believe not rune that was what was in store for her if she stayed but if she followed the ghosts advice to go and not look back what about mother part of her asked a colder part had the answer already stara could take care of herself if she couldnt that wasnt runes problem besides ive been standing here for the past few minutes listening to my own mother slash what little reputation i had to ragged ribbons shes not exactly overflowing with maternal protection and love her jaw clenched her resolve hardened no stara could damned well take care of herself rune wasnt about to help her but what about jib that stopped her cold for a moment jib had been as much prey to the village youngsters as she had and shed protected him for a long time now what would they do when they found out he didnt have that protection anymore how could she just leave him without a word she moved into the shelter of some bushes around the forested side of the inn leaned up against a tree and shut her eyes for a moment trying to think he didnt need to worry about rape no one was going to try and force him because his mother had the word of being a slut his problems had always stemmed from the bigger stronger boys seeing him as an easy target someone they could beat up with impunity but the bigger stronger boys had other things to occupy them now theyd all either been apprenticed or theyd taken their places in the fields with their farmerfathers they had very little time to go looking for mischief and thered be no excuse for them giving jib a hiding if hed been sent to the village on an errand nor did jib have to worry about the girls wagging tongues they didnt care one way or another about himexcept perhaps as to whether or not hed been tupping rune that might even earn him a little grudging admiration if he refused to tell them or denied it altogether theyd be certain to think that he had then besides one way or another he was going to have to learn to fend for himself eventually it might as well be now sorry jib youll be all right she worked her way through the bushes farther along the side of the inn to stand below the eaves there was one way into her room that she hadnt bothered to take for years not since she and jib had gone swimming at night and hunting owls she looked up peering through the leaves of the big oak that grew beside the inn and saw that sure enough the shutters were open on the window to her room stara hadnt bothered to close them very well then shed make the truth out of part of the lie carefully she put the fiddle down beside the trunk and pulled the pouch of coins from her belt tucking it into her shirt it was safer there than anywhere else while she climbed she jumped up and caught the lowest limb of the oak shed been leaning against pulling herself up onto it and calling up an ache in her arms it was a lot harder to climb the tree than she rememberedbut not as hard as fiddling all night from that limb she found hand and toeholds up the trunk to the next branch this one went all the way to her attic window slanting above the roof and sometimes scraping against it when high winds blew she eased her way bellydown along the branch with the pouch of silver resting against her stomach above her belt she crept along it like a big cat not wanting to sling herself underneath the way she had when she was a kid it was easier to climb that way but also easier to be seen the branch was still strong enough to take her weight though it groaned a little as she neared the roof when she got to the rooftop she eased herself over hanging onto the branch with both hands and arms feeling with her toes for the windowsill this part was easier now that she was older it wasnt as far to reach it was a matter of minutes to pack her few belongings in a roll made from her bedding shirts breeches a winter cloak that was a castoff from rose a single skirt and a couple of bodices and vests some underclothing a knife a fork a wooden dish and a mug two hats both battered stockings a pair of sandals and a pair of shoes rosin for the bow and a string of glass beads an old hunting knife she hesitated about taking the bedding but remembered all the work shed done and lost her hesitation jeoff owed her a couple of sheets and blankets at least she figured for all the work shed done for him without pay then she tossed the bundle into the brush where shed left her fiddle and eased herself down over the sill catching the branch above and reversing her route to the ground bedroll on her back fiddle in her hand and silver in her shirt she headed down the road to beeford and beyond without a single glance behind her chapter five rune paused for a moment at the top of what passed for a hill hereabouts and looked down on the city of nolton she forgot her aching feet and the dry roaddust tickle at the back of her throat no amount of water would ease she had been anticipating something large but she was taken a bit aback she hadnt expected anything this big the city spread across the green fields in a dull redbrown swath up and down the river and so far as she could see there was no end to it a tradecity a city that had never been under attack nolton had no walls to keep anyone out nolton wanted all comers inside spending their coin making the city prosper the strategy must be working for it surely looked prosperous houses of two and even three stories were common in the center there were buildings that towered a dizzying ten or eleven stories tall the cathedral was one it loomed over everything else overshadowing the town as the church overshadowed the lives of the townsfolk she had also been expecting noise but not this far away from the city itself but already there was no doubt that she heard sounds that could only come from nolton even at this distance the city hummed a kind of monotonous chant in which the individual voices blended until there was no telling what were the parts that comprised it she had anticipated crowds well shed gotten them in abundance there had been some warning in the numbers of travelers for the past day and more on the road although there were throngs of people until today she hadnt been as apprehensive as she might have been after all the whole way here she had made her way with her fiddle and her songs it hadnt been easy drumming up the courage to approach that first innkeeper trying to appear nonchalant and experienced at life on the road shed taken heart at first from the heavy belt of silver coins beneath her shirt the ghost had thought her worth listening to and worth rewarding for that matter the memory gave her courage courage to stride up to inns with all the assurance of the minstrels that had been her teachers and present herself with an offer of entertainment in exchange for room and board it got a little easier with each approach especially when the innkeepers stayed civil at the very least and most were cordial even in their rejection not that she had tried great inns the inns where the guildsmen and lesser nobles stayed she didnt even try for the traders inns the kind where every traveler had at least a twohorse string no she had stuck to common enough inns the sort simple peddlers and foottravelers used inns like the one she had grown up in where she figured she knew the custom and the kind of music theyd prefer shed been right for they welcomed her always when they had no other musicians present and sometimes even when they did if the other musician was a local or indicated a willingness to share out the proceeds no one ever complained about her playingalthough she dared not try her luck too far she didnt want to run afoul of a guild minstrel so she kept her ambitions modest collected her pennies and didnt trespass where she had any reason to doubt her welcome there would be time enough to play for silver or even gold later time enough for the fine clothing and the handsome pony to ride time enough when she was a guild bard she didnt want to give any guildsman reason to protest her admittance so for now she pleased the peddlers the farmers and the herdsmen well enough she took her dinner her spot by the hearthfire and her bread and cheese in the morning with no complaint she collected the occasional penny with a blessing and a special song for the giver every copper saved on this journey was one she could use to buy lessons and that precious instrument when she reached nolton and when there was no dinner no spot on the hearthshe slept in barns in haystacks or even up a treeand she ate whatever she had husbanded from the last inn or doled out a grudging coin or two for the cheapest possible meal or a bit of bread or a turnip from a marketstall twice when the inns failed her she was able to avail herself of a travelers shelter operated by the church for the price of a half loaf she was able to get not only a pallet in a dormitory with other woman travelers but a bath and two meals dinner was a bowl full of thick peaseporridge and a slice of oat bread and breakfast was more of the bread toasted this time with a bit of butter and a trickle of honey more copper or silver produced better food and accommodations but she saw no reason to waste her coins the hidden price of this largess was that she also had to listen to sermons and scripture at both meals and attend holy services before and after dinner and dawn prayers in the morning she had been left alone other than that though any females with a look of prosperity about them were singled out for special attentions those who were single and welldressed but not guild members were urged to consider the novitiatethose who were married or in a trade were reminded that the church favored those daughters who showed their faith in material ways those two rest stops were enlightening a bit amusing and a bit disturbing she had never quite realized the extent to which the churchs representatives worked to build and keep a hold on people it was true that the church did a great deal of goodbut after years of living in an inn rune had a fair notion of how much things cost oat bread was the cheapest type there was peaseporridge just as inexpensive the hungry bear had never served either except in the dead of winter when there were no customers at all and only the staff to feed granted both meals at the hostel were wellmade and food was given out unstintingly but the labor involved was free as was the labor involved in keeping the travelers dormitory and bathhouse clean that was provided by the novicesthe lowerclass novices or so rune suspected she doubted those of gentler birth would be asked to scrub and cook the church was probably not making enough just from the meals and the price of lodging to make the kind of profit a real inn wouldbut there was another factor involved here the donations coaxed from the purses of the welloff the church got more than enough to make a tidy profit in freewill offeringsat least on the two occasions rune observed so the lodging was a pretense for extracting more donations for all the prating about the poverty of the church for all that what she saw was as bare and sparse as the clergy claimed the money had to be going somewhere she couldnt help wondering as she walked away that second morning what happened to all that money was there something beyond those stark severe walls in the places where the layman was not allowed to walk it was a good question but one she didnt dwell on for long she had her own agenda and it had nothing to do with the churchs she simply resolved to keep a wary eye on dealings that involved the clergy from here on so long as they left her alone shed hold her peace about their profits nolton had become her goal very soon after leaving the hungry bear once shed had a chance to talk to other travelers for all that shed never been outside the bounds of her own village she knew what she needed out of a town nolton was the nearest city with enough musicians to give her a choice in teachersdozens of inns and taverns shed been told with all manner of entertainers musicians could make a good living in nolton the rich had their own family musicians as retainersthere were several guild halls which often hired singers and players even whole ensembles there were even instrumentmakers in nolton enough of them that they had their own section in the weekly market it was not in the direction of the midsummer faire but she wouldnt be ready for the trials for at least a year maybe two so direction didnt much matter at the moment what did matter was finding a good teacher quickly she hadnt once considered how big a city would have to be in order to provide work for that many musicians the number of ordinary folk that meant simply hadnt entered her mind shed simply pictured in a vague sort of way a place like her own village multiplied a few times over now she found herself standing on the edge of the road looking down on a place that contained more people than she had ever imagined lived in the whole world and suddenly found herself reluctant to enter it with all those peoplethe abundance of musicians abruptly became more than just a wide choice of teachers it had just occurred to her that all those teachers were also competition suddenly her plan of augmenting her savings with her fiddling seemed a lot riskier what if she wasnt good enough but the ghost thought i was the weight of the coins shed sewn into the linen belt she wore under her shirt served as a reminder of that stillshe was good in a little village she was passable in the country inns but here she was likely to be just one more backwater fiddler the tunes she knew could be hopelessly outdated or too countrified to suit townsfolk and shed heard that everything was more expensive in cities her hoard of coins might not be enough to keep her for any length of time apprehension dried her mouth as she stared at the faraway roofs maybe she just ought to forget the whole idea turn back and keep on as she had been fiddling for food and a place to sleep in little wayside inns traveling about picking up a few coppers at weddings and faires tempting it was the easy way out it was the way her mother would have counseled stick with the sure thing but the thought of staras counsel made her stiffen her back maybe she shouldbut no that wasnt what she wanted to do it wasnt enough and look where staras counsel had gotten her she gave herself a mental shake and squared her shoulders under her pack it wasnt enoughand besides practically speaking this fiddling about was a fine life in the middle of summer but when winter came shed be leading a pretty miserable existence many inns closed entirely in the winter and it would be much harder to travel then her pace would be cut to half or a third of what it was now shed be spending a lot of time begging shelter from farmers along the road some of them were friendly some werent then there were robbers highwaymen banditsshe hadnt run afoul of any of them yet but that had been because she was lucky and didnt look worth robbing in winter anything was worth robbing no there was no hope for it the original plan was the best she took a deep breath remembered the ghostwith a bit of a chuckle to think that she was finding comfort in the memory of that creatureand joined the stream of humanity heading into the city she kept her eyes on the road and the back of the cart in front of her watching to make sure she didnt step in anything the pace slowed as people crowded closer and closer together finally dropping to a crawl as the road reached the outskirts of the city there was no wall but there was a guard of some kind on the roadway and everyone had to stop and talk to him for a moment rune was behind a man with an ox cart full of sacks of new potatoes so she didnt hear what the guard asked before she reached him herself a wooden barrier dropped down in front of her startling her into jumping back the guard a middleaged paunchy fellow yawned and examined her with a bored squint picking his teeth with his fingernail she waited stifling a cough as he picked up a piece of board with paper fastened to it a list of some kind he studied it then her then it again name he said finally rune she replied wishing her nose didnt itch she was afraid to scratch it lest he decide she meant something rude by the gesture he scribbled a few things on the list in his hand free indentured or guild came the next question she wrinkled her forehead for a moment puzzled by that middle term he looked at her impatiently and swatted at a horsefly that was buzzing around his ears whats matter boy he barked deaf or dumb for a moment she was confused until she remembered that she had decided to wear her loose shirt vest and breeches rather than attract unwelcome attention boy was her but what on earth was he asking her well she wasnt guild and if she didnt know what indentured was she probably wasnt that either no sir she said hesitantly iuh then answer the question free indentured or guild he swatted at the fly again free sir she was relieved to see him make another note he didnt seem angry with her just tired and impatient well she was pretty hot and tired herself she felt a trickle of sweat running down the back of her neck and her feet hurt from westhaven sir she added my mother is stara at the hungry bear he noted that too profession that at least she could answer she touched the strap of lady rose and replied with more confidence fiddler sir musician sir but not guild he gave her another one of those sharp glances passing through planning to stay a while she shook her head going to stay sir through winter anyway he snorted right they all are all right boy you bein not guild you can busk in the street or you can take up with a common inn or a pleasurehouse but you cant take no gentry inns an no gentry jobs less you get guild permission an you stay outa the parksan you got a threeday to get a permit after that if you be caught streetbuskin you get fined maybe thrown in gaol here he shoved a chip of colored wood at her with a string around it she took it bewildered that shows what day ye come in show it when yer buskin or when innkeeper asks fer it till ye get yer permit mind what i said get that permit he raised the barrier and she stepped gingerly past him and into the town an dont think t come back through an get another chit he shouted after her yer down on the list constables will know constables what on earth is a constable she nodded as if she understood and got out of the way of a man leading a donkey who showed the guard a piece of paper and was waved through the fellow with the ox cart had disappeared into the warren of streets that led from the guardpost and she moved off to the side of the road and the shade of some kind of storage building to study the situation she stood at the edge of a semicircular area paved with flat stones similar to streets she had seen in some of the larger villages and in the courtyards of the church hostels that only made sense with all these people a dirt street would be mud at the first bit of rain and dust the rest of the time storage buildings padlocked and closed up made a kind of barricade between the open fields and the edge of town the streets led between more of these buildings with no sign of houses or those inns the guard spoke of she watched the steady stream of travelers carefully as she rubbed her nose looking for a system in the way people who seemed to know what they were doing selected one of the streets leading from this crossing she took off her hat and fanned herself with it the sweat she had worked up cooling in the shade of the building no one seemed inclined to make her move on which was a relief finally she thought she had a pattern worked out there werent so many streets as she had thought just a half dozen or so the people with the bits of paper the ones with beasts laden with foodstuffs were taking the street farthest left that probably leads to a market there wont be any inns there too noisy and too smelly the three streets on the right were being followed by folks who were plainly church guild or noble mounted and welldressed the street directly before her was taken only by commoner folk or by guards they were all people whod been waved through without being stopped so it probably led to homes a wide assortment of folks the kind questioned by the guard before he let them in were taking the marketstreet or the one next to it after a moment she decided to take the latter she made her way across the fanshaped crossingarea darting under the noses of placid oxen following in the wake of a peddler leading a donkey loaded with what looked like rolls of cloth as she had hoped he took that second street and she continued to follow him being jostled at every turn before she got the knack of avoiding people it was a little like a dance you had to watch what they were going to do but there was a kind of rhythm to it although she lost her guide before she figured it all out after a few moments she settled into the pace a kind of bobbing walk in which she took steps far shorter than she was used to and began looking around her with interest all the buildings here were of wood with slate roofs two or three stories tall the upper stories overhung the street and some were near enough to each other that folk sat in their open windows and gossiped above the heads of the the crowd like neighbors over a fence for the most part there was scarcely enough room for a dog to squeeze between the buildings and the street itself was several degrees darker for being overshadowed a gutter ran down the center of the street and she assumed at first that it was for the dung of the beastsbut a moment later she saw a little old man with a barrow and a shovel adroitly skipping about his side of the street and scooping up every fragrant horseapple in sight often before anyone had a chance to tread on it he acted as if he was collecting something valuable he certainly didnt miss much and what he didnt get the sparrows lining the rooftops swooped down on scattered it and picked it over looking for undigested grain behind the fellow with the barrow came another with a dog cart drawn by a huge mongrel holding a barrel with boards bulging and sprung so that it leaked water in every direction rune stared at it aghast at what she thought was his loss through foolishness or senilityand then realized it was on purpose the water washed whatever the dungcollector had missed into the gutter where it ran away somewhere it wasnt the arrangement itself that caught her by surprise it was what it implied here were people who spent all day every day presumably making a livingkeeping the streets clean the very idea would have made someone from her own village stare and question the sanity of anyone who proposed such an outlandish notion this was not just a new world shed jumped into it was one that entertained things shed never even dreamed of as commonplaces she felt dizzy rootlessand terribly alone how could she have enough in common with these townsfolk to even begin to entertain them but the next moment she heard the familiar sounds of a jig she knew wellhalf a pennyplayed on some kind of fife or pipe she craned her neck to try and spot the player waiting impatiently for the flow of the traffic to take her close enough to see him finally she spotted him wedged in a little nook under the overhanging second story of one of the houses with his hat on the stones in front of him and a bit of paper pinned to his hat he was surrounded by a mix of people none very wellborn but of all ages and trades clapping in time to his piping she focused on that brightly colored bit of paper that must be the permit the guard told me i had to get she tried to get over to him to ask him where hed gotten it but the crowd carried her past and she wasnt sure enough of her way to try and fight her way back still his hat had held a fair amount of coinwhich meant that someone thought country jigs were good enough entertainment the houses began to hold shops on the lower level with young prentices outside crying the contents the street widened a bit as well and she began to spot roving peddlers of the sort that walked the faires trays of goods carried about their necks the peddlers seemed mostly to be crying foodstuffs meat pies roast turnips nuts breadandcheese muffins and sweets one of them passed near enough to her that she got a good whiff of his meatpies and the aroma made her stomach growl and her mouth water it had been a long time since noon and her hoarded turnip but it wasnt only caution that kept her from reaching for her purse of coppers it was common sense no use in letting any thief know where her money was shed felt ghostly fingers plucking at her outer sashbelt a number of times and at her pack but the clever knots shed tied the pack with foiled them and the pouch lean as it was she had tucked inside her belt if she let pickpockets see where that pouch was she had a shrewd idea it wouldnt stay there long she mentally blessed raven for warning her to make a cloth belt to wear inside her clothes for most of any money she had once she was on the road it wont keep you safe from true robbers hed said not the kind that hit you over the head and strip youbut itll save you from cutpurses there was more advice hed given her and now that she was a little more used to the city some of it was coming back though she hadnt paid a lot of attention to it originally the lessons in music had seemed a lot more important never ask for directions except from somebody wearing a uniform or from an innkeeper if you find yourself on a street thats growing deserted turn around and retrace your steps quickly especially if the street seems very dirty and dark with the buildings closed up or in bad repair if a friendly passerby comes up out of nowhere and offers to help you ignore him walk away from him or get by him before he can touch you never do anything that marks you as a stranger especially as a stranger from the country thatll show you as an easy mark for robbers or worse all right then exactly how was she going to find an inn and a place where she might be able to set herself up as the resident musician this was a street of shopsbut sooner or later there had to be an inn didnt there maybe then again maybe not there were other streets branching off this one maybe the inns were on these side streets shed never know she spotted a dusty hat just ahead of her a hat that had once been bright red but had faded to a soft rose under sun and rain something about the set of the rooster feathers in it seemed familiar when the crowd parted a little she realized that it belonged to one of the journeymen who had been in the same inn shed played at last night and had tossed her a copper when she played the tune hed requested shed overheard him talking quite a bit to a fellow in the apothecarys guild she remembered now that he had said he wasnt from nolton himself but he was familiar with the city and had recommended a number of inns and had given directions to the other man she hadnt paid attention thenthe more fool hershed thought she would have no trouble as an innbrat herself in finding plenty of places but he bobbed along in the crowd with a purposeful stride he obviously knew exactly where he was going an inn it was very likely given the time of day and any inn he frequented would likely be the sort where her playing would be welcome she darted between two goodwives with shopping baskets over their arms and scraped along a shop front past a clutch of slowerpaced old men who frowned at her as she scooted by the feathers bounced in the breeze just ahead of her tantalizingly near yet far enough away that she could all too easily lose their owner in the press she found herself stuck behind a brownclad overweight nursemaid with a gaggle of chattering children on their way home from the church school the two eldest both girls one in scarlet and one in blue and both wearing clothing that cost more than every item shed ever owned in her life bundled together looked down their noses at her in a vaguely threatening fashion when she made as if to get past them she decided not to try to push her way by they might think she was a thief and get a guard or something in fact they might do it just to be spiteful the pinched look about their eyes put her in mind of some of the more disagreeable village girls she loitered behind them and fumed but they were moving awfully slow as the nursemaid called back the littler ones from darting explorations of store fronts time and time again the rooster feathers were bobbing away getting ahead of her their owner making a faster pace than she dared then suddenly as she strained her neck and her eyes trying to keep them in sight redhat turned into a side street the rooster feathers swishing jauntily as he ducked his head to cut across the flow of traffic then hat and feathers and all disappeared behind a building oh no heedless now of what the unfriendly girls might say or do rune dashed between them at the first break ignoring their gasps of outrage as she wormed her way through the crowd to the place where redhat had vanished she used her elbows and thin body to advantage ignoring the protests of those whose feet she stepped on or who got an elbow in the ribs taking care only to protect lady rose and her pack she broke out of the crowd directly under the nose of a coach horse it snorted in surprise and came to a hoofclattering halt she flung herself against the wall plastering herself against the brick to let the coach pass the driver cursed her and the other foottravelers roundly but the welltrained placid horse simply snorted again at her as if to register his surprise when she had appeared under his nose and ignored her once she was out of his way the wheels of the coach rumbled by her feet missing them by scant inches the driver now too busy cursing at the other folk in his way to pay any more attention to her she sighed and wiped her sweating brow when he had passed that was a lot closer than she cared to come to getting run over and if the horse hadnt been a particularly stolid beast she could have gotten trampled or started a runaway but now that the coach was gone she saw that this street carried a lot less traffic than the main street it should be easy to find redhat she peered down the cobblestone street but the conspicuous hat was nowhere to be seen for a moment her heart sank but then she raised her eyes a little and couldnt help but grin there not twenty feet from her swung a big handpainted sign proclaiming the crowned corn public house drink vittles superimposed over a garish yellow painting of a barleysheaf with a crown holding the straws in place beside it swung a huge wooden mug with carved and whitepainted foam spilling over the sides for the benefit of the illiterate whether or not red hat was in there the presence of the beer mug meant that it was a common place and its clientele shouldnt be too different from the travelers shed been entertaining if she couldnt strike up a bargain here she could probably get directions to a place that could use a musician if the owner proved unfriendly at least now she knew that the inns were on the side streets i can retrace my steps if i have to and find another she trotted the remaining few steps to the door and pushed it open she blinked trying to get her eyes to adjust quickly to the dark smoky interior the aroma that hit her of smoke baking bread and bacon of stew and beer was so like the way the hungry bear smelled that she could have been there instead of here but the crowds this place was packed full with more people than the bear ever saw except at the height of harvest faire there were five or six girls in bright cheap skirts and tightlaced bodices and young men in leather aprons breeches and nocolor shirts scurrying about the room tending to the customers she despaired of being able to catch anyones eye to ask directions to the owner but one of the girls must have caught the flicker of movement at the door for she bustled over as soon as shed finished gathering the last of the mugs from an empty table she appraised rune with a knowing eye a little disappointed that it wasnt a paying customer but willing to see what rune wanted ye be a musicker boy she asked and rune nodded come wi me then she said and turned on her heel to lead the way through the crowd her striped skirts swishing jauntily with every step there evidently wasnt any prohibition here about fondling the help and the many pats and pinches the girl got made rune very glad for her boys garb she pushed past two swinging halfdoors into what could only be the kitchen it was hot as the inside of a bakeoven and overcrowded with people on the wall nearest the door stood a pair of dishtubs on a tall bench or narrow table with a dragglehaired girl standing beside it and working her way through a mountain of mugs and bowls runes guide heaved her own doublehandful of wooden mugs up onto the table with a clatter then turned to the rest of the room it was dominated by the bakeovens at the far end all of them going full blast three huge windows and the door open to the yard did little to ease the burden of heat the roaring fires beneath the ovens emitted there was a big table in front of the ovens with a man and a woman rolling out crust for a series of pies at one end and cooling loaves stacked at the other another table next to that held a man cutting up raw chickens beside him was another woman slicing some kind of large joint of cooked meat a third table held six small children cleaning and chopping vegetables there were other folks darting in and out with food or the dirty dishes and a knot of people at the oven end mathe the serving girl shouted over the din mathe sommut t see ye a short round redfaced man in a flourcovered apron detached himself from the clump of workers beside the ovens and peered across the expanse of the kitchen toward them his bald head shiny with sweat looked like a ripening tomato what is it he yelled back wiping his brow with a towel he tucked back into his waistband musicker the girl called a bit impatiently wants a job mathe edged around the end of the table by the oven then squeezed in between the wall with the windows and the children cleaning vegetables to make his way towards them rune waited for him trying not to show any anxiety the serving girl watched them both with avid curiosity as mathe stopped a few feet away the owner planted both fists on his hips and stood slightly straddlelegged looking her up and down with bright black eyes as keen as his eyes seemed to be however she got the feeling he didnt realize she wasnt a boy plenty of young men wore their hair longer than hers and her thin face and stickstraight body wasnt going to set any hearts aflame even when she was in skirts certainly the serving girl had made the same mistake that the gateguard had made and she wasnt going to correct any of them musicker eh mathe said at last guild she shook her head wondering if she had doomed herself from the start what had the gateguard said about jobs she could take there had been something about inns good mathe said in satisfaction we cant afford guild fees from country are ye singer or player from down near beeford im a player sir she replied fiddle sir got permit when ye come in he asked wheres yer chit these cityfolk spoke so fast she had to listen carefully to make out what they were saying wordlessly she showed him her scrap of wood he took a quick glance at it today hmm he examined her a moment more you know heart to the ladies he asked and at her nod said unlimber that bita wood and play it she dropped her pack on the flagstone floor and took lady rose out of her traveling bag tuning her hastily with a wince for her in this overheated room she set the bow to the strings and playednot her best but not her worstthough it was hard to make the music heard in the noisy kitchen still the serving girls foot was tapping when mathe stopped her at the second chorus yell do he said if we cn agree ye got a oneday job heres how it is we got a reglar musicker but he took a job at a weddin we was gonna do wiout tnight but music makes the beer flow better an since here ye be i dont go lookin a gift musicker i the mouth he chuckled and so did rune though she didnt get the joke whatever it was now heres the bargain mathe continued wiping the back of his neck with his towel it was a good thing he was mostly bald or his hair would have been in the same greasy tangles as the dishwasher girls i feeds ye now ye plays till closin ye gets a place by th fire t sleepthis aint no inn an im not spposed t be puttin people up but you bein on yer threeday chit th lawll look tother way ye put out yer hat i get two coins outa every three that wasnt as good a bargain as shed been getting on the road but it sounded like he was waiting for her to make a counteroffer she shook her head half and i get bread and stew in the morning half an ye get breadn dripping he countered take it or leave it its mlast offer bread and butter or bread and honey would have been betterbut butter and honey could be a lot more expensive in the city where there were neither cows nor bees done she said putting out her hand they shook on it solemnly all right then he said rubbing his hands together in satisfaction beth therell show ye where tset up and gi ye the laya the land an shell see to yer feedin don touch th girls less they invite it or mbarkeepll have yer hand broke oh one other thing i don let me musickers get dry but i don let em get drunk neither small beer or cider cider rune said quickly the last thing she needed was to get muddleheaded in a strange eatinghouse in a strange city and although small beer didnt have a lot of punch to it drinking too much could still put you under the table and if it was this hot all night shed be resorting to her mug fairly often mathe had given her an interesting piece of information so inns didnt necessarily take sleepers here that was worth noting she reckoned that would suit stara just fineit would mean less than half the work but this place wasnt called an inn it was something called a public house they must be two different things good lad mathe replied with satisfaction dont talk much sensible and ye drive a good bargain yell do now get long wi ye i got my work t tend beth laughed and wrinkled her nose at him and rune picked up her pack and followed the serving girl out her hips waggled saucily and rune wondered just what constituted an invitation certainly the girl was trying to see if this new musician could be tempted too bad for her im not a boy im afraid im going to disappoint her if she wants a sweatypalm reaction there was just enough of a clear path behind the benches and tables to walk without bumping into the customers they edged around the wall until they came to a corner with a stool and a shelf very near the bar and the massive bartender presiding over the barrels of beer and ale his expression impassive statuelike here beth said gesturing at the stool flipping her dark hair over her shoulder if she was disappointed that rune hadnt answered her flirtations she didnt show it maybe she was completely unaware shed been flirtatious manners could be a lot different here than what rune was used to this be where ye set up an play we likes countrytunes here an keep it lively if they gets t clappin they gets t drinkin rune nodded and tucked her pack behind the stool lady rose was still in her hand and she set the fiddle down on top of the pack gently so that the instrument was cradled by the worn fabric of the pack and the clothing it contained look sharp here boy beth said and rune looked up ye see how close ye are t the bar she pointed with her chin at the massive barrier of wood that stood between the customers and the barrels of beer and wine rune nodded again and beth grinned theres a reason why we put th musicker here most of ye aint big nuff t take carea yerselves if it comes t fightin now mostly things is quiet but sometimes a ruckus comes up if theres a ruckus ye get yer tail down behin that bar hear aint yer job t stop a ruckus thas boonys job an he be right good at it beth tossed her curly tangle of hair over her shoulder again and pointed at a shadowy figure across the room in a little alcove near the door she hadnt noticed it when she first came in because her back had been to it and the occupant hadnt moved to attract her attention rune squinted then started surely she hadnt seen what she thought shed seen beth laughed showing that she still had most of her teeth and that they were in good shape aint never seen no mintak eh fiddler well boonys a mintak an right good at keepin the peace so mind what i said an let him do what hes good at f it come to it rune blinked and nodded she wanted to stare at the creature across the room but she had the vague feeling that too many people already stared at boony openly or covertly and she wasnt going to add to their rudeness a mintak shed heard about the isolated pockets of strange creatures that were scattered across the face of alanda but no one in her village had ever seen so much as an elven forester much less a mintak they were supposed to have bodies like huge humans but the heads of horses the brief glimpse shed gotten didnt make her think of a horse so much as a dog except that the teeth hadnt been the sharp pointed rending teeth of a canine but the flat teeth of an herbivore and the eyes had been set on the front of the head not the sides but the mintak loomed a good headandahalf above the bartender and that worthy was one of the tallest men rune had ever seen beth came bustling back with a bowl of stew a mug and a thick slice of bread covered in bacon drippings in one hand and a pitcher with water beading the sides in the other take this theres a good lad shed evidently decided that rune was terribly young too young and girlshy to be attracted and had taken a bigsisterly approach to dealing with her you get dry an look to run short you nod at me or onea th other girls ol mathe he dont like his musickers goin dry you heard him sayin that an he meant it she put the pitcher on the floor beside the stool shoved the rest into runes hands and scampered off with a squeal as one of the customers pinches got a little closer to certain portions of her anatomy than she liked she slapped the hand back and huffed away the customer started to rise to follow and boony stepped forward into the light now rune saw him clearly he wore a pair of breeches and a vest and nothing else he carried a cudgel and he was a uniform dark brown all over like a horse and he had the shaggy hair of a horse on his face and what could be seen of his body his eyes seemed small for his head he had pointed ears on the top of his head peeking up through longer darker hair than was on his face and that hair continued down the back of his neck like a mane he looked straight at the offending customer who immediately sat down again so boony kept the peace it looks like he does a good job rune mused but there was dinner waiting and beyond that a room full of people to entertain she wolfed down her food taking care not to get any grease on her fingers that might cause problems with the strings of her fiddle the sooner she started the sooner she could collect a few coins and hopefully tonight boonys services wouldnt be needed nothing cooled a crowd like a fight and nothing dried up money faster she put out her hat wedging it between her feet with one foot on the brim to keep it from being accidentally kicked out into the room and retuned lady rose cider or no with all these people and only herself to entertain them it was going to be a long night seventeen eighteen nineteen rune counted out the coins on the table under mathes careful eye thats the whole of it sir nineteen coppers the candle between them shone softly on the worn copper coins and mathe took a sip of his beer before replying not bad mathe said taking nine and leaving her ten scooping his coins off the table and into a little leather pouch in case ye were wonderin lad thats not at all bad for a night that aint a feast nor faireday harse don do much better nor that he set a bowl down in front of her and a plate and filled mug ye did well nough for another meal boy so eat whiles i have my beer an well talk this time the stew had meat in it and the bread had a thin slice of cheese on top getting an extra meal like that meant that shed done more than all right she could use it too she was starving the public house was very quiet beth and the other girls had gone off somewhere whether they had lodgings upstairs or elsewhere rune had no idea for theyd left while rune was packing up going out the back way through the kitchen presumably theyd gotten their meals from the leftovers on their way through boony slept upstairs she knew that for certain so did mathe and one of the cooks and all of the children who turned out to be his wife and offspring right now she was was thinking about how this would have meant a months take in faireseason at home she shook her head it seems like a lot she said tentatively but people keep telling me how much more expensive it is to live in the city mathe sipped his own beer it is and thisd keep ye for bout a day but its causea the rules the taxes an the priests he said ye gotta tithe ye gotta pay yer tax an ye gotta live where they say herelemme show ye he stretched out his finger and extracted two coppers and moving them to the side thats yer titheye gotta pay tithe an tax on what ye made bfore i took my share he moved two more thats yer tax now ye got six pence left rules say ye gotta live in resdential distrik less yer a relative or a special kinda hireling like the cooks an the kids and boony is musickers don count sotheres fourpence a day fer a place w decent folks in it where ye cn leave things an know they aint gonna make legs an walk while yere gone that leaves ye tuppence fer food rune blinked caught off guard by the way four pennies evaporatedclose to half her income for the day tax she said stupidly tithe fourpence goneand for what mathe shook his head church is the law round bout towns he told her a hint of scolding in his voice ye tithe lad an ye base it on what ye took in same fer taxes if ye don pay sooner r later they cotch up wi ye or sommut turns ye in an then they fine ye they fine ye ten times what they figger ye owe but how would they know what i owe them she asked still confused specially if i work the street they know bout what a musicker like you should make in a night barrin windfalls he replied twenny pence thats two fer church an two fer tax an if ye get them windfalls the lad as drops bita gold in yer hat an the like ye best rport em too could be sommut saw it go in yer hat ans gone t snitch on ye could be tis a priest in disguise belike testin ye this all seemed terribly sinister but what happens if i couldnt pay she asked i mean what if id been holding back for a year ten times tuppence timeshow many days in a year the figures made her head swim it was more than shed ever seen in her life except for the windfall of the silver and she panicked over that for a moment until she realized that no one knew about it but hernor ever would if she kept her mouth shut happened to a girla mine mathe said warningly she owed em fer bout three year back spent it all a course stupid cow couldnt pay she got indentured t pay the bill indentured there was that word again whats indentured mathe she asked worse than slavery boomed a voice over her head so that she jumped worse than being chattel ol boony hes got hard feelins bout bein indentured mathe offered as boony moved around to the other side of the table and sat down on the bench making it creak under his weight there are laws to keep a slave from being beaten boony rumbled there are laws saying he must be fed so much a day he must have decent clothing and shelter the church sees to these laws and fines the men who break them there are no such laws for the indentured the mintak nodded his massive head with each word now that he was so close he looked less animallike and morewell human wasnt the word but there was ready intelligence in his face he had expressions rune was able to read his face was flatter than a horses and his mouth and lips were mobile enough to form human speech without difficulty his hands only had three broad fingers though and the fingers had one less joint than a humans though the joints seemed much more flexible boony didn know bout tithin an taxes when he come here mathe said as boony took a turnip from the bowl at the end of the table and began stolidly chewing it he got indentured t pay em an hes right the way indenturin works is that ye work fer yer wage but yer wage goes first t yer master t pay off yer debt an there aint no law saying how much he cn take so long as he leaves ye a penny a day and a penny as she had just learned wouldnt go far in this city i was bought by a greedy man who used my strength in his warehouse took all and left me with nothing boony said he thought i was stupid a dark light in his eyes told her hed somehow managed to turn the tables on his greedy owner and was waiting for her to ask how hed done it what did you do she asked obediently boony chewed up the last of the turnip top and all confirming her notion that he was herbivorous he laughed a slow deep laugh that sounded like stones rolling down a hill i was so very stupid that i did not know my own strength the mintak said smiling i began to break things and when he ordered me beaten i would catch the hand of the overseer and ask him ever so mildly why he did this to me soon i was costing the scum much and there was no one in his employ willing to face me much less beat me thats when i bought im out mathe said ive had a mintak custmer or twain here an i knew th breed dye see he earned back is fine a long time agone but he reckoned on stayin wi me so weve got im listed as adopted sos he cn live here he and the mintak exchanged backslaps the mintak delivering one that looked like a flyswat and staggered his employer hell run th place fer the wife when im gone wont you old horse may god grant that never come to be the mintak said piously but admit ityou are the exception with indentures mathe shrugged sad but boonys got the right f it and member boyif ye get indentured the law says ye work at whatever yer bondholder says ye do that means f he runs a boybrothel which is where amany young men and women go boony rumbled into shame the law says nothing about that nor the church mathe made a shushing motion best not t get inta that best t jest finish warnin the youngun here he took another pull on his beer and boony chomped up a couple of carrots and a head of lettuce jaws moving stolidly she took the opportunity to finish her food all right mathe said after a moment of silence tonight ye sleep on that straw mat by th firewhichs what payin customersd get if i took anyan in the mornin i feeds ye an yer on yer way now ye know where ye go first to get a permit she ventured he shook his head not less ye got a silver penny on ye thats th cost f a streetbuskin permit no ye go straight t churchbox on tend a this

an yell have nough for tithe an tax from tday this is the one time you may safely skim a little to pay for the permit in all the time you may be here the mintak rumbled they will not expect you to play enough to earn double wages she nodded but she began then hesitated so mathe said as his wife shooed her children up the stairs behind them to their living quarters don be t long eh sweeting she called boys a goodun but ye both needs sleep mathe waved at her his eyes fixed on rune she dropped her eyes to her hands what ireally came here for to nolton i mean was lessons iwant to join the guild i told you boony said booming with satisfaction did i not tell you he knew more than to be simple busker ye did ye did i heerd ye mathe replied ye won yer bet old horse now boy lemmee think he rubbed his bare chin and pursed his lips theres places t get secondhand instruments an places t get lessons sometimes they be th same place tell ye what i gi ye a map i th mornin tell ye what else sommut em gonna know where theres places lookin fer musickers if ye got a place ye don need no permitor ye can git one an play double by day fer pennies i th street an by night fer yer keep rune could hardly restrain herself this was far more than shed expected in the way of help i dont know how to thank you sir she said awkwardly i mean hush mathe said thank yon beth an boony twas she brought ye back twas he tol me id best sit ye down an splain how things is round here afore ye got yersel in a mess ive already thanked beth sir she said truthfully for shed asked the girl what her favorite tunes were and had played them all it was kindness to take me back to you and not show me the street well she said ye had th looka sommut that knew his way about an inn mathe replied blushing a little i figgered if ye did ye knew what t play t please m custom an ye did sold a good bita beer tnight ye done good by me im glad she replied sincerely and thank you sir she said turning to boony although im sure i know your reasonsthat you didnt want to see a weaker creature put in the same position youd been in ive heard many good things about the mintak i will be glad to say in the future that they are all true boony laughed out loud and i will say that it is true that bards have silver tongues and the gift of making magic with word and song he replied for i am sure you will be a bard one day it pleases me to have saved a future bard from an unpleasant fate and now he looked significantly at mathe the man laughed all right old horse its off t bed for all of us or mwife ll have boony carry me up gnight young rune he and boony clumped up the stairs taking the candle but leaving the fire lit so she could see to spread her blankets out on the sack of clean straw theyd given her to sleep on she had thought that shed be too excited to sleep but she was wrong she was asleep as soon as shed found a comfortable position on the straw sack and she slept deeply and dreamlessly chapter six breakfast dished up by mathes wife after the morning cleaning crew rousted her out of her bed was not bread and drippings nor leftover stew it was oatporridge with honey and a big mug of fresh milk when rune looked at her with a lifted eyebrow she shrugged and cast a halfscornful look at mathes back tis what my younglings get she said ye need a healthy morning meal ye do and i told mathe i did that youre not much bigger nor they bread and drippings indeed for a growing boy yed think the man had no childer of his own and she sniffed with disdain rune knew when to leave well enough alone and she finished the porridge with appreciation she gathered up her things slung her pack and lady rose over her back and headed for the outer door she found the owner there as if he was waiting for her and somehow she wasnt surprised when mathe slipped a packet into her hand as she bade him farewell the cooks from last night were already hard at work in the kitchen the servingboys were scrubbing down tables benches and floor while the girls swept the fireplaces and cleaned beer mugs mathe took her outside and stood on the doorsill closing the door behind them the street before them had a few carts on it but not many by the angle of the sunlight it was about an hour past dawn in the country folks would already be out in their fields working here in the city it seemed that most people werent even awake yet since rune had always preferred lying late abed she had the feeling she was going to like being a city person ye go straight down this street east mathe said waving his hand down the quiet sunlit lane dustmotes danced in the shaft of light that ran between the overhanging buildings at second crossing there be a little black stall that be churchbox there be priest inside ye gi him yer tithe an tax an make sure ye gi him separate elsewise hell write all fourpence down as tithe an leave ye owin fourpence tax and i wonder how many people thats happened to i bet the church wouldnt give it back either even if you could get them to admit that a mistake was made she nodded slipping the packet into the pocket in her vest it felt like bread maybe even bread and cheese that would be welcome in a few hours it meant something more she wouldnt have to buy and courtesy of mathes wife too she had no doubt that was a good woman and very like rose mathe continued with his directions and instructions now then ye go cross street there be couple stalls sells vittles play there theres always a crowd thereye got the people as come t pay tax an tithe ye got people as wants a bit teat its a bit too noisy fer a singer but yell do fine nobody got that as set yet that i heerd of heres bita map he handed her a folded paper and watched as she unfolded it the maze of lines was incomprehensible at first until she resolved it into streets and even found the one the public house stood on the gate shed come in by and the street she had followed see this here thiss where we be these little red dots thas somea them teachers an instrment makers see if any on emll do ye he nodded as she folded it up and stowed it in her beltpouch where the ten pennies from her evenings labor chinked now if i was in yer shoes id play till after nuncheon thas midmeal when people stop buyin things at stall an then id go look up somea them teachers and the like but thas me think yell do youve done more for me than i ever hoped sir she replied honestly i cant begin to thank you and i dont know why youve done it either im glad you did but i wish i knew why he flushed a little with embarrassment ah musickers done me a good turn or twain figger this helps pay back when i was jest startin this place musickers came round t play jest fer the setout till i could afford t feed em then i got my reglar man an he baint failed me soi gi ye a hand ye gi sommut else one f its needed someone inside called him urgently and he turned cant be away a breath an they need me god be wi ye youngling watch yerself and he dashed back inside shouting all right all right im gettin there fast as i can rune headed up the street in the same direction mathe had pointed it was considerably quieter in the early hours of the morning shops were just opening merchants taking down massive wooden shutters and laying displays in the windows behind thinner wooden grates to foil theft the shops here seemed to tend to clothing materials or clothing readymade she passed a shop full of stockings hats and gloves a shoemaker and several shops that appeared to be dressmakers and tailors the crowned corn seemed to be the only inn or public house on this street although there were vendors of foodstuffs already out with their trays about their necks they werent crying their wares though the streets werent so full that customers couldnt see them they ignored rune for the most part as being unlikely to have enough spare coin to buy their goods a cart passed and rune noticed another odd contrivance just under the horses clubbed tail this was a kind of scoop rigged to the cart that caught any droppings a good notion given the number of animals here that would mean only those carts without the scoop and horses being ridden would be leaving refuse the city while not exactly sweetsmelling would be a lot worse without the care taken to keep it clean the merchants were doing their part too there were folks out scrubbing their doorsteps and the street immediately in front of the shop right up to the gutterline how the folk back in the village would stare not even the late rose was that fanatical about cleanliness on the other hand there werent that many people in the village with all these people all these animals there would have to be extra precautions against the illnesses that came from dirt and contaminated water the little black stall that mathe had called the churchbox was plainly visible as soon as she crossed the first street it had an awning above it supported by carved wooden angels instead of simple props and without a doubt the awning was decorated with painted saints distributing alms to remind the pious and impious alike where their tithes were going in all probability the stall was the last business to close at night and the first to open in the morning the church never lost an opportunity to take gifts from her children there was a grillcovered window in the front of the stall and beneath it a slot behind the window sat a bored young novicepriest in his plain black robes yawning and making no attempt to cover his indifference to his surroundings he blinked at her without interest and reached for a pen when he saw she was going to stop and give him something to do or rather force him to do something name he mumbled she gave it likewise her occupation and that she was beginning her second day in nolton he noted all of it down and warned her in a perfunctory manner that she would have to purchase her permit to busk before the fourth day from him of course and that it would be a silver penny he did not issue any of the warnings mathe had about what it would mean if she neglected to do so heres my twopence tithe for yesterday sir she said pushing the pennies across the counter to him through the slit he took it with a slightly wrinkled nose as if in disdain for the tiny amount but he took it nevertheless she noted that he seemed wellfed very wellfed in fact roundcheeked and healthier than most his hands were soft and white where the ink of his occupation hadnt stained them he dropped the two coins into something beneath the counter just out of sight and made a notation after her name and heres my twopence tax she said shoving those coins across when she knew hed made his first notation and couldnt change it he frowned at her as he took the two coins you could have given it to me all at once he grumbled making a second notation she blinked and contrived to look stupid and he muttered something under his breath about fools and music and waved her off she turned away from the window well that was that fourpence lighter and nothing to show for it could have been worse she supposed if she hadnt been warned sooner or later the church would have caught up with her boonys description of his treatment as a bondservant hadnt been inviting although the idea of seeing a bondholders face when he realized that the boy hed thought hed bought off was a girl was amusing she didnt care to think about what would have followed that discovery probably something very unpleasant across the street were the two foodstalls mathe had described for her with a bit of space in between for a tall counter where folk could eat standing up one was redpainted and one was blue she crossed the street under the disdainful gaze of the novicepriest and approached the first stallholder would you mind if i put out my hat here sir she asked politely of the thin fellow frying sausage rolls in deep skillets of lard he glanced up at her and shook his head so long as ye don drive th custom away tis nobbut t me he replied absently encouraged she repeated her question at the second stall which sold drink and got the same answer so she found a place where she wasnt going to be in the way of people buying or eating and set her hat at her feet with her pack to hold it down she took the fiddle from her carrying bag gave lady rose a quick tuning and began playing choosing a simple jig bright and lively although she quickly attracted a small crowd they were mostly children and people who didnt look to have much more money than she still they enjoyed her music and one or two even bought something at the stalls on either side of her so she was accomplishing that much and as long as her listeners bought something she wasnt likely to be chased away by noon bell shed acquired a grand total of three pennies a marble dropped in by a solemnfaced child a little bag of barleysugar candy added by a young girl a bit of yellow ribbon and at least a dozen pins shed never collected pins before but any contribution was better than nothing once shed straightened and cleaned them pins were worth a penny the dozen so that wasnt so bad really the bad part was that shed fiddled most of the morning and not even gained half what shed gotten in the public house last night she was a long way from the silver penny that permit would cost her she took a moment for a breather to look over the traffic on the street early days yet she told herself as the crowds thickened the street filling with folk looking for a bit to eat the first noon bell seemed to signal a common hour for nuncheon which the people back home called midmeal she took her eyes off her hat and fixed them on the faces about her smiling as if she hadnt a care in the world when youre fiddling think about music raven had admonished her dont think about your dinner or where youre going to sleep tonight tell yourself youre happy and put that happiness into the way youre playing make people feel that happiness the faces of those about her changed as they got within earshot of the fiddle they generally looked surprised first then intrigued their eyes searched the edge of the crowd for the source of the music then when they found it a smile would creep onto their lips and most times theyd stop for a moment to listen she found herself looking for those smiles trying to coax them onto otherwise sour faces playing light cheerful tunes tunes meant to set feet tapping her efforts began to pay off now that she was looking to those smiles for her reward and not the money in the hat a couple of children broke into an impromptu jig at her feet once and a young couple with the look of the infatuated did an entire danceset beside her until the glare and a word from a passing priest sent them laughing away she played a mocking run on her fiddle to follow the fat bitter man and thought then how odd it was that the church seemed to frown upon everything that was less than serious but frivolity puts no coins in their coffers she reminded herselfand realized that the crowds had thinned again the second noonbell had rung and the stallkeepers on either side of her were cleaning their counters instead of cooking or serving customers she finished the piece then looked down at her hat and saw that the three pennies had multiplied to nine there was a second bag of sweets beside the first and a veritable rain of pins covered the bottom of the hat eh lad said the second stallkeeper leaning out to examine the contents of her hat with interest f ye got no plans fer them pins i trade em fer ye fifteen pins fer a muga cider an don matter what shape they be in ill swap wife cn allus use pins same here said the sausageroll vendor fifteen pins fer a roll well that would take care of her nuncheon with nothing out of her pocket and shed be saved the trouble of straightening the pins herself and dealing with them she hadnt a paper to stick them in and she didnt relish the idea of lining them up in rows on her hat shed probably forget they were there and put her hand on them done to both of you she replied and grateful too good enough said the sausage vendor and when a count proved her to have fortythree offered her two rolls for what was left when she got her cider she stowed the rest of her take in her pouch and pack put away lady rose drank her cider and considered what to do with the rest of her day devouring her rolls while she thought it really wasnt worth playing her fingers off for only three pennies not when she needed to find a place to live a teacher and a second instrument in that order so with a wave of farewell to the two vendors she packed herself up and took out her map after a few times of getting turned around she learned the trick of following it it was too bad that none of the places mathe had marked were terribly nearby but there were three that were kind of in a row and she headed in their direction the first shop was in the middle of a neighborhood where her shabby clothing drew dubious looks nearly everyone she saw on the street wore clothing like the wealthier farmers sons and daughters wore to church services back home one look in the shop window convinced her that this was no place for her the instruments hung on the wall were polished and ornamented with carving and inlay work they might well be secondhand but they were still beyond her reach and so likely was the teaching to be had the second place was much like the first and she caught sight of some of the students waiting their turns they were very well dressed hardly a patch or a darn or letdown hem to be seen and most of them were much younger than she from the bored expressions they wore she had the notion that the only reason they were taking music lessons at all was because it was genteel to do so she left the brightly painted shops behind passed through a street of nothing but wroughtiron gates set into brick walls a story tall gates giving onto small luxurious gardens the gardens were beautiful but she didnt linger to admire them some of those gates had men in livery behind them and those men wore weapons openly no point in giving them a reason to think she was here by anything other than accident that street became a street of shops food shops this time vegetables fruit wooden replicas of meat and fish and poultry all displayed enticingly inside open windows with the real meat and dairy products lying on counters inside or hanging from the rafters and hooks on the walls here the clothing of the folk in the street had a kind of uniform feel to it all sober colors with white aprons and caps or dark hats servants she decided sent from those houses behind her to buy the goods for dinner how strange to have a servant to send outwhat a thought to wait doing whatever it was that rich folk did until dinner appeared like magic without ever having to raise a finger to make it all happen and then to go up to a room and find a bath hot and waiting and a bed warmed and readya book perhaps beside it and in the morning to find clean clothing set out breakfast prepared she daydreamed about this as she wormed her way down street after street each one getting progressively narrower and gradually shabbier finally she found herself on a street much too narrow for a cart unless it was one of the dog carts a street that even a ridden horse would probably find uncomfortably confining there was only one shop in the street that had three instruments hanging in the window although it had other things there as well cheap copper jewelry religious statues cards of lace and tarnished trim that showed bits of thread on the edge where it had been picked off a garment knives and a sword a tarnished silver christeninggoblet a small sign in the window said we buy and sell and loans made another sign beneath it showed two pairs of hands one offering a knife the other a silver coin a third smaller sign said music lessons she looked back up at the instruments a lute a harp and a guitar they were old plain but wellcaredfor there wasnt a speck of dust on them anywhere the strings looked a little loose which meant they werent kept tunedsomething that would warp an instruments neck if it wasnt taken down and played often whoever had hung them there knew what he was doing the street itself was quiet one of those residential areas mathe had spoken of there was another foodshop on the corner but otherwise this seemed to be the only store in this block of buildings the rest were all wooden twostoried with slate roofs they had single doors and a window on either side of the door with more windows in the overhanging second story a rat might have been able to scurry in the spaces between them but nothing larger the buildings themselves were old in need of a new coat of paint and leaned a little they reminded rune of a group of old granddams and grandsires shabby worn but always thinking of the days when they had been young instruments and lessonsand a place where she might find somewhere to live this was the most promising area at least insofar as her purse was concerned that she had encountered yet she opened the door and went inside the interior of the shop was darker than the public house had been and smelled of mildew and dust when she closed the door behind her a bell jangled over it and a voice from the back of the store said be patient a moment please im up on a ladder the voice matched the store a little tired old but with a hint that it had been richer long ago rune waited letting her eyes adjust to the darkness of the shop the place was crowded with all sorts of oddments even more so than the tiny window behind and in front of her were floortoceiling shelves on them were books stuffed animals neatly folded clothing statues of all sorts not just religious one or two of which made her avert her eyes in flushed embarrassment there were dusty crystals strange implements of glass and metal lanterns and cutlery all of it was used much of it was old and some of it looked as if it had sat there for centuries every object had a little paper tag on it she couldnt imagine why suspended from the rafters were cloaks and coats each with mothbane festooning the hems the shop itself was barely large enough for rune the shelves and the tiny counter at the rear of the shop after a moment an old man dressed in a dustcolored shirt and breeches pushed aside the curtain behind the counter and peered at her then shook his gray shaggy head im sorry lad he said regretfully im not buying today and im not selling sir she interrupted approaching the counter so he could get a better look at her he blinked looked again and chuckled a rich humorfilled sound that made her want to like him he reminded her of raven a little and a little of that guild minstrel and youre no lad either forgive me lass what can i do for you a little surprised since no one else had seen her true sex through her purposefully sexless clothing she took another step forward my name is rune im a player sir she said hesitantly i was told that i could find an instrument and lessons here thats true the old man said his sharp black eyes watching her so closely she felt as if her skin were off you can as you know if you saw the signs in the windows but theres more to it than thatthe things that brought you to this shop in this city now i like a good tale as well as any man and its late and near time to close up if youd care to share a cup of tea with meand tell me your tale part of her said not to trust this manhere he was a stranger and offering to share his hospitality with another stranger but the rest of her thoughtwhat could he possibly do to her he was old he moved slowly he couldnt possibly outwrestle her in a bad situation where was the harm in indulging him and there was more of ravens advice if you find yourself with someone who cares for his instruments no matter how old or how plainor even how cheapyou can trust him hes a man who knows that all value isnt on the surface and he may have some of that hidden value himself id like that sir she said finally but he had already raised his tiny counter on the hinges at one side and was motioning her through as if he had never expected she would do anything other than accept she pushed the curtains aside hesitantly and found herself in another narrow room with a staircase at the farther end leading up to a loft this room was just as crowded as the shop there was a stove with a tiny fire in it with a kettle atop a brokendown bed that seemed to be in use as seating since it was covered with wornout cushions in a rainbow of faded materials there seemed to be more furniture up in the loft but the shadows up there were so thick that it was hard to see besides the bed there was a basin and ewer on a stand a couple of tables piled with books two chairs and a kitchencupboard next to the stove everything stood within inches of the furniture beside it there wasnt any possible way one more piece of furniture could have been crammed in here rune took a seat on one of the chairs placing her pack and lady rose at her feet the only light came from a window at the rear of the room below the loft covered in oiled paper and from a lantern on the table beside her there was a thump as of heavy shutters closing the doorbell jangled and then a scraping sound of wood on wood came to her ears as the old man pushed the bar into place across his shutters a moment later he pushed aside the curtains and limped into the room instead of speaking he went straight to the stove at the rear and took a kettle off the top pouring hot water into a cracked teapot that was missing its lid and stood on the shelf of the kitchencupboard beside him he brought the pot and a pair of mugs with him on a tarnished tray which he sat down on the table beside her next to the lamp pushing the books onto the floor to make room for the tray now he said taking the other chair my names tonno yours you said is rune as i believe while we wait for the herbs to steep why dont you tell me about yourself youre obviously not from nolton and your accent sounds as if youre fromhmmbeeford or thereabouts she nodded startled he chuckled and smiled a smile that turned his face into a spiderweb of tiny lines yet made him look immensely cheerful so how is it that a young lady like you finds herself so far from home and alone she found herself telling him everything for somehow his questions coaxed it all out of her from the bare facts to how she had managed to come here to her desire for a place in the guild as the light beyond the oiled paper dimmed and her confidence in him grew she even told him about the ghost and her secret hoard of coins somehow she felt she could trust him even with that and he wouldnt betray her trust he pursed his lips over that have you told anyone else about this he asked sternly she shook her head good dont the church would either take a lions share or confiscate it all as coming from demons ill give you a choice either you can keep them hidden and safe or you can give them to me and ill provide you with that instrument you want and a years worth of lessonsand give you whatevers left over but ill have it all changed into smaller coins smaller coins wont call attention to you the way silver would i can probably manage that just on what ive saved she thought about that thought about how easy it would be for the money to just trickle away without her ever getting the lessons or the instrument if she paid him now this wont be just lessons in learning tunes mind tonno said abruptly ill teach you reading music and writing ityoull have the freedom to read any book in this shop and ill expect you to read one a week im a hard teacher but a fair one she nodded this was more than she had expected can you play me a tune on that little fiddle of yours he askedand once again rune took her lady from her case and tuned her this time with carefor tonno was a fellow musician and she wanted to give him her very best she played him three pieces a love song a jig and one of the strange gypsy tunes that nightingale had taught her the last seemed to fill the shadows of the room with life and turn them into things not properly of the waking world it wasnt frightening but it was certainly uncanny she finished it with gooseflesh crawling up her arms despite the fact that she had played the tune herself when shed finished tonno sighed and his eyes were a little melancholy ill tell you something else the old man said slowly and im not ashamed to admit it not after listening to you im no better than a talented amateur i knew better than to try and make a living at music but i promise you that i know how to play every instrument in this shop and im quite good enough to give you basic lessons and believe me child if youve learned this much on your own basic lessons in a new instrument the ways of reading and writing the tunes you surely have in your head and all the education youll get from reading whatever you can get your hands on for the next year will be all that you need he shook his head again after that youll need more expert help than that and i can probably find someone to give it to you but i dont think that youll need it for at least a year and tell the truth i wonder if some people who heard you now might not hold you back out of jealousy to keep you from outstripping them when you get beyond me i can send you out to others for special lessons but until then she let out the breath shed been holding in a sigh can we chose an instrument now sir she asked id like to make this a firm bargain they picked out a delicate little lute for her she fell in love with its tone and decided against the harp that tonno thought might suit her voice better besides the lute only had four strings it would be easier to tune and keep tuned in the uncertain climes a traveling musician was likely to encounter they agreed on a price for it and the year of lessons and rune retired behind a screen to take off her belt of silver coins she knew she had spent a lot getting to nolton even augmenting her cash with playing on the road the coins had been spent a lot faster than shed liked there was some left when they got through reckoning up how much three hours of lessons every day for a year would cost not much but some she could go ahead and buy her permit and she would have a hedge against a lean spell when the commercial exchange had been accomplished an awkward silence sprang up between them she coughed a little and bit her lip wondering what to say next i probably should go she said finally its getting darker and ive taken up too much of your time as it is ill come about the same time tomorrow for my first lesson now what are your plans he asked interrupting her never mind what youre going to do tomorrow what are you planning on doing tonight you dont know the cityyou could get yourself in a bad area wandering about i need a place to live she said now uncertain daylight was long spent and she wasnt certain if those who took in lodgers would open their doors to a stranger after dark what about a place to earn your keep he asked or part of it anywayiknow someone looking for a musician she could offer you a good room in exchange for playing part of the night possibly even a meal as well there was something about his manner that made her think there was a great deal more about the place than he was telling her and she said as much he nodded reluctantly its a public housea real one but a small one in part andwell the rest id rather amber told you herself if you want to go talk to her tonnos diffident manner convinced her that there was something odd going on but she couldnt put her finger on what it was she frowned a little he shrugged helplessly its only a few blocks away he said and its in the area where there are a lot ofplaces of entertainment if you dont like amber or she doesnt like you you can try somewhere else that area is safe enough you could even busk on the streetcorner and buy yourself a room when you have the two pence he smiled apologetically i often go there for my dinner i would be happy to walk you there and introduce you to amber she thought about it thought about it a long time in the end what decided her was tonnos expression it wasnt that of a man who was planning anything or even that of a man who was trying to keep his plans hidden it was the anxious look of someone who has a friend of dubious character that he likes very muchand wants his new friend to like as well rune was well enough acquainted with the way the world wagged to guess what tonnos friend amber was a public houseof sorts hmm a small one that might be what it was belowstairs but above amber probably has pretty girls who serve more than just beer and wine id reckon on the other hand it couldnt hurt to go look people who came to a whorehouse had money and were ready to spend it they might be willing to toss a little of it in the direction of a player as long as amber knew she was paying for the music and not the musician besides if there was one thing the church priests preached against it was the sins of the flesh it would ease the burden of having to pay the priests their damned tithe knowing that the money came from something they so violently disapproved of all right she said standing up and catching tonno by surprise ill see this friend of yours lets go and i can always say no once ive met her chapter seven in the streets of nolton darkness was total and at first the only light they had to show them their footing were the torches at the crossroads and the occasional candle or rushlight in a window at street level tonno kept a brisk pace for such an old man rune had to admire him it helped that he knew the way of course and she didnt he kept pointing out landmarks as they passeda building that dated back several hundred years a place where some significant event in the history of the city had occurred or the site of someones birth or death she would strain her eyes and still see only one more shapeless bulk of a building with a furtive light or two in the windows finally she gave up trying to see anything she just nodded foolish since he wouldnt be able to see the nod and made an appreciative grunt or a brief comment the street tonno led her to was not one she would have found on her own it was reached only by passing through several other side streets and the street itself was about a dozen houses long and came to a dead end culminating in a little circle with an ornamental fountain in the center of it it was however very well lit surprisingly so after the darkness of the streets around it torches outside every door and lanterns hanging in the windows of the first and second stories saw to that there was an entire group of musicians and a dancer busking beside the fountain and from the look of the money theyd collected on the little carpet in front of the drummer the pickings were pretty good here the fountain wasnt one of the noisy variety it would be easy enough even for a single singer to be heard over it a good place to put out a hat it would seem the musicians looked familiar in the generic sense finally she realized that they were dressed in the same gaudy fashion as the gypsies the harpist nightingale traveled with if this amber didnt prove out perhaps shed see if theyd let her join them they didnt have a fiddler and they might recognize nightingales name or description and be willing to let her join them on the basis of a shared acquaintance most of the places on the circle itself were large with three stories and lights in every window sometimes strings of lanterns festooning the balconies on the second and third stories as if it were a festival there were people coming and going from them in a steady stream men mostly and mostly welldressed whenever a door opened rune heard laughter and music for a moment mingling with the music of the quartet by the fountain there were women leaning over the balconies and out of the windows most disheveled most wearing only the briefest of clothing tightlaced bodices and sleeveless undershifts that fluttered like the drapes of the ghost she shivered for a moment with a chill then resolutely put the memory out of her mind there was no ghost hereand anyway hed favored her he hadnt harmed her sheer luck whispered the voice of caution she turned her attention stubbornly to her surroundings here was warmth and light and laughter however artificial there were no ghosts here all of the women she had to admit were very attractiveat least from this distance they flirted with fans combed their hair with languid fingers or sometimes called out to the men below with ribald jokes shed have to be a simpleton not to recognize what kind of a district this was it might even be the same street mathe had mentioned as a good place to busk at night her guise of a boy would probably keep her safely unmolested hereshed seen no signs that these brothels catered to those whose tastes ran to anything other than women but tonno took her to a tiny place just two stories tall tucked in beneath the wings of the biggest building on the circle there were lights in the windows but no women hanging out of them and no balcony at all much less one festooned with willing ladies the sign above the door said only ambers and when tonno opened the door there was no rush of light and sound he invited rune in with a wave of his hand and she preceded him inside while he shut the door behind them the very first thing she noticed were the lanterns there was one on every tableand every table seemed to have at least one customer so whatever this place was or did it wasnt suffering from lack of business the common room was half the size of the bears but the difference was in more than size here there were no backless benches no trestle tables each square table was made of some kind of dark wood and surrounding it were padded chairs and there were padded booths with tables in them along the walls the customers were eating real meals from real plates with pewter mugs and forks to match and the whiff rune got of beefgravy and savory was enough to make her stomach growl she told it sternly to be quiet promising it the bread and cheese still tucked into her pack no matter what came of this meeting she had a meal and the price of a room on herand tomorrow would be another day to try her luck shed certainly been lucky today so far it was enough to make her believe in guardian spirits across the room a woman presiding over a small desk beside a staircase saw them smiled and rose to greet them she was middleaged probably a little older than stara and rune couldnt help thinking that this was what stara was trying to achieve with her paints and her lowcut bodices and failing her tumbling russet curls were bound back in a style that looked careless and probably took half an hour to achieve her heartshaped face with a wide generous mouth and huge eyes seemed utterly agelessbut content with whatever age it happened to be rather than being the face of a woman trying to hold off the years at any cost the coloring of her complexion was so carelessly perfect that if rune hadnt been looking for the signs and seen the artfully painted shadows on lids and the perfect rose of the cheeks shed never have guessed the woman used cosmetics her dress of a warm rich brown was of modest cutbut clung to her figure as if it had been molded to it before falling in graceful folds to the floor any woman presented with stara and this woman amber when asked to pick out the trollop would point without hesitation to stara ignoring the other entirely and rune sensed instinctively that any man when asked which was the youngest most nubile attractive would select amber every time the first impression of amber was of generosity and happiness the first impression of stara was of discontent petulance and bitterness she found herself smiling in spite of herself and in spite of her determination not to let herself be charmed into something she would regret later tonno amber said holding out both hands to him as if he was the most important person in the world he clasped them both with a pleased smile on his lips and she held them tightly i had given up on seeing you tonight i am so pleased you decided to come after all and who is this young lad she turned an inquiring smile on rune that would likely have dazzled any real lad and yet was entirely free of artifice it didnt seem designed to dazzle rather that the ability to dazzle was simply a part of ambers personality amber this lass is my new pupil rune and i hope is the musician youve been asking me to find tonno beamed at both of them but the smile that he turned to rune held a hint of desperation in it as if he was begging rune to like this woman well see how she reacts to being told im a girl firstif all shes interested in is what she can get out of someone and she knows that as a woman im not as likely to be manipulated a lass ambers smile didnt lose a bit of its brightness in fact if anything it warmed a trifle forgive me runei hope youll take my mistake as a compliment to your disguise it really is very effective was this a way to avoid trouble in public if it is i think you chose very well rune found herself blushing it seemed the safest way to travel she temporized i never wore skirts except when i planned to stay at a hostel clever amber replied with approval very clever now what was this about your being a musician i take it you have no place yet tonno i thought you said she was your student she interrupted herself with a shake of her head never mind lets discuss all this over food and drink shall we rune glanced sideways at the customer nearest her she knew what she could affordand she didnt think that this place served meals for a penny she thought shed been fairly unobtrusive but amber obviously caught that quick sideways glance and had guessed what it meantthough that could have been intuited from the threadbare state of runes wardrobe business before pleasure might be better perhaps if youd feel more comfortable about it we can discuss this now in my office and tonno can take his usual table would that be more to your liking rune nodded and amber left her for a moment escorting tonno to a small table near the door then returning with a faint swish of skirts rune sighed a little with envy the woman moved so gracefully she turned the mere act of walking into a dance come into my office will you she said and signaled to one of the serving girls to take care of tonnos table obediently rune followed her feeling like an awkward little donkey loaded down with packs carrying as she was her worldly goods and the fiddle and lute cases the office was just inside the door to the staircase and held only a desk and two chairs amber took the first and rune the other for the second time that day dropping her packs down beside her amber studied her for a moment but there was lively interest in the womans eyes as if she found rune quite intriguing tonno is a very good friend and has advised me on any number of things to my profit she said at last hes very seldom wrong about anything and about music never so perhaps you can explain how you can be both his student and the musician ive needed here im selftaught milady rune replied with care last night my first in the city the owner of the crowned corn said i was good enough to expect the same profit as anyone else who isnt a guild musician but thats on the fiddleand i cant read nor write music cant read much better than to puzzle out a few things in the holy book so thats how im tonnos student you seeon the lute and with things thatll make me ready for the guild trials amber nodded her lips pursed so youve ambitions then i cant blame you the life of a common minstrel is not an easy one and the life of a guild musician is comfortable and assured rune shrugged there was more to it than that much more but perhaps amber wouldnt understand the other desires that fired herthe need to find the company of others like herself the thirst to learn more much more about the power she sensed in musicand most especially the drive to leave something of herself in the world if only one song as she knew the names of the bards who had composed nearly every song in her repertory except the gypsy ballads so she wanted to know that in some faroff day some other young musician would learn a piece of hers and find it worth repeating perhaps evenfind it beautiful no shed never understand that i will be willing to take tonnos assessment of your ability as a given this is what i can offer a room and one meal a day of your choice this is what your duty would be to play here in the common room from sundown until midnight bell i should warn you that you can expect little in the way of tips here as you have probably guessed already this is not an inn as such its apleasurehouse isnt it she had to think for a moment before she could come up with a phrase that wouldnt offend amber nodded yes it isand although many clients come here only for the food the food is not where the profit is it is merely a sideline it serves to attract customers to give them something to do while they wait their turn your capacity would be exactly the same you would not be expected to serve abovestairs is that clear the relief must have been so obvious in spite of runes effort not to show it that amber laughed my dear runeyou are a very pleasant girl but a girl is all you are no matter how talented you might be in other areas this house serves a very specific set of clients by appointment only and let me tell you that the four young ladies entertaining above are quite a peg beyond being either girls or merely pleasant beside them i am a withered old hag indeed and their talents and skills far outstrip mine irrationally rune felt a little put out at being called a pleasant young girlbut good sense got the better of her and she contemplated the offer seriously for the first time since tonno had brought the possibility up this meant one sure meal a day a particularly good meal at that and a room she need only play until midnight bell she would have the morning and noon and part of the afternoon to busk before her lessons with tonno not a bad arrangement really it would let her save a few pennies and in the winter when it was too cold to busk she could stay inside in a building that would by necessity be warmly heated still this was a whorehouse there were certain assumptions that would be made by the clients no matter what amber claimed if amber wanted her to dress as a female there could be trouble no one will bother you amber said firmly answering the unspoken question if you like you can keep to that boys garb youve taken although i would prefer it if you could obtain something a little lessworn rune looked down reflexively at her nocolor shirt graybrown vest and muchpatched breeches all of which had been slept in for the past three days and flushed tonno can help you find something appropriate im sure amber continued with a dimpling smile i swear i think the man knows where every secondhand vendor in the city is as for the clients and your own safetyi have two serving girls and two serving boys belowstairs you may ask them if they have ever been troubled by the clients the ladies do not serve meals the belowstairs folk do not serve the clients everyone who comes here knows that rune licked her dry lips took a deep breath and nodded id like to try it then lady amber good amber nodded then lets make your meal for the day a bit of dinner with tonno and we can call tonights effort your tryout if you suit us then you have a place if notill let you have the room for the rest of the night and then well see you on your way in the morning a short trialperiod as these things went and on generous terms but she had nothing to lose and if nothing else shed gain a dinner and a place to sleep for the night she followed amber back out into the common room where she sat at tonnos table ate one of the best beef dinners she had ever had in her life and listened while amber and tonno talked of books the only time shed ever eaten better was when the sire had sent a bullock to the village to supply a feast in celebration of his own wedding and rune had quite by accident she was sure been given a slice of the tenderloin the beef shed normally eaten was generally old tough and stewed or in soup during that time she saw several men leave by the stairs and several more ascend when summoned by a little old man so bent and wizened he seemed to be a thousand years old they were all dressed well if quietly but for the rest they seemed to fit to no particular mold as soon as shed finished she excused herself and returned to ambers office for lady rose figuring that the office was the safest place to leave her gear for the moment fiddle in hand she came back to the table and waited for a break in the conversation lady amber if you please where would you like me to sit and what would you prefer i played she asked when amber made a point that caused tonno to turn up his hands and acknowledge defeat in whatever they were discussing they both turned to her as if they had forgotten she was there tonno smiled to see her ready to play and amber nodded a little in approval ambers brows creased for a moment i thinkover there by the fireplace if you would rune she said after a moment of glancing around the room for the best place and i would prefer no dance tunes and no heartrending laments anything else would be perfectly suitable try to be unobtrusive she smiled mischievously seduce them with your music instead of seizing them if you will i would like the clients relaxed and in a good mood sometimes they get impatient when they are waiting and if you can make the wait enjoyable instead of tedious that would be perfect rune made her way around the edge of the room avoiding the occupied tables a little conscious of ambers assessing eyes and tonnos anxious ones that was an interesting choice of music for normally innkeepers wanted something lively to heat the blood and make people drink faster evidently the inn was not in the business of selling liquor either it must be as amber had said that their primary income came from the rooms above rune would have thought though that an intoxicated client would be easier to handle on the other hand maybe you wouldnt want the clients drunk they might be belligerent might cause trouble or start fights if they thought theyd waited longer than they should somust be that im supposed to keep em soothed soothing it is she found a comfortable place to sit in the chimneycorner on a little padded bench beside the dark fireplace she set her bow to her strings and began to play an old old love song this was a very different sort of playing from everything shed done in inns up to this moment there she had been striving to be the center of attention here she was supposed to be invisible after a moment she began to enjoy it it was a nice change she played things she hadnt had a chance to play in a while all the romantic pieces that she normally saved for the odd wedding or two shed performed at keeping the volume low just loud enough to be heard without calling attention to the fact that there was a musician present she watched her audience for a while until she became more interested in what she was playing than the silent faces at the tables the servinggirls and men gave her an appreciative smile as they passed but that was all the reward she got for her efforts it was as if the men out there actually took her playing for granted then it dawned on her that this was exactly the case these were all men of some means and no doubt many of them had household musicians from the bardic guild whose only duty was to entertain and fill the long hours of the evening with melody that was why amber had warned her she should expect little in the way of remuneration men like these didnt toss coins into a minstrels hatthey fed him clothed him housed him saw to his every need and on occasion when he had performed beyond expectation or when they were feeling generous they rewarded him but that only happened on great occasions and in front of others so that their generosity would be noted by others they never rewarded someone for doing what she was doing now providing a relaxing background ah well if i become a guild musician this may well be my lot no harm in getting used to it after a while she lost herself in the musicin the music itself and not the memories it recalled for her she began to play variations on some of the pieces doing some improvisational work and getting caught up in the intricacies of the melody she was creating she closed her eyes without realizing shed done so and played until her arm began to ache she opened her eyes then finished off the tune shed been working on and realized that she must have been playing for at least an hour by the way her arms and shoulders felt the customers had changed completely tonno was gone and amber was nowhere to be seen one of the servinggirls glided over with a mug of hot spiced cider rune took it gratefully they exchanged smiles rune found herself hoping shed be able to stay everything so far indicated that all amber had claimed was true she hadnt seen the servinggirls so much as touched and both the girls pretty in their brown skirts and bodices one darkhaired and one light had been friendly to her they acted as if they were glad to have her there in fact perhaps the clients were making fewer demands on them with runes playing to occupy their thoughts when she had shaken the cramps out and had massaged her fingers a bit she felt ready to play again this time she didnt lose herself in the spell of the music she watched the customers to see what their reaction was to her playing a head or two nodded in time to the music there were two tables where there were pairs of men involved in some kind of game it wasnt the draughts she was used to for the pieces were much more elaborate those four ignored her entirely there were another three involved in some kind of intense conversation who didnt seem to be paying any attention either then she noticed one richly dressed very young manhardly more than a boyin the company of two older men the boy looked nervous as an experiment she set out deliberately to soothe him she played not love songs but old lullabies then as he began to relax she switched back to love songs but this time instead of ballads she chose songs of seduction the kind a young man would use to lure a girl into the night and hopefully at least from his point of view into his bed the young man relaxed still further and began to smile as if he envisioned himself as that successful lover he sat up straighter he began to sip at his drink instead of clutch it and even to nibble at some of the little snacks his companions had ordered for their table by the time the wizened man summoned them he was showing a new selfassurance and swaggered a bit as he followed the old man up the stairs his two companions chuckled and sat back to enjoy their drink and food one summoned one of the servingboys and a moment later they too were embroiled in one of those games at first rune was amused but then as she started another languid ballad she felt a twinge of conscience if the boy had actually responded to what shed been doing rather than simply calming normally then she had manipulated him shed had her own belly full of manipulation was it fair to do that to someone else even with the best of intentions did i do that or was it just the liquor and if it was me what gave me the right she wondered even more now about these invisible women amber employed did they enjoy what they were doing were they doing it by choice or because of some kind of constraint amber had on them were they pampered and protected or prisoners just what kind of place was this exactly she had finished her second mug of cider and was well into her third set when the midnight bell rang signaling the end of her stint there was no sign that the custom had abated any though the tables were just as full as before while she wondered exactly what she should do amber herself glided down the stairs and into the room and nodded to her she finished the song slid lady rose into her carrying bag and stood up a little surprised at how stiff she felt she edged past the fireplace to ambers side without disturbing anyone that she could tell amber drew her into the hall of the staircase and motioned that she should go up at this point the gentlemen waiting are in no hurry she said at this late hour the gentlemen have usually exhausted their high spirits and are prepared to relax past midnight i probably wont ever need your services to keep them occupied they got to the top of the stairs where there was a hall carpeted in something thick and plushly scarlet paneled in rich wood and illuminated by scented candles in sconces set into the walls she started to turn automatically down the candlelit hallway but amber stopped her before shed gone a single pace watch this carefully the woman said ignoring the muffled little sounds of pleasure that penetrated into the hall and made rune blush to the hair youll have to know how to do this for yourself from now on she tried to ignore the sounds herself and watched as amber turned to the shelves that stood where another hall might have been she reached into the second set of shelves grasped a brass dog that looked like a simple ornament and turned it there was a click and a door upon which the set of shelves had been mounted swung open revealing another hall amber waved rune through and shut the door behind them this was a much plainer hallway lit by two lanterns and with an ordinary wooden floor and whitepainted walls this subterfuge is so that the customers dont lose their way and blunder into our private quarters amber said in a conversational voice i never could imagine why but some people seem to think that anything ordinary in a pleasurehouse must conceal something extraordinary the servinggirls got very tired of having clients pester them so i had the shelves built to hide the other hall i took the liberty of having old parro bring your things up to your new room so you wouldnt have to i imagine that youre quite fatigued with all your walking about the streets today rune tried to imagine that poor wizened little man hauling her pack about and failed he really didnt have to she protested hehe doesnt oh dont make the mistake of thinking that because hes small and a bit crippled that hes weak amber said he wouldnt thank you for that hes quite fiercely proud of his strength and i have him as my summoner for a good reason he canand hasbrought strong guardsmen to their knees and men constantly underestimate him because of the way he looks oh rune said weakly youll meet everyone tomorrow i thought youd rather get to sleep early tonight amber continued holding open a door for her this is your room by the way you did very well just as well as tonno said you would im happy to welcome you to my little family rune rune stepped into the room before the last remark penetrated her fatigue you are she said a little stupidly amber nodded and lit a candle at the lantern outside the door placing it in a holder on a little table just inside the bathroom is at the end of the hall and there should be hot water in the copper if you want to wash before you go to bed in the morning simply come downstairs when youre ready and either parro or i will introduce you goodnight rune she had closed the door before rune had a chance to say anything but what could she say really wait im not sure i should be doing this that wasnt terribly bright just what is going on around here she knew what was going on this was a whorehouse she was going to entertain here the madam was a gracious lady of impeccable manners and taste but it was still a house of pleasure but this was certainly the oddest bawdyhouse shed ever heard of she looked around at her roomher room and what an odd sound that had there wasnt much a tiny table a chair a chest for clothing and the bed but it was a real bed not a pallet on the floor like shed had all her life and it was much too narrow for two which in a way was reassuring theres no way anyone would pay to share that with amber much less with me the frame was the same plain wood as the rest of the furniture the mattress seemed to be stuffed with something other than straw not feathers but certainly something softer than she was used to she bounced on it experimentally and found herself grinning from ear to ear there were clean fresh sheets on the bed and blankets hung over the footboard with clean towels atop them the plain wooden floor was scrubbed spotless as were the whitepainted walls there was one window with the curtains already shut she went to it and peeked out less than an arms length away loomed the wooden side of the house next door there were windows in it but they were set so that they didnt look into any windows in this building thus ensuring a bit of privacy not much of a view but the window would probably let in some air in the summer as soon as the warmer weather really arrived it was better than being in the attic where the sun beating down on the roof would make an oven of the place in summer and the wind whistling under the eaves would turn it into the opposite in winter her room her room with a latch on the inside of the door so she could lock it if she chose her room where no one could bother her a room she didnt have to share with anyone maybe it was the size of a rich mans closet but it was all hers and the thrill of privacy was heady indeed she looked longingly at the bedbut she knew she was filthy she hadnt had a bath in several days and to lie down in the clean sheets unwashed seemed like a desecration it also wouldnt give amber a very good impression of her cleanliness after all the woman had gone out of her way to mention that there was water ready for washing even at this late hour that could have been a hintin fact it probably was she took the towels and went to the end of the hall to find the promised bathroom and indeed it was there and included the indoor privies she had seen in the church hostels which could be flushed clean by pulling a chain that sluiced down a measured amount of water from a reservoir on the roof there were two privies in stalls and two bathbasins behind tall screens one was big enough to soak in but the other wouldnt take as long to fill and she was awfully tired both the baths were fixed to the floor with permanent drains in their bottoms she filled the shallow bath with equal measures of hot and cold water dipped from the copper and a jar both of which were also fed by the roofreservoir as she dipped the steaming water out of the top of the cauldron she longed more than ever to be able to take a good long soak but that could wait until she had a halfpenny to spare for the public baths and steamhouse then she could soak in the hot pools swim in the cold and go back to soak in the hot pools until every pore was cleansed she could take an afternoon from busking perhaps the seventhday when people would be going to church in the morning and spending the afternoon at home that would mean thered be fewer of them in the streets and her take wouldnt be that much anyway it wouldnt hurt her income as much to spend the afternoon in the bathhouse but for now at least she could go to bed clean she scrubbed herself hastily rinsed with a little more cold water and toweled herself down feeling as if she were a paying patron and if this was the treatment that the help got how were the patrons treated with that thought in mind she returned to her room locked herself in for the night and dug out her poor maltreated bread and cheese it was squashed but still edible and she found herself hungry enough to devour the last crumb and with the last of her needs satisfied she blew out the candle and felt her way to her bed to dream of dancing lutes dressed in gypsy ribbons and fiddles that ran fiddlebrothels where richly dressed men came to caress their strings and play childrens lullabies and strange wizened old men who lifted houses off their foundations and placed them back down wrongway about she woke much later than she had intended much to her chagrin she hurried into the only clean set of clothing she hada shirt and breeches that had seen much better daysand resolved to find herself more clothing before amber had a chance to comment on the state of her dress when she found her way down to the common room she discovered the exterior doors locked tight and a halfdozen people eating what looked like breakfast porridge and talking one of those was the most stunning young woman rune had ever seen even in a simple shift with her hair combed back from her face she looked like an angel rune thought wonderingly she was inhumanly lovely no one should look that lovely no one could outside of a ballad the girl was so beautiful it was impossible to feel jealousy rune could only admire her the way she would admire a rainbow a butterfly or a flower her hair was a straight fall of gold and dropped down past her waist to an inch or two above the floor her eyes were the perfect blue of a summer sky after a rain her complexion was roses and cream her teeth perfect and even her face round as a childs and with a childs innocence her figure slight and lissome was as delicate as a porcelain figure of an idealized shepherdess her perfect rosebud mouth made a little o as she saw rune and the person sitting with her who rune hadnt even noticed at that moment turned it was amber ah rune she said smiling come here child id like you to meet sapphire she is one of the ladies i told you about last night rune blinked and made her way carefully to the table anyone with that much beauty cant be human she probably has the brains of a pea hello rune sapphire said with a smile that eclipsed ambers that isnt my real name of courseamber insisted we all take the names of jewels so when i leave here and retire i can leave sapphire behind and just be myself amber nodded it will happen of course this is not a profession one can remain in for long oh rune said awkwardly then amber is not my real name eitherat least it isnt the one i was born with amber said easily ill probably become amber when i take over as madam sapphire continued since theres always been an amber in charge here this amber decided to take me as her prentice so to speak i already help with the bookkeeping but im going to need a lot more schooling in handling people that much i know rune nearly swallowed her tongue this delicate brainlesslooking creature was doingbookkeeping sapphire laughed at the look on her face rune felt like a fool youre not the first person whos been surprised by sapphire amber said indulgently i told you the ladies were all something very special so are you love sapphire replied warmly without you wed all be elsewhere amber interrupted and probably just as successful all four of you have brains and ambition youd probably be very influential courtesans and mistresses but not wives sapphire replied and her tone was so bitter that rune started no amber said softly never wives thats the fate of a lovely woman with no lineage and no money the prince doesnt fall in love with you woo you gently carry you away on his white horse and marry you over his fathers objections no the prince seduces youif youre lucky more often than not he carries you off all right screaming for your father who doesnt dare interfere then he rapes youand abandons you once he knows youre with child sapphire said grimly her mouth set in a thin hard line and that is the prerogative of princes amber concluded with equal bitterness merchant princes princes of the trades or princes by birth they both seemed to have forgotten she was there she felt very uncomfortable this was not the sort of thing one heard in ballads well yes and no there were plenty of ballads where beautiful women were seduced or taken against their will but in those ballads they died tragically often murdered and their spirits pursued their ravagers and brought them to otherworldly justice or else they retired to a life in a convent and only saw their erstwhile despoilers when the villains were at deaths door brought there by some other rash action apparently it wasnt considered to be in good taste to survive ones despoiling as anything other than a nun well im not going to let one damn fool turn me into a bitter old hag sapphire said with a sigh and stretched turning from bitter to sunny in a single instant thats over and done with in a way he did me a favor she said half to rune half to amber if he hadnt carried me off and abandoned me here i probably would have married bert raised pigs and died in childbed three years ago amber nodded thoughtfully and i would have pined myself over tham wedding jakie until i talked myself into the convent sapphire laughed and raised a glass of apple juice a shaft of sunlight lancing through the cracks in the shutters pierced it turning it into liquid gold then heres to feckless young men spoiled and ruthless she said gaily and to women who refuse to be ruined by them amber solemnly clinked glasses with her poured a third glass for rune without waiting for her to ask and they drank the toast together so rune how is it that you come here sapphire asked with your accent from my own hills and your gift of soothing the fears out of frightened young men runes jaw dropped and amber and sapphire both laughed you thought i hadnt noticed amber said that was the moment when i knew you were for us if you can soothe the fears out of a young man you may well soothe the violence out of an older one that is a hazard of our profession oh our old and steady clients know that to come here means that one of the ladies will be kind and flattering will listen without censure and will make him feel like the most virile and clever man on earthbut there are always new clients and many of them come to a whore only because they hate women so much they cannot bear any other relationship theni did right rune asked wondering a little that she brought a question of morality to a whorebut unable to believe that these two women were anything but moral i thoughtit seemed so calculating to try and calm him down the men who come here come to feel better amber said firmly that is why i told you we serve a very special need we hear secrets they wont even tell their priests and fears they wouldnt tell their wives or best friends if all they wanted was lovemaking they could go to any of the houses on the street unskilled sex perhaps sapphire commented acidly with a candor that held rune speechless not lovemaking that takes ability and practice point taken amber replied well enough our clients come to us for more than that sapphire topaz ruby and pearl are more than whores rune im she said and coughed to clear her throat im uhbeginning to see that so how did you come here rune sapphire persisted when i heard you speak i swear you carried me right back to my village once again rune gave a carefully edited version of her travels and travailsthough she made light of the latter sensing from sapphires earlier comments that her experiences had been a great deal more harrowing than runes she also left out the skull hill ghost time enough to talk about him when shed made a song out of him and thered be no reason to suspect that the adventure was anything more than a song sapphire sat entranced through all of it though rune suspected that half of her entrancement was another skill she had acquired the ability to listen and appear fascinated by practically anything when rune finished sapphire raised her glass again and heres to a young lady who refused to keep to her place as decreed by men and god she said and had the gumption to pack up and set out on her own thank you rune said flattered but ive a long way to go before im a guild apprentice right now i intend to concentrate on keeping myself fed and out of trouble until i master my second instrument good amber turned a critical eye on her clothing and rune flushed again please talk to tonno about finding you some costumes would you that was a clear dismissal if ever rune had heard one and since she had decided to take advantage of her promised meal by making it supperespecially if she was going to dine like she had last nightshe took her leave but she took to the streets in search of a buskingcorner with her head spinning nothing around here was the way she had thought it would be the folk who should have been honest and helpfulthe churchwere taking in money and attempting to cheat over it at every turn and the folk who should have been the ones to avoidamber and her ladieshad gone out of their way to give her a place of course she was going to have to work for that place but still that didnt make things any less than remarkable amber was about as different from the fellow who set up at the faires as could be imaginedand the ladies at least sapphire as different from his hardeyed dancers they seemed to think of themselves as providing a service even if it was one that was frowned upon by the church then again it was the church who frowned upon anything that didnt bring money to its coffers and servants to its hands doubtless the church had found no way for the congress between men and women to bring profit to themso they chose instead to make it if not forbidden then certainly not encouraged rune shook her head and stepped out into the sunlight surrounding the fountain it was all too much for her those were the worries of the high and mighty she had other things to attend toto find breakfast pay her tax and tithe buy her permit and set up for busking until it was time for her lessons and that was enough for any girl to worry about on a bright early summer morning chapter eight midmorning found her back on the corner between the drinkstall and the sausagestall and both owners were happy to see her happier still to see the badge of her permit pinned to the front of her vest she set herself up with a peculiar feeling of permanence and the sausage roll vendor confirmed that when he asked her if she planned to make this her regular station she didnt have a chance to answer him then but once the nuncheon rush was over and he had time again to talk he brought it up again she considered that idea for a moment nibbling at her lip this wasnt a bad place not terribly profitable but not bad there was a good deal of traffic here although the only folks that passed by that appeared to have any money at all were the church functionaries still better spots probably already had residents this one might even have a regular player later in the day when folk were off work and more inclined to stop and listen i dont know she said truthfully why because if ye do men jak therell save it for ye the sausageman told her as she exchanged part of her collection of pins for her lunch theres a juggler what has it at night but we cn save it fer ye by day th wife knows a seamstress th seamstress allus needs pins he leaned forward a bit earnestly his thin face alive with the effort of convincing her barters no bad way tgo fer a meal or twain an f ye get known fer bein here could be yell get people comin here t hear ye apurpose an well get th custom the cidervendor said with a grin leaning over his own counter to join the conversation aint bad fer evbody now that was certainly true she nodded in halfagreement ye get good nough so ye bring more custom tell ye what well do the cidervendor jak said leaning forward even farther and halfwhispering confidentially well feed ye fer free nuncheon anyway but yell have t bring us more custom nor wed had already after a moment of thought the sausagevendor nodded aye we cn do that if ye bring us more custom nough t pay th penny fer yer share anyway he said thatll do i reckon his caution amused her even while she felt a shade of annoyance at their pennypinching surely one sausage roll and a mug of cider wasnt going to ruin their profits in a day how would i know rune asked with a touch of irony i mean id only have your word that i hadnt already done that well now yed just haveta trust us eh jak said with a grin and she found herself wondering what the juggler thought of these two rogues what can ye lose good corners are hard t find a when ye find one mebbe sommuts already there an ye know ye can trade off yer pins here even if we says ye haint brought in nough new business t feed ye free not evbody takes pins ask that blamed church vulture ttake pins hell laugh in yer face that was true enough she looked the corner over with a critical eye it seemed to be adequately sheltered from everything but rain the wind wouldnt whip through here the way it might a more open venue sure it was summer now but there could be cold storms even in summer and winter was coming she was going to have to think ahead to the next season she still had to eat pay her tax and tithe on the tradevalue of what she was getting from amber and enlarge her wardrobe right now she had no winter clothes and none suitable for the truly hot days of summer shed have to take care of that as well f it rains ye come in here jak said suddenly i reckon larsd offer but hes got that hot fat back there an i dunno how good thatd be fer th fiddle there come winter lars peddles same i peddle hot cider wi spices ye can come in here tget yer fingers an toes warm wheneer ye get chilled that settled it done rune replied instantly it wasnt often a streetbusker got an offer of shelter from a storm that could make the difference between a good days take and a poor oneshelter meant she could play until the last moment before a storm broke then duck inside and be right back out when the weather cleared and a place out of the cold meant extra hours she could be busking that alone was worth staying for these men might be miserly about their stock but they were ready enough to offer her what someone else might not she left the corner for the day feeling quite lighthearted on the whole her day so far had been pretty pleasant including the otherwise unpleasant duty of paying the church shed been able to annoy the priest at the churchbox quite successfully playing dunce and passing over first her tithe counted out in halfpenny and quarterpennies then her tax counted out likewise and then after hed closed the ledger assuming she was going to move on her permitfee ten copper pennies which were the equivalent of one silver shed done so slowly passing them in to him one at a time much to the amusement of a couple of other buskers waiting to pay their own tithes and taxes they knew she was playing the fool but he didnt it almost made it worth the loss of the money he had cursed her under his breath for being such a witling and shed asked humbly when she finished for his blessinghed had to give it to herand hed been so annoyed his face had been poppyred the other buskers had to go around the corner to stifle their giggles now it was time to go find tonnos shopshe needed at least one new outfit to satisfy ambers requirements and tonno knew where she was going to be able to find the cheapest clothes that expenditure wasnt something she was looking forward to for the money for new clothing would come out of her slender reserve but she had no choice in the matter ambers request had the force of a command if she wanted to keep her new place and even when shed gotten her old clothing clean it hadnt weathered the journey well enough to be presentable downstairs it would do for busking in the street where a little poverty often invited another coin or two but not for ambers establishment on the other hand the money for her lodging was not coming out of her reserves and that was a plus in her favor and she did need new clothes no matter what when she pushed open the door she saw that tonno had a customer he was going over a tall stack of books with a man in the long robes of a university scholar probably one of the teachers there she hung back near the door of the shop until she caught his eye then waited patiently until the scholar was engrossed in a book and raised her eyebrows in entreaty he excused himself for a moment once she whispered what she needed he took lady rose and her lute from her to stow safely behind the counter until lesson time then gave her directions to patch street where many of the old clothes sellers either had shops or barrows she excused herself quickly and quietlya little disappointed that he wouldnt be able to come with her she had the feeling that hed be able to get her bargains she hadnt a chance for alone it was a good thing that shed started out with a couple of hours to spend before her first lesson patch street was not that far away but the number of vendors squeezed into a twoblock area was nothing less than astonishing the street itself was thick with buyers and sellers all shouting their wares or arguing price at the tops of their lungs the cacophony deafened her and she began to feel a little short of breath from the press of people the moment she entered the affray the sun beat down between the buildings on all of them impartially and she was soon limp with heat as well as pummeled by noise and prodded by elbows she now was grateful she had left lady rose with tonno there was scarcely room on this street to squeeze by she tried to keep her mind on what she neededgood servicable clothing not too wornbut there were thousands of distractions the woman in her yearned for some of the bright silks and velvets worn and obviously secondhand as most of them were and the showman for some of the gaudier costumes like the ones the gypsies had wornhuge multicolored skirts bright scarlet sashes embroidered vests and bodices she disciplined herself firmly underthings first one pair of breeches something strong and soft two new shirts as lightweight as i can get them one vest nothing bright nothing to cry out for attention im supposed to be inconspicuous and nothing too feminine the underthings she found in a barrow tended by a little old woman who might have been parros wizened twin she suspected that the garments came from some of the houses of pleasure too although the lace had been removed from them they were underthings meant to be seenor rather they had been before theyd been torn aside from the tears they looked hardly used at all she picked up a pair of underdrawers they were very lightweight but they were also softnot silk but something comfortable and easy on the skin quite a change from the harsh linen and wool things she was used to wearing the tears would be simple enough to mend though they would be very obvious then again rune wasnt likely to be in a position where anyone was going to notice her mended underwear the original owners thoughit probably wasnt good for business for a whore to be seen in underthings with mends and patches it was odd though the tears were all in places like shoulderseams or along the sideswhere the seams themselves had held but the fabric hadnt as if the garments had been torn from their wearers maybe they had been either apurpose or by chance perhaps the life of a whore wasnt all that easy her next acquisition must be a pair of shirts and it was a little hard to find what she was looking for here most shirts in these stalls and barrows were either ready to be turned into rags or had plainly been divested of expensive embroidery the places where bands of ornamentation had been picked off on the sleeves and collars were distressingly obvious especially for someone whose hands and arms were going to be the most visible parts of her although rune wasnt the most expert seamstress in the world it looked to her as if the fine weave of the fabrics would never close up around the seamline it would always be very clear that the shirt was secondhand and that wouldnt do for ambers as she turned over garment after garment she wondered if she was going to be able to find anything worth buying or if she was going to have to dig even deeper into her resources and buy new shirts she bit her lip anxiously and went back to the first barrow hoping against hope to find something that might do scuse me dearie a hand on her arm and a rich alto voice interrupted her fruitless search rune looked up into the eyes of a middleaged redhaired woman a lady with a buskingpermit pinned to the front of her bodice and a look of understanding in her warm greenbrown eyes i think mebbe i cn help ye she licked her lips and nodded lissen boy the woman continued when she saw shed gotten runes attention leaning towards runes ear to shout at her can ye sew at all a straight seam like an patch what an odd question uhyes rune answered before she had time to consider her words yes i can but i cant do any more than that good the woman said in satisfaction look here she held up two of the shirts rune had rejected a faded blue and a stained white both of lovely light material and both useless because the places where bands of ornament had been picked off or cut away were all too obvious buy these rune shook her head the woman persisted nay hear me out ye go over t that lass th one w th ribbons she pointed over the heads of the crowd at a girl with a shouldertray full of ribbons of various bright colors ye buy nough plain ribbon t cover th places where the broidery was picked out an wider than the broidery was look see like i done wi mine she held up her own arm and indicated the sleeve where a band of embroidery would have been at the cuff there was a wide ribbon where a bit of lace would have been at the top of the sleeve shed put a knot of multicolored ribbons the effect was quite striking and rune had to admit that the shirt did not look as if it had come from the ragbin like these the woman held up the white one this uns only stained at back an near th waist ye see she said pointing out the location of the lightbrown stains sleeves r still good sos top get a good vest sew bita ribbon on an nobbutll know tis stained rune blinked and looked at the shirts in the womans hands in the light of her suggestions it would work it would certainly work the stained shirt could even be made ready by the time rune needed to take up her station at ambers tonight thank you she shouted back taking the shirts from the womans hands and turning to pay the vendor for them thank you very much think nowt ont the woman shouted back with a grin tis one musicker to nother ye do sommut else the turn one day sides me nieces th one w the ribbon she bought the shirtsdearer than shed hoped but not as bad as shed fearedand wormed her way to the ribbon vendors side a length of dark blue quite transformed the faded blue shirt into something with dignity and a length of faded roseobviously also picked off something elseworked nicely on the stained white and who knew maybe someone at ambers would know how to take the stains out they looked like spilled wine and there was undoubtably a lot of spilled wine around a brothel now for the rest she had better luck there thankful for her slight frame she was thin for a boy though tallher normal height being similar to the point where a lad really started shooting up and outgrowing clothing at a dreadful rate soon she had a pair of fawncolored corduroy breeches with the inside rubbed bare probably from riding but that wouldnt show where she was sittingand a slightly darker vest of lined leather that laced tight and could pass for a bodice when she wore her skirts the seams on the vest had popped and had not been mended it would be simplicity to sew them up again with the lightcolored shirt the breeches and the new vest shed be fit for duty this evening and meanwhile she could wash and dry her blue breeches and skirt and her other three shirts once they were clean she could see how salvageable they were for nightduty if they were of no use she could come back here and get a bit more clothing and theyd be good enough for streetbusking it didnt pay to look too prosperous on the street people felt sorry for you if you looked a bit tattered and she didnt want that nosy churchclerk to think she was doing too well she wormed her way out of the crowd to find that two hours had gone byas well as five penniesand it was time to return to tonno runes head pounded and her hands hurt worse than they had in years blessed god she squinted and tried to ignore the pain between her eyebrows without success her fingers and her head both hurt she was more than happy to take a break from the lesson when tonno ran his hand through his thick shock of gray hair and suggested that she had quite enough to think about for the moment she had always known that the lute was a very different instrument from the fiddle but she hadnt realized just how different it was she shook her left hand hard to try and free it from the cramps and licked and blew on the fingertips of her right to cool them there wouldnt be any blisters but that was only because tonno was merciful to his newest pupil playing the lute was like playing something as wildly different from the fiddle asa shepherds pipe the grip and the action for instance it was noticably harder to hold down the lutes strings than the fiddles and now she was required to do something with her right handbowing required control of course but all of her fingers worked together now she was having to pick in patterns as complicated as fingering more so even she was sweating by the time tonno called the break and offered tea and quite convinced that tonno was earning his lesson money it didnt much help that she was also learning to read musicthe notes on a pageat the same time she was learning to play her second instrument it was hard enough to keep notes and fingerings matched now with simple melodiesbut shed seen some music sheets that featured multiple notes meant to be played simultaneously and she wasnt sure shed ever be ready for those so child am i earning my fee tonno asked genially she nodded and shook her hair to cool her head she was sweating like a horse with her effort at this rate shed have to wash really well before she went on duty tonight youre earning it sir but im not sure im ever going to master this stuff youre learning a new pair of languages dear he cautioned understanding in his eyes dont be discouraged it will come and much more quickly than you think trust me if you say so she put the lute back in its carrying case and looked about at the shop there were at least a dozen different types of instruments hanging on the wall not counting drums there were a couple of fiddles another lute a guitar a shepherds pipe and a flute a mandolin a hurdygurdy a trumpet and a horn three harps of various sizes plus several things she couldnt identify i cant imagine how you ever learned to play all these things it seems impossible partially out of curiosity partially out of necessity tonno told her following her gaze and smiling reminiscently i inherited this shop from my father and it helps a great deal to have a way to bring in extra money but when he still owned it and i was a child he had no way of telling if the instruments he acquired were any good so when i showed some aptitude for music he had me learn everything so that i could tell him when something wasnt worth buying but why didnt you rune stopped herself from asking why he hadnt become a guild musician tonno smiled at her tolerantly and answered the question anyway i didnt even try to enter the guild because i have no real talent for music he said i have a knack for picking up the basics but there my abilities end im very good at teaching the basics but other than that i am simply a gifted amateur ohand i can tell when a musician has potential i am good enough to know that i am not good enough you see rune felt inexplicably saddened by his words she couldnt imagine not pursuing music at least not now yet to offer sympathy seemed rude at the least she kept her own counsel and held her tongue unsure of what she could say safely so tonno said breaking the awkward silence its time for your other lessons what do you think youd like to read histories collected poems and ballads old tales reading shed forgotten that was to be part of her lessoning her head swam at the idea of something more to learn is there anything easy she asked desperately i cant read very well just enough to spell things out in the holy book tonno got up and walked over to the laden shelves without answering scrutinizing some of the books stacked there for a moment easy hmm he said after a moment or two yes i think we can manage that here he pulled a book out from between two more and blew the dust from its wellworn cover this should suit you he told her bringing the book back to where she sat with her lute case in her lap its a book of songs and ballads and im sure youll recognize at least half of them that should give you familiar ground to steady you as you plunge into the new material here he thrust it at her so that she was forced to take it before he dropped it on her lute bring it back when youve finished and ill give you something new to read once youre reading easily ill start picking other books for you it isnt possible for a minstrel to be too widely read yes sir she said hastily i mean no sir now run along back to ambers he said making a shooing motion with his hands im sure youll have to do something with those new clothes of yours to make them fit to wear ill see you tomorrow how he had known that she had no idea but she was grateful to be let off right now her fingers stung and she wanted a chance to rest them before the eveningand she did indeed have quite a bit of mending and trimming to do before her garments were fit for ambers common room the first eveningbell rang marking the time when most shops shut their doors and the farmers market was officially closed she hurried back through the quiet streets empty of most traffic in this quarter reaching ambers and flower street in good time none of the houses on the court were open except ambers and rune had the feeling that it was only the downstairs portion that was truly ready for business there were a handful of men and even one woman sitting in the common room enjoying a meal as rune entered the common room her stomach reminded her sharply that it would be no bad thing to perform with a good meal inside her as she hesitated in the stairway one of the servinggirls the cheerful one who had smiled at her last night stopped on her way to a table if youd like your meal in your room she said quietly go to the end of the corridor just beyond the bathroom theres a little staircase in a closet there that leads straight down into the kitchen you can get a tray there and take it up or you can eat in the kitchenbut lana is usually awfully busy so its hard to find a quiet corner to eat in this time of night shes got every flat space filled up with things shes cooking thanks rune whispered back the girl grinned in a conspiratorial manner and hurried on to her table rune followed her instructions and shortly was ensconced in her own room with a steaming plate of chicken and noodles a basket of bread and sliced cheese and a winter apple still sound though wrinkled from storage although she was no seamstress she made a fairly quick job of mending the vest and trimming the light shirt taking a stitch between each couple of bites of her supper the food was gone long before the mending was done of course she was working by the light of her candle when a tap at her door made her jump with startlement yyes she stuttered trying to get her heart down out of her throat its maddie said a muffled voice lana sent me after your dishes ohcome in she said standing up in confusion as the door opened revealing the servinggirl whod told her the way to the kitchen with her neat brown skirt and bodice and apron over all she looked as tidy as rune felt untidy rune flushed im sorry i meant to take them downi didnt mean to be any trouble the girl laughed and shook her head until her light brown hair started to come loose from the knot at the back of her neck its no bother she replied really theres hardly anyone downstairs yet and i wanted a chance to give you a proper hello youre rune right the new musician carly thought you were a boyshe is going to be so mad rune nodded apprehensively the girl seemed friendly enoughshe had a wonderful smile and a host of freckles sprinkled across her nose that made her look like a freckled kitten she looked as if she could have been one of the village girls from home which was the root of runes apprehension those girls from home hadnt ever been exactly friendly and now this girl had been put out of her way to come get the dishes and had informed her that the other servinggirl was going to be annoyed when she discovered the musician wasnt the male she had thought well im maddie the girl said comfortably picking up the tray but seeming in no great hurry to leave with it i expect well probably be pretty good friendsand i expect that carly will probably hate you shes the other server the blond the one as has the sharp eyes and nose she hates everyoneevery girl anyway but shes parros daughter so lady amber puts up with her whats carlys problem rune asked putting her sewing down she wants to work upstairs maddie said with a twist of her mouth and theres no way shes not nowhere good enough or nice enough maddie shrugged at least as much as the tray in her arms permitted shell probably either marry some fool and nag him to death or end up down the street at the stallion or the velvet rope theres men enough around thatll pay to be punished that shed be right at home rune found her mouth sagging open at maddies matteroffact assessment of the situation and at what shed hinted back at home well she wasnt back at home she found herself blushing and maddie giggled best learn the truth rune and learn to live with it were on flower street and thats the whores district theres men thatll pay for whores to do weirder things than just nag or beat em but that doesnt happen here but thiss a whorehouse whatever else them nice people call it the ladies upstairs belong to the whores guild and they got the right to make a living like any other guild got crown protection and all runes mouth sagged open further theydo she managed surely maddie said with a firm nod i know tis a bit much at first me my momma was a laundrywoman down at knifes edge so i seen plenty growing up and let me tell you i was right glad to get a job here instead of there but young shawm hes straight from the country like you and carly made his life a pure misery until me and arden and lana took him in hand and got him used to the way things is like were gonna do with you rune managed a smile thanks maddie she said weakly still a little in shock at the girls frankness i probably seem like a real countrycousin to you maddie shook her head cheerfully nay most of the people here in town think just like youfact is ambers had a bit of a problem getting a good musicker because of that whoring is a job lass like any other whore sells something she can do just like a cook or a musicker try thinking on it that way and thingsll come easier she tilted her head to one side as rune tried not to feel too much a fool at the moment she felt as naive as a tiny child and maddie though she probably wasnt more than a year older seemed worlds more experienced i got to go the other girl said hefting the tray a little higher tell you what though if you got clothes what need washing you can give em to me and ill take em to momma with lana and shawms and mine tonight twont cost you nothing momma does it cause lana gives her whats left over lady amber dont allow no leftovers being given to our custom ohthank you rune said taken quite aback but are you sure maddie nodded sure as sureand sure i wont never do the same for carly she winked and rune stifled a giggle feeling a sudden kinship with the girl ill come by in the morning and you can help me carry it all down to momma eh rune laughed oh i see this way you get somebody to help you carry things maddie grinned sure thing and i dont want to ask shawm i got other things id druther ask him to do rune grinned a little widerand dared to tease her a little maddie are you sweet on shawm to her surprise the girl blushed a brilliant scarlet and mumbled something that sounded like an affirmative rune could hardly believe maddies sudden shynessthis from the girl who had just spoke about being brought up in a whorehouse with the same matteroffactness that rune would have used in talking about her childhood at the hungry bear well dont worry she said impulsively i wont tell him or carly if thats what you want maddie grinned gratefully still scarlet thanks i knew you were a goodun she said now i really do have to go the customs gonna start coming in right soon and shawms down there by himself ill see you down there in a little bit rune replied and if you can think of anything youd like to hear let me know if i dont know it i bet tonno does and i can learn it from him thanks maddie said with obvious surprise heyyou know ratcatcher i really like that song and i dont get to hear it very often i sure do rune replied happy to be able to do something for maddie right away in return for the girls kindness ill play it a couple times tonight and if you think of anything else tell me rightoh maddie said and turned to go rune held the door open for her then trotted down to the end of the hall to hold open the door to the stairway as well she returned to put the last touches on her costume for tonight and get lady rose in tune feeling more than a little happy about the outcome of the day so far shed gotten her first lesson a permanent busking site with some extra benefits acquired the first new clothing shed had in a while been warned about an enemy and found a friend that was the most surprising and perhaps the best part of the day shed been half expecting animosity from the other girlsbut she was used to that shed never expected to find one of them an ally she slipped into her new garb and laced the vest tight flattening her chestwhat there was of itand looking down at herself critically neat welldressedand not even remotely feminine looking that would do time to go earn her keep she grinned at the thought time to go earn my keep at a house of pleasure with my fiddle and my teacher thinks im going to be good go stick that in your cup and drink it westhaven and she descended the front stairs with a heady feeling of accomplishment chapter nine i cant imagine what lady amber thinks shes doing hiring that scruffy little catgutscraper carly said irritablyand very audiblyto one of the customers just as rune finished a song i should think shed drive people away she gives me a headache rune bit her tongue and held her peace and simply smiled at carly as if she hadnt been meant to overhear that last then flexed her fingers to loosen them bitch shed fit right in at westhaven right alongside those other sanctimonious idiots i think its very pleasant the young man said in mild surprise he looked over to runes corner and lifted a finger lass you wouldnt know song of the swan would you i surely would my lord she said quickly and began the piece before carly could react keeping her own expression absolutely neutral no point in giving the scold any more ammunition than she already had rune got along fine with everyone else in the house it was only carly who was intent on plaguing her life why she didnt know but it was no use taking tales to lady amber amber would simply fix her with a chiding look and ask her if it was really so difficult to get along with one girl the young man looked gratified at being called my lord amber had told her to always call men my lord and the few women who frequented the place my lady it does no harm amber had said with a lifted eyebrow and if it makes someone feel better to be taken for noble then it does some good that seemed to be the theme of a great many things that amber said she even attempted to make the sourtempered carly feel more contented of course the girl did do her work quickly efficiently and expertlyshe could serve more tables than shawm maddie or arden that was probably one of the things that saved her from getting the sack rune reflected if shed shirked her work there would be no way that even amber would put up with her temper now that summer was gone and autumn nearly over as well rune was a standard fixture at ambers and felt secure enough there that she had dropped the boy disguise even when she wore her breeches instead of skirts the customers never even hinted at services other than music for she along with the rest of the downstairs help did not sport the badge of the whores guild and that made her absolutely offlimits at least in ambers in one of the other houses on the street that might not be true but here she was safe she knew most of the regular customers by sight now and some by name as well tonnos friends she all knew well enough even to tease them a bit between setsand they frequently bought her a bit of drink a little stronger than the cider she was allowed as part of her keep a nice glass of brandywine did go down very well making her tired fingers a little less tired and putting a bit more life in her hands at the end of a long night that was the good part the bad part was that her income had fallen off there were fewer people on the street seeking nuncheon during the day the days themselves were shorter and winter was coming on very early this year jak and his fellow vendor had been looking askance at the weather and jak had confessed that he thought they might have to close down during the bitterest months this year shutting up the stalls and instead taking their goods to those public houses that didnt serve much in the way of food if that happened rune would still have her corner but no shelter already she had lost several days to rotten weather rains that went on all day soaking everything in sight and so cold and miserable that even ambers had been shy of custom come the evening hours the winter did not look to be a good one so far as keeping ahead of expenses went the best thing she could say for it was that at least she had a warm place to live and one good solid meal every dayshe still had her teacher and a small store of coin laid up that might carry her through until spring if only she didnt have the damned tax and tithe to pay no one made any further suggestions so rune let her wandering mind and fingers pick their own tunes today had been another of those miserable days gray and overcast and threatening rain though it never materialized the result was that her take was half her norm five pennies in half and quarter pence and pins and out of that was taken three pence for tithes and taxes the only saving grace was that since her corner was right across from the churchbox the priest could see for himself how ill she was doing and didnt contest her now that she was paying less nor thank god had he contested her appraisal of her food and lodging as five pennies she hadnt told him where it was or she suspected hed have levied it higher shed seen the clients paying over their bills and the meal alone was generally five copper pennies its a good thing ive already got my winter clothes id never be able to afford them now the local musicians had a kind of unofficial uniform an echo of what the guild musicians wore where guildsmen always wore billowysleeved shirts with knots of purple and gold or silver ribbons on the shoulders of the sleeves the nonguild minstrels wore knots of multicolored ribbons instead rune had modified all her shirts to match and since no one but a musician ever sported that particular ornament she was known for what she was wherever she went during the summer shed even picked up an odd coin now and again because of that being stopped on the street by someone who wanted music at his party or by an impromptu gathering on a warm summer night that wanted to dance but that had been this summer a blast of cold wind hit the shutters shaking them and making the flames on all the lanterns waver rune was very glad of her proximity to the fireplace it was relatively cozy over here maddie and carly wore shawls while they worked tucking them into their skirt bands to keep their hands free she couldnt wear a shawl she had to keep hands and arms completely free if she hadnt been in this corner shed be freezing by now even though fiddling was a good way to keep warm the winters going to be a bad one all the signs pointed in that direction for that matter all the signs pointed to tomorrow being pretty miserable maybe i ought to just stay here tomorrow carly passed by scowling just to tweak the girls temper rune modulated into ive a wife since it was quite unlikely that carly would ever attain the married state it was an unmistakable taunt in her direction assuming the girl was bright enough to recognize it as such on the other hand staying here tomorrow means id have to put up with her during the day i cant stay in bed all day reading and its too cold to stay up there the whole day its not worth it maybe tonno could use some help in his shop she changed the tune again to winter winds as another blast hit the shutters and rattled them she told herself again that it could be worse she could be on the road right now she could be back in westhaven there were a hundred places she could be instead she was here with a certain amount of her keep assured sapphire drifted down the stairs dressed in a lovely soft kirtle of her signature blue that was a rarity the ladies didnt usually come downstairs after dark rune was a little surprised but then she saw why sapphire had come down while luxurious the ladys rooms were meant for one thing onlybesides sleep and then it got very crowded with more than two if clients wanted simple company and in a group rather than alone well the common room was the best place for that there were four older gentlemen waiting eagerly for sapphire at their table a pentangle board set up and ready for play if all they wanted was to play pentangle with a beautiful woman who would tease and flatter all of them until they went homeor one or more of them mustered the juice to take advantage of the other services herethen ambers would gladly provide that service and now rune knew why carly was especially sour tonight bad enough that she wasnt good enough to take her place upstairs worse that one of the ladies came down here into her sphere to attract all eyes and remind her of the fact for truly there wasnt an eye in the place that wasnt fastened on sapphire and well she knew it though carly was outofbounds she liked having the men look at her now no one would give her any more attention than the lantern on the table sapphire winked broadly at rune who raised her eyebrows and played her a special little flourish as she sat down rune knew all the ladies now and to her immense surprise she found that she liked all of them and never mind that one of them wasnt human that was topaz a lady she had met only after maddie had taken her aside and warned her not to show surprise if she could help it what topaz was rune had never had the temerity to ask another one of those creatures who like boony came fromelsewhere only topaz was nothing like boony she was thin and wiry and com pletely hairless from her toe and fingerclaws to the top of her head her golden eyes were set slantwise in her flat face which could have been catlike but she gave an impression less like a cat and far more like a lizard with her sinuosity and her curious stillness her skin was as gold as her eyes a curious metallic gold and rune often had the feeling that if she looked closely enough shed find that in place of skin topaz really had a hide covered in tiny scales the size of grains of dust but whatever else she looked like topaz was close enough to human to be very popular at ambers or else but rune didnt want to speculate on that she was still capable of being flustered by some of the things that went on here her fingers wandered into that wild oceanwhich made her think of pearl not because pearl was wild but because she reminded rune of the way the melody twisted and twined in complicated figures for all that it was a slow piece pearl was human altogether human though of a different race than anyone rune had ever seen she was tiny and very pale with skin as colorless as white quartz long black hair that fell unfettered right down to the floor and black obliquely slanted eyes she and topaz spent a great deal of their free time together rune suspected that there were more of topazs kind where pearl came from although neither of them had ever said anything to prove or disprove that occasionally rune would catch them whispering together in what sounded like a language composed entirely of sibilants but when rune had asked pearl if that was her native tongue the tiny woman had shaken her head and responded with a string of liquid syllables utterly unlike the hissing she had shared with topaz but for all their strangeness pearl and topaz were very friendly both to her and to maddie shawm and arden maddie frankly adored pearl and would gladly run any errand the woman asked of her shawm whiteblond and bashful with toolarge hands and feet was totally in awe of all the ladies and couldnt even get a word out straight when they were around arden tall and dark like rune teased them all like a younger brother and took great pleasure in being teased back he was never at a loss for words with any of them except for one the fourth lady ruby who was the perfect compliment to sapphire her eyes were a bright challenging green in contrast to sapphires dreamy blue her hair was a brilliant red cut shorter than runes her figure was athletic and muscular and she kept it that way by running every morning when she rose and following that by two hours of gymnastic exercises where sapphire was soft and lush she was muscle and whipcord where sapphire was gentle she was wild where sapphire was languid she was quicksilver sapphires even temper was matched by her fiery changeability predictably enough they were best friends and where arden could tease sapphire until she collapsed in a fit of giggles he became tonguetied and silent in the presence of ruby and carly hated that well fortunately ruby was fully occupied at the momentso arden could tease sapphire as she teased the old gentlemen at her table and carly only glowered she didnt fume all four of them plus maddie were the first female friends rune had ever had she found herself smiling a little at that and smiled a bit more when she realized that her fingers had started home home home well this was the closest thing shed ever had to a home one by one the four ladies had introduced themselves over the course of her first few weeks at ambers and gradually rune had pieced together their stories topazs history was the most straightforward topaz like boony had been a bondling and had been taken up for the same reason failure to pay tax and tithe she had been a small merchanttrader until that moment amber had bought her contract from one of the other houses at pearls hysterical insistence when the tiny creature learned that topaz was in thrall there and just as well topaz had said once one more night there and something would have been dead it might have been a client it might have been me i cannot say looking at her strange golden eyes and the wildness lurking in them rune could believe it it was not that topaz had objected to performing what she called concubine duties evidently that was a trade with no stigma attached in her and pearls country it was some of the other things the house had demanded she perform her eyes had darkened and the pupils had widened until they were all that was to be seen when shed said that rune had not asked any further questions pearl had come as a concubine in the train of a foreign trader when he had died she had been left with nowhere to go by the laws of her land she was propertyand should have been sent back with the rest of his belongings but by the laws of nolton even a bondling was freed by the death of his bondholder and no one was willing to part with the expense of transporting her home again but she had learned of flower street and of ambers from her nowdead master and had come looking for a place originally she had intended to stay only long enough to earn the money to return home but she found that she liked it here and so stayed on amassing savings enough to one day retire to a place of her own and devote herself to her other avocation the painting of tiny pictures on eggshells as curiosities her work fetched good prices and would be enough to supplement her savings sapphires story was the one she had obliquely referred to that first morning when rune had met her carried off and despoiled by a rich young merchants son she had been abandoned when her pregnancy first became apparent she had been befriended by tonno who had found her fainting on his doorstep and taken to amber what became of the child rune did not know though she suspected that amber had either rid the girl of it or she had miscarried naturally amber had seen the haggard remains of sapphires great beauty and had set herself to bringing it back to full bloom again and had succeeded then there was ruby who had been a wild child willful and determined to be everything her parents hated and feared possibly because they had been so determined that she become a good little daughter of the churchperhaps even a clericpriest or a nun she had run away from the convent got herself deflowered by the first man she ran across a minstrel she had confided to rune and i dont know who was the more amazed him or me and discovered that she not only had a talent for the games of man and maid she craved the contact so she had come to nolton working my way examined each of the brothels on flower street then came straight to amber demanding a place upstairs amber much amused by her audacity and impressed by her looks had agreed to a compromisea week of trial under the name garnet promising her a promotion to ruby and full house status if she did well she was ruby within two days ruby was the latest of the ladies a fact that galled carly no end carly had petitioned amber for a trial so many times that the lady had forbidden her to speak of it ever again she could not understand why ruby had succeeded where she had failed sapphire left the gentlemen for a moment and drifted over to runes corner seeing where she was headed rune brought her current song to an end finishing it just as sapphire reached the fireplace the young gentleman who had earlier requested a song hardly breathed as he watched her move his eyes wide his face a little flushed rune dear each of the gentleman has a song hed like you to play and i have a request too if you dont mind sapphire said softly with an angelic smile i know you must be ready for a break but with five more songs i think dear lerra might be ready toyou know rune smiled back anything for you ladies sapphire and you know it i didnt get to play much out on the street today my fingers arent the least tired that was a little lie but five more songs werent going to hurt them any thank you dear sapphire breathed her face aglow with gratitude that was one of the remarkable things about sapphire whatever she felt she felt completely and never bothered to hide it all right this is what wed like fair maid of the valley four sisters silver sandals the green stone and the dream of the heart can you do all those in my sleep rune told her with a grin sapphire rewarded her with another of her brilliant smiles and started to turn to go but then she turned back a moment you know i must have thought this a thousand times and i never told you i am terribly envious of your talent rune you were good when you first arrivedyoure quite good nowand some day people are going to praise your name from one end of this land to the other i wish i had your gift well rune said cautiously i dont know about that ive a long way to go before im that good and a hundred things could happen to prevent it besides she grinned its one guild bard in a thousand that ever gets that much renown and i doubt im going to be that one but sapphire shook her head i tell you true rune and ill tell you something else for all the money and the soft living and the rest of it if i had a fraction of your talent id never set foot upstairs id stay in the common room and be an entertainer for the rest of my life all four of us know how very hard you work we admire you tremendously and i want you to know that then she turned and went back to her little gathering leaving rune flattered and no little dumbfounded they admired her beautiful graceful with everything they could ever want or need and they admired her this was the first time she had ever been admired by anyone and as she started the first of the songs sapphire had requested she felt a little warm current of real happiness rising from inside her and giving her fingers a new liveliness even jib thought i was a little bit daft for spending all my time with music she thought giving the tune a little extra flourish that made sapphire half turn and wink at her from across the room tonno keeps thinking about what i should be learning maddie doesnt understand how i feel about music and even to lady amber im just another part of the common room thats the very first time anyone has ever just thought that what i did was worth it in and of itself the warm feeling stayed with her right till the end of the fifth song when sapphire laughingly drew one of the gentlemen to his feet and up the stairs after her she played one more songand then she began to feel the twinges in her fingers that heralded trouble if she wasnt careful time for a break she threw the young gentleman a goodnatured wink which he returned and set off to the kitchen for a bit of warm cider since it was useless to ask carly for anything they admire me whod have thought it rune let her fingers prance their way across her lutestrings forgetting that she was chilled in the spell of the music she was creating tonno listened to her play the piece she had first seen back in the summer and thought impossible with all its runs and triplepickings with his eyes closed and his finger marking steady time she played it gracefully with relish for the complexities with all the repeats and embellishments she couldnt believe how easy it seemedand how secondnature it was to read and play these little black notes on the page she couldnt have conceived of this back in the summer but one day everything had fallen into place and she hadnt once faltered since she came to the end and waited quietly for her teacher to say something when he didnt when he didnt even open his eyes she obeyed an impish impulse and put down the lute picking up lady rose instead then she started in on the piece againthis time playing it on the fiddle of course it was a little different on the fiddle she stumbled and faltered on a couple of passages where the fingering that was natural for the lute was anything but on the fiddle but she got through it intact tonnos eyes had flown open in surprise at the first few bars he stared at her all through the piece clearly dumbfounded right up until the moment that she ended with a flourish she put the fiddle and bow down and waited for him to say something he took a deep breath well he said youve just made up my mind for me dear if ever i was desirous of a sign from god that was it she wrinkled her brow puzzled whats that supposed to mean she asked it was just that lutepiece thats all just the lutepiecewhich you proceeded to play through on an instrument it wasnt intended for tonno shook his head rune ive been debating this for the past two weeks but i cant be selfish anymore youre beyond me on both your instruments i cant teach you any more it was her turn to stare licking suddenly dry lips not sure of what to say butbut i this was too sudden too abrupt she thought her heart catching with something like fear she wasnt ready for it all to end at least not yet im not ready to leave theres still the whole winter yet the faire isnt until midsummerwhat am i supposed to do between now and then dont look at me like that girl tonno said a little gruffly rubbing his eyebrow with a hand encased in fingerless gloves just because youre beyond my teaching that doesnt mean youre ready for what you want to do imnot she said dazedly not certain whether to be relieved or disappointed no tonno replied firmly youre beyond my ability to contribute to your teachingin musicbut youre not good enough to win one of the bard apprenticeships and ive heard some of your tunes dear you shouldnt settle for less than a bardic position of all the positions offered at the faire only a handful are for bardic teaching and you are just not good enough to beat the ninetynine other contenders for those positions good news and bad all in the same bite will i ever be she asked doubtfully of course you will he snapped as if he was annoyed at her doubt i have a damned good ear and i can tell you when you will be ready what well have to do is find some of my truly complicated music the things i put away because they were beyond my meager capabilities to play youll practice them until your fingers are blue and then youll learn to transpose music from other instruments to yours and play that until your fingers are blue practice is what you need now and practice by all thats holy is what youre going to get i guess its not over yet not even close she sighed but he wasnt finished with his plans for her immediate future then theres the matter of your other lessons he continued inexorably ive taught you how to read music now ill teach you how to write it as wellby ear without playing it first on your instruments ill see that you learn as much as i know of other styles and of the work of the great bards and then my dear im going to drill you in reading history in particular until you think youve turned scholar oh no she said involuntarily while she was reading with more competence it still wasnt something that came easily unlike music she still had to work at understanding history in particular was a great deal of hard work oh yes he told her with a smile if youre going to become a guild bard youre going to have to compete with boys whove been learning from scholars all their lives youre going to have to know plenty about the pastwhos who and more importantly why because if you inadvertently offend the wrong person he sliced his finger dramatically across his neck she shuddered reflexively as a breath of cold that came out of nowhere touched the back of her neck now he said clearing the music away from the stand in front of her and stacking it neatly in the drawer of the cabinet beside him put your instruments back in their cases and come join me by the stove i want you to know some hard truths and what youre getting yourself into she cased the lute and lady rose obediently and pulled her short cloak a little tighter around her shoulders tonnos stove didnt give off a lot of heat partially because fuel was so expensive that he didnt stoke it as often as amber fueled her fireplaces rune would have worried more about him in this cold except that he obviously had a lot of ploys to keep himself warm he spent a lot of time at ambers in the winter maddie said nursing a few drinks and keeping some of the waiting clients company with a game of pentangle or cards and amber smiled indulgently and let him stay i wonder what it is that he did for her that theyre such good friends rune followed him to the back of the livingquarters bringing her chair with her and settled herself beside him as he huddled up to the metal stove he wrapped an old comforter around himself and raised his bushy gray eyebrows at her now first of all as far as i know there are no girls in the guild he stated flatly so right from the beginning youre going to have a problem she nodded shed begun to suspect something of the sort shed noticed that no one wearing the purple ribbonknots was female and shed discovered her first weeks out busking that every time she wore anything even vaguely feminine out on the street she got propositions eventually she figured out why there were plenty of freelance whores out on the street pretending to busk with their permits stuck on their hats like anyone else she found out why when shed asked the dancers that performed by the fountain every night the permit for busking was cheaper by far than the fees to the whores guild so many whores afraid of being caught and thrown into the workhouse for soliciting without a permit or guild badge bought busking permits the church which didnt approve of either whores or musicians ignored the deception the city frowned but looked the other way so long as those on the street bought some sort of permit real musicians wore the ribbon knots on their sleeves and whores didnt but most folk hadnt caught on to that distinction so the result was undoubtedly that female musicians had a reputation in the guild for being something else entirely but stillthe auditions should weed out those with other professions shouldnt they and why on earth would a whore even come to the trials the reason there arent any females in the guild he continued is because they arent allowed to audition at the faire ever she stared at him anger warming her cheek at the realization that he hadnt bothered to say anything to her about this little problem with her plans before this i imagine youre wondering why i didnt tell you that in the first place he raised an eyebrow and she blushed that he could read her so easily its simple enough i didnt think it would be a problem as long as you were prepared for it youve carried off the boydisguise perfectly well ive seen you do it and fool anyone who just looks at the surface of things i dont see any reason why you cant get your audition as a boy and tell them the truth after youve won your place she flushed again this time at her own stupidity she should have figured that out for herself but wont they be angry she asked a little doubtfully tonno shrugged that i cant tell you i dont know i do know that if youve been so outstanding that youve surprised each and every one of them if they are any kind of musician at all theyll overlook your sex they might make you keep up the disguise while youre an apprentice but once youre a master you can do what you want and they can be hanged that seemed logical and she could see the value of the notion so long as she went along with their ideas of what was proper theyd give her what she wantedbut once she had it she would be free of any restraints they werent likely to take her title away once you were a master bard you were always a master no matter what you did they hadnt even taken away the title from master marley who had lulled his patron sire jacoby to sleep and let in his enemies by the postern gate to kill him and all his family theyd turned him over to the church and the high king for justice but theyd left him his title not that it had done much good in a dungeon i intend you to leave here with enough knowledge crammed into that thick head of yoursand enough skill in those fingersto give every boy at the trials a run for his money tonno said firmly i trust you dont plan to settle for less than an apprenticeship to a guild bard he raised one eyebrow she shook her head stubbornly guild minstrels only played music guild bards created it there were songs in her head dying to get out good tonno nodded with satisfaction thats what i hoped youd say youre too good a musician to be wasted busking out in the street you should have noble patrons and the only way youre going to get that is through the guild thats the only way to rise in any profession through the guilds guildsman keep standards high and craftsmanship important and thats not all if youre good enough the guild will make certain that youre rewarded by backing you like what she asked curiously and tucked her hands under her knees to warm them oh like master bard gwydain tonno replied his eyes focused somewhere past her head as if he was remembering something i heard him play once you know amazing he couldnt have been more than twenty but he played like no one ive ever heardand that was twenty years ago before he was at the height of his powers ten years ago the high king himself rewarded master gwydainmade him laurel sire gwydain and gave him lands and a royal pension a great many of the songs ive been teaching you are hisspellbound captive dream of the heart that wild ocean black rose oh he must have written hundreds before he was through amazing he fell silent as the light in the shop began to dim with the coming of evening soon rune would have to leave to return to ambers but curiosity got the better of her after all if gwydain had been twenty or so twenty years ago he couldnt be more than forty now yet she had never heard anyone mention his name what happened to him she asked breaking into tonnos reverie he started a little and wrinkled his brow you know thats the odd part he said slowly its a mystery no one ive talked to knows what happened to him he seems to have dropped out of sight about five or ten years ago and no one has seen nor heard of him since thereve been rumors but thats all what kind of rumors she persisted feeling an urgent need to know though she couldnt have told why right after he vanished there was a rumor hed died tragically but no one knew howright after that there was another that hed taken vows renounced the world and gone into holy orders tonno shook his head i dont believe either one if you want to know the truth it seems to me that if hed really died thered have been a fancy funeral and word of it all over the countryside and if hed taken holy orders hed be composing church music theres never been so much as a hint of scandal about him so that cant be it i just dont know rune had the feeling that tonno was very troubled by this disappearancewell so was she it left an untidy hole a mystery that cried to be cleared up what if he gave up music for some reason she asked then if hed gone into the church hed have just vanished give up music not likely tonno snorted you cant keep a bard from making music its something theyre born to do no he shook his head vehemently something odd happened to him and thats for sureand the guild is keeping it quiet maybe he had a brainstorm and he cant play or even speak clearly maybe he took wasting fever and hes too weak to do anything maybe he ran off to the end of the world looking for new things but something out of the ordinary happened to him i would bet my last copper on it its a mystery he changed the subject then back to quizzing rune on the history shed been reading and they did not again return to the subject of master bard gwydain eventually darkness fell and it was time for her to leave she bundled herself up in her cloak slung her instruments across her back underneath it to keep them from the cold and let herself out of the shop wanting to spare tonno the trip up through the cold darkened store as she hurried along the street towards ambers the wind whipping around her ankles and crawling under her hood until she shivered with cold she found herself thinking about the mystery she agreed with tonno unless she were at deaths door or otherwise crippled she would not be able to stop making music if gwydain still lived he must be plying his birthright somewhere and if he was dead someone should know about it if he was dead and the guild was keeping it quiet there must be a reason and ill find it out she decided suddenly when i get into the guild ill find it out no matter what they cant keep it a secret forever chapter ten rune fitted the key tonno had given her into the old lock on the front door of the shop and tried to turn it nothing happened frozen again she thought and swore under her breath at the key the ancient lock and the damned weather she pulled the key out and tucked it under her armpit to warm it wincing as the cold metal chilled her through her heavy sweater and flinching again as a gust of wind blew a swirl of snow down her neck she glanced up and down the silent street the only traffic was a pair of tradesmen muffled in cloaks much heavier than hers probably hurrying to open their own shops and a couple of apprenticeboys out on errands other than that there was no one the slatecolored sky overhead spilled thin skeins of flurries and the wind sent them skating along the street like ghostsnakes whatever could have been in gods mind when he invented winter thriceforsaken season it didnt look like a good day for tradebut scholars made up half of tonnos business and days like today she had learned meant business from scholars theyd be inside all day fussing over their libraries or collections of curiosities and discover they had somehow neglected to buy that book or bone or odd bit of carving theyd looked at back in the summer and now of course they simply must have it so theyd wait until one of their students arrived for a special lesson and the hapless youth would be sent out on quest with a purchaseorder and a purse willhe nillhe those sales made a big difference to tonno especially in winter and made it worth keeping the shop open she pulled out the key and stuck it back into the lock quickly before it had a chance to chill down again this time when she put pressure on it the lock moved stiffly but the door did unlock and she hurriedly pushed it open and shoved it closed against another snowbearing gust of wind tonno she called out im here she flipped the little sign in the window from closed to open and made her way back to the counter where she raised the hinged part and flipped it over tonno she called again im awake rune he replied his voice distant and a little weak im just notout of bed yet she frowned he didnt sound well shed better get back to him before he decided to be stubborn and open the shop himself in weather like this or so amber told her tonno did better to stay in bed she pushed the curtain in the doorway aside and hurried over to his bedside before he had a chance to struggle out of the motley selection of comforters quilts and old blankets he had piled one atop the other so that the holes and worn spots in each of them were compensated for by the sound spots in the others she reached him and had taken his hand in both of hers examining the joints with a critical eye as she had expected they were swollen red and painful to look at you arent going anywhere she said firmly theres a storm out there and its mucking up your hands and every other bone youve got id wager he frowned but it was easy to see his heart wasnt in the protest but i didnt get up yesterday except so you dont get up today whats the difference she asked reasonably i can mind the shop well probably get a customer or two but not more thats hardly work at all and im not busking today its too damned cold and ill not risk lady rose to weather like this i might just as well mind the shop and give your lessons towho is it todayanny and ket i thought so theyre bare beginners easy i could teach them half asleep and their parents dont care if its me or you who teaches them so long as they get the lessons theyve paid for but you arent benefiting by this tonno said fretfully you should be out earning a few coppers she shrugged theres no one out there to earn coppers from i picked up a little in my hat at ambers last night enough for the tax and tithe and i am benefiting she gave him a wide grin if im here im not there and i dont have to listen to carlys bullying and whining you havent been tormenting her have you tonno asked sharply with more force than she expected she gave him a quizzical look wondering what notion hed gotten into his head surely carly didnt deserve any sympathy from tonno not unless you consider ignoring her to be tormenting her she replied straightening his bedcovers then putting a kettle on the stove and a brick to heat beneath it i try not to let her bother me but she does bully me every chance she gets and she says nasty things about my playing to the customers shed probably say worse than that about me but the only thing she can think of is that since i dress like a boy sometimes i might be a poppet or an androgyn thats hardly going to be an insult in a place like ambers its just too bad for her that the clients all have ears of their own and they dont agree with her maddie is the one who teases her tonno relaxed good but be careful rune ive been thinking about her and wondering why amber keeps her on and i think now i know the reason i think shes a spy for the church a what rune turned from her work to gape at him carly whatever for what reason would the church have to spy on a brothel i can think of several reasons he said his face and voice troubled the most obvious is to report on how many clients come and go and how much money they tip in the common room to make certain that all taxes and tithes have been paid for thats fairly innocuous as things go since we both know perfectly well that all the fees are paid at ambers and on time too theres another reason too though and its one that would just suit the girls sour spirit right down to the core oh she asked a cold lump of worry starting in the pit of her stomach whats that she couldnt imagine what interest the church would find in a brotheland if she couldnt imagine it it must be something darkly sinister she began wondering about all those rumors shed heard of church priests being versed in dark magics when his next words cleared her mind entirely fornication he said fornication is a sin rune although the laws of the city say nothing about it the only lawful congress by the churchs rule is between man and woman who are wedded by church ceremony and by church rule sins must be confessed and paid for either by penance or donation her first impulse had been to laugh but second thought proved that tonnos concern was real though less sinister than her fears she nodded thoughtfully so if carly keeps a list of who comes and goes and gives it to the church the next time guildsman weaver shows up to confess and do penance if he doesnt list his visit to ambershes in trouble tonno sighed and reached eagerly for the mug of hot tea she handed to him and for the men of means who visit ambers the trouble will mean that the priest will confront them with their omission impress them with his supernatural understanding and assign additional penance additional guiltmoney you mean she finished cynically and meanwhile no doubt carlys recordkeeping is paying off her sins for working in a brothel in the first place she sniffed angrily oh that makes excellent sense tonno and it explains a lot since carly cant have a place at ambers shell do her best to foul the bedding for everyone else and shell come out sanctimoniously lilywhite she picked up the hot brick and tucked it into the foot the bed replacing it under the stove with another the heat did a great deal of good for tonno already there was a bit more color in his face and some of the lines of pain around his eyes and mouth were easing he took another sip of tea and nodded do you see what i mean by suiting the girls nature likely shes even convinced herself that this was why she came to work there in the first place to keep an eye on the welfare of others souls no doubt rune said dryly she stirred oatmeal into a pot of water and set it on top of the stove beside the kettle to cook shell always want the extreme of anything if she cant be a highly paid whore shell be a saint what i cant understand is why amber lets her stay onyou pretty much implied that she knows what carlys up to tonno laughed though the worry lines about his mouth had not eased any thats the cleverness of our lady amber dear as long as carly is in place she knows who the spy is if there is truly someone whose reputation with the church is so delicate that he must not be seen at ambers then all the lady needs to do is make certain carly doesnt see him and i suspect lady amber has whatever official carly reports to quite completely bribed wiser in the ways of bribery than she had been a scant six months ago rune nodded if she got rid of carly someone else might get his agent in and shed have to find out what his price was but if she stopped bribing the old official hed report on what carly had given him already tonno shrugged amber knows whats going on whats being reported and saves money this way as well and what does carly cost her really nothing she wouldnt be paying anyway shed have to bribe someone in the church to be easy with the clients no matter what rune shook her head i guess ill have to put up with it and be grateful that i personally dont care that much about the state of my soul to worry about what working in a whorehouse is going to do to it im probably damned anyway for having the poor taste to be born on the wrong side of the blankets thats the spirit tonno laughed a little and she cheered up herself seeing that he was able to laugh without hurting himself she gave the room a sketchy cleaning and washed last nights supper dishes by then the oatmeal was ready and she spooned out enough for both of them sweetening it with honey she ate a lot faster than he did he wasnt even half finished with his portion when shed cleaned her bowl of the last spoonful she put the dish into the pan of soapsuds just as the bell to the front door tinkled he started to get up from sheer habit but she glared at him until he sank back into the pillows and hurried to the front of the shop as shed anticipated since it was too early for either of the children having music lessons to arrive the person peering into the shop with a worried look on his face was one of the university students the red stripe on the shoulders of his cloak told her he was a student of philosophy good they had moneyand by extension so did their teachers only a rich man could afford to let his son idle away his time on something like philosophy and rich men paid well for their sons lessons can i help you my lord she said into the silence of the shop startling him he jumped then peered shortsightedly at her as she approached is this the shop of he consulted a strip of paper in his hand tonno alendor yes it is my lord she said and waited he looked at her doubtfully i was told to seek out this tonno himself he said the set of his chin told her that he was of the kind of nature to be stubborn but the faint quiver of doubt in his voice also told her he could be bullied another of tonnos lessons how to read people and know how to deal with them master tonno is ill i am his niece she lied smoothly he entrusts everything to me the soft round chin firmed as the spoiled young man who was not used to being denied what he wanted emerged in response to that warning so did her voice if you truly wish to disturb him if you feel you must pester a poor sick old man i can take you to his bedsideand ill make you pay dearly for it in embarrassment her voice promisedbut hell only tell you the same thing young man her tone and the scolding young man she appended to her little speech gave him the impression she was much older than he had thought nearsighted as he was and in the darkness of the shop he would probably believe it and as she had hoped he must have a female relative somewhere that was accustomed to browbeating him into obedience his resistance collapsed immediately scholar mardake needs a book he said meekly he looked at it last summer and he was certain he had purchased it but now he finds he hadnt and he has to have it for his monograph and she let him rattle on for far too long about the monograph the importance of it and how it would enhance scholar mardakes already illustrious reputation and by extension the reputations and status of all of mardakes students what a fool she tried not to yawn in his face but it was difficult jib had more sense in his big toe than this puffedup popinjay had in his entire body and of all the things to be overproud ofthis endless debate over frothy nothings like the question of what a soul truly consisted of made her weary to the bone if they would spend half the time on questions of a practical nature instead of this choplogic drivel the world would be better run finally he came to the point the name of the book by whom she asked finally getting a word in of all of the scholars the philosophers were by far and away the windiest athold derelas he replied loftily as if he expected that she had never heard of the great man ah youre in luck she replied immediately we have two copies does your master prefer the annotated version by wasserman or the simple translation by bartol he gaped at her she stifled a giggle in truth she wouldnt have known the books were there if she hadnt replaced a volume of history by lyam derfan to its place beside them the day before it was bad enough that shed known of the book but shed offered two choices and he didnt know how to react hed loftily assumed no doubt that she was the next thing to illiterate and shed just confounded him hed have been less startled to hear a pig sing or an ape recite poetry she decided to rub the humiliation in if your master is doing a monograph covering derelas work as a whole he would probably want the annotated version she continued blithely but if all he wants is derelas comments on specific subjects hed be better off with the bartol translation now the young man had to refer to the slip of paper in his hand he looked from it to her and back again and couldnt seem to come to a decision his face took on a pinched look of miserable confusion perhaps hed better have both she suggested no knowledge is ever wasted after all the wasserman is rare he may find enough of interest in it for an entirely new monograph the student brightened up considerably yes of course he said happily and rune had no doubt that he would parrot her words back to his scholar as if they were his own and suggesting that the shopgirl hadnt known what a rarity the wasserman was so that hed gotten the book at a bargain price before he could change his mindit was his masters money he was spending after all and not his ownshe rolled the floortoceiling ladder over to the d section and scampered up it the student virtuously averted his eyes blushing lest he have an inadvertent glimpse of feminine flesh as if there was anything to be seen under her double skirts double leggings and boots besides being the most longwinded philosophers were also the most prudish of the scholarsat least the ones that rune had met she much preferred the company of the natural scientists and the mathematicians the former were full of the wonders of the world and eager to share the strange stories of birds and beasts the latter tended to make up for the times when they lost themselves in the dry world of numbers with a vengeance and both welcomed women into their ranks far oftener than the philosophers doubtless because women are too sensible to be distracted for long by maunderings about airy nothings she came down with both books clutched in her hand eluding his grasp for them so easily he might not even have been standing there and took them behind the counter there she consulted the book where tonno noted the prices of everything in the shop by category it was a little tedious for things were listed in the order he had acquired them and not in the alphabetical order in which they were ranked on the shelves but finally she had the prices of both of them and looked up reaching beneath the counter for a piece of rough paper to wrap them in the wasserman as i said is rare she said deftly making a package and tying it with a bit of string master tonno has it listed at forty silver pieces his mouth gaped and he was about to utter a gasp of outrage she continued before he had a chance the other is more common as i said it is only twenty now as it is master tonnos policy to offer a discount to steady clients like your scholar i believe i can let you have both for fifty she batted her eyelashes ingenuously at him after all master tonno does trust me in all things and it isnt often we have a fine young man like you in the shop the appeal to his vanity killed whatever protest he had been about to make his mouth snapped shut and he counted out the silver quickly before she could change her mind he knew very wellalthough he did not know that she knewhis scholar was anything but a steady customer he bought perhaps a book or two in a year what he did not knowand since he was not a regular customer neither would his scholarwas that she had inflated the listed prices of both books by ten silver pieces each she had heard other scholars speaking when she had tended the shop before chuckling over tonnos prices she heard a lot of things tonno didnt the scholars tended to ignore her as insignificant so whenever she had sold a book lately she had inflated the price scholars would never argue with her assuming no woman would be so audacious as to cheat a scholar their students never argued with her because she bullied and flattered them the same way she had treated this boy and with the same effect and when she added the nonsense about a discount they generally kept their mouths shut she handed him the parcel and he hurried out into the cold she dropped the taxes and tithes into the appropriate boxes and pocketed the rest to take back to tonno merchants with shops never went to a church stall the way buskers and peddlers did they kept separate tax and tithe boxes which were locked with keys only the church collectors had the collectors would come around once a week with a city constable to take what had accumulated in the boxes noting the amounts in their books rune actually liked the collector who serviced tonnos shop she hadnt expected to but the first day he had appeared when she was on duty he had charmed her completely brother bryan was a thin energetic man with a marvelously dry sense of humor and was so far as she could tell absolutely honest tonno seemed convinced of his honesty as well and greeted him as a friend and whenever she was here and tonno was ill he would make a point of coming to the back of the shop to see how the old man was faring pass the time of day with him and see if he could find some way to entertain tonno a little before he continued on his rounds of the other shops she dipped a quill in a bit of ink and ran a delicate line through the titles of the two books to indicate they had been sold and returned to tonno he sat up with interest and demanded to know what had happened he shook his head over her duplicity with the spurious discount but she noted that he did not demand that she refund the extra ten silvers you should update your prices she said scolding a little you havent changed some of them from the time when your father ran this shop i know you havent because ive seen the prices still in his handwriting he sighed but people come here for bargains rune he replied plaintively even when father had the shop this district was changing over from shops to residences nowits so out of the way that no one would ever come here at all if they didnt know theyd get a bargain you can make them think youve given them a bargain and still not cheat yourself she said taking the empty bowl from the floor beside his bed and swishing it in the painfully cold washwater until it was clean i hope you put what was due in the tax box and not what was in the book he said suddenly she grimaced but nodded of course i did although i cant for the life of me see why that scholar isnt likely to tell anyone how much he paid and you need every silver you can get we may not have another sale for a week or more she put the bowl back on the shelf with a thud because its our responsibility rune he replied patiently as if she was a child he said that every time she brought up the subject of taxes and she was tired to death of hearing it he never once explained what he meant and she just couldnt see it there were too many rich ones she suspected of diddling the tax rolls to get by with paying less than they should why is it our responsibility she asked fiercely and why ours i dont see anyone else leaping forward to throw money in the tax and tithe boxes you and amber keep saying that and i dont see any reason for it he just looked at her somberly until she flushed he made her feel as if she had said something incredibly irresponsible and that made no sense she didnt know why she should feel embarrassed by her outburst but she did and that made her angry as well rune he said slowly as if he had just figured out that she was serious there truly is a reason for it now do you really want to hear the reason or do you want to be like all those emptyheaded fools out there who grumbled about taxes and cheat when they can and never once think about who or what theyre cheating well if theres a reason id certainly like to hear it she muttered skeptically and sat down in the chair beside his bed nothing ive seen yet has given me a reason to think differently and youre the one who taught me to trust my eyes and not just parrot what ive been told youve lived here for almost half a year tonno replied i know that theres a world of difference between nolton and your little village there are things we do here that no one would ever think of doing back in westhaven she made a face but he continued i know im saying something obvious but because its obvious you might not have thought about it there are things that people take for granted after theyve been here as long as you have things that are invisible but that we couldnt do without dungsweepers for instance who cleans up the droppings in westhaven well no one she admitted it gets kicked to one side or trodden into the mud thats about it but if we did that here wed be kneedeep in manure in a week tonno pointed out and she nodded agreement who do you think pays the dungsweepers i never wondered about it she admitted with surprise i thought the dung must be valuable to someonefor composting or something it is and they sell it to farmers but thats not enough to compensate a man for going about with a barrow all day collecting it tonno pointed out the city pays themright out of that tax box she rubbed her hands together to warm them about to say something but he continued who guards the streets of westhaven by day or night from robbers drunks troublemakers and thieves she laughed because it was something else that would never have occurred to her old village to worry about no one nobodys abroad very late and if they are theres no one to trouble them if a drunk falls on his face in the street he can lie there until morning but she couldnt keep the laughter from turning uneasy it might not have occurred to them but it would have been a good thing if it had a single constable could have prevented a lot of trouble in the past if thered been someone like the city guard or constables around would those bullies have tried to molest her that day even one adult witness would likely have prevented the entire incident how many times had something like that happened to someone who couldnt defend herself was that how stara had gotten into trouble in the first place as a child too young to know better was that why she had gone on to trade her favors so cheaply if that incident with jon and his friends hadnt occurred would rune have been quite so willing to seek a life out in the wider world that will do for a little village but what would we do here tonno asked gently there are thousands of people living here most are honest but some are not whats a shopkeeper to do spend his nights waiting with a dagger in hand couldnt peoplewellband together and just have one of them watch for all she asked selfconsciously flushing knowing it wasnt any kind of a real answer i suppose they could pay him for his troubles then she shook her head thats basically what the constables are arent they thats what youre trying to tell me and theyre paid from taxes too constables dungsweepers the folk who repair and maintain the wells and the aqueducts and a hundred more jobs youd never think of and likely wouldnt see ratcatchers and streettenders gatekeepers and judges gaolers and the men who make certain food sold in the marketplace is what its said to be tonno leaned forward earnestly and she saw that the light was fading i suppose youre right she lit a candle at the stove but he wasnt going to be distracted from his point thats what a government is all about rune he said more as if he was pleading with her than as if he was trying to win an argument taking care of all the things that come up when a great many people live together and yes most of those things each of us could do for himself taking care of his own protection and his familys and minding the immediate area around his home and shopbut that would take a great deal of time and while the expenses would be less they would come in lumps and in the way of things at the worst possible time he laughed ruefully and so did she it hadnt been that long ago theyd had one of those lump expenses when the roof sprang a leak and theyd had it patched she could see his pointbut not his passion and for something as cold and abstract as a government but you dont like paying taxes either she said in protest and he nodded no i dont thats quite true there are some specific taxes that i think are quite unfair i pay a yeartax leavened against the shop simply because i own it rather than renting and when my father died i paid a deathtax in order to inherit i dont think those taxes are particularly fair buthe held up his hand to forestall her commentsthose are only two taxes with a government that could leaven far more taxes than it does ive heard of cities where they tax money earned then tax the goods sold then tax every stage a product goes through as it changes hands she shook her head baffled i dont understand she said how can they do that he explained further take a cow it is taxed when it is sold as a weanling taxed again when it is brought to market the rawhide is taxed when it comes into the hands of the tanners taxed again when it goes to the leatherbroker taxed when it is sold to the shoemaker then taxed a final time when the shoes are sold her head swam at the thought of all those taxes that kind of taxation is abusive when the time comes that the price of an object is doubled to pay the taxes on it that is abusive and governments of that nature are generally abusive of the people that live under them as well tonno leaned back into his pillows and he looked like a man who was explaining something he cared about deeply as deeply as i care about music she thought in surprise she had found his secret passion and it was nothing like what she would have expected before you ask he told her carefully as if he was weighing each word for its true value i can tell you that youll get a different definition of an abusive government from nearly everyone who cares to think about such things in general though i would say that when a government is more concerned with keeping itself in power and keeping its officials in luxury whether they were elected to the posts appointed or inherited the position then that government is abusive as well government is what takes care of things beyond you good government cares for the wellbeing of the people it serves abusive government cares only for its own wellbeing the fewer the people the less government you need does that seem clear to you she thought about it for a moment shed begun listening to this mostly because she respected tonno and this seemed to mean a great deal to him but the more hed said the more she began to get a glimmering of a wider sphere than the one she was used to dealing withand it intrigued her in the way the things the mathematicians said intrigued her and now she realized that amber had said basically the same things in cryptic little bits over the past several months reluctantly she had to agree that they were right stillthis was the real world she was living in and not some philosophers book where everyone did as he should and everything was perfect but what about the stories i keep hearing she protested taking one last shot at disproving his theories the things about the inspectors who take bribes and the gaolers who turn people loose no matter what theyve done so long as theyve got money enough what about the clerics at the church stalls wholl take all your money as tax or tithe then insist you owe as much over again for the one you didnt pay i bet they pocket the difference tonno shrugged then chuckled a little though sadly youre dealing with people rune and the real world not a philosophers ideal sphere he said echoing her very thoughts people are corruptible and any time you have money changing hands someone is likely to give in to temptation so ill give you another definition since theres always going to be corruption a good government is one where you have a manageable level of corruption he laughed at that one she made a face but laughed with him right ill grant your stand on taxes but what about tithes whats the church doing to earn all that money they take in as much as the city and they arent hiring the ratcatchers whats the church doingor what is it supposed to be doing rather he asked his expression hardening what its supposed to be doing is to care for those who cant care for themselvesto feed and clothe the impoverished to heal the sick to bring peace where there is war to be family to the orphaned find justice for those who have been denied it the priests are bound to make certain every child can read and write and cipher so that it can grow up to find a place or earn a living without being cheated thats what its supposed to be doing that and give the time to god that few of us have the leisure for so that hopefully god will know when we have need of his powers having run out of solutions for ourselves she nodded that was indeed what the village priest was supposed to deal withwhen he wasnt too busy with being holy that is he seemed to spend a great deal of time convincing the villagers that he was much more important than they were tonno took note of her abstracted nod and we all pay tithes to see that it gets donebecause one day i may be too ill to care for myself you may find yourself in a town on the brink of war your friends child may lose its parents you might find yourself in the rightbut up against the sire himself with no hope from his courts and some of that is done but she asked a little more harshly than she intended nobody had seen that justice was done for heror jib had she been raped would the priest have lifted a finger to see that the bullies paid not a chance more likely hed have condemned her for leading them on but not enough to account for the enormous amount of money the church takes in tonno replied his mouth a tight grim line and i could be in very deep trouble if you were ever to repeat my words to a church official other than say brother bryan the church is an example of an abusive government it punishes according to whim or according to who can afford to buy it off within church ranks dissenters must walk softly and reform by infinitesimal degrees if at all the church is a dangerous enemy to haveand theres only one reason why it isnt more dangerous than it is it is so involved in its own internal politics that it rarely moves to look outside its walls and for that i am profoundly grateful this last colloquy aroused intense feelings of disquiet in runes heart she was glad when he fell silent shed never thought much about the churchbut the few glimpses shed had from inside in the hostels only confirmed what tonno had just told her if the church as a whole ever decided to move against something say for instance the church were to declare nonhumans as unholy anathema as they had come very close to doing several times according to the history books shed read she shivered and not from the cold boony topazthey were as human as she was there was nothing demonic about them and when would the church end once it had begun would exotics like pearl also fall under the ban what if they decided to bancertain professions whores or even musicians dancers anyone who gave pleasure that was not tangible that sort of pleasure could be construed as heretical since it took attention away from god and what about all those rumors of dark sorceries that some priests practiced using the mantle of the church to give them protection she was glad to hear the shop bell signaling the arrival of one of the two youngsters due for lessons today ket was due first he was late but that was all right her thoughts were all tangled up and too troubled right now it would be a relief to think about simpler things like basic lute lessons she forgot about her uneasiness as she gave ket his teaching then drilled anny in her scales the children were easier to deal with than they normally were this kind of weather didnt tempt anyone to want to play outside not even a child and anny was home alone with her governess a sour old dame who sucked all the joy out of learning and left only the withered husks she was glad for a chance to get away and do something entirely different the lute lessons and the sessions she had with her dancing teacher were her only respites from the heavy hand of the old governess so it wasnt until after theyd left that tonnos words came back to trouble herand by then she had convinced herself that she had fallen victim to the miserable weather she made a determined effort to shake off her mood and by the time she left tonno curled up in his blankets with bread and toasted cheese beside him and a couple of favorite books to read she was in as cheerful a mood as possible given her long walk back to ambers through the dark and blowing snow and by midnight shed forgotten it all entirely but her dreams were haunted by things she could not recall clearly in the morning onlythe lingering odor of incense chapter eleven rune sailed in the door of tonnos shop singing at the top of her lungs with a smile as wide and sunny as the day outside and a bulging beltpouch well tonno greeted her answering her smile with one of his own whats all this she leaned over the counter and kissed him soundly on the cheek he actually blushed but could only repeat well welladay she laughed pulled her pouch off her belt and spread her days takings out on the countertop for him to see look at that just look at it why thats almost ten whole silver pennies and a handful of copper can you believe it what did you do rob someone tonno asked teasingly no indeed she said happily do you remember that city ordinance that was passed at spring equinox session the one that was basically about female buskers he sobered quickly i do indeed he replied the ordinance had troubled him a great deal he had fretted about it incessantly until it was passed and he had warned rune not to go out on the streets as a musician in female garb once it was passed not that she ever did at least not to busk the ordinance had been aimed squarely at those females who were using busking to cover their other business it licensed inspectors who were to watch street and tavern musicians to be certain that their income was derived entirely from music a similar ordinance aimed at dancers had also passed rune of course had either not come under scrutinyat least that she was aware ofbecause of her habit of taking on boydisguise or she had passed the scrutiny easily for some reason it never occurred to the inspectors or to those who had passed the ordinance that males might be operating the same deceptions but the ordinance had pretty much cleared the streets of those women who had bought cheaper busking licenses and were using them to cover their other activities the ordinance directed that any such woman be made to tender up not one but two years dues in the whores guild and buy a freelancers license as well the whores guild and the bardic guild had backed it the whores guild since it obviously cut down on women who were practicing outside the rules and restrictions of the guild which set prices and ensured the health of its members amber hadnt said much but rune suspected that she both approved and worried she partially approved of it obviously because she felt the same way about those women who were abusing the buskers licenses as rune felt about amateur musicians who thought they could set up with an instrument they hardly knew how to play and a repertoire of half a dozen songs and call themselves professionals but rune knew that amber and tonno both worried about this law because the church had also been behind itand they feared it might be the opening move in a campaign to end the whores guild altogether and make the houses themselves illegal it had been hard for rune to feel much concern about that when the immediate result had been to free up half the corners in nolton to honest musicians and dancers and to send even more clients to ambers than there had been before amber had been forced to add a fifth and sixth lady both of whom had passed their trial periods with highest markswhich had made carly even more sour than before carly now stalked the hall of the private wing with a copy of the holy book poking ostentatiously out of her pocket and she spent most of her time off at the church at interminable womens prayer meetings she had even tried to drag the boys off to a group prayer meeting but both of them had told her to her face that theyd rather scrub chamber pots the two new ladies amethyst and diamond got along perfectly well with the other four rune liked them both very much especially diamond who had the most abrasive and caustic sense of humor shed ever encountered it was diamond who had suggested her current project diamond was an incredibly slender woman with pure white hairnaturally white claimed maddie who often helped diamond with the elaborate though revealing costumes she favored diamond had been in the common room one night dressedso to speakmostly in strings of tiny glass beads made into a semblance of a dress when rune had played a common song called two fair maids at a clients request diamond had politely waited until that client had gone upstairs before she said anything but then she had them all in stitches just once shed said vehemently just once id like to hear a song about that situation that makes some sense one of the gentlemen with her who rune had suspected for some time really was nobly born had said ingenuously what situation that had pretty much confirmed runes suspicions since it would have been hard to be a commoner and not have heard two fair maids often enough to know every word of every variant diamond however had simply explained it to him without betraying that its about two sisters in love with the same man she told him hes been sleeping with the older one who thinks hes going to have to marry herbut he proposes to the younger one who accepts when the older one finds out she shoves the younger one in the river she turned to rune then and included her in the conversation rune what are all the various versions of it after that well rune had answered thinking theres three variations on how she dies one the older girl holds her under two she gets carried off by the current and pulled under the millrace three that the miller sees her wants her gold ring and drowns her but in all of the versions a wandering harpistbard finds heror rather whats left of her after the fish get doneand makes a harp of her bones and strings it with her long gold hair dear god the gentleman exclaimed thats certainly gruesome and pretty stupid rune added to diamonds great delight i cant imagine why any musician would go making an instrument out of human bone when there are perfectly good pieces of wood around that are much better suited to the purpose and i cant imagine why anyone would want to play such a thing she shivered i should think youd drive customers into the next kingdom the first time they caught sight of it but anyway thats what this fool does and he takes it to court and plays it for the sire and of course the moment the older sister shows up the harp begins to play by itself and sing about how the little idiot got herself drowned and of course the sister is burned and the miller is hung and the bastard that started it in the first place by seducing the first sister gets off free she curled her lip a little in fact in one of the versions he gets all kinds of sympathy from other stupid women because his syrupy little true love drowned and thats what i mean by i wish that someone would write a sensible version diamond said taking up where rune left off i mean if i was the wronged sister i wouldnt blame my brainless sib id go after the motherless wretch that betrayed me and if i was the younger sister if i found out about it id help her she turned to rune then with a mischievous look on her face that made her pale blue eyes sparkle like the stone she was named for youre a musician she said gleefully why dont you do it at first rune could only think of all the reasons why it wouldnt workthat people were used to the old song and would hate the new version that the bardic guild would hate it because their members had written a great many of the variants and that it wasnt properly romantic but then she thought of all the reasons why if she chose her audience properly picking mostly young people who were in a mood to laugh it would work there were not a great many comic songs out in the world and she could if she managed this successfully get quite a following for herself based on the fact that she had written one in fact there were a great many really stupid sentimental ballads like two fair maids in existence if she wrote parodies of them she could have an entire repertory of comic songs and songs like that were much more suited to the casual atmosphere of streetbusking than the maudlin ones were shed started on the project in late spring she already had four shed moved to a new corner vacated by one of the buskersthatwerent on a very busy crossroads it wasnt a venue usually suited to busking but shed made a bargain with one of the gypsydancers who had reappeared at the fountain in flower street with the spring birds rune would play the fiddle for her to dance from exactly midday until second bell and split the take if the gypsies would hold the corner for her to play from two hours before midday till the dancer showed up no one wanted to argue with the gypsies who were known to have tempers and be very quick with their knives so the corner was runes without dispute now what she had planned to do was to alternate lively fiddling with comic songs to see how well they did and if she could hold a rowdy crowd with them she had discovered this afternoon that not only could she hold the crowd she now had a reputation for knowing the funny songs and there were people coming to her corner at lunch just to hear them and furthermore they were willing to pay to hear them every time shed tried to go back to the fiddle today someone had called out for one of her songs and when shed demurred protesting that shed already done it or that people must be getting tired of it at least three coins were tossed into her hat as an incentive in the end she had made as much during her stint alone as she and the dancer had together she explained all that to tonno who looked pleased at first then troubled you didnt write anythingsatiric did you he asked worriedly these were just silly parodies of common songs am i understanding you correctly she sighed exasperated he was beating around the bush again rather than asking her directly what he wanted to know and she was tired of it tonno just what exactly are you asking me get to the point will you im not one of your scholar customers that you have to build a tower of logic for before you get a straight answer he blinked in surprise i supposedid you make fun of anyone highranking enough to cause you trouble or did you sing anything satirical about the church if anybody in one of those songs resembles someone in nolton i dont know about it she told him in complete honesty and i must admit that i had considered doing something about a corrupt priest but i decided against it after seeing carly leaving my room it would be just like her to take a copy to the church with her when she goes to one of her stupid prayer meetings and find a way to get me in trouble tonno let out a deep sigh of relief id advise you to keep to that decision he said passing his hand over his hair at least for now when you have no one to protect you later perhaps when you have guild status and protection you can write whatever you choose he smiled weakly who knows with the force of a guild bard behind a satiric song you might become an influence for good within the church what are you so worried about really she asked putting her instruments down on the counter did brother bryan tell you something is the church planning on backing more of those ordinances you dont like he shook his head nono its that ive been debating doing something for a while and ive been putting it off because i didnt have the connections remember when i started sending you to other people for lessons this spring she nodded mandar cray for lute and geor baker for voice you told me you werent going to be useful for anything with me except for reading and writing mandar and geor were two of the people she had considered as teachers when she first came to nolton as it turned out both of them were guild musicians both had very wealthy students had she approached them on her own she probably would have gotten brushed off but both were clients and friends of both tonno and amber and both had heard her sing and play they were two very different men mandar tall and ascetic geor short and muscular mandar hardly every ate at least at ambers and geor ate everything in sight mandar fainted at the thought of bloodshed let alone the sight of blood and geor was a champion swordsman but they had one other thing in common besides being clients and friends of amber and tonnothey both adored music for the opportunity to teach someone who loved it as much as they did and had talent as opposed to the rich bored children who were enduring their lessons both of them cut their lessonrates to nexttonothing they wouldnt teach her for freefor one thing that could get them in trouble with the guildfor another they felt like tonno that paying for something tended to make one pay attention to it but they werent charging her any more than tonno had and she was learning a great deal he simply could not show her ive been wanting to find someone who could teach you composition tonno said his expression still worried but the only bards i knew of in the city were either in a great household orin the church runes mouth formed a silent o of understanding now all of tonnos fussing made some sense if hed wanted to find her a teacher and shed gotten herself in trouble with the church but he wasnt finished i didnt have the contacts to get you lessons with any of the church bards he continued but last week brother bryan mentioned that hed listened to you playing out on the street and that he thought you were amazing he still thinks youre a boy you understand rune nodded brother bryan had never seen her in female garb she and tonno had judged that the best idea many church men felt very uneasy around females for one thingand it seemed no bad idea to have her female persona unknown to the church after all the ordinances and the snooping carly was doing they might not connect the rune that busked with the rune that played at ambers and even if they did they might not know that rune was really a girl if carly hadnt gone out of her way to tell them rune didnt think she had she just reported the activities going on but because she knew runes sex she would probably assume the church did too well brother bryan was very impressed by what hed heard he asked if you composed then before i could say anything he offered to see if he couldnt get brother pell to take you in his class tonno was clearly torn between being proud and being concerned at a church collectors interest in his pupil thats why i wanted to know what your comic songs were about if youd done anything to annoy the church officials going to that class could be walking you into a trap the church has no power outside the cloister but once they had you inside they could hold you for as long as they cared to and the city couldnt send anyone to get you out assuming theyd even bother to try which i doubt the only people the constables and guards are likely to exert themselves for have more money than you and i put together runes mouth went dry at the bare thought of being held by the church for questioning she recalled the high walls around the cloister all too wellwalls that shut out the world and held in secrets they wouldnt he saw her terrified expression and laughed easing her fear oh all theyd do most likely is try to frighten you to bully you and make you promise never to write something like that again he cocked his head sideways for a moment and his expression sobered but if they connected you with the musician at ambers they could threaten other punishments and make you promise to spy at ambers in return for being set free i doubt carly is terribly effective i wouldnt do that she exclaimed hotly you might if you were frightened enough he admonished her im not saying you also wouldnt go straight to amber afterwards and tell her what theyd gotten from you but dont ever underestimate the power of a skilled church interrogator they could make you promise to do almost anything for them and youd weep with gratitude because they had forgiven you for what youd done to them they are very skilled with wordswith innuendowith making threats they have no intention of carrying out and they are a force unto themselves on their own ground and maybe theyre as skilled with magic as they are with words rune frowned those were some of the whispered rumors shed heard that the church harbored priests and brothers who were powerful magicians who could make people do what they wanted them to with a few chosen words and a spell to take over their will possibly tonno conceded wearily possibly i dont know ive never seen a church mage and i dont know of anyone who has but that doesnt mean anything does it since you havent angered them and dont intend to youre unlikely to see one either lets face it rune you and i are just too small for them to take much notice of its not worth the time theyd spend something to be said for being insignificant she commented sardonically he nodded at any rate im quite confident that youll be in no danger whatsoever if you want to take these lessons brother bryan told me that brother pell iswell rather difficult to get along with is the way he put it i pressed him for details but he couldnt tell me much i gather he has a bad temper and a sour disposition he doesnt like much of anybody and even someone as eventempered as bryan has a hard time finding good things to say about him sounds like taking lessons from carly she said with a wry twist to her mouth perhaps tonno replied thoughtfully but there is this bryan said that by all reports even of those who dont like him at all pell is the best composition teacher in all of nolton huh rune said thoughtfully id be willing to take lessons even from carly if she was that good am i supposed to be a boy or a girl boy tonno told her firmly women have very little power in the church at least here in nolton and i gather that pell in particular despises the sex go as a girl and hell probably refuse to teach you on the grounds that youll just go off and get married and waste his teaching he gave her a long level look as he realized exactly what shed said i take it that you want the lessons then i said id even take lessons from carly if she had anything worth learning rune replied firmly when can i start she didnt feel quite so bold a few days later as she meekly showed her pass to the brother on watch at the cloister gate in the year shed been here shed never once been inside the huge cathedral in the center of nolton big enough to hold several thousand worshipers at once in fact she avoided it as much as possible that wasnt too difficult since there was no use in busking anywhere near it the priests and brothers made a busker feel so uncomfortable by simply standing and staring with disapproval that it was easier to find somewhere else to play it was an imposing forbidding edifice carved of dark stone with thousands of sculptures all over its surface there wasnt a single square inch that didnt hold a carving of something down near the base it was ordinary people doing good works and the temptations of the evil one trying to waylay them farther up there were carvings of the lives of the saints and all the temptations that they had overcome the next level held the bliss of paradise the uppermost level was carved with all the varied kinds of angels from the fingerlength etherials to the archangels that were three times the height of a man there was a skypiercing tower in the middle of it carved with abstract water and cloud shapes that held the bells that signaled the changes of the hours for everyone in the city inside she had been told it was different not dark and foreboding at all full of light and spacethose carved walls held hundreds of tiny windows filled with glass and most of the ones near the ground were of precious colored glass every saints shrine every statue inside had been gilded or silvered places where the light couldnt reach were covered with banks of prayer candles when the sun shone or so tonno claimed the eye was dazzled even when it didnt there were lights and reflective surfaces enough to make the interior bright as day in an open meadow she hadnt cared enough to want to see it although it was quite an attraction for visitors just to come and gawk at behind the cathedral was the cloister a complex of buildings including convents for men and for women a school and the church administrative offices all that was held behind a high wall pierced with tiny gates each guarded day and night by a brother rune had never been inside those walls and didnt know anyone who had plenty of people had been inside the cathedral though the high priest of nolton was said to be a marvelous speaker although again rune couldnt have said one way or another she hadnt cared to see him either though carly went to the service he preached at as faithfully as the bells rang from the little she saw outside the walls the cloister was twice as forbidding as the cathedral because it had none of the cathedrals ornamentation now that she was inside the walls it was worse much worse the place looked like a prison the buildings were carved of the same dark stone with tiny slits for windows it looked as if it was a place designed to keep people from escaping rune hoped shed never have occasion to discover that her impression was true the brother at the gate anonymous in his dark gray robe directed her to go past the building immediately in front of her and take the first door she saw after that she walked slowly across the silent paved courtyard nothing behind her but the wall with its small postern gate nothing on either side of her or before her but tall oblong buildings with tiny passages between them nothing green or growing anywhere not even a weed springing up between the cobblestones it seemed unnatural a few robed figures crossed the courtyard ahead of her none looked at her no one spoke in their dark androgynous robes she couldnt even tell if they were men or women once past the first building she felt even more hemmed in and confined how can anyone bear to live like this she wondered no need to look for a reason why brother pell was so sour if she had to live here shed be just as bitter as he was there was another brother at the door of the building sitting behind a tiny desk once again she showed her pass and was directed to a secondfloor room she looked back over her shoulder for a moment as she climbed the stair the brother was watching herto be certain she went where she was told possibly that might be simple courtesy on the part of the brothers it might be something else there was no point in speculating she was just here for composition lessons not anything sinister she didnt want to stay here a moment longer than she had to let the brother watch hed see only a young boy obeying doing exactly what he was told she opened the designated doorway and went inside there was no one there and nothing but one large desk and six smaller ones she discovered that she was the first to arrive of a class of six including her the classroom was a tiny cubicle narrow with enough space for their six desks arranged two by two with brother pells large desk facing them and behind that a wall covered in slate brother pell appeared last a perfectly average man balding slightly with his hands tucked into the sleeves of his gray robe and a frown so firmly a part of his face that rune could not imagine what he would look like if he ever smiled if he had been anything other than a brother she would have guessed at scholar or clerk he had that kind of tightlipped look there was a nagging sense of familiarity about him after a moment she knew what it was she had seen this man often out on the street ever since the ordinance against pseudobuskers had been passed presumably he was one of the inspectors and now that she thought about it she realized that there were a great many more brothers and sisters out on the street since the ordinance had been passed interesting she had never thought of them as being inspectors but it made sense the inspectors were being paid very little about the same as a lamplighter or a dungsweeper unless you had no other job it wasnt one youd think of taking a few of the real buskers had become inspectors by day and did their busking at night but church clericswell it wouldnt matter to them how small the fee was it was very probable that since everyone in the church took a vow to own nothing their fees as inspectors went to the church itself very interesting and not very comforting that the church who had backed the law should send its people out into the streets as an army of enforcers of that law shed have to tell tonno about her suspicion and see what he said brother pell did not seem to recognize her however although she recognized him his eyes flitted over her as they did the other five boys in the class without a flicker of recognition he consulted a list in his hand terr capston of nolton he said and looked up his voice at least was pleasant although cold a good strong trained tenor here sir said a sturdy brownhaired boy who looked back at the brother quite fearlessly of all of them he seemed the most used to being in the tutelage of brothers and why are you here terr capston brother pell asked without any expression at all terr seemed to have been ready for this question brother rylan wants me to find out if i have bardic material in me the boy said im for the church either way but brother wants to know if it will be as just a player or stop right there boy brother pell said fiercely and his cold face wore a forbidding frown there is no such thing as just a player and brother rylan is sadly to blame if thats the way hes taught you or is that your notion the boy hung his head and brother pell grimaced i thought so i should send you back to him until you learn humility consider yourself on probation lenerd cattlan of nolton heresir the timid darkhaired boy right in front of rune raised his hand and why are you here the brother asked glaring at him with hawkfierce eyes the boy shrank into his seat and shook his head you dont know pell said biting off each word he cast his eyes upward lord give me patience rune of westhaven sir she said nodding and matching his stare with a stare of her own you dont frighten me one bit and im not going to back down to you either she had expected the same question but he surprised her no last name why not that was rude at the very leastbut she had a notion that brother pell was never terribly polite she decided to see if she could startle or discomfort him with the truth i dont know who my father is she replied levely and i judged it better than to claim something i have no right to one of the other boys snickered and pell turned a look on him that left rune wondering if she scented scorched flesh in its wake the boy shrank in his seat and gulped youre an honest boy he barked turning back to rune and theres no shame in being born a bastard the shame is on your mother who had no moral sense not on you you did not ask to be born that was gods will you are doing well to repudiate your mothers weak morals with strong ones of your own god favors the honest perhaps your mother will see your success one day and repent of her ways if rune hadnt agreed with him totally about her mothers lack of sense moral or otherwise she might have resented that remark as it was she nodded cautiously why are you here rune now came the question she expected because there is music in my head and i dont know how to write it down the way i hear it she replied promptly i can find harmonies and countermelodies when i sing but i dont know how to get them down either and sometimes i lose things before i even manage to work them out properly he looked a little interested so she continued brother bryan heard me on the street and told my first teacher that hed get me a recommendation into this class if i wanted it i wanted it i want to be more than a street busker if its in me and if its gods will she added circumspectly pell barked a laugh good answer axen troud of nolton brother pell continued the litany until he had covered all six of them and rune realized after she watched him listening to their answers that he had formed a fairly quick impression of each of them from both their words and the way they answered and as he began the first session and she bent all of her attention to his words and the things he was writing down on the slate behind him she also realized that unlike tonno brother pell was not going to help anyone he would never explain things twice if you fell behind that was too bad you would keep up with him in this class or you would not stay in it she had a fairly good idea that the timid boy would not be able to keep up nor would one of the boys who had answered after her a stolid unimaginative sort who was more interested in the mathematics of music than the music itself and they might lose the first boy who was plainly used to being cosseted by his teacher at the end of that first lesson she felt as drained and exhausted as she had been at the end of her first lute lesson if this had been the first time shed ever felt that way she likely would have given up right therewhich was what the first boy looked ready to do but as she gathered up her notes under pells indifferent eye and filed out with the rest she knew that if nothing else she was going to get her moneys worth out of this class pell was a good teacher and ive been hungry cold nearly penniless i fiddled for the skull hill ghost and won if the ghost didnt stop me neither will brother pell no one will not ever chapter twelve rune rang the bell outside the church postern gate again though she had no expectation of being answered this time either when after several minutes there was no sound of feet on stone she beat her benumbed mittened hands together and continued pacing up and down the little stretch of pavement outside the gate her heart pounded in her chest at the audacity of what she was about to do but she wasnt going to let fear stop her not now not when the stakes were this high she told her heart to be still and the lump in her throat to go away neither obeyed her tonno had taken a chill when hed been caught between the market and his shop three weeks ago on the day of the great blizzard and it had taken him hours to stumble back home the blizzard had piled some of the city streets so deeply with snow that people were coming and going from the secondfloor windows of some places although that was not the case with ambers or with tonnos shop rune had been busy with helping to shovel once the storm was over and it had taken her two days to get to him by then the damage was done he was sick and getting sicker she had gone out every day to the church since then to the priests who sent out doctors to those who had none of their own each day she had been turned away by the priest in charge who had consulted a list told her brusquely that there were those with more need than tonno and then ignored her further protests finally today one of the other women in line had explained this cryptic statement to her your masters old boy the woman had whispered hes old hes never been one for making more than the tithe to the church no doubt and hes got no kin to inherit and likely hes not rich enough to be worth much of a thanksgift if a doctor came out and made him well they figure if he dies the church gets at least half his goods if not alland if he lives its gods will that had infuriated and frightened her it was obvious that she was never going to get any help for tonnoand when shed arrived today hed been half delirious with a fever shed sent a boy to get maddie to come watch him while she went after a doctoragain and this time by all that was holy she was not going to return without one she had been in and out of the cloister enough to know who came and went by all the little gates one lesson the brothers had never expected her to learn doubtless she knew where the doctors gate was and she was going to wait by it until she spotted one of the physicianbrothers they were easy enough to pick out by the black robe they wore instead of gray and by the box of medicines they always carried when she saw a doctor or could get one to answer the bell she was going to take him to tonnoby force if need be her throat constricted again and she fought a stinging in her eyes crying was not going to help him only a doctor could do that and a doctor was what she was waiting for she tried not to think about what hed looked like when she left him transparent thin and oldso frail as if a thought would blow him away she stopped her pacing along enough to cough like everyone else it seemed shed picked up a cold in the past two weeks she hadnt paid it much attention beside tonnos illness it was hardly more serious than a splinter as she straightened up she heard the sound of feet approaching hard soles slapping wearily on the stonework the church certainly didnt lack hands to see that the streets about the cathedral and the cloisters were shoveled clean she turned approaching from a side street to her left was a man in the black robe of a church doctor laden with one of those blackleathercovered boxes he walked with his head down so that she couldnt see his face watching his step on the icy cobbles she hurried to intercept him her heart right up in her throat and pounding so loudly she could hardly hear herself speak excuse me sir she said trotting along beside him then putting herself squarely in his path when he wouldnt stop she held out her empty mittened hands to him and tried to put all the terror and pleading she felt into her face and voice excuse memy masters sick hes got a fever a dry fever and a dry cough that wont stop hes been sick ever since the blizzard and ive been here every day but the priest wont send anybody he says theres people with greater need but my masters an old man and hes having hallucinations she was gabbling it all out as fast as she could hoping to get him to listen to her before he brushed her aside he frowned at her when she made him stop and frowned even harder when she began to talkhe put out a hand to move her away from his path but then he blinked as if what she had said had finally penetrated his preoccupation and stayed his hand a fever with visions you say she nodded and a dry racking cough that wont stop she nodded again harder if he recognized the symptoms sure surely he knew the cure he sworeand for the first time in months of living at ambers she was shocked not at the oath shed heard enough like it from the carters and other rough laborers who visited some of the other houses on the street that a brother should utter a hairscorching oath like thatthat was what shocked her but it seemed that this was no ordinary brother his face hardened with anger and his eyes grew black an old man with pneumonia lying untreated for two weeksand instead of taking care of him they send me out to tend a brat with a bellyache from too many sweets he swore again an oath stronger than the first show me your master lad and be hanged to father genner bellyache my ass rune hurried down the street towards tonnos with the brother keeping pace beside her despite the hindering skirts of his robe im brother anders he said trotting next to her and not even breathing hard tell me more about your masters illness she did everything she could recall casting sideways glances at the brother as she did so he was a large man blackbearded and blackhaired he made her think of a bear but his eyes now that he wasnt frowning were kind he listened carefully to everything she said but his expression grew graver and graver with each symptom and her heart sank every time his expression changed hes not in good shape lad the brother said at last i wont lie to you if id seen him a week agoor better when he first fell ill i came then she protested angrily forcing away tears with the heat of her outrage i came every day the priest kept telling me that there were others with more need and turning me away she wanted to tell him the rest what the old woman had told herbut something stopped her this was a brother after all tied to the church if she maligned the church he might not help her and i simply go where the priests tell me brother anders replied as angry as she was father genner didnt see fit to mention this case to any of us well theres going to be someone answering for this i took my vows to tend to all the sick not just fat merchants with deep pockets and their spoiled children who have nothing wrong that a little less coddling and cosseting wouldnt cure there didnt seem to be anything more to add to that so rune saved her breath for running speeding up the pace and hoping that despite brother anders words things were not as grave as they seemed but she was fighting back tears with every step and the old womans words kept echoing in her head if the church wanted tonno to die what hope did she have of saving him but this brother seemed capable and caring he was angry that the priests hadnt sent him to tonno before this he would do everything in his power to help just for that reason alone she was certain after all many doctors probably exaggerated the state of an illness to seem more skilled when the patient recovereddidnt they she had left the door unlocked when she went out it was still unlocked she pushed it open and motioned to the brother to follow her through the dark cold narrow shop maddie looked up when rune came through the curtain rune hes getting worse she said worriedly he doesnt know who i am he thinks its summer and he keeps pushing off the blankets as fast as i put them back then she saw the brother as he looked up for his black robe had hidden him in the shadows oh she exclaimed with relief you got a doctor to come aye he did the brother rumbled squinting through the darkness to the little island of light where tonno lay and not a moment too soon from the sound of it you go on home lass this lad and i will tend to things now maddie didnt wait for a second invitation she snatched up her cloak and hurried out pushing past them with a brief curtsy for the doctor brother anders hardly noticed her all his attention was for the patient rune heard the door slam shut behind maddie then she ignored everything except tonno and the doctor get some heat in this place lad the brother ordered gruffly shoving his way past the crowded furnishings to tonnos bedside rune didnt hesitate she opened the stove door and piled on expensive wood and even more expensive coal after all what did it matter tonnos life was at stake here she would buy him more when he was well and if he dies the church gets it all anyway she thought bitterly rubbing her sleeve across her eyes as they stung damply why should i save it for them then she pushed the thought away tonno would not die she told herself fiercely around the lump of pain and fear that filled her he would get better this was a conscientious doctor and she sensed hed fight as hard for tonno as he would for his own kin tonno would get welland she would use some of the money saved from last summer to buy him more wood and coalyes and chicken to make soup to make him strong and medicine and anything else he needed boil me some water will you lad the doctor said as the temperature in the room rose tonno mumbled something and tried to push brother anders hands away the doctor ignored him peering into tonnos eyes and opening his mouth to look at his throat then leaning down to listen to his chest theres some already sir she replied he turned in surprise to see her holding out the kettle i always had a fresh kettle going i kept giving him willowbark tea sir at first it helped with the fever and even when it didnt it let him sleep some well done lad brother anders nodded with approval but hes going to need something stronger than that if hes to have any chance of pulling through and do you think you can get me some steam in here itll make his breathing easier and i have some herbs for his lungs that need steam she put the kettle back on the top of the stove as he rummaged in his kit for herbs and a mortar and pestle to grind them steam how can i get steam over to the bed if she put a pan of water on the stove the steam would never reach as far as the bed if she brought a pan to boil and took it over beside the bed it would stop steaming quickly wasting the precious herbs then she thought of the little nomads brazier out in the shop one of the curiosities that tonno had accumulated over the years that had never sold if she were to put a pan of water on that and put the whole lot beside the bed yes that would work she ran out into the shop to get it it was up on one of the shelves one near the floor since it was ceramic and very heavy it was meant tonno had said to use animaldroppings for fuel if she took one of the burning lumps of coal out of the stove and dropped it into the combustion chamber that should do as an afterthought she picked up the wooden stool she used to get things just out of her reach and took that with her as well there was a slab of marble in the living area that tonno used to roll out dough on if she put that on the stool and the brazier on that it would be just tall enough that she could fan steam directly onto tonnos face and the marble would keep the wooden stool from catching fire she set up the stool with the marble and brazier atop it then carefully caught up a lump of bright red coal in the tongs and carried it over dropping it into the bottom on the brazier to land on the little iron grate there then she got an ornamental copper bowl put it atop the brazier and filled it with water she didnt look at tonno she couldnt she couldnt bear to see him that way when the water began to steam and she started fanning it towards tonnos face the doctor looked up in surprise and approval keep that up lad he said and dropped a handful of crushed herbs into the water the steam took on an astringent quality refreshing and cleansmelling it even seemed to make her breathing easier she tried not to listen to tonnos his breath rasped in his throat and wheezed in his chest and there was a gurgling sound at the end of each breath that sounded horrible the doctor didnt like it either she could tell by the way his face looked but he kept mixing medicines steeping each new dose with a little hot water and spooning them into tonnos slack mouth between rattling breaths she lost track of time when the water in the bowl got low she renewed it at the doctors direction she heated bricks at the stove and kept them packed around tonnos thin body when she wasnt doing either of those things she was fanning the aromatic steam over tonnos face and despite all of it each breath came harder each breath was more of a struggle tonno showed no signs of wakingand the hectic feverspots in his cheeks grew brighter as his face grew paler finally just before dawn he took one shallow breaththe last rune huddled in the chair beside the bed silent tears coursing down her cheeks and freezing as they struck the blanket shed wrapped herself in the doctor had gently given tonno final rites as he was authorized to do then covered him face and all so that rune didnt have to look at the body hed told her to go home that there was nothing more to do that the priests would come and take care of everythingthen hed left but she couldnt leave she couldnt bear the idea of tonno being left alone here with no one to watch to see that he wasnt disturbed she let the fire go out though after piling on the last of the wood and coal there was no point in saving it for the damned priests let them buy their own or work in the cold she thought savagely i hope their fingers and toes fall off but she just couldnt see the point of buying any more either after all tonno didnt need the warmth any more its all my fault she told herself as the tears continued to fall i should have gone after a doctor before i should never have gone to the priests i should have found brother bryan and had him help me i should have seen if brother pell was any use i should have told amber that tonno was sicker than i thought but what could amber have done oh there were herbwomen attached to the whores guild that kept the members of the guild healthy and free of unwanted pregnancies but did they know anything about pneumonia probably notbut i should have tried i should have gone to everyone i knew if shed done that tonno would probably be alive now shed spent hours talking to the empty air begging tonnos forgiveness and promising him what she was going to do with the rest of her life because of what hed taught her and trying to say goodbye shed cursed the priests with every curse she knew three times over but the essential blame lay with her there was no getting around it so she stayed as the shop grew colder the water in the pan beside the bed froze over and the square of sun cast through the back window crept across the floor and up the wall it wasnt much of a penance but it was something shed long ago talked herself hoarse now she could only address him in thought even if her voice hadnt been a mere croak she couldnt have said anything aloud around the lump of grief that choked her im sorry tonno she said silently to the still sheetshrouded form on the bed im sorryi did everything i could think of i just didnt think of things soon enough i really tried honestly i did and the tears kept falling trickling down her cheeks though they could not wash away the guilt the pain or the loss the priests finally arrived near sunset as another snowstorm was blowing up when she was numb within and without from cold and grieving both a trio of hardfaced vulturine men they seemed both surprised and suspicious when they saw her beside tonnos bed when they asked her what she was doing there she stammered something hoarsely about tonno being her master but that wasnt enough for them while two of them bundled the body in a shroud the third questioned her closely as to whether she was bonded or free and what her exact relationship to tonno had been she answered his questions between fits of coughing he was not pleased to discover that she was freeand less pleased to discover that tonno was nothing more than her teacher she had the feeling that this one had been counting on her to have been a bonded servant and thus part of the legacy id rather die than work for you bastards she thought angrily though she held her tongue i can just imagine what the lives of your bonded servants are like i see no reason why you should have been here the priest finally said acidly you did your duty long ago you should have been gone when we arrived he stared at her as if he expected that she had been up to something that would somehow threaten a single pin that the church could expect out of tonnos holdings that was when she lost her temper entirely i was his friend she snapped croaking out her words like an asthmatic frog thats reason enough siror have you forgotten the words of your own holy book you stayed beside me when i was sick you fed me when i was hungry you guided me when i was troubled and you asked no more than my loveblessed are they who love without reward for they shall have love in abundance i was following the words of the book whether or not it was prudent to do so the priest started taken aback by having the holy words flung in his face it didnt look to her like he was at all familiar with that particular passage either in abstract or in application she dashed angry tears away he gave me something more precious than everything in this shophe gave me learning i could never repay that why shouldnt i watch by him she would have said more but a coughing fit overcame her she bent over double and by the time she had gotten control of herself again the priest who was questioning her had gone out into the shop itself she looked outside at the snowstorm dubiously wondering if she should just try to stay the night here it wouldnt have been the first timein fact shed been sleeping on the couch just to keep an eye on him these past two weeks then one of the other two priests came back into the room and cleared his throat so that shed look at him youll have to leave boy the priest said coldly you cant stay here therell be someone to come collect the body in a moment but youll have to leave now in this snow she replied without thinking why and what about thieves well be staying the priest said his voice and eyes hard and unfriendly well be staying and making certain the contents of this place match the inventory there might be a will but there probably isnt and if there isnt everything goes to the church anyway thats the law what would i do if i didnt have anyplace else to go she wonderedbut it didnt look as though the priest cared hed have turned anyone out in the snow like as notold woman or young child unless of course they were bonded then no doubt hed have been gracious enough to let them sleep on the floor he stared at her and she had the feeling that he expected her to have a fortune in goods hiding under her cloak she took it off and shook it slowly and with dignity trying not to shiver just to show them that there wasnt anything under it but one skinny boy then she put it back on stepped right up to him as if she was about to say something and deliberately sneezed on him he started back with the most dumbfounded and offended look on his face shed ever seen if she hadnt been so near to tears and so angry shed have laughed at him excuse me she said still wrapped in dignity ive been tending him for two weeks now out of charity i must have caught a chill myself then she pushed rudely past him and past the other two who were already out in the shop with tonnos books candles and pens she managed to cough on them too on her way out and took grim pleasure in the fact that there wasnt a stick of fuel in the place and at this time of night thered be no one to sell them any unless they sent one of their number back to the cloister to fetch some which meant going out into the storm theyd be spending a long cold night there wasnt any food left either shed been buying soup for him from one of his neighbors i hope they freeze and starve she wrapped her cloak tighter around herself before stepping out of the doorwhich she left open behind her one of the priests shouted at her but she ignored him let him shut his own damn door she thought viciously then the wind whipped into her driving snow into her face and she didnt have a breath or a thought to spare for anything else but getting back to ambers this wasnt as bad a storm as the one that had killed tonno but it was pure frozen hell to stagger through she lost track of her feet first then her hands and finally her face she was too cold to shiver but under the cloak she was sweating like a lathered horse it seemed to take forever to beat her way against the wind down the streets she usually traveled in a half hour or less the wind cut into her lungs like knives every breath hurt her chest horribly and her throat was so raw she wept for the pain of it and tried not to swallow she was horribly thirsty but icicles and snow did nothing but increase the thirst she wondered if shed been the one that had died and this was her punishment in the afterlife if so she couldnt imagine what it had been that shed done that warranted anything this bad when she got to flower street she couldnt bear to go around the back she staggered to the front door instead amber would forgive her this once she could clean up the snow later or something to make up for it all she wanted was her bed and something hot to drink her head hurt her body hurt everything hurt she shoved open the front door too frozen to think and managed to get it slammed shut behind her she turned in the sudden silence and shelter from the wind to find herself the center of attentionand there wasnt a client in the place all of the ladies were downstairs gathered in the common room around the fire wearing casual lounging robes in their signature colors and all seven sets of eyesambers includedwere riveted to her in shocked surprise that was when the heat hit her and she fainted dead away she came to immediately but by then she was shivering despite the heat her teeth chattering so hard she couldnt speak she was flat on her back in a kind of crumpled twisted pile of melting snow and heavy cloak sapphire and amber leaned over her trying to get her cloak off trying to pry her hands open so they could get her unwrapped from the halffrozen mass of snowcaked wool ambers hand brushed against her forehead as rune tried to get enough breath to say somethingand the woman exclaimed in surprise iiim ssssorry rune babbled around her chattering teeth iiim jjjust ccccold thats all she tried to sit up but the room began to spin cold amber said in surprise cold child youre burning up you must have a fever she gestured at someone just out of sight and topaz slid into view topaz youre stronger than any of the boys can you lift her and get her into bed the strange slitpupiled eyes did not even blink of course topaz replied gravely i should be glad to just get her out of the cloak please i cannot bear the touch of the snow im all rrrright really she protested thththis is sssilly rune had forgotten the cloak she let go of the edges and slid her arms out of it sapphire pulled it away and before rune could try again to get to a sitting position topaz had scooped her up as easily as if she weighed no more than a pillow and was carrying her towards the stairs i didnt know she was so strong rune thought dazedly she must be stronger than most men ormaybe ive just gotten really light she felt that way as if she would flutter off like a leaf on the slightest wind no amber forestalled her as topaz started for the staircase no i dont think her room is going to be warm enough and besides i dont want her alone well put her on the couch in my rooms ah was all that topaz said amber led the way into her office then didsomethingwith the wall or an ornament on the wall whatever a panel in the wall opened and topaz carried her into a small parlor like rose had in the private quarters back at the hungry bear but this was nothing like roses parlorit was lit with many lanterns the air was sweet with the smell of dried herbs the honeyscent of beeswax and a faint hint of incense but that was when things stopped making sense for topaz turned into boony and the couch she was put on was on the top of skull hill and she was going to have to play for the ghost only tonno was in the ghosts robesshe tried to explain that shed done her best to help him but he only glared at her and motioned for her to play she picked up her fiddle and tried to play for him but her fingers wouldnt work and she started to cry the wind blew leaves into her face so she couldnt see and she couldnt hear either and she was so very very cold she began to cry and couldnt stop someone was singing very near at hand she opened gritty sore eyes in an aching head to see who it was for the song was so strange less like a song than a chant and yet it held elements of both it was nothing she recognized and yet she thought she heard something familiar in the wailing cadences there was a tall stronglooking old woman sitting beside her a woman wearing what could only be a gypsy costume but far more elaborate than anything rune had ever seen the gypsies wear besides her voluminous multicolored skirts and bright blouse the woman had a shawl embroidered with figures that seemed to move and dance every time she breathed and a vast set of necklaces loaded with charms carved of every conceivable substance they all seemed to represent animals and birds rune saw motherofpearl sparrows obsidian bears carnelian fish turquoise foxes all strung on row after row of tiny shell beads the woman looked down at her and nodded but did not stop her chanting for a moment everything hurt head joints throatshe was alternately freezing and burning she closed her eyes to rest them and opened them again when she felt a cold hand on her forehead amber was looking down at her with an expression of deep concern on her face she tried to say something but she couldnt get her mouth to work and the mere effort was exhausting she closed her eyes again she felt herself floating away from the pain and she let it happen when her aching body was just a distant memory she opened her eyes to find that she was somewhere up above her body looking down at it amber was gone but the strange gypsy woman was back again sitting in the corner chanting quietly rune realized then that she felt the chanting the song wove a kind of net about her that kept her from floating off somewhere as she watched with an oddly dispassionate detachment pearl and diamond entered the room pearl carrying a large bowl of something that steamed which she set down on the hearth diamond with a tray of food she set down beside the gypsy diamond kept glancing at the gypsy out of the corner of her eye thats not one of the guild herbwomen she said finally to pearl as she moved a little away no pearl confirmed no this is someone amber knows how pearl shrugged expressively amber has many friends often strange look at us diamond didnt echo pearls little chuckle ruby says shes elftouched the young woman said with a shiver ruby says shes a witch and elftouched pearl shook her head she may be for all i know the gypsies the musicians they know many strange creatures not like this diamond objected not elftouched thats perilous close to heresy where i come from she shuddered have you ever seen what the church does to heretics and those who shelter them i have and i dont ever want to see it again pearl cocked her head to one side as if amused by diamonds fear wemy peoplewe have old women and old men like her they serve the villages in many ways as healers of the sick as speakerstotheothers and as magicians to keep away the dark things that swim to the surface of the sea at the full moon she deserves respect i would say but not fear if you say so diamond said dubiously is shei mean is rune she cast a glance at the couch where rune lay wrapped in a cocoon of blankets her face as pale as the snow outside with the same feverspots of bright red that tonno had on his cheeks yes pearl replied with absolute certainty she has told amber that the girl will live and if she makes such a pledge she will keep it such as she is cannot lie rune would have liked to listen to morein fact she would have liked to see if she couldnt float off into another room and see what was going on therebut at that moment the old woman seemed to notice that she was up there the tone of her chant took on a new sharpness and the words changed and rune found herself being pulled back down into the body on the couch she tried resisting but it was no use once back in her body all she could think of was tonno and once again she began crying feebly for all the things she had not done her head hurt horribly and her joints still ached but she wasnt so awfully cold and she didnt feel as if she was floating around anymore she felt very solidly anchored inside her body actually she opened her eyes experimentally maddie was sitting in the chair where the old woman had been sitting working on her mending rune coughed maddie looked up and grinned when she saw that rune was awake well are you back with us again the girl said cheerfully rune tested her throat found it still sore and just nodded hang on a moment maddie told her and put her mending away she went over to the hearth where there was a kettle on the hob beside the steaming bowl of herbsherbs that smelled very like the ones brother anders had used for tonno thatit seemed as if it had happened years ago something had happened to her grief while she slept it was still with her but no longer so sharp maddie picked up the kettle and poured a mug of something bringing it over to the couch rune managed to free an arm from her wrappings to take it her hand shook and the mug felt as if it weighed a thousand pounds but she managed to drink the contents without spilling much it was some kind of herb tea heavily dosed with honey and it eased the soreness in her throat wonderfully what happened she said grateful beyond words to hear her voice come out as a whispered version of her own and not a feverscorched croak well maddie said sitting herself down in the chair again you made a very dramatic entrance thats for certain nighthawk said that she thinks you got pneumonianighthawks the gypsywitch amber knows that treats us all for things the guild herbwomen cant anyway nighthawk says you got pneumonia but that your voice is going to be all right so dont worry its just that youre going to be all winter recovering so dont think you can go jumping out of bed to sing oh rune said vaguely whatwhat am i doing here she gestured at ambers neat little parlor in which she was the only discordant note amber says youre staying here where we can all keep an eye on you until you stop having fevers maddie said fiercelyand something in her voice told rune that her recovery hadnt been nearly as matteroffact as maddie made it out to be then you can go back to your room but youre going to stay in bed most of the time until spring thats orders from amber but rune began thats orders from amber maddie repeated and the tone of her voice said that it was no use protesting or arguing and she says youre not to worry about what all this is costing or about the fact that youre not playing in the common room for your keep youve been part of ambers for more than a year and amber takes care of her people rune nodded meekly but when maddie finally left she lay back among her pillows and tried to figure out exactly why amber was doing all this for her it wasnt as if this was the same set of circumstances as when shed nursed tonno or was it she fell asleep trying to puzzle it all out without much success she dreamed of jib dreamed of the hungry bear like her he was two years olderbut unlike her he was still doing exactly the same things as hed been two years ago still playing stablehand and general dogsbody his life hadnt altered in the slightest from when shed left and she was struck with the gloomy certainty that it never would unless fate took an unexpected hand she woke again to neardarkness the only light was from the banked fire there was another full mug on a little table beside her this time with doctored apple cider in it she sipped it and stared into the coals for a long time wondering how much of her dream was reality and how much was her feverdreams what was going to happen to jib hed been her friend her only friend and shed run off without even a goodbye she hadnt ever worried about what was going to happen to him with her gone was he all right had the bullies found something better to do or were they still making his life a torment was he satisfied how could he be how could anyone be satisfied in the position he held it was all right for a boy but no job for a man but unless something changed for him that was what hed be all his life someones flunky now she remembered what hed wanted to do back in the longago days when theyd traded dreams hed wanted to be a horsetrader a modest enough ambition and one he could probably do well at if he stuck to the kind of horses he had experience with farmstock donkeys rough cobssturdy beasts not highly bred but what farmers and simple traders needed jib knew beasts like that could tell a good one from a bad one a bargain from a doctored beast that was about to break down she tried to tell herself that what happened to him wasnt her responsibility but if that was true then it was also true that what happened to her was not ambers responsibility yet amber was caring for her jib was old enough to take care of himself well that was truebut jib had no way to get himself out of the rut he was in he had no talent at all except that of working well with animals if he went somewhere else hed only be doing the same work in a different place would that be better or not and would he even think of doing so she knew from her own experience how hard it was to break ties and go when things where you were at the moment were only uncomfortable not unbearable it was easy to tell yourself that theyd get better eventually she fell asleep again feeling vaguely bothered by yet more guilt if only there was something she could have done to help him weak earlyspring sunshine reflected off the wall of the house across from her window and she had the window open a crack just for the sake of the fresh air shed been allowed out of bed finally two weeks ago she still spent a lot of time in her room reading even a simple trip down to the common room tended to make her legs wobbly but she persisted whether she was ready or not she would have to make midsummer faire this year and the trials for her own sake and for the sake of tonnos memory if only she didnt owe amber so much her indebtedness troubled her as it did not seem to trouble amber but at the least before she left rune had determined to walk the length and breadth of nolton listening to buskers and talking to them to find amber a replacement musician for the common room that wouldnt cancel the debt but it would ease it a little rune maddie tapped on the halfopen door to her room rune looked up from the book she was reading it was one of tonnos but shed never seen fit to inform the church that she had it and no one had ever come asking after it she had a number of books here that had been tonnos and she wasnt going to give them back until someone came for them she reasoned that she could always use her illness as an excuse to cover why she had never done so she smiled at maddie who returned it a little nervously theres a visitor below she said and the tone of her voice made rune sit up a little straighter its a priest he wants to see you he was with amber for a while and she said it was all right for him to talk to youbut if you dont want to rune she sighed exasperated oh its probably just about the books i have from the shop the greedy pigs probably want them back she tugged at her hair and brushed down her shabby breeches and shirt do i look like a boy or a girl maddie put her head to one side and considered more like a girl actually damn oh well it cant be helped you might as well bring him up she gritted her teeth together he would show up now when she was just getting strong enough to enjoy reading maddie vanished and a few moments later heavy footsteps following her light ones up the kitchen stairs heralded the arrival of her visitor rune came very near to chuckling at the disgruntled look on the priests face bad enough to have to come to a brothel to collect part of an estateworse that he was taken up the back stairs to do so like a servant thats one for you tonno she thought keeping the smile off her lips somehow a small one but there it is are you rune of westhaven the balding thin priest asked crossly he was another sort like brother pell but he didnt even have the brothers love of music to leaven his bitterness rune nodded she waited for him to demand the books she was going to make him find them all pick them up and carry them out himself hopefully down the back stairs again but his next words were a complete shock tonno alendor left a will filed as was proper with the church and appointing brother bryan as executor of the estate the priest continued as if every word hurt him in it everything except the tithe of deathduties and deathtaxes was left to you the shop the contents everything he glared at her as if he wanted badly to know what she had done to make the old man name her as his heir for her part she just stared at him gaping in surprise unable to speak finally the priest continued in an aggrieved tone brother bryan has found a buyer for the shop and contents with the sole exception being a few books that tonno mentions specifically that he wanted you to keep heres the list he handed it to her with the tips of his fingers as if touching her or it might somehow contaminate him she took it hands shaking as she opened it as she had expected they were all the books tonno had insisted she keep here at her room if you have no objections the priest finished his teeth gritted brother bryan will complete the purchase the church will receive ten percent as deathtithe he as executor will receive another ten percent city deathtaxes are a remaining ten percent you will receive the bulk of the moneys from the sale it wont be much he finished taking an acid delight in imparting that bad news the shop is in a bad location and the contents are a jumble of used merchandise mostly curiosities and hard to dispose of but brother bryan will have your moneys delivered here at the conclusion of the sale and take care of the deathduties himself unless you have something else from the shop you would like to keep as a memorialpiece again he pursed his lips sourly the value of that piece will of course be prorated against your share she thought quickly then shook her head there was nothing there that she wanted everything in the shop would be forever tainted with the horrid memories of tonnos sickness and unnecessary death let someone else take it someone for whom the place would have no such memories not even the instruments would be of any use she could only play fiddle and lute and tonno had sold the last of those months ago during the height of summer the priest took himself out leaving her still dazed she didnt know what to think how much money was not very much assuming that brother bryan only got a fraction of what the contents of the shop were worthand she did not doubt that he would drive a very hard bargain indeed both for her sake and the churchsthat was still more money than she had ever had in her life what was she to do with it it beggared the pouch full of silver shed gotten from the ghost she fell asleep still trying to comprehend it this time her dreams about jib were troubled he was plainly unhappy scorned by the villagers abused by stara ordered about by everyone and yet he had nowhere to go he had no money saved no prospects the village toughs still bullied him and without rune to protect him he often sported bruises or a black eye they laughed at him for being a coward but what was he to do if he fought them theyd only hurt him further or complain that he had picked the fight not they they never came at him by ones or twos only in a gang hed had an offer from a horsetrader a month ago an honest man who had been stopping at the bear for as long as jib could recallif he had some money the man would let him buy into the string and learn the business eventually to take it over when the trader settled down to breeding that was the answer to his prayersbut he had no money the trader would keep the offer open as long as he could but how long would he wait a year more no matter how long he waited jib would still never have it he got no pay hed get no pay for as long as stara was holding the pursestrings if he went elsewhere he might earn pay in addition to his keep but only if he could produce a good reference and stara would never let jeoff give him one if he left he worked his endless round of chores with despair his constant companion rune woke with a start and she knew at that moment exactly what she was going to do the days were warm now and so were the nightswarm enough to sleep out at any rate now was the time to leave shed be at the faire when it opened if she left now but leaving meant goodbyes she hugged everyone from ruby to the new little kitchenboy with a lump in her throat shed been happier here than anyplace else in her life if tonno were still alive she might have put this off another year not now it was go now or give up the dream tonnos memory wouldnt let her do that were sorry to see you leave rune amber said with real regret when rune hugged her goodbye her balance a little off from the unaccustomed weight of her packs but tonno and i always knew this place wouldnt hold you longer than a year or two were glad you stayed this long rune sighed im sorry too she confessed buti cant help it amber this is something i have to do at least i found you a replacement for me and a good one diamond said with a wink shell do just fine shes already giving carly hives she doesnt want to do anything else but work as a streetbusker so youll have her for as long as you want her rune continued i was very careful about that i know you were dear amber said and looked at the pouch of coin in her hand i wish youd take this back rune shook her head stubbornly save it if you wont use it save it for an emergency or use it for bribes its not a lot but it ought to keep the lowerlevel church clerks happy i know thats what tonno would like and itd be a good way to honor his memory half of the money shed gotten from the sale of the shop shed given to amber to repay her for all the expense shed gone to in nursing rune back to health a quarter of it had been sent to jib via the gypsies with a verbal messagefollow your dream there were things the gypsies were impeccably honest about and one of them was in keeping pledges theyd vowed on their mysterious gods to take the money to jib without touching a penny once it had gone shed ceased to have nightmares about him the remaining quarter minus the gypsies deliveryfee and the things shed needed for the trip ought to be just enough to get her to the midsummer faire and the trials for the bardic guild she had a new set of faded finery a new pack full of books and the strength that had taken so long to regain was finally back she was ready amber kissed her the way a fond mother would youd better go now before i disgrace myself and cry the madam ordered sternly imagine amber in tears on the steps of her own brotheland over a silly little fiddlergirl she smiled brightly but rune saw the teardrops trembling at the corners of her eyes and threatening to spill over to prevent that she started another round of hugs and kisses that included all of them except carly who was nowhere to be seen probably telling the church that im running away with my illgotten gains well thats it she said at last as nonchalantly as if she was about to cross the town not the country im off wish me luck she turned and headed off down the street for the east gate turning again to walk backwards and wave goodbye she thought she saw amber surreptitiously wipe her eyes on the corner of her sleeve before returning the wave brightly her own throat knotted up and to cover it she waved harder until she was forced to round a corner that put them all out of sight then she squared her shoulders beneath her pack and started on her journey destination the midsummer faire and tonno she thought as she passed below the gates and took to the road this ones for you too always for you chapter thirteen all the world comes to the midsummer faire at kingsford thats what they said anywayand it certainly seemed that way to rune as she traveled the final leg down from nolton the trade road that ran from the holiforth pass to traen and from there to kingsford and the faire field across the kanar river from the town she wasnt walking on the dusty hardpacked road itself shed likely have been trampled by the press of beasts then run over by the carts into the bargain instead she walked with the rest of the foottravelers on the roads verge it was no less dusty what grass there had been had long since been trampled into powder by all the feet of the fairgoers but at least a traveler was able to move along without risk of acquiring hoofprints on his anatomy rune was close enough now to see the gates of the faire set into the wooden palisade that surrounded it and the guard beside them this seemed like a good moment to separate herself from the rest of the throng rest her tired feet and plan her next moves before entering the grounds of the faire she elbowed her way out of the line of people some of whom complained and elbowed back and moved away from the road to a little hillock under a forlorn sapling where she had a good view of the faire a scrap of shade and a rock to sit on the sun beat down with enough heat to warm the top of her head through her soft leather hat she plopped herself down on the rock and began massaging her tired feet while she looked the faire over it was a bit overwhelming certainly it was much bigger than shed imagined it would be nolton had been a shock this was a bigger one it was equally certain that there would be nothing dispensed for free behind those log palings and the few coppers rune had left would have to serve to feed her through the three days of trials for admission to the bardic guild after that well after that she should be an apprentice and food and shelter would be for the guild and her master to worry about or else if she somehow failed she refused to admit the possibility of failing the trials she couldntnot after getting this far tonno would never forgive me but for now she needed somewhere to get herself cleaned of the road dust and a place to sleep both with no price tags attached right now she was the same graybrown as the road from head to toe the darker brown of her hair completely camouflaged by the dust or at least it felt that way even her eyes felt dusty she strolled down to the river her lute thumping her hip softly on one side her pack doing the same on the other there were docks on both sides of the river on this side for the faire on the other for kingsford close to the docks the water was muddy and roiled there was too much traffic on the river to make an undisturbed bath a viable possibility and too many wharfrats about to make leaving ones belongings unattended a wise move she backtracked upstream a bit while the noise of the faire faded behind her she crossed over a small stream that fed into the river and penetrated into land that seemed unclaimed it was probably church land since the faire was held on church property shed often seen church land left to go back to wilderness if it was hard to farm since the church owned the docks and probably owned all fishing rights to this section of river they werent likely to permit any competition the bank of the river was wilder here and overgrown not like the carefully tended area by the faire docks well that would discourage fairegoers from augmenting their supplies with a little fishing from the bank especially if they were townsfolk afraid of bears and snakes under every bush she pushed her way into the tangle and found a gametrail that ran along the riverbank looking for a likely spot finally she found a place where the river had cut a tiny cove into the bank it was secluded trees overhung the water their branches making a good thick screen that touched the water the ground beneath them bare of growth and hollows between some of the roots were just big enough to cradle her sleeping roll camp bath and clear water all together and within climbing distance on one of the trees she discovered a hollow big enough to hide her bedroll and those belongings she didnt want to carry into the faire she waited until dusk fell before venturing into the river and kept her eyes and ears open while she scrubbed herself down she probably wasnt the only countrybred person to think of this ploy and ruffians preferred places where they could hide once clean she debated whether or not to change into the special clothing shed brought tonight it might be better to save itthen the thought of donning the sweatsoaked dusty traveling gear became too distasteful and she rejected it out of hand ive got shirts and underthings for three days thatll do she felt strange and altogether different once shed put the new costume on part of that was due to the materialsexcept for when shed tried the clothing on for fit this was the first time in her life shed ever worn silk and velvet granted the materials were all old bought from a secondhand vendor back in nolton and cut down from much larger mens garments by maddie shed had plenty of time on the road to sew them up the velvet of the breeches wasnt too rubbed the ribbons on the sleeves of the shirt and the embroidered trim shed made when she was sick should cover the faded and frayed places and the vest should cover the stains on the back panels of each shirt completely that had been clever of maddie to reverse the shirts so that the winestained fronts became the backs her hat once the dust was beaten out of it and the plumes shed snatched from the tails of several disgruntled roosters along the way were tucked into the band looked both brave and professional enough her boots at least were new and when the dust was brushed from them looked quite respectable she tucked her remaining changes of clothing and her bedroll into her pack hid the lot in the treehollow and felt ready to face the faire the guard at the gate a church cleric of course eyed her carefully minstrel he asked suspiciously looking at the lute and fiddle she carried in their cases slung from her shoulders youll need a permit to busk if you plan to stay more than three days she shook her head here for the trials mlord not planning on busking which was the truth she wasnt planning on busking if something came up or she was practicing and people chose to pay herwell that wasnt planned was it ah he appeared satisfied you come in good time boy the trials begin tomorrow the guild has its tent pitched hard by the main gate of the cathedral you should have no trouble finding it she thanked him but he had already turned his attention to the next in line she passed inside the log walls and entered the faire itself the first impressions she had were of noise and light torches burned all along the aisle she traversed the booths to either side were lit by lanterns candles or other more expensive methods like perfumed oillamps the crowd was noisy so were the merchants even by torchlight it was plain that these were the booths featuring shoddier goods secondhand finery brass jewelry flash and tinsel the entertainers here weresurprising she averted her eyes from a set of dancers it wasnt so much that they wore little but imagination but the way they were dancing embarrassed even her amber had never permitted anything like this in her house and the fellow with the dancers back at the westhaven faire hadnt had his girls doing anything like this either truth to tell they tended to move as little as possible she kept a tight grip on her pouch and instruments tried to ignore the crush and let the flow of fairgoers carry her along eventually the crowd thinned out a bit though not before shed felt a ghostly hand or two try for her pouch and give it up as a bad cause she followed her nose then looking for the row that held the cookshop tents and the alesellers she hadnt eaten since this morning and her stomach was lying in umcomfortably close proximity to her spine she learned that the merchants of tavernrow were shrewd judges of clothing hers wasnt fine enough to be offered a free taste but she wasnt wearing garments poor enough that they felt she needed to be shooed away sternly admonishing her stomach to be less impatient she strolled the length of the row twice carefully comparing prices and quantities before settling on a humble tent that offered meat pasties best not ask what beast the meat came from not at these prices and fruit juice or milk as well as ale and wine best of all it offered seating at rough trestletables as well her feet were complaining as much as her stomach rune took her flaky pastry and her mug of juice and found a spot at any empty table where she could eat and watch the crowds passing by no wine or ale for her not even had she the coppers to spare for it she dared not be the least muddleheaded not with a secret to keep and the first round of competition in the morning the pie was more crust than meat but it was filling and wellmade and fresh that counted for a great deal she watched the other customers and noted with amusement that there were two sorts of the clumsy crude clay mugs one sort the kind they served the milk and juice in was ugly and shapeless too ugly to be worth stealing but was just as capacious as the exterior promised no doubt that was because children were often more observant than adults gave them credit forand very much inclined to set up a howl if something didnt meet implied expectations the other sort of mug for wine and ale was just the same ugly shape and size on the outside though a different shade of toadback green but had a far thicker bottom effectively reducing the interior capacity by at least a third which a thirsty adult probably wouldnt notice come for the trials lad asked a quiet voice in her ear rune jumped nearly knocking her mug over and snatching at it just in time to save the contents from drenching her shopworn finery and however would she have gotten it clean again in time for tomorrows competition there hadnt been a sound or a hint of movement or even the shifting of the bench to warn her but now there was a man sitting beside her he was of middle years red hair just going to gray a little at the temples smilewrinkles around his mouth and graygreen eyes with a candid triangular face well that said nothing rune had known highwaymen with equally friendly and open faces his costume was similar to her own though leather breeches instead of velvet good linen instead of worn silk a vest and a leather hat that could have been twin to hers but the telling marks were the knots of ribbon on the sleeves of his shirtand the neck of a lute peeking over his shoulder a minstrel of the guild could it be possible that here at the faire thered be guild musicians working the streets rune rechecked the ribbons on his sleeves and was disappointed blue and scarlet and green not the purple and silver of a guild minstrel nor the purple and gold of a guild bard this was only a common busker a mere streetplayer still hed bespoken her kindly enough and god knew not everyone with the musicpassion had the skill or the talent to pass the trials look at tonno hed never even gotten as far as busking aye sir she replied politely ive hopes to pass i think ive the talent and others have said as much including the sour brother pell when shed told him goodbye and the reason for leaving hed not only wished her well hed actually cracked a smile and said that of all his pupils she was the one hed have chosen to send to the trials the strangers eyes measured her keenly and she had the disquieting feeling that her boyruse was fooling him not at all ah well he replied theres amany before you have thought the same and failed that may be she answered the challenge in his eyes stung into revealing what shed kept quiet until now but id bet a copper penny that none of them fiddled for a murdering ghost and not only came out by the grace of their skill but were rewarded by that same spirit for amusing him oh so a lifted eyebrow was all the indication he gave of being impressed but somehow that lifted brow conveyed volumes and he believed her she read that too youve made a song of it surely should i sing it now well why not after the next couple of days it wouldnt be a secret anymore have i not its to be my entry for the third day of testing well then he said no more than that but his wordless attitude of waiting compelled rune to unsling her fiddle case extract her instrument and tune it without further prompting its the fiddle thats my first instrument she said feeling as if she must apologize for singing with a fiddle rather than her lute since the lute was clearly his instrument and since twas the fiddle that made the tale never apologize for a song child he admonished interrupting her let it speak out for itself now lets hear this ghost tale it wasnt easy to sing while fiddling but rune had managed the trick of it some time ago she closed her eyes a halfmoment fixing in her mind the necessary changes shed made to the lyricsfor unchanged the song would have given her sex awayand began i sit here on a rock and curse my stupid bragging tongue and curse the pride that would not let me back down from a boast and wonder where my wits went when i took that challenge up and swore that i would go and fiddle for the skull hill ghostoh that was a damn fool move rune and you knew it when you did it but if you hadnt taken their bet you wouldnt be here now its midnight and theres not a sound up here upon skull hill then comes a wind that chills my blood and makes the leaves blow wildnot a good word choice but a change that had to be madethat was one of the giveaway verses and rising up in front of me a thing like shrouded death a voice says give me reason why i shouldnt kill you child the next verse described runes answer to the spirit and the fiddle wailed of fear and determination and things that didnt rightly belong on earth then came the description of that nightlong lightless ordeal shed passed through and the fiddle shook with the weariness shed felt playing the whole night long then the tune rose with dawning triumph when the thing not only didnt kill her outright but began to warm to the music shed made now she had an audience of more than one though she was only half aware of the fact at last the dawnlight strikes my eyes i stop and see the sun the light begins to chase away the dark and midnight cold and then the light strikes something morei stare in dumb surprise for where the ghost had stood there is a heap of shining goldthe fiddle laughed at death cheated thumbed its nose at spirits and chortled over the revelation that even the angry dead could be impressed and forced to reward courage and talent rune stopped and shook back brown locks dark with sweat and looked about her in astonishment at the applauding patrons of the cooktent she was even more astonished when they began to toss coppers in her open fiddle case and the cooktents owner brought her over a full pitcher of juice and a second pie ida brought ye wine laddie but master talaysen there says ye go to trials and mustna be amuddled she whispered as she hurried back to her counter but this hadnt been a performanceat least not for more than one i hadnt meant surely this isnt the first time youve played for your supper child the minstrels eyes were full of amused irony she flushed well no but so take your wellearned reward and dont go arguing with folk who have a bit of copper to fling at you and who recognize the gift when they hear it no mistake youngling you have the gift and sit and eat youve more bones than flesh a good tale that she peeked at the contents of the case before she answered him not a single pin in the lot folks certainly do fling money about at this faire well rune said and blushed i did exaggerate a bit at the end twasnt gold it was silver but silver wont rhyme and it was that silver that got me herebought me my second instrument paid for lessoning kept me fed while i was learning id be just another tavernmusician otherwise she broke off realizing who and what she was talking to like me you are too polite to say the minstrel smiled then the smile faded there are worse things child than to be a free musician i dont think theres much doubt your gift will get you past the trialsbut you might not find the guild to be all you think it to be rune shook her head stubbornly taking a moment to wonder why shed told this stranger so much and why she so badly wanted his good opinion maybe it was just that he reminded her of a much younger tonno maybe it was simply needing the admiration of a fellow musician only a guild minstrel would be able to earn a place in a nobles train only a guild bard would have the chance to sing for royalty im sorry to contradict you sir but ive had my taste of wandering singing my songs out only to know theyll be forgotten in the next drink wondering where my next meal is coming from ill never get a secure life except through the guild and ill never see my songs live beyond me without their patronage he sighed i hope you never regret your decision child but if you shouldor if you need help ever here at the faire or elsewherewell just ask around the gypsies or the musicians for talaysen or for master wren some call me that as well ill stand your friend with those surprising words he rose soundlessly as gracefully as a bird in flight and slipped out of the tent just before he passed out of sight among the press of people he pulled his lute around to the front and struck a chord she managed to hear the first few notes of a love song the words rising golden and glorious from his throat before the crowd hid him from view and the babble of voices obscured the music she strolled the faire a bit more bought herself a sweetcake and watched the teasershows outside some of the showtents she wished she wasnt in boyguise there were many goodlooking young men here and not all of them were going about with young women having learned more than a bit about preventing pregnancy at ambers shed spent a little of her convalescence in losing her virginity with young shawm the defloration was mutual as it turned out shed reflected after she left that it might have been better with a more experienced lover but at least theyd been equals in ignorance towards the end theyd gotten better at it she had at least as much pleasure out of loveplay as he did theyd parted as theyd begunfriends and she had the feeling that maddie was going to be his next and more serious target well at least i got him broken in for her but it was too bad that she was in disguise even downright plain girls seemed to be having no trouble finding company and if after a day or two it turned into more than company never mind if they work me as hard as i think they will in the guild i wont have any time for dalliance so i might as well get used to celibacy again but as the tentlined streets of the faire seemed to hold more and more couples she decided it was time to leave she needed the sleep anyway everything was still where shed left it praying for a dry night she lined her chosen roothollow with bracken and settled in for the night rune was waiting impatiently outside the guild tent the next morning long before there was anyone there to take her name for the trials the tent itself was as the faire guard had said hard to miss purple in the main with pennons and edgings of silver and gilt almosttoo much it bordered on the gaudy she was joined shortly by three more striplings one welldressed and confident two sweating and nervous more trickled in as the sun rose higher until there was a line of twenty or thirty waiting when the guild registrar an old and sourlooking church cleric raised the tentflap to let them file inside he wasnt wearing guild colors but rather a robe of dusty gray linen she was a little taken aback since she hadnt been aware of a connection between the guild and the church before other than the fact that there were many guild musicians and bards who had taken vows would they have ways to check back to nolton and to ambers could they find out she was a girl before the trials were over then she laughed at her own fears even if they had some magic that could cross leagues of country in a single day and bring that knowledge back why would they bother there was nothing important about her she was just another boy at the trials and even if she passed shed only be another apprentice the clerk took his time sharpening his quill until rune was ready to scream with impatience before looking her up and down and asking her name rune of westhaven and lately of nolton she held to her vow of not claiming a sirename mother is stara of westhaven he noted it without a comment primary instrument fiddle scratch scratch of quill on parchment secondary lute he raised an eyebrow the usual order was lute primary fiddle secondary for that matter fiddle wasnt all that common even as a secondary instrument and you will perform first day primary lament of the maiden esme second day secondary the unkind lover third day original the skull hill ghost an awful title but she could hardly use the real name of fiddler girl accompanied on primary fiddle he was no longer even marginally interested in her take your place she sat on the backless wooden bench trying to keep herself calm before her was the raised wooden platform on which they would all perform to either side of it were the backless benches like the one she warmed for the aspirants to the guild the back of the tent made the third side of the platform and the fourth faced the row of wellpadded chairs for the guild judges although she was first here it was inevitable that they would let others have the preferred first few slots there would be those with fathers already in the guild or those who had coins for bribes who would play first so that they were free to enjoy the faire for the rest of the day without having to wait long enough for their nerves to get the better of them still she shouldnt have to wait too longrising with the dawn would give her that much of an edge at least she got to play by midmorning the lament was perfect for fiddle the words were simple and few and the wailing melody gave her lots of scope for improvisation the style the judges had chosen florid style encouraged such improvisation the row of guild judges solemn in their tunics or robes of purple white silk shirts trimmed with gold or silver ribbon depending on whether they were minstrels or bards were a formidable audience their faces were much alike wellfed and very conscious of their own importance you could see it in their eyes as they sat below the platform and took unobtrusive notes they seemed at least mildly impressed with her performance even more heartening several of the boys yet to perform looked satisfyingly worried when shed finished she packed up her fiddle and betook herself briskly outto find herself a corner of the cathedral wall to lean against as her knees sagged when the excitement that had sustained her wore off i never used to react that badly to an audience maybe she hadnt recovered from her sickness as completely as shed thought or maybe it was just that shed never had an audience this important before it was several long moments before she could get her legs to bear her weight and her hands to stop shaking it was then that she realized that she hadnt eaten since the night beforeand that she was suddenly ravenous before shed played the very thought of food had been revolting the same cookshop tent as before seemed like a reasonable proposition she paid for her breakfast with some of the windfallcoppers of the night before this morning the tent was crowded and she was lucky to get a scant corner of a bench to herself she ate hurriedly and joined the strollers through the faire once or twice she thought she glimpsed the red hair of talaysen but if it really was the minstrel he was gone by the time she reached the spot where she had thought hed been there were plenty of other streetbuskers though she thought wistfully of the harvest of coin shed reaped the night before as she noted that none of them seemed to be lacking for patronage and no one was tossing pins into the hat either it was all copper coinsand occasionally even a silver one but now that she was a duly registered entrant in the trials it would be going against custom if not the rules to set herself up among them that much shed picked up waiting for her turn an odd sort of custom but there it was better that she didnt stand out as the only one defying it so instead she strolled and listened and made mental notes for further songs there were plenty of things she saw or overheard that brought snatches of rhyme to mind by early evening her head was crammed fulland it was time to see how the guild had ranked the aspirants of the morning the list was posted outside the closed tentflaps and rune wasnt the only one interested in the outcome of the first days trials it took a bit of time to work her way in to look but when she did by gods saints there she was rune of westhaven listed third she all but floated back to her riverside treeroost the second day of the trials was worse than the first the aspirants performed in order lowest ranking to highest that meant that rune had to spend most of the day sitting on the hard wooden bench clutching the neck of her lute in nervous fingers listening to contestant after contestant and sure that each one was much better on his secondary instrument than she was shed only had a year of training on it after all still the song shed chosen was picked deliberately to play up her voice and deemphasize her lutestrumming it was going to be pretty difficult for any of these others to match her high contralto a truly cunning imitation of a boys soprano since most of them had passed puberty at long last her turn came she swallowed her nervousness as best she could took the platform and began privately she thought it was a pretty ridiculous song why on earth any man would put up with the things that lady did to him and all for the sake of a kiss on her cold quiet hand was beyond her shed parodied the song and nothing she wrote matched the intrinsic silliness of the original still she put all the acting ability she had into it and was rewarded by a murmur of approval when shed finished that voiceive seldom heard one so pure at that late an age she overheard as she packed up her instrument if he passes the third dayyou dont suppose hed agree to being gelded do you i can think of half a dozen courts that would pay red gold to have a voice like his in service she smothered a smileimagine their surprise to discover that it would not be necessary to eunuch her to preserve her voice she played drum for the next then lingered to hear the last of the entrants and unable to resist she waited outside for the posting of the results she nearly fainted to discover that shed moved up to second place i told you said a familiar voice behind her but are you still sure you want to go through with this she whirled to find the minstrel talaysen standing in her shadow the sunset brightening his hair and the warm light on his face making him appear scarcely older than she im sure she replied firmly one of the judges said today that he could think of half a dozen courts that would pay red gold to have my voice he raised an eyebrow bought and sold like so much mutton wheres the living in that caged behind high stone walls and never let out of the sight of mlords guards lest you take a notion to sell your services elsewhere is that the life you want to lead trudging down roads in the pouring cold rain frightened half to death that youll take sickness and ruin your voicemaybe for good singing with your stomach growling so loud it drowns out the song watching some idiot with half your talent being clad in silk and velvet and eating at the high table while you try and please some brutes of guardsmen in the kitchen in hopes of a few scraps and a corner by the fire she countered no thank you ill take my chances with the guild besides where else would i be able to learn ive got no more silver to spend on instruments or teaching tonno you did your best but ive seen the guild musicians i heard guild musicians in the church at practice back in nolton i have to become that good i have to if im to honor your memory there are those who would teach you for the love of it he said and her face hardened as she thought of tonno how he had taught her to the best of his ability she was trying to keep from showing her grief he must have misinterpreted her expression for he sighed welladay youve made up your mind as you will child he replied but his eyes were sad as he turned away and vanished into the crowd again once again she sat the hard bench for most of the day while those of lesser ranking performed this time it was a little easier to bear it was obvious from a great many of these performances that few if any of the boys had the gift to create by the time it was runes turn to perform she judged that counting herself and the firstplace holder there could only be five real contestants for the three open bardic apprentice slots the rest would be suitable only as minstrels singing someone elses songs unable to compose their own she took her place before the critical eyes of the judges and began she realized with a surge of panic as she finished the first verse that they did not approve while she improvised some fiddle bridges she mentally reviewed the verse trying to determine what it was that had set those slight frowns on the judicial faces then she realized she had said she had been boasting guild bards simply did not admit to being boastful nor did they demean themselves by reacting to the taunts of lesser beings oh god in heaven quickly she improvised a verse on the folly of youth of how had she been older and wiser shed never have gotten herself into such a predicament she heaved an invisible sigh of relief as the frowns disappeared by the last chorus they were actually nodding and smiling and one of them was tapping a finger in time to the tune she finished with a flourish worthy of a master and waited breathlessly and they applauded dropped their dignity and applauded the performance of the final contestant was an anticlimax none of them had left the tent since this last trial began instead of a list the final results would be announced and they waited in breathless anticipation to hear what they would be several of the boys had already approached rune offering smiling congratulations on her presumed firstplace slot a hush fell over them all as the chief of the judges took the platform a list in his hand first place and first apprenticeship as bardrune son of stara of westhaven pardon my lord rune called out clearly bubbling over with happiness and unable to hold back the secret any longer but its not sonits daughter she had only a split second to take in the rage on their faces before the first staff descended on her head they flung her into the dust outside the tent halfsenseless and her smashed instruments beside her the passersby avoided even looking at her as she tried to get to her feet and fell three times her right arm dangled uselessly it hurt so badly that she was certain that it must be broken but it hadnt hurt half as badly when theyd cracked it as it had when theyd smashed her fiddle that had broken her heart all she wanted to do now was to get to the river and throw herself in with any luck at all shed drown but she couldnt even manage to stand gently lass someone said touching her good arm she looked around but her vision was full of stars and graying out on the edges strong hands reached under her shoulders and supported her on both sides the voice sounded familiar but she was too dazed to think who it was god be my witness if ever i thought theyd have gone this far id never have let you go through with this farce she turned her head as they got her standing trying to see through tears of pain both of heart and body with eyes that had sparks dancing before them the man supporting her on her left she didnt recognize but the one on the right ttalaysen she faltered i told you id help if you needed it did i not he smiled but there was no humor in it i think you have more than a little need at the moment she couldnt help herself she wept like a little child hopelessly the fiddle the gift of roseand the lute picked out by tonnoboth gone forever ththey broke my fiddle talaysen and my lute they broke them then they beat me and they broke my arm oh rune lass there were tears in his eyes and yet he almost seemed to be laughing as well if ever i doubted youd the makings of a bard you just dispelled those doubts first the fiddle then the luteand only then do you think of your own hurts ah come away lass come where people can care for such a treasure as you stumbling through darkness wracked with pain carefully supported and guided on either side rune was in no position to judge where or how far they went after some unknown interval however she found herself in a manycolored tent lit with dozens of lanterns partitioned off with curtains hung on wires that crisscrossed the entire dwelling just now most of these were pushed back and a mixed crowd of men and women greeted their entrance with cries of welcome that turned to dismay at the sight of her condition she was pushed down into an improvised bed of soft wool blankets and huge fat pillows a thin dark girl dressed like a gypsy bathed her cuts and bruises with something that stung then numbed them and a graybearded man tskd over her arm prodded it once or twice then without warning pulled it into alignment when he did that the pain was so incredible that rune nearly fainted by the time the multicolored fireflashing cleared from her eyes he was binding her arm up tightly with bandages and thin strips of wood while the girl was urging her to drink something that smelled of herbs and wine where am i who are these people what do they want before she had a chance to panic talaysen reappeared as if conjured at her side where he understood immediately what she was asking youre with the free bardsthe real bards not those pompous pufftoads of the guild he said dear child i thought that all that would happen to you was that those inflated bladders of selfimportance would give you a tonguelashing and throw you out on your backside if id had the slightest notion that theyd do this to you id have kidnapped you away and had you drunk insensible till the trials were over i may never forgive myself now drink your medicine but howwhywho are you rune managed between gulps what are you i think might be the better place to start tell her will you erdric were the free bards said the graybearded man as master talaysen told you hes the one who banded us together when he found that there were those who like himself had the gift and the talent but were disinclined to put up with the selfaggrandizement and politics and foolish slavishness to form that the guild requires we go where we wish and serveor not servewho we will and sing as we damn well please and no foolishness about wholl be offended we also keep a sharp eye out for youngsters like you with the gift and with the spirit to fight the guild weve had our eye on you theseoh it must be near a halfdozen years now six years all this time and i never knew youbut how who was watching me myself for one said a new voice and a bony fellow with hair that kept falling into his eyes joined the group around her you likely dont remember me but i remember youi heard you fiddle in your tavern when i was passing through westhaven and i passed the word and im another this one standing near the back of the group rune recognized she was the harpist with the gypsies the one called nightingale another of my people the man you knew as raven was sent to be your main teacher until you were ready for another we knew youd find another good teacher for yourself then if you were a true musician you see we keep an eye out for all the likely lads and lasses weve marked knowing that soon or late theyd come to the trials usually though theyre not so stubborn as you talaysen said and smiled i should hope to live the lanky fellow agreed they made the same remark my first day about wanting to have me stay a liltin soprano the rest of me days that was enough for me and they wouldnt even give me the same notice theyd have given a flea the dark girl laughed though i hadnt the wit to think of passing myself off as a boy for the trials that was my teachers idea rune admitted it might even have worked talaysen told her if they werent so fanatic about women its part of guild teachings that women are lower than men and can never have the true gift of the bards you not only passed you beat every other boy there they couldnt have that it went counter to all they stand for if they admitted you could win theyd have to admit that many other things they teach are untrue he grinned which they are of course thats why were here butwhy are youtogether rune asked bewildered she was used to competition among musicians not cooperation for the same reason as the guilds were formed in the first place we band together to give each other help a spot of silver to tide you over an empty month a place to go when youre hurt or ill someone to care for you when youre not as young as you used to be the grayhaired man called erdric said nightingale spoke up from the rear to teach and to learn as well and we have more and better patronage than you or even the guild suspects a big bear of a man laughed not everyone finds the precious style of the guild songsters to their taste especially the farther you get from the large cities out in the countryside away from the decadence of courts they like their songs to be like their food substantial and heartening but why does the guild let you get away with this if youre taking patronage from them rune couldnt help feeling apprehensive despite all their easy assurance bless you child they couldnt do without us talaysen laughed no matter what you think there isnt a single creative master among em gwyna my heart sing her the unkind loveryour version i mean the real and original gwyna the dark girl who had tended runes bruises flashed dazzling white teeth in a vulpine grin plucked a guitar from somewhere behind her and began well it was the same melody that rune had sung and some of the wordsthe best phraseswere the same as well but this was no icecold princess taunting her poor chivalrous admirer with what hed never touch no this was a teasing shepherdess seeing how far she could harass her cowherd lover and the teasing was kindly meant and what the cowherd claimed at the end was a good deal more than a kiss on her cold quiet hand in fact you might say with justice that the proceedings got downright heated it reminded her a bit of her private goodbye with shawm in fact that lament you did the first days trial is another song theyve twisted and tormented most of the popular ballads the guild touts as their own are ours talaysen told her with a grin as you should know seeing as youve written at least half of them gwyna snorted but what would you have done if they had accepted me anyway rune wanted to know oh you wouldnt have lasted long can a caged lark sing soon or late youd have done what i did talaysen told her youd have escaped your gilded cage and wed have been waiting then you were a guild bard somehow she felt shed known that all along but i never hear of one called talaysen and if the lament is yours talaysen coughed and blushed well i changed my name when i took my freedom likely though you wouldnt recognize it oh she wouldnt you think or are you playing mockmodest with us again gwyna shook back her abundant black hair ill make it known to you that youre having your bruises tended by master bard gwydain himself gwydain runes eyes went wide as she stared at the man who coughed deprecatingly butbuti thought master gwydain was supposed to have gone into seclusionor diedor took vows the guild would hardly want it known that their pride had rejected em for a pack of gypsy jonguelers now would they the lanky fellow pointed out so can i tempt you to join with us rune lass the man shed known as talaysen asked gently id likebut i cant she replied despairingly how could i keep myself itll take weeks for my arm to heal andmy instruments are splinters anyway she shook her head tears in her eyes they werent much but they were all i had they werefrom friends tonno rose will you ever forgive me ive not only failed but ive managed to lose your legacy to me i dont have a choice ill have to go back to noltonor maybe theyll take me in a tavern in kingsford i can still turn a spit and fill a glass onehanded tears spilled down her cheeks as she thought of going back to the life shed thought shed left behind her ah lass didnt you hear erdric the old man asked theres nothing for you to worry about youre one of us you wont need to go running off to find a way to keep food in your mouth we take care of each otherwell care for you till youre whole again she stared at them all and every one of them nodded the old man patted her shoulder then hastily found her a rag when scanning their faces brought her beliefand more tears as for the instruments talaysen vanished and returned again as her sobs quieted i cant bring back your departed friends theyre splinters and i loved them cant be mended nor can i give you back the memories of those who gave them to you but if i can offer a poor substitute what think you of these twain the fiddle and lute he laid in her lap werent new nor were they the kind of gilded carved and ornamented dainties guild musicians boasted but they held their own kind of quiet beauty a beauty of mellow wood and clean lines rune plucked a string on each experimentally and burst into tears again the tone was lovely smooth and golden and these were the kind of instruments shed never dreamed of touching much less owning when the tears had been soothed away the various medicines been applied both internally and externally and introductions made all around rune found herself once again alone with talaysenor gwydain though on reflection she liked the name shed first known him by better the rest had drawn curtains on their wires close in about her little corner making an alcove of privacy if youre going to let me join you she said shyly let he laughed interrupting her havent we made it plain enough weve been trying to lure you like conycatchers oh youre one of us rune lass youve just been waiting to find us youll not escape us now thenwhat am i supposed to do you heal he said firmly thats the first thing the second well we dont have formal apprenticeships amongst us by the lady theres no few things you could serve as master in and no question about it you could teach most of us a bit about fiddling for one but she felt a surge of dismay am i going to have to fumble along on my own now one of the reasons i wanted to join the guild was to learn i can barely read or write music not like a master anyway theres so many instruments i cant playher voice rose to a soft wailhow am i going to learn if a master wont take me as an apprentice enough enough no more weeping and wailing my hearts oversoft as it is he said hastily if youre going to insist on being an apprentice i suppose theres nothing for it will i do as a master to you rune was driven to speechlessness and could only nod me apprentice to gwydain she felt dizzy this was impossible things like this only happened in songs like winning prizes from a ghost by the lady lass you make a liar out of me who swore never to take an apprentice wait a moment he vanished around the curtain for a moment then returned here he set down a tiny harp this can be played onehanded and learning the ways of her will keep you too busy to bedew me with any more tears while your arm mends treat her gentlyshes my own very first instrument and she deserves respect rune cradled the harp in her good arm too awestricken to reply well send someone in the morning for your things wherever it is youve cached em lean back thereoh its a proper nursemaid i am he chattered as if to cover discomfort or to distract her as he made her comfortable on her pillows covering her with blankets and moving her twono threenew instruments to a place of safety but still within sight he seemed to understand how seeing them made her feel well find you clothing and the like as well that sleepyjuice they gave you should have you nodding shortly just remember one thing before you doze off im not going to be an easy master to serve you wont be spending your days lazing about you know come morning ill set you your very first task youll teach mehis eyes lighted with unfeigned eagernessthat ghost song yes master talaysen she managed to sayand then she fell deeply and profoundly asleep chapter fourteen the faire ran for eight weeks rune had arrived the first day of the second week not everyone who was a participant arrived for the beginning of the faire there were major events occurring every week of the faire and minor ones every day she had known vaguely that the trials and other guild contests were the big event of the second weekthe first week had been horse races and next week would be livestock judging a different breed of animal every day none of this had made any difference to her at the time but it might now the final week of faire was devoted to those seeking justice and it was entirely possible that the guild might decide to wreak further justice on her in trials of another sort she spent the night in painfilled dreams of being brought up before the three church justices on charges of trying to defraud the bardic guild each time she halfwoke someone would press a mug of medicinal tea into her hands get her to drink it down and take it away when shed fallen asleep again when she truly woke the next morning the big tent was empty of everyone except gwyna the dark gypsy girl erdric and a young boy it was the boys voice that woke her singing in a breathy treble to a harp a song in a language she didnt recognize the harpnotes faltered a little as he tried to play and sing at the same time she struggled to sit up and in the process rattled the rings of the curtain next to her against the wire strung overhead there was no sound of footsteps to warn her that anyone had heard her but gwyna peeked around the curtain and smiled when she saw that rune was awake everybodys gone out busking she said except us she pulled back the curtain to show who us was its our turn to mind the tent and make sure no one makes off with our belongings what will you have for breakfast a new head rune moaned moving had made both head and arm ache horribly her head throbbed in both temples and her arm echoed the throbbing a half heartbeat after her head she also felt completely filthy which didnt improve matters any how about a bath a visit to the privy and a mug of something for the aches gwyna asked once youre up itll be easier to get around but for the first couple of days redbird has said you ought to stay pretty much in bed wondering who redbird was rune nodded wordlessly and gwyna helped her up i think youll have to borrow some of my clothes until yours can be washed the girl added looking at runes stained filthy clothing if youve no objection to wearing skirts noi mean the whole purpose of looking like a boy was to get in the trials rune sighed i dont really care one way or another and if youd be willing to lend some clothing id be grateful i left some other stuff my bedroll and all up a tree but most of the clothing in my pack was dirty too she described where shed left it as the boy left his harp with the old man and came close to listen ill go get it the child said eagerly and was off before anyone could say a word flying out the front of the tent where the two flaps stood open to let in air erdric shrugged hard to keep them to lessons at that age the old man said not without sympathy i know how i was hell be all right and hell get your things without touching the pack hes that honest though i should warn you if youve got anything unusual youd better show it to him before he gets eaten up with curiosity imagining all sorts of treasures thats my grandson rune his names alain but we all call him sparrow the name suited him well if he gets back before were done would you tell him i thank him most kindly rune said with difficulty through the pain in her skull the ache made her squint against all the light and it made her tense up her shoulder muscles as well which didnt help any right now i cant think any too well not to worry gwyna chuckled we all know how you must be feeling i think every one of us has fallen afoul of someone and has ended up with a cracked bone and an aching head i mind me the time a bitch of a girl in newcomb reckoned i was after her swain and took after me with a frypan i swear my head rang like a steeple full of bells on a holy day come on lady lark let me get you to some warm water to soak the aches out and well worry about the rest later rune hadnt really hoped for warm water and she wondered how tentdwellers who presumably hadnt brought anything more than what they could carry were going to manage it she soon found out the free bards were camped outside the faire palings alongside of another little stream that fed the great river on much hillier rockier ground than rune had crossed in her explorations of the river it was an ingenious campsite the huge tent lay athwart the entrance to a little hollow beside the stream that gave them their own little park free from prying eyes screened by thick underbrush and trees that grew right up to the very edge of the bank on the other side this was a wilder watercourse than the one rune had crossed upstream it had a little waterfall at the top of the hollow and was full of flat sheets of rock and watersmoothed boulders below the falls a hollow log carried water from the falls to a place where someone had cemented riverstones on the sides of a natural depression in one of those huge sheets of rock there was a little board set into the rocks at the lower end like a dam to let the water out again and a fire on the flat part of the rock beside the rough bathtub the rockbuilt tub was already full weve been coming here for years and since were here before anyone but the merchants we always get this spot gwyna explained as she shoveled rocks out of the heart of the fire and dropped them into the waiting water with a sizzle we keep the tent in storage over in kingsford during the year with a merchant who sometimes lets it to other groups for outdoor revels weve put in a few things that the wind and weather wont ruin over the years this was one of the first do you know those scurvy merchants over in the faire charge a whole silver penny for a bath she bristled as if she was personally offended rune smiled wanly you cant win she continued you can get a bath for a copper in the public baths across the river in kingsford but youd either get soaked going over the ford or pay four coppers coming and going on the ferry thats a merchant for you rune agreed i suppose the church has rules about bathing in the river no but no one would want to up near the docks its half mud she shook her head well when youre better youll have to do this for yourself and remember on your honor you always leave the bath set up for the next person he may be as sore and tired as you were when you needed it while she was talking she was helping rune get out of her clothing rune winced at the sight of all the bruises marking her body it would be a long time before they all faded and until then it would be hard to find a comfortable position to sit or sleep in and shed have to wear long sleeves and long skirts to keep people from seeing what had been done to her in you go gwyna said gaily as if rune didnt look like a patchwork of blue and black you soak for a while ill be back with soap rune was quite content to lean back against the smooth rock close her eyes and soak in the warm water it wasnt hot that was too bad because really hot water would have felt awfully good right now but it was warmer than her own skin temperature so it felt very comforting a gap in the trees let sun pour down on her and that continued to warm both the water and the rocks she rested on she must have dozed off because the next thing she knew gwyna was shaking her shoulder there was a box of soft soap on the rocks beside her here drink this ill do your hair gwyna said matteroffactly placing a mug of that doctored wine in her good hand its not fit to be seen i can believe it rune replied she took the mug then sniffed the wine wrinkled her nose and drank it down in one gulp as she had expected it tasted vile gwyna laughed at her grimace took the mug and used it to dip out water to wet down her hair we gypsies only use the worst wine we can find for potions gwyna said cheerfully they taste so awful theres no use in ruining a good drinkand im told you need the spirits in wine to get the most out of some of the herbs she took the box of soap then and began massaging it carefully into runes hair rune was glad she was being careful there was an amazing number of knots on her skull and gwyna was finding them all she closed her eyes and waited for the aching to subside about the third time gwyna rinsed her hair her head finally stopped throbbing she opened her eyes without wincing at the light took the soap herself and began getting herself as clean as she could without wetting her splinted arm finally they were both finished and rune rinsed herself off can you stand a cold drench gwyna asked then itll probably clear your head a bit she considered it for a moment then nodded gwyna let the water out by sliding out the board then she maneuvered the log over to its stand and let fresh cold water run in it swung easily and rune noted that it was set to pour water over the head of someone sitting beneath it in the tub rune rinsed quickly getting the last of the soap off and stuck her head under the water for as long as she could bear then she scrambled out gasping and gwyna handed her a rough towel that might once have been part of a grain sack and swung the log away again while gwyna took the rocks out of the bottom of the pool put them back beside the fire then refilled the tub and built the fire back up rune dried herself off wrapping her hair in the towel there was clothing ready on the rocks in the sun a bright skirt and bodice and a minstrels shirt with ribbons on the full sleeves and some of her own underthings waiting for her she got into them and felt much the better the medicine the bath and the clean clothing worked together to make her feel more like herself especially after the worst of the bruises were covered even the ache in her head and arm receded to something bearable now what she asked gwyna where would you like me to go i dont want to be in the way and if theres anything i can do id like to i dont want to be a burden either the girl nodded towards the tent again back to bed with you gwyna said theres plenty you can do for us without being in the way erdric wants to hear some of those comicsongs thrush said you did back in nolton who she asked astonished that anyone here knew about those songs how did you hear about those thrush i told you gwyna replied a trifle impatiently you played for her to dance when her brothers were out busking the taverns at midday the gypsy remember oh rune said faintly that was all the way back in nolton how on earth had word of those songs gotten all the way here how many of these free bards were there and was there anything that they didnt know i didnt knowyou all knew each other then she burst out impatiently does every busker in the world belong to the free bards was i the only one who never heard of you before this oh no gwyna took one look at her angry exasperated face and burst out laughing for some reason she found runes reaction incredibly funny rune wasnt as amused in fact she was getting a bit angry but she told herself that there was no point in taking out her anger in gwyna even if she was being incredibly annoying rune reined in her temper and finally admitted to herself that she wouldnt be as exasperated if she wasnt still in pain after all what was she thinkingthat the free bards had the same kind of information network as the church now there was an absurdity no no no gwyna finally said when shed gotten her laughter under control its just the gypsies were used to passing messages all over the kingdoms anything that interests the free bards involves us sooner or later why rune asked her brow furrowed you gypsies are all related in one way or another if i understand right but what does that have to do with the free bards quite a bit gwyna said sobering you see master wren came to us when he first ran away from the guild and it was being with us that gave him the idea for the free bards he liked the kind of group we are he says were supportive without being restrictive whatever that means all right i can see that rune replied but i still dont understand what the gypsies have to do with the free bards for a start its probably fair to say that every gypsy thats any kind of a musician is a free bard now the gift runs strong in us when it runs at all when anything calls us music or dance tradingcraft horsecraft metalcraft or mag she stopped herself and rune had the startling idea that she was about to say magic magic if it was not proscribed by the church it was at the least frowned upon well anything that calls us calls us strongly so when we do a thing we do it well gwyna skipped lightly over the grass and held open the tentflap for rune so if wed chosen the cagedlife every male of us could likely be in the guild that wasnt our way though and seeing that gave master wren the idea for the free bards of you gejo id say maybe one of every ten musicians and streetbuskers are free bards no more the rest simply arent good enough you were good enough so we watched you wethats free bards and gypsies both rune sighed that at least made her feel a little less like a child that hasnt been let in on a secret the free bards werent everywhere they didnt have a secret eye on everyone just the few who seemed to promise theyd fit in the free bard ranks there werent any free bards in nolton the gypsies though we have eyes and ears everywhere because we go everywhere and since were always meeting each other were always passing news so what one knows within months all know were a good way for the free bards to keep track of each other and of those who will fit in when theyre ready gwyna showed her back to her own corner of the tent which now held her bedroll and the huge cushions her pack as well as the instruments talaysen had given her food first the girl asked rune nodded now that her head and arm didnt hurt quite so much she was actually hungry not terribly which was probably the result of the medicine but she wasnt nauseated anymore gwyna brought her bread and cheese and more of the doctored wine while erdrics grandson came and flung himself down on the cushions with the bonelessness of the very young and watched her as if he expected she might break apart at any moment and as if he thought it might be very entertaining when she did she finished half the food before she finally got tired of the big dark eyes on her and returned him stare for stare yes she said finally is there something you wanted to ask me did it hurt he asked brighteyed as innocent and callous as only a child could be yes it did she told him a lot i was very stupid though nobody knew how stupid i was being dont ever put yourself in the position where someone can beat you run away if you can but dont ever be as stupid as i was all right he said brightly i wont thank you for getting my things she said when it occurred to her that she hadnt thanked him herself i really appreciate it there isnt anything special in my pack but its all ive got youre welcome he told her serious and proper then as if her politeness opened up a floodgate the questions came pouring out are you staying with the free bards are you partnering with master wren are you going to be his lover he needs a lover robin says so all the time do you want to be his lover lots of girls want to be his lover and he wont be do you like him he likes you i can tell sparrow gwyna said sharply thats private do we discuss private matters without permission if shes with us it isnt private is it he retorted if shes a free bard shes part of the romgerry and it isnt private matters to talk about yes it is gwyna replied firmly yes shes staying and yes shes a free bard now but the rest is private matters until master wren tells you different you wont ask any more questions like that is that understood for some reason that rune didnt understand gwyna was blushing a brilliant scarlet the boy seemed to sense he had pushed her as far as he dared he jumped to his feet and scampered off gwyna averted her face until her blushes faded what was that all about rune asked too surprised to be offended or embarrassed after all the boy meant no harm shed spent the night an arms length away from talaysen it was perfectly natural for the child to start thinking in terms of other than master and apprentice we all worry about master wren gwyna said some of us maybe worry a bit too much some of us think he spends too much time by himself and well theres always talk about how he ought to find someone whod be good for him and who is this robin she asked curiously me gwyna said flushing again gypsies dont like strangers knowing their real names so we take names that anyone can use names that say something about what our craft is a horsetamer might be roan tamer or cob for instance all musicians take birdnames and the free bards have started doing the same because it makes it harder for the church and cities to keep track of us for taxes and tithes andother things yes and i can imagine what those other things are trouble like i got myself into she turned a face back to rune that might never have been flushed once again the cheerful careless girl shed been a moment earlier talaysen is wren erdric is owl im robin daranthats the tall fellow that knew youis heron alain is sparrow aysah is nightingale my cousin the one whos making up your medicines is redbird reshan is raven you know him too the fellow who looks like a bandit hes not here yet we expect him in about a week she tilted her head to one side and surveyed rune thoughtfully we need a name for you although i think wren tagged you with the one that will stick lark lady lark rune rolled the flavor of it around on her tongue and decided she liked it not that she was likely to have much choice in the matter these folk tended to hit you like a wild wind and like the wind they took you where they wanted without warning theres a song in that but she was not allowed to catch it not yet erdric advanced across the tentfloor towards her guitar in hand and a look of determination on his face she was a bit surprised at that she hadnt thought there was anything anyone could want from her as badly as all that my voice isnt what it was erdric said as he sat down beside her its going on the top and the bottom and frankly the best way i can coax money from listeners is with comedy now i understand you have about a dozen comic songs that no one else knows thats nothing short of a miracle especially for me youve no idea how hard it is to find comic songs so the times come to earn my bread hmm she asked he nodded if you cant go out you should share your songs with those that need them erdric replied i do a love song well enough but ive no gift for satire besides can you see a driedup old stick like me asinging a love ballad he snorted ill give the love songs to you youngsters you teach me your comedy i promise you ill do justice to it all right thats only fair she acknowledged lets start with two fair maids the free bards all came trickling back by ones and twos as the sun set but only to eat and drink and rest a bit and then they were off again mostly they didnt even stop to talk although some of them did change into slightly richer clothing and the dancers changed into much gaudier gear erdric his grandson and gwyna did quite a bit more than merely watch the tent she noticed there was plain food and drink waiting for anyone who hadnt eaten at the fairethough those were few since it seemed a musician could usually coax at least a free meal out of a cooktent owner by playing at his site still there was fresh bread cheese and fresh raw vegetables waiting for any who needed it and plenty of cold clean water and when darkness fell it was gwyna and erdric who saw to it that the lanterns were lit that there was a fire burning outside the tent entrance and that torches were placed up the path leading to the free bard enclave to guide the wanderers home no matter how weary they might be talaysen had not returned with the rest he came in well after dark and threw himself down on the cushions next to rune with a sigh he looked very tired and just a trifle angry though she couldnt think why that would be erdric brought him wine without his asking for it and another dose of medicine for rune which she drank without thinking about it a long day master wren erdric asked sympathetically anything we can do very long talaysen replied long enough that i shall go and steal the use of the bath before anyone else returns and then apprentice he cocked an eyebrow at rune youll teach me in that ghost song he drained half the mug in a single gulp theres been a lot of rumor around the faire about the boyor girl the rumors differwho won the trials yesterday and yet has vanished quite out of ken no one is talking and no one is telling the truth his expression grew just a little angrier the guild judges presented the winners today and they had their exhibitionand they all looked so damned smug i wanted to break their instruments over their heads i intend the guild to know youre with us and if they touch you therell be equal retribution equal retribution rune asked swallowing a lump that had appeared in her throat when hed mentioned broken instruments when master wren came to us the guild didnt like it gwyna said bringing talaysen a slice of bread and cheese twas at this very faire that he first began to play with us in public he wasnt calling himself gwydain but the guildsmen knew him anyway they set on himthey didnt break his arm but they almost broke his head we gypsies went after every guild bard we caught alone the next day talaysen shook his head it was all i could do to keep them from setting on the guildsmen with knives instead of fists erdric laughed but it wasnt a laugh of humor if theyd hurt you more than bruises you wouldnt have they didnt dare walk the faire without a guardeven when they wandered about in twos and threes theyre so soft twas no great task to beat them all black and blue when we reckoned theyd gotten the point and when they started hiring great guards to go about with em we left them alone they havent touched one of us since any place therere are gypsies about but elsewhere rune winced as her head throbbed gypsies and free bards cant be everywhere quite true but i doubt thats occurred to them talaysen said at any ratehe flicked a drop of water at her from his mugthere youre rune no more rune is gone lark standsor rather sitsin her place the quarrel the bardic guild has is with rune and i dont know anyone by that name as you say master she replied mockmeekly he saw through the seeming and grinned im for a bath then the song ill see it sung all over the faire tomorrow and theyll know youre ours when you come out with the rest of us in a week or two theyll know better than to touch you come out in two weeks she exclaimed but my arm hasnt hurt your voice any talaysen replied you can come with me and sing the female parts teach me the rest of your songs and ill play while you sing he fixed her with a fierce glare youre a free bard arent you she nodded slowly then you stand up to the guild to the faire to everyone you stand up to them and you let them know that nothing keeps a free bard from her music he looked around at the rest of the free bards gathered in the tent so did rune and she saw every head nodding in agreement yes sir she replied with more bravery than she felt she was afraid of the guild of the bullies that the guild could hire of the connection the guild seemed to have with the church and the church was everywhere if the church took a mind to get involved no silly renaming would make her safe she hadnt been so shaken since westhaven when those boys had tried to rape her talaysen seemed to sense her fear he reached forward and took her good hand in his believe in us lady lark he said his voice trembling with intensity believe in usand believe in yourself together we can do anything so long as we believe it i know trust me she looked into his green eyes deep as the sea and as restless hiding as many things beneath their surface and revealing some of them to her there was passion there that he probably didnt display very often she found herself smiling tremulously and nodded because she couldnt speak he took that at face value released her hand and pulled himself up to his feet ill be back he said gravely but with a twinkle and the apprentice had better be ready to teach when i return he left the tent with a remarkably light step and her eyes followed him when she pulled her eyes back to the rest rune didnt miss the significant glance that erdric and gwyna exchanged but somehow she didnt resent it talaysen though might she remembered all the questions that sparrow had asked and the tone of them and decided to keep her observations to herself it was more than enough that the greatest living bard had taken her as his apprentice anything else would either happen or not happen a week later it was talaysens turn to mind the tent that duty shared by runes old friend raven raven had appeared the previous evening to be greeted by all of his kin with loud and enthusiastic cries and then underwent a series of kisses and backslapping greetings with each of the free bards then he was brought to runes corner of the tent she hadnt seen who had come in and had been dying of curiosity to see who it was raven was loudly pleased to see her dismayed to see the fading marks of her beating and angered by what had happened it was all talaysen and the others could do to keep him from charging out then and there and beating up a few of the guild bards in retaliation the judges in particular he had the same notion as talaysen to break their instruments over their heads they managed to calm him but after due thought he judged that it was best he not go playing in the streets for a while so he took his tentduty early he played mockcourt to rune who blushed to think that shed ever thought he might want to be her lover i didnt know anything then she realized as he bowed over her hand but kept a sharp watch for nightingale she knew that once nightingale appeared hed leave her side in a moment she was not his type not even in the gypsygarb shed taken to wearing finding skirts and loose blouses much more suited to handling onehanded than breeches and vests all of his gallantry was in fun and designed to keep her distracted and in good humor oddly enough talaysen seemed to take ravens mockcourtship seriously he watched them with a faint frown on his face most of the morning after lunch he took the younger man aside and had a long talk with him what they said rune had no idea until raven returned with a face full of suppressed merriment and his hands full of her lunch and her medicines ive never in all me life had quite such a notlecture he whispered to her when talaysen had gone to see about something he takes being your master right seriously young rune ive just been warned that if i intend to break your heart by flirting with you your master there will be most unamused he seems to think a broken heart would interfere more with your learning than yon broken arm in fact he offered to trade me a broken head for a broken heart rune didnt know whether to gape or giggle she finally did both talaysen found them both laughing as rune poked fun at ravens gallantry and raven pretended to be crushed talaysen immediately relaxed but then he shooed raven off and sat down beside her himself its time we had a real lesson he said if youre going to insist i act like a master ill give you a masters lessoning he then began a ruthless interrogation having rune go over every song shed ever written first he had her sing them until hed picked them up then hed critique them with more skilland which surprised her he criticized them much harder even than brother pell had of her comic songs he said its all very well to have a set of those for busking during the day either in cities or at faires but theres more to music than parody and you very well know it if youre going to be a bard you have to live up to the title you cant confine yourself to something as limited as one style you cant even be known for just one style you have to know all of them and people must be aware that youre versed in all of them of fiddler girl he approved of the tune except thatits too limited you need to expand your bridges into a whole new set of tunes make the listener feel what it was like to fiddle all night long with death waiting if you slipped in fact dont ever play it twice the same improvise match your fiddlemusic to the crowd play scraps of what you played then so that they recognize youre recreating the experience youre not just telling someone elses story and of the lyrics he was a little kinder but he felt that they were too difficult to sing for most people you and i and most of the free bards can manage themif were sober if we arent having a tonguetied daybut what about the poor busker in the street they look as if you just wrote them down with no notion of how hard theyd be to sing when she admitted that was exactly what shed done he shook his head at her at least recite them first nothings ever carved in stone rune be willing to change the rest of her serious songs he dismissed as being good for filling in between difficult numbers easy songs with ordinary lyrics those were the ones shed composed according to brother pells rules for his class and while it hurt a bit to have them dismissed as ordinary it didnt hurt as much as it might have shed chafed more than a bit at those rules to have the things shed done right out of her head given some praise and the ones shed done according to the rules called common wasnt so bad or at least it wasnt as bad as it could have been then he set her a task write him a song something about elves theyre always popular he said try somethingwhere a ruler makes a bargain with an elf then breaks it make the retribution something original no thunder and lightning being turned into a toad or dragged off to hell none of that nonsense its trite she nodded and set to it as soon as he left but she could see that he had not lied to her he was not going to be an easy master talaysen left his instruments in the tent and walked off into the faire with nothing about him to identify who or what he was he preferred to leave it that way given that he was going to visit the cathedraland that the bardic guild tent was pitched right up against the cathedral walls of course there was always the chance that one of his old colleagues would recognize him but now at night that chance was vanishingly slim they would all be entertaining the high and the wealthyeither their own masters or someone who had hired them for the night the few that werent would be huddled together in selfsatisfied smugnessthough perhaps that attitude might be marred a little since hed begun singing fiddler girl about the faire the real story of the contest was spreading through the medium of the free bards and the gypsies in another couple of weeks it should be safe enough for rune to show her face at this faire he was worried about his young charge though because she troubled him so he was going to talk with an old friend one who had known him for most of his life to see if she could help him to sort his thoughts out he skirted the bounds of the guild tent carefully even though a confrontation was unlikely his bones were much older than the last time hed been beaten and they didnt heal as quickly anymore but the tent was dark no one holding revels in there not at the moment just as well really he sought out a special gate in the cathedral wall and opened it with a key he took from his beltpouch locking the gate behind him again once hed entered the welloiled mechanism made hardly a sound but something alerted the guardian of that gate who came out of the building to see who had entered the little oddshaped courtyard id like to see lady ardis talaysen told the blackclad guard who nodded soberly but said nothing could you see if she is available to a visitor the guard turned and left still without a word talaysen waited patiently in the tiny courtyard thinking that a musician has many opportunities to learn patience in a lifetime it seems as if i am always waiting for something this was at least a pleasant place to wait unlike the courtyards of most church buildings this one though paved boasted greenery in the form of plants spilling from tiers of wooden boxes and trees growing from huge ceramic pots lanterns hanging from the wall of the cloister provided soft yellow light against the wall of the courtyard a tiny waterfall trickled down a set of stacked rocks providing a breath of moisture and the restful sounds of falling water at least it did when the faire wasnt camped on the other side of the wall music crowdnoise and laughter spilled over the walls ruffling the serenity of the place he caught movement out of the corner of his eye and turned a tall scarletclad woman whose closecropped blond hair held about the same amount of gray as his held out her hands to him gwydain she exclaimed i wondered when youd get around to visiting me he strode towards her and clasped both her hands in his i was busy and so were you my dear cousin i truly intended to pay my respects when the trials were over then my latest little songbird got herself into a brawl with the guild and i had to extract her from the mess my lack of foresight put her in her one winglike brow rose sharply and ardis showed her interest i heard something of that was she badly hurt bruised all over and a broken arm he began which is disaster for a musician she completed can you bring her here i can certainly treat her that is what you wanted isnt it well yes he admitted with a smile if that wont bring you any problems she sniffed disdainfully the church treats its justiciars well it treats its mages even better rank does bring privileges if i wish to treat a ragtag streetsingers broken arm no one will naysay me but there will be a price she continued taking her hand away from his and holding up a single finger in warning name it talaysen replied with relief with the magehealing lady ardis could work runes arm would be healed in half the time it would normally take well enough certainly to permit her to play by the end of the faire more importantly well enough so that when he and she went on the road together it wouldnt cause her problems you shouldnt be so quick to answer my demands the lady replied but with a serious look instead of the smile talaysen expected this could be dangerous so he shrugged i wont belittle your perception of danger and i wont pretend to be a hero but if id been afraid of a little danger i would still be with the guild so you would she studied his face for a moment theres a darkmage among the brotherhood and i dont know who it is i only know its a he since there are only two female mages and i know it isnt a justiciar talaysen whistled between his teeth in surprise and consternation thats not welcome news what is it you want me to do she freed her other hand and walked slowly over to one of the planters rubbing her wrists as she walked he followed and she turned abruptly it isnt quite true that i dont know who it is i have a guess and if my guess is correct hell take advantage of the general licentiousness of the faire to sate some of his desires what i want is for you to watch and wait and see if there are rumors of a priest gone bad one who uses methods outside the ordinary to enforce his will talaysen nodded slowly its true that a bard hears everything she laughed shortly and everyone tells a bard everything they know a free bard anyway if you hear anything bring it to me if you can somehow contrive to bring him before me in my official capacity that would be even better i can be certain that the other two justiciars with me would be mages and uncorrupted ill try he promised and gestured for her to seat herself she took the invitation and perched on a bench between two pots of fragrant honeysuckle so what else do you need of me cousin she asked a look of shrewd speculation creeping over her even features it has to do with this little songster doesnt it not so little he replied with a bit of embarrassment shes quite old enough to be wedded with children by country standards shes very attractive ardis and thats the problem i promised to give her a masters teaching to an apprentice and i find her very attractive so a lifted shoulder told him ardis didnt think that was much of a problem so thats not ethical dammit he snapped this girl is my student if i took advantage of that situation id bedishonorable and besides im twice her age easily ardis shook her head i cant advise you gwydain i agree with you that pushing yourself on the girl would not be ethical but what if shes attracted to you if shes as old as you say shes old enough to know her own mind its still not ethical he replied stubbornly and im still twice her age very well she sighed if it isnt ethical then be the same noble sufferer youve always been and keep your attraction hidden behind a mask of fatherly regard if you keep pushing her away likely shell grow tired of trying and take her affections elsewhere the young are very short of patience for the most part she stood and smoothed down the skirt of her robes with her hand the fact that youre twice her age doesnt signify you know very well i was betrothed to a man three times my age at twelve and if my father hadnt found it more convenient to send me to the church id likely be married to him now he tightened his jaw her light tone told him she was mocking him and that wasnt the answer hed wanted to hear either she wasnt providing him with an answer im not going to give you an answer gwydain she said echoing his very thought in that uncanny way she had im not going to give you an excuse to do something stupid again how someone as clever as you are can be so dense when it comes to matters of the heart she pursed her lips in exasperation never mind bring your little bird here tomorrow afternoon ill heal up her arm for you after that what you do with each other is up to you he bowed over her hand since the audience was obviously at an end and took a polite leave of her he sensed that she was amused with him and it rankledbut he also sensed that part of her tormenting him was on account of her little problem little he thought locking the gate behind him and setting off back through the faire a darkmage in the kingsford brotherhoodthats not such a little thing what is it about the church that it spawns both the saint and the devil then he shrugged it wasnt that the church spawned either it was that the church held both and permitted both to run free unless and until they were reined in by another hand to his mind the venial were the more numerous but then he had been a cynic for many years now one of his problems was solved at least rune would be cared for if one of the gypsies like nighthawk had been available hed have sent the girl to her rather than subject her to his cousin and her acidic wit but none of those with the healing touch had put in an appearance yet and he dared not wait much longer he had hoped that ardis would confirm his own assertions that the child was much too young and that he had no business being attracted to her instead shed implied that he was being oversensitive still one of the things shed said had merit if he continued acting in a fatherly manner she would never guess how he felt and in the way of the young would turn to someone more suitable young heron for instance or swift he clamped a firm lid down on the uneasy feelings ofwas it jealousythat thought caused better much better to suffer a little and save both of them no end of grief yes he told himself with determination as he wound through the press of people around a dancers tent much much better rune hardly knew what to say when talaysen ordered her to her feet the next afternoonshe had been feeling rather sick and had a pounding head and she suspected it was from too much of the medicine shed been taking but if she didnt take it she was still sick with pain her head still ached and so did her arm she simply couldnt win master wren she pleaded when he held out his hand to help her to her feet i really dont feel welli thats precisely why i want you to come with me he replied with a brisk nod i want someone else to have a look at your arm and head come along now it isnt far she gave in with a sigh she was not up to the heat and the jostling crowds even if most of the fairgoers would be at the trialsconcert this afternoon but talaysen looked determined and she had the sinking feeling that even if she protested that she couldnt walk hed conjure a dog cart or something to carry her she got clumsily to her feet and followed him out of the tent and down to the faire the sun beat down on her head like a hammer on an anvil making her eyes water and her ears ring she was paying so much attention to where she was putting her feet that she had no idea where he was leading her no idea until he stopped and she looked up to find herself pinned between the guild tent and the wall of the kingsford cathedral cloister she froze in terror as he unlocked the door in the wall there she would have bolted if he hadnt reached for her good hand and drawn her inside before she could do anything her heart pounded with panic and she looked around at the potted greenery expecting it to sprout guards at any moment this was it the church had found her out and they were going were not going to do anything to you child said a scarletrobed woman who stepped out from behind a trellis laden with rosevines she had a cap of pale blond hair cut like any priests candid gray eyes and a pointed face that reminded her sharply of someone then talaysen turned around and the familial resemblance was obvious she relaxed a little not much but a little rune this is my cousin ardis ardis this is the young lady who was too talented for her own good talaysen smiled and rune relaxed a little more ardis tilted her head to one side and her pale lips stretched in an amused smile so i see well come here rune i dont biteor rather i dont bite people who dont deserve to be bitten rune ventured nearer and ardis waved at her to take a seat on a bench the priestfor so she must be although rune had never seen a scarletrobed priest beforeseated herself on the same bench as talaysen stood beside them both she glanced at him anxiously and he gave her a wink of encouragement i might as well be brief ardis said after a moment of studying runes face i suppose youve heard rumors of priests who also practice magic on behalf of the church she nodded reluctantly unsure what this had to do with her the rumors are true child ardis said watching her face closely im one of them runes initial reaction was alarmbut simple logic calmed her before she did anything stupid she trusted talaysen he trusted his cousin there must be a reason for this revelation she waited for ardis to reveal it i have healingspells the priest continued calmly and my cousin asked me to exercise one of them on your behalf i agreed but i cannot place the spell upon you without your consent it wouldnt be ethical she smiled at talaysen as she said that a smile with just a hint of a sting in it he chuckled and shook his head but said nothing will it hurt rune asked the only thing she could think of to ask a little ardis admitted but after a moment or two youll begin feeling much better finei mean please id like you to do it then rune stammered a little confused by the priests clear direct gaze she sensed it would be difficult if not impossible to hide anything from this woman it cant hurt much worse than my head does right now the priests eyes widened for a moment and she glanced up at talaysen belladonna she asked sharply he nodded then its just as well you brought her here today its not good to take that for more than three days running i didnt take any today rune said plaintively i woke up with a horrid headache and sick and it felt as if the medicine had something to do with the way i felt the priest nodded wise child wiser than some who are your elders now hold still for a moment think of a cloudless sky and try not to move obediently rune did as she was told closing her eyes to concentrate better she felt the priest lay her hand gently on the broken arm then there was a sudden sharp pain exactly like the moment when erdric straightened the break she bit back a crythen slumped with relief for the pain in both her head and her arm were gone nonot gone after all but dulled to distant ghosts of what they had been and best of all she was no longer nauseous she sighed in gratitude and opened her eyes smiling into ardis intent face you fixed it she said it hardly hurts at all its wonderful how can i ever thank you ardis smiled lazily and flexed her fingers my cousin has thanked me adequately already child think of it as the churchs way of repairing the damage the bardic guild did but rune protested ardis waved her to silence it was no trouble dear the priest said rising the bonehealing spells are something i rarely get to use im grateful for the practice you can take the splint off in about four weeks that should give things sufficient time to mend she gave talaysen a significant look of some kind one that rune couldnt read he flushed just a little though as she bade him a decorous enough farewell and he turned to lead rune out the tiny gate he seemed a little illatease though she couldnt imagine why to fill the silence between them she asked the first thing that came into her head do all priestmages wear red robes she said id never seen that color before on a priest he turned to her gratefully and smiled no actually theres no one color for the mages you can find them among any of the church brotherhoods red is the justiciars colorthere do seem to be more mages among the justiciars than any other brotherhood but that is probably coincidence he continued on about the various brotherhoods in the church but she wasnt really listening she had just realized as she looked at him out of the corner of her eye what an extraordinarily handsome man he was she hadnt thought of that until shed seen his cousin and noticed how striking she was how odd that she hadnt noticed it before possibly because he was acting as if he was my father well never mind there was time enough to sort out how things were going to be between them maybe he was just acting oddly because of all the people around him as the founder of the free bards he must feel as if there were eyes on him all the timeand rightly given sparrows chattering questions the other day but once the faire was over and the free bards dispersed there would be no one watching them to see what they did then maybe he would relax and once he did well her lips curved in a smile that was totally unconscious and talaysen chattered on oblivious to her thoughts chapter fifteen rune caught a hint of movement in the crowd out of the corner of her eye she kept singing but she thought she recognized the bright red skirt and bodice and the lowcut blouse the color of autumn leaves a second glance told her she was right it was gwyna all right and dressed to be as troublesome as she could to male urges and church sensibilities tiny as she was she had to elbow her way to the front of the crowd so rune could see her and by the look in her eyes she knew she was causing mischief her abundant black hair was held out of her eyes by a scarf of scarlet tied as a headband over her forehead beneath it huge brown eyes glinted with laughter there was no law against showingand none against lookingand she always dressed to catch the maximum number of masculine attentions she garnered a goodly share of appreciative glances as she sauntered among the fairgoers from men both high and lowly born she preened beneath the admiration like the bright bird she so strongly resembled rune and talaysen were singing fiddler girl though without the fiddle runes arm was only just out of its sling and she wasnt doing anything terribly difficult with it yet instead she was singing her own part and talaysen was singing the ghost and making it fair bloodchilling too even gwyna shivered visibly listening to them and shed heard it so many times she probably could reproduce every note of it herself in both their styles they finished to a deafening round of applause and copper and silver showered into the hat set in front of them as gwyna wormed her way to the center of the crowd rune caught sight of another of the brotherhood just coming along the streetdaran called heron tall gangling and bony he was easy to spot as he towered a good head above the rest of the crowd he looked nothing like a musician but he was second only to talaysen in the mastery of guitar and that daftlooking vacuous face with empty blue eyes hid one of the cleverest satiric minds in their company his voice was a surprising tenor silver to talaysens gold and no sooner had rune spotted him than she recalled a bit of wickedness the four of them had devised when she had first joined them out on the streets of the faire and her broken arm had prevented her from playing she whistled a snatch of the songmy lovers eyes it was and as sickening and stickysweet a piece of doggerel as ever a guild bard could produce she saw talaysens head snap up at the notes saw his green eyes sparkle with merriment he nodded a grin wrapping itself around his head then nodded at gwyna to come join them daran had caught the whistle toohe craned his absurdly long neck all about blond forelock flopping into his eyes as usual then sighted her and whistled back that was all it took while the crowd was still making up its collective mind about moving on gwyna and daran edged in to take their places beside talaysen and rune and the song was begun they sang it acappella but all four of them had voices more than strong enough to carry over the crowd noise and the harmony they formedthough they hadnt sung it since the fourth week of the fairewas sweet and pure and recaptured the fickle crowds attention the first verse of the ditty extolled the virtues of the singers beloved and the faithfulness of the singerlovergwyna held darans hands clasped chinhigh and stared passionately into his eyes as rune and talaysen echoed their pose so far a normal sort of presentation if more than a bit melodramatic ahbut the second verse was coming and after all those promises of eternal fidelity the partners suddenly dropped the hands they held and caught those of a new partner and without missing a beat sang the second verse just as passionately to a new beloved chuckles threaded the crowd the audience waited expectantly for the next verse to see what the bards would do they lowered their clasped hands turning their heads away from their partners as if in an agony of moonstruck shyness at the end of the third verse they dropped hands again rolled their eyes heavenward as each lifted right hand to brow and the left to bosom changed pose again still without looking and groped once again for the hands of the beloved except that this time talaysen got darans hands and gwyna got runes the crowds chuckles turned into an appreciative roar of laughter when they turned their heads back to discover just whose hands they were clutching and jumped back pulling away as if theyd been burned the laughter all but drowned out the last notes of the song sung to the eyes of their original partners as more coinage showered into the hat one among the crowd turned away with a smothered oath and a look of hatred he wore the purple and gold ribbons of a guild bard well here my children talaysen bent to catch up the laden hat share and share alike feed your bodies that your voices not suffer buy fairings to call the eyes of an audience or other things he poured a generous measure of the coinage into each of their hands now off with you well meet as usual just at sundown at the tent for dinner gwyna slipped the money into her beltpouch and dropped talaysen a mockcurtsy as you say master mine elsewhere treeman master heron im minded to sing solos for a bit daran grinned and took himself off as ordered rune noticed that his eyes had been following gwyna for some time and she reflected that he would be no bad company for the cheerful gypsy gwyna had confided a great deal to rune over the past few weeks theyd become very good friends gwyna had said that she tended to take up with either bards or gypsies but that she hadnt had a lover from amongst the free bards in four years maybe she was thinking about it now as gwyna strolled away it seemed her thoughts were tending in that direction for she pulled her guitar around in front of her and began a love song rune exchanged a glance full of irony with talaysen and they began her elfballad gwyna didnt mind too carefully where she was wandering until she noted that her steps had taken her away from the welltraveled ways and into the rows reserved for the finer goods here she was distinctly out of place and besides there were fewer fairgoers and less of a chance for an audience she turned to retrace her steps only to find her path blocked he who blocked it was a darkly handsome man as looks are commonly judgedbut his gray eyes had a cruel glint to them that gwyna did not in the least like the smile on his thin hard lips was a prurient one and he wore the robes of a church priest but they were winedark and she thought she could see odd symbols woven into the hem of the robe symbols which she found even less to her liking than the glint in his eyes your pardon mlord she made as if to step around him but he moved like quicksilver getting in front of her again stay bright songbird he spoke softly his voice pitched soft and low so as to sound enticing a word in your ear if i may i cannot prevent you mlord gwyna replied becoming more uneasy by the heartbeat you have no patron else you would not be singing to the crowdand i think you have at present nofriendeither his knowing look gave another meaning entirely to the word friend a prurient lascivious meaning i offer myself in both capacities i think we understand each other although gwyna was long past innocence the blood rose to her cheeks in response to his words and the evil lascivious leer that lay thinly veiled behind them just listening to him made her feel used and that made her angry as well as a little frightened that i think we do not my lord she retorted putting a good sharp sting in her reply firstly you are a priest of the church and sworn to celibacy if you will take no care for your vows then i will secondly i am a free bard and i earn my way by songnaught else i go where i will i earn my way by music and i do not sell myself to such as you for your caging so you may take your patronage and offer it among the dealers in swine and sheepfor im sure that there youll find bedmates to your liking in plenty she pushed rudely past him her flesh shrinking from the touch of his robes and stalked off with her head held high and proud she prayed that he could not tell by her carriage how much she longed to take to her heels and run she prayed that he wouldnt follow her it seemed her prayers were answered for she lost sight of him immediately and as soon as he was out of sight she forgot him the priest clenched his jaw in rage and his saturnine face contorted with anger for one brief instant before settling into a mask of indifference it was only a moment but it was long enough for one other to see a plump balding man oily with good living and wearing the gold and purple ribbons of a guild bard stepped out from the shelter of a nearby awning and approached the darkrobed cleric if you will forgive my impertinence my lord he began i cannot help but think we have an interest in common so i told him to look for bedmates among the flocks gwyna finished while daran and rune chuckled appreciatively she took a hearty bite of her bread and cheeseno one among the brotherhood had had extraordinary good luck so the fare was plain tonightand grinned back at them neither erdric nor talaysen looked at all amused howevererdric was as sober as a stone and talaysens green eyes were darkened with worry that may not have been wise gypsy robin he said sipping his wellwatered wine it isnt wise to anger a priest and i would guess from your description that he is not among the lesser of his brethren granted if you called him up before the justices this week and you had witnesses you could prove he meant to violate his vowsbut even so he is still powerful and that is the worst sort of enemy to have made so long as i stay within the faire precincts what can he do gwyna countered nettled at talaysens implied criticism of her behavior i do have witnesses if i care to call them and if he dares to lay a hand on me her feral grin and a hand to the knife concealed in her skirts told the fate he could expect gwyna needed no man to guard her honorsuch as it was all right robin i am rebuked no one puts a tie on you least of all me where away tonight a partya most decorous party virtue i tell you will be my watchword this eve i am pledged to play and sing for the nameday feast of the daughter of the jewelsmith marek she being a ripe twelve on this night i am to sing nothing but the most innocent of songs and tales and the festivities will be over before midnight i will be there and back again in my bed before the night is half spent she drooped her eyelids significantly at daran who looked first surprised then pleased talaysen bit his lip to keep from chuckling he knew that tacit invitation gwyna would not be spending the last nights of the faire alone then may the lady see to it that the jewelsmith marek rewards you and your songs with their true value as for the rest of usthe faire awaits and we grow no richer dallying here they finished the last bites of their dinners and rose from their cushions nearly as one each to seek an audience gwynas pouch was the heavier by three pieces of gold and she was wearing it inside her skirts for safety as she made her way down the aisle of closed and darkened stalls one gold piece would go to erdric with instructions to purchase a roast pig and wine for the company and keep the remainder for himself the other two would go to goldsmith nosta in the morning to be put with her other savings gwyna firmly believed in securing high ground against rainy days with her mind on these matters she did not see the dark shadow that followed her mingling with the other shadows cast by the moon her sharp ears might have warned her of danger but there were no footfalls for her to hear there was only a sudden wind of ice and fear that blew upon her from behind and hard upon that the darkness of oblivion she woke with an aching head her vision blurred and oddly distorted her sense of smell gone to find herself looking out through the bars of a black iron cage she scrambled to her feet with a frightened squawk and a flurry of wings shaking so hard with a sudden onset of terror that every feather trembled feathers wings a duncolored hanging in front of her moved from behind it emerged the dark bearded priest she had so foolishly insulted beside him was a fat little man in guild purple and gold she had heard of priests who practiced magic now she knew the rumors to be true and the foolish little bird takes the baited grain not so clever now are we the guild bard chortled mareks invitation was his own but two of those gold pieces you so greedily bore away were mine with mlord revaners spell upon them is the vengeance sweet enough bestif the priests deep voice was full of amusement it will be in a moment mlord bestif bent down so that his face filled gwynas field of vision she shrunk back away from him until the bars of the cage prevented her going farther you my fine feathered friend are now truly feathered indeed and you will remain so look at yourself birdbrained you were to make a mock of my masterpiece and bird you have truly become the property of mlord to sing at his will you would not serve him freely so now you shall find yourself serving from within one of those cages you have so despised and whether you will or no and do not think little songbird that you may ever fly away the priest continued his eyes shining with cheerful sadism magic must obey laws you wear the semblance of a bird but your weight is that of the woman you were as is your approximate size your wings could never carry you to freedom attractive though they may be gwyna stretched out one armno winginvoluntarily her head swiveled on a long neck to regard it with mournful eyes indeed it was quite brilliantly beautiful and if the rest of her matched the graceful plumage she must be the most striking and exotic bird ever seen the colors of her garb the golds and reds and warm oranges were faithfully preserved in her featherstransformed from clothing to plumes she supposed despairingly circling one leg was a heavy gold ringwhich could only be the gold pieces that had been the instrument of her downfall cunningly transmuted black bleak despair filled her heart for how ever would any of her friends guess what had become of her had she been woman still she would have sunk to the floor of her cage and wept in hopelessness here the most cruel jest of all was played on her her neck stretched out her beak opened involuntarily and glorious liquid song poured forth her amazement broke the despair for a moment and the music ceased to come from her the priest read her surprise correctly and smiled a predatory smile did we not say you would serve me whether you would or no i was not minded to have a captive that drooped all day on her perch no the spell binding you is thus the unhappier you are the more you will sing well bard are you satisfied very my lord very the priest clapped his hands summoning two hulking attendants in black uniform tunics these hoisted her cage upon their shoulders and carried her outside the tent where the cage was fastened to a chain and hoisted to the top of a stout iron pole now all the faire shall admire my treasure and envy my possessing it the priest taunted her from below while you shall look upon the freedom of your former friendsand sing for my pleasure as dawn began to color the tips of the tents and roofs of the faire gwyna beat with utter futility on the bars of her cage with her wings while glorious music fell on the tents below her in the place of her tears by midmorning there was a crowd of curiosityseekers below her cage and gwyna had ceased her useless attempts at escape now she simply sat eyes halfclosed in despair and sang she had learned that while she could not halt the flow of music from her beak she could direct it to the wonderment of the onlookers she was singing every lament and dirge she could remember once she saw daran below her and her voice shook with hopelessness she was singing talaysens walls of iron at the time it seemed appropriate daran stared at her intently as she sang it with the special interludes she had always played on her guitar she longed to be able to speak even to throw a fit of some kind to attract his attention but the spell holding her would not allow that she thought her heart would break into seven pieces when he walked away at the end of the song the priest had her cage brought down at sunset and installed on a special stand in his tent she was scrupulously fed the freshest of fruit and the water in her little cup was renewed despite the warnings that she could not fly away she watched avidly for an opportunity to escape but the cage was cleaned and the provisioning made without the door ever being opened revaner evidently had planned a dinner party he greeted visitors placing them at a table well within clear sight of her cage when all were assembled he lit branching candles with a wave of his hand the golden light falling clearly upon her the guests sighed in wonderher spirits sank to their lowest ebbshe opened her beak and sang and her music was at its most lovely the celebrants congratulated the priest on his latest acquisition he preened visibly casting a malicious glance from time to time back at the cage where gwyna drooped on her perch it was unbearable yet she had no choice but to bear it torture of the body would have been far far preferable to this utter misery of the spirit at last the long bitter day was over a cover was placed over her cage in the darkness birdinstincts took over entirely and despite sorrow and despair gwyna slept talaysen questioned everyone who knew the free bards and especially those who knew gwyna herself always the answer was no no one had seen her since the previous day the last to see her was marek and she had left his tent well within the time she had promised to return it was bad enough that she had not appeared last night but as the day wore on it became more and more obvious that she wasnt just dallying with a new chancemet lover she was missing and since it was robin who truly could defend herself that could only mean foul play as talaysen searched the faire for some sign of her he could only think about the incident she had reported the previous evening the priest who had approached herhe wasnt one that talaysen knew which meant he wasnt one of the priests attached to kingsford he ran a hand through his hair distractedly and another thought occurred to himone which he did not in the least like ardis had asked him to be on the watch for a priest who might violate his vows to please his own desiresa priest who would use extraordinary means to get what he wanted could this priest and the one that threatened gwyna be the same given that she had quite vanished from the faire it was not only possible it seemed likely ardis had said that she didnt know the exact identity of this priest which meant he wasnt one she ordinarily worked with as a mage so he would be new to kingsford and probably camped in the priests tents with the other visiting clerics if he had gwyna in any form of captivity he would keep her there he wouldnt dare bring her into the cloisters not with ardis on the watch for him talaysen made up his mind called his free bards together and passed the word look for anything that reminds you of gwyna anything at all and look for it especially among the priests tents the next day was like the first save only that she was left outside the tent when the sun set evidently since he had no reason to display her the priest saw no reason to bring her inside or perhaps this was but another sadism on his partfor now she was witness to the faires night life with its emphasis on entertainments the cage was lowered cleaned and stocked then raised again gwyna watched the lights of the faire appear watched the strollers wander freely about and sang until she was too weary to chirp another note she was far too worn to notice that someone had come to stand in the shadows below her until the sound of a whisper carried up to her perch gwyna bird are you gwyna she fluttered her wings in agitation unable to answer except for strangled squawks a second voice whispered to the first daran this seems very farfetched to me rune i tell you its gwyna nobody performs walls of iron the way she doesbut this bird replicated every damn note gwyna answer me as a cloud of helplessness descended on her and her beak began to open to pour forth melody she suddenly shook as an idea occurred to her no she couldnt talk but she could most assuredly sing she sang the chorus of elven captive a spellbound captive here am i who will not live and cannot die a bittenoff exclamation greeted the song rune gasped wait thats daran interrupted her elven captive no bird would pick that chorus just at this moment it is gwyna gypsy robin who did this to you for answer gwyna sang the first notes of my lovers eyes and the chorus of the scurvy priest a little ditty that was rarely if ever heard in faires but often in taverns of a particular clientele bestif and a priest probably the one she told us about oh hellfire this is too deep for us to handle daran mumbled in a discouraged voice dont ever underestimate talaysen cloudscraper rune sounded a bit more hopeful hes got resources you wouldnt guessgwyna dont give up were going to leave you but only to let talaysen know whats happened well be back and with help well get you back to us somehow i swear it there was a brief pattering of footsteps and the space below her was empty again but the hope in her heart was company enough that night when dawn came she looked long and hopefully for a sight of her friends among the swirling crowds but there was no sign of them as the day wore on she lost hope again and her songs rang out to the satisfaction of the priest when no one had appeared by sunset the last of her hopes died talaysen must have decided that the idea of her transformation was too preposterous to consideror that they simply were powerless to help her she was so sunk in sadness that she did not notice the troupe of acrobats slowly making their way towards the priests duncolored tent tumbling and performing tricks as they came she only heard their noise and outcries when they actually formed up in the cleared space just in front of the tent and beneath her cage much to the displeasure of the priests chief servant they began their routine right there with a series of tumbles that ended with the formation of a human pyramid ho therebe off with youaway the majordomo was one to their many and they simply ignored him continuing with their act much to the delight of the children that had followed them here the pyramid collapsed into halfadozen somersaulting bodies and the air and ground seemed full lithe laughing human balls the majordomo flapped his hands at them ineffectually as gwyna watched her unhappiness momentarily forgotten in the pleasure of seeing one of her captors discomfited this continued for several moments until at last the priest himself emerged to demand why his rest was being disturbed now cried a cloaked nonentity at the edge of the crowdand gwyna recognized talaysens voice with a start everything seemed to happen at oncetwo of the acrobats flung a blanket over the priests head enveloping him in its folds and effectively smothering his outcries the rest jumped upon each others shoulders forming a tower of three men and a boy the boy produced a lockpick and swiftly popped open the lock on gwynas cage the door swung wide jump gwyna talaysen and daran held a second blanket stretched taut between them she didnt pause to think but obeyed the ground rushed at her as she instinctively spread her wings in a futile hope of slowing her fall somewhat she landed in the blanket with one of her legs halfbent beneath herit was painful but it didnt hurt badly enough to have been broken before she could draw breath daran had scooped her up from the pocket of the blanket and bundled her under one arm like an oversized chicken likely he was the only one of them big enough to carry her so with talaysen leading and the acrobats confusing the pursuit behind them he set off at as hard a run as he could manage with the burden of gwyna to carry gwyna craned her neck around in time to see the priest free himself from the confines of the blanket his face black with ragethen they were out of sight around a corner of one of the stalls they were hidden in the warm nearstifling darkness of the back of a weavers tent in among bales of her work gwyna could hear daran panting beside her and clamped her bill tight on the first notes of a song her heart high during the rescue had fallen again she was free yes but no nearer to being herself again than she had been in the cage there was a swish of material rune flung herself down beside them breathing so hard she could hardly speak taltalaysens gone to the cathedral to the courts and the justiciars looking to the church for help daran whispered incredulously i thought the wren cleverer than that why all that bastard has to do is get there before him lay a charge and flaunt his robes there are priests and priests heron rune replied invisible in the stuffy darkness and let me tell you the masters no fool i thought the same as you but he says he knows someone among the justiciars today and i think i know who it is he knows who we can trust he says to make a break and run as soon as we think it safeim to get someone with the gypsies youre for the cathedral and the court of justice the tumblers will do their best to scramble things again all right daran said doubtfully the wrens never been wrong before butlady bless i hope he isnt now all of them burst from the tent into the blinding sunlightand behind them rose a clamor and noise gwyna looked back to see the priest how had he contrived to be so close to their hiding place in hot pursuit followed by all of his servants and two of his helmeted and armed guards if those caught them before they reached the goal talaysen had in mind for them they burst into the justice court of the cathedral itself revaner and his contingent hard on their heels talaysen was there already gesturing to a robed man and woman and a younger man clad in the red robes of church justiciars my lordsmy lady he cried waving at daran and gwyna here is the one of whom i told you justice thundered revaner at the same time these thieves have stolen my petwrecked my tent one of the guards seized darans arms he responded by dropping gwyna she squawked in surprise at being dropped then fled to the dubious safety of the feet of the three strangers before revaner could grab more than one of her tailfeathers the lady reached down and petted gwyna comfort and reassurance passed from priest to bird with her caress gwyna suddenly had far more confidence in talaysens schemethis priest was no ordinary goldgrasping charlatan but one with real power and a generous spirit the other two waited patiently for the clamor to die down to silence quite plainly ready to wait all day if that was what it took at length even the yipping servants of the priest ceased their noise you claim bard talaysen that this bird is in fact one of your company ensorceled into this shape said the grayhaired man in priest robes yet what proof have you that this is so mindtouch her lady ardisor have lord arran do so talaysen replied steadily trust your own senses the man in red approached slowly his hand held out as if to a shy animal gwyna needed no such reassurance she ran limpingly to the young mans feet chirping and squawking she strove with all her might to project her human thoughts into the hirelings mind spreading out the whole story as best she could arran patted her feathers into smoothness and from his touch came reassurance and comfort more words formed in gwynas mind words as clear as speech fear not little singer there is no doubt in my heart that you are wholly human the young man rose gracefully to his feet and faced the two mages this one is bespelled indeed she is the free bard gwynamore than that the evil being that has so enslaved her is that onehe pointed an accusing finger at revanerhe who claims her as his property and pet his accomplice in this evil was the guild bard bestif at that the priest paled and tried to flee only to be held by the guards he had brought with him at the same time gwyna felt the ladypriests hand on her head and some instinct told her to remain utterly still she saw talaysen take runes hand his face harden with anxiety daran clutched his bony hands together biting his lip we shall need your help the ladypriest said to talaysen and rune i think you have some small acquaintance with magic yourselves and you know her she saw rune start with surprise saw talaysen nod then all was confusion the courtyard spun around in front of gwynas eyes moving faster and faster until it was nothing but a blur of light and shadow the courtyard vanished altogether then light blazed up nearly blinding her and a dark something separated from her own substance pulling away from her with a reluctant shudder she could feel it wanting to stay clinging with an avid hunger but the light drove it forth despite its will suddenly she was overcome with an appalling pain and crumbled beneath the onslaught of it her flesh felt as if it were melting twisting reshaping and it hurt so much she cried out in sheer misery a cry that began as a birds call and ended as the anguished sob of a human in mortal agony the pain cut off abruptly gwyna blinked finding herself slumped on the stone of the courtyard her skirts in a puddle of red gold and scarlet about her her dark hair falling into her eyes and three gold coins on the stone before her she stared at one hand then at the otherthen at the faces of the three who stood above her the ladypriest talaysen and rune their brown green and hazel eyes mirrored her own relief and joy from the other side of the courtyard came an uncanny shrieksomething like a ravens cry something like the scream of a hawk all four turned as one to see what had made the sound crouching where the dark priest had stood was an ugly evillooking bird like none gwyna had ever seen before its plumage was a filthy black its head and crooked neck naked red skin like a vulture it had a twisted yellow beak and small black eyes it stood nearly waisthigh to the two guards beside it as they watched it made a swipe at one of them with that sharp beak but the man was not nearly so alesotted as he seemed and caught the thing by the neck just behind the head evil spells broken often return upon their caster said young arran soberly as this one has balance is restored let him be exhibited at the gate as a warning to those who would pollute the holy church with unclean magic but tend him carefully and gently it may be that one day god will warm to forgiveness if he learns to repent as for the guild bard bestif let him be fined twelve gold pieces and banned forever from the faire let one half of that fine be given to the minstrels he wronged and one half to those in need that would be my judgment so be it so let it be done said the older man silent until now they made as if to leave gwyna scrambled to her feet holding out one of the three gold coins my lordsladythis for my thanks an you will the older priest took it gravely we are true priests of the church we do not accept pay for the performance of our dutybut if you wish this to be given to the offerings for the poor gwyna nodded he accepted the coin and the three vanished into the depths of the cathedral gwyna took the others and tossed them to talaysen who caught them handily for celebration he asked holding it up shall we feast tonight have i not cause to celebrate only one thing name it gypsy robin if you love me master wrenbuy nothing that once wore feathers chapter sixteen rune shooed talaysen away so that she could apportion their belongings into packs this is apprenticework she told him sternly you go do what a master does grinning he left her to it she had acquired a bit more clothing here at the faire but her load was still much lighter than his and she elected to take their common stores of food along with her own things the tent was still full of people or seemed to be anyway it was much smaller when all of them were packing up with gear spread all over and there was much complaining about how it had all magically multiplied during the sojourn at the faire rune hadnt had that much to start with and talaysen did not carry one item more than he needed but some of the others were not so wise when one stayed in one place for any length of time rune suspected it was easy to forget how much one could carry there had been this same moaning and groaning for the past two days as the free bards departed in groups by morning and afternoon the only folk not involved in the throes of packing were erdric and his grandson they lived here in kingsford the year round erdric had a permanent place in the kings blade tavern and young sparrow was learning the trade at the hands of his grandfather they would see to it that the two men the free bards had hired to take down the great tent would do so without damaging it and haul it off in their cart to the merchant it was kept with the rest of the year more than threefourths of the free bards had already gone their way by this morning talaysen would be the last to depart so that no one lacked for a personal goodbye from their leader that meant he and rune wouldnt be able to cover a great deal of ground their first day but rune didnt much mind shed gotten a great deal to think about over the past several weeks and most of it was unexpected the free bards for instancecontrasted with the guild bards talaysens group was a great deal more in the way of what she had thought the guild bards would be like the free bards took care of each other she had seen with her own eyes right here at the faire how the guild bards squabbled and fought among themselves for the plum jobs and if someone were unfortunate to lose one of those jobs due to accident illness or the like well his fellow guild members would commiserate in public but rejoice in private and all scramble for the choice tidbit like so many quarreling dogs under the table and the churchthere had been a set of shocks though shed been prepared for some of them from the rumors shed heard that though it officially frowned upon magic it held a cadre of mageswell shed learned that was true enough though lady ardis had warned her not to confirm the rumor to anyone and though there were plenty of venial priests there were some like lady ardis who would aid anyone who needed it and valued honor and ethics above gold then there was talaysenan enigma if ever she saw one a guild bard once he could still claim his place any time he wanted toand he refused even though that refusal cost him in patronage and wealth she wasnt certain how he felt about her he didnt treat her as a child though she was his apprentice he watched her constantly when he thought she wasnt looking and the eyes he followed her with were the eyes of a starving man but when he spoke with her or taught her he had another look entirely he teased her as if he was her elder brother and he never once gave a hint that his feelings ran any deeper than that yet whenever someone else seemed to be playing the gallant with her hed find himself watched so closely that he would invariably give up the game as not worth it after all no one wanted to invoke talaysens displeasure and no one wants to interfere with anyone that master wren is finally taking an interest in she thought with heavy irony the only problem is the master doesnt seem to know hes taken that interest gwyna had at least told her that talaysen had remained virtually celibate for the last several years though no one knew why there didnt seem to be any great lost loves in his life although lady ardis had hinted that he might at least have had a dalliance that could have become a love if he had pursued it for some reason he hadnt well if theres no lost loves theres no ghosts for me to fight ive got that much in my favor rune had decided in the last week of the faire how she felt about master wren and there was nothing celibate about what she wanted she had never in all her life met with a man who so exactly suited her in every way of course shed never seen him out of companyout on the road he might turn surly hard to get along with but she didnt think so he had a great deal to teach and she to learn but in performance at least they were absolute partners each making up for the others weaknesses she had every reason to think that the partnership would continue when they were on their own now if i can just warm it up to something more than partnership she finished the packs talaysen was making farewells and giving some lastminute directions so she had elected to pack up and not because she was the apprentice and he expected itwhich he didnt it was because he was doing what his duties required and she had free hands the accord had been reached without either of them saying a word she set the packs aside and waited for him to return out beyond the faire palings the merchants were also breaking down and preparing to leave the midsummer faire was over for another year she was surprised to feel an odd sense of loss of uncertainty for the past three weeks at least ever since her splint had come off she had known what every day would bring now it was completely new she hadnt ever really traveled the roads for a living and the idea was a little daunting finally as the sun crossed the zenithline he returned well are we ready he asked she nodded packed and provisioned master wren she hefted her pack up and slung it over her back her fiddle was safe inside and her harp and lute were fastened securely on the outside she wished briefly that talaysen had a horse or even a little donkey they could use to carry their supplies with a beast their pace could be much faster though it would be an added expense while youre wishing rune why dont you wish for a pair of riding horses while youre at it still a donkey could eat almost anything it wouldnt be that much of a burden unless they stayed in a town and a donkey makes you look more prosperous and makes you a target for robbers talaysen blinked in surprise and hefted his own pack onto his back i hadnt expected you to be ready quite so soon he said mildly i took you for townbred and not used to the road life she shrugged i walked from westhaven to nolton from nolton to here i learned a bit so i see he shifted the pack into a comfortable position on his back well if youre ready so am i so it was that simple after all they simply left the tent with a farewell wave to erdric as he gave the two hired men their instructions and took their place in the steady stream of people leaving by the road to the north talaysen seemed disinclined to talk so she held her peace as they walked at a good pace along the verge the press of people leaving was not as heavy as the one of those arriving had been and most of them were driving heavily loaded wagons not walking their pace was set by the pace of whoever was in the lead of this particular group of travelers the other folk on foot at least those that rune saw were limited to some small peddlers who had probably been vending impulsegoods from trays and nondescript folk who could have been anything the former toiled under packs that would have made a donkey blanch the latter beneath burdens like their own the pace that talaysen set had them passing most other foottravelers and all the carts the sun beat down on all of them regardless of rank or station and while there were frequent smiles and nods from those they passed no one seemed inclined to talk halfway into the afternoon though they took the first turning to the right a track so overgrown that she would never have picked it herself it seemed no one else had chosen it either at least not today and no one followed them for as long as she could see the main road when she glanced behind them she cast him a doubtful look that he never noticed and followed along a step or two behind him keeping a sharp watch for trouble weeds grew anklehigh even in the ruts on the road itself and were waisthigh on the verge once under the shelter of overhanging trees she was forced to revise her guess of how long it had been since the road had been used by other than foot traffic from the look of the roador rather pathno one else had come this way since the beginning of the faire at very best unless they were foottravelers like themselves the weeds were not broken down the way they would be if cart wheels had rolled over them she was admittedly no tracker but it didnt seem to her that the weeds had been taken down by anything other than the passing of animals in days trouble on a deserted way like this could come in several forms least likely was in the form of humans robbers who hunted up and down a seldomtraveled track precisely because they were unlikely to be caught on it and those they robbed were unlikely to be missed wild animals or farm animals run feral could give a traveler a bad time particularly wild cattle and feral pigs she didnt think that the larger predators would range this close to the faire site and kingsford but that was a possibility that shouldnt be dismissed out of hand there had once been a wild lion loose in the forest near westhaven and there were always wolves about but last of all and most likely was that it could be that the reason why this road was unused was the same reason the road through skull hill pass was little used something really horrible could be on it something that had moved in recently that talaysen might not know about where are we going she asked talaysen not wanting to seem to question his judgment but also not wanting to find herself facing something like the ghost the next uncanny creature might not be a music lover and she was no hand at all with any kind of weapon whats our next destination do you mean he replied or where are we making for tonight he looked back over his shoulder at her to answer and he didnt seem at all alarmed surely he knew about all the signs of danger on a road surely he was better at it than her both she said shortly the track widened a little and she got up beside him so that he could talk to her without having to crane his neck around allendale faire ultimately he told her thats about two weeks from now the pickings there have been good for me in the past and no one else wanted to take it this year so i said we would tonight theres a good camping spot i think we can make by moonrise theres water shelter and high ground there ive used it before the track doesnt get any worse than this so i dont see any problem with pressing on after sunset after sunset she said doubtfully master wren i dont think im up to struggling with tent poles in the dark you wont have to he said with a cheerful smile there wont be anyone there but us and since the weather is fine theres no need to worry about putting up a tent with luck the weather will hold until we reach allendale in about two weeks two weeks that was a long time to walk through forest shed slept under the stars without a tent before but never with company still it wasnt that she was afraid something would happen it was that she was afraid it wouldnt without a little privacy to share and she wasnt certain their provisions would hold out that long is there anything on this road she asked quite a bit after tonight small villages a great deal like the one you came from and about two days apart he told her we ought to be able to pick up a few nights worth of food and lodging for music on the way to allendale faire she frowned not quite understanding why he was so certain of a welcome but theyre so close to kingsfordwhy would they bother to trade us for music so close to the cityand so close to fairetime in winter now i could see itbut now he chuckled how often did the people in your village go even as far as the next one for anything maybe once or twice a year the first village is close to a twoday walk from here and most farmers cant afford to take that much time away from crops this time of the season not many people take this road either which is why i claimed it for the start of our journey what if theyve had a minstrel through here she asked then she remembered westhaven and shook her head never mind even if it was two days ago well still be a novelty wont we even if they have their own musicians it was that way at the hungry bear in my village he laughed well with luck well be the first musicians theyve seen in a while with none they still wont have had a musician down this way for a few days and whats morehis grin grew cocky and selfassuredhe wont have been as good as we are because he wont have been a free bard she chuckled and bent her head to keep her eye on her footing they walked on in silence the grass grown over the track muffled their steps and though their appearance frightened the birds right on the road into silence farther off in the woods there were plenty of them chirping and singing sleepily in the heat these woods had none of the brooding ominous qualities of the ones around skull hill and she began to relax a little there was nothing at all uncanny that she could senseand in fact after all those weeks of throngs of people and living with people at her elbow all the time she found the solitude quite comforting she was glad of her hat a widebrimmed straw affair that shed bought at the faire it was a lot cooler than her leather hat and let a bit of breeze through to her head when there was any to be had though the trees shaded the road a bit they also sheltered it from what little breeze there was and the heat beneath the branches was oppressive insects buzzed in the kneehigh weeds beside the road a monotonous drone that made her very sleepy sweat trickled down her back and the back of her neck shed put her hair up under the hat but she still felt her scalp and neck prickling with heat at least she was wearing her light breeches in skirts even kilted up to her knees shed have been fighting her way through the weeds grasshoppers sprang away from their track and an enterprising kestrel followed them for a while he was quite a sight to see hovering just ahead of them then swooping down on a fat hopper that they frightened into bumbling flight he would carry it on ahead and perch neatly stripping wings and legs then eating it like a child with a carrot before coming back for another unfortunate enough to be a little too slow why allendale faire she asked when the silence became too much to bear and her ears rang from the constant drone of insects its a decently large local faire in a town that has quite a few sires and wealthy merchants living nearby he replied absently we need to start thinking about a place to winterup im not in favor of making the rounds in winter personally and you never have its a hard life although it can be very rewarding if you hit a place where the town prospered during the summer and the people all have real coin to spend she thought about trekking through woods like these with snow up to her knees instead of weeds and shivered id rather not she said honestly like i told you when i met you that isnt the kind of life i would lead by choice that was one reason why i wanted to join the guild and your points were well made so one of those sires or the local branches of the merchants guild in or around allendale might provide a place to spend our winter he turned his head sideways and smiled you see most sires cant afford a permanent house musicianat least the ones out here in the country cant so theyll take on one that pleases their fancy for the winter months and turn him loose in the spring that way they have new entertainment every winter when there are long dark hours to while away yet they dont have the expense of a house retainer and all the gifts necessary to make sure that he stays content and keeps up his repertory the tone of his voice turned ironic the fact is that once a guild minstrel has a position theres nothing requiring him to do anything more its his for life unless he chooses to move on or does something illegal if hes lazy he never has to learn another new note just keep playing the same old songs so the people who have house minstrels or bards encourage them to stir themselves by giving them gifts of money and so forth when theyve performed well gifts for doing the job theyre supposed to do in the first place she replied aghast thats the guild he shrugged again i prefer our way honest money honestly earned stilla place in a sires household even for just the winter how is that possible i thought only guild musicians could take positions with a house she offered he laughed well thats the way its supposed to work but once youre away from the big cities the fact is that the sires dont give a fat damn about guild membership or not they just want to know if you can sing and play and if you know some different songs from the last musician they had and whos going to enforce it the king their duke not likely the bardic guild with what theres nothing they can use to enforce the law out here a sire is frequently his own law what about the other guilds she asked arent they supposed to help enforce the law by refusing to deal with a sire who breaks it thats true but once again youre out where the sire is his own law and the guildmasters and craftsmasters are few if a craftsman enforces the law by refusing to deal with the sire hes cutting his own throat by refusing to deal with the one person with a significant amount of money in the area the sire can always find someone else willing to deal but will the craftsman find another market he sighed the truth is that the guildmasters of other crafts might be able to do somethingbut half the time they dont give a damn about the bardic guild the fact is the bardic guild isnt half as important out of the cities as they think they are their real line of enforcement is their connection with the church through the sacred musicians and bards and the church is pragmatic about what happens outside the cities why is it that the bardic guild isnt important to the other guilds she asked hitching her pack a little higher on her back there was an itchy spot right between her shoulderblades that she ached to be able to scratch if she could keep him talking a while she might get her mind off of the itch because most of the crafts dont think of us as being crafters he said wryly music isnt something you can eat or wear or hold in your hand and they never think of the ability to play and compose as being nearly as difficult as their own disciplines he sighed and it isnt something that people need the way they need smiths or coopers or potters we arent even rated as highly as a limner or a scribe until its the middle of winter and people are growling at each other because the snows kept them pent up for a week she put in and even then they dont think of us as the ones who cheered everyone up never mind master wren im used to it in the tavern back home they valued me more as a barmaid and a floorscrubber than a musician and they never once noticed how i kept people at their beer long past the time when theyd ordinarily have gone home they never noticed how many more people started coming in of a night even from as far away as beeford all they remembered was that i lost the one and only fiddling contest i ever had a chance to enter silence theni would imagine theyre noticing it now he said when the silence became too oppressive yes i expect they are and theyre probably wondering what it is theyve done thats driving their custom away were they she wondered maybe they were the one thing that jeoff had always paid attention to was the state of the cashbox not even stara would be able to get around him if there was less in it than there used to be but then againhabit died hard and the villagers of westhaven were in the habit of staying for more than a couple ales now the villagers of beeford were in the habit of coming over to the bear for a drop in the long summer evenings maybe they werent missing her at all surely they thought she was crazed to run off the way that she had and the old women would be muttering about bad blood no doubt and telling their daughters to pay close attention to the priest and mind they kept to the stony path of virtue not like that rune bastard child and troublemaker from the start likely off making more trouble for honest folk elsewhere up to no good and shed never make an honest woman of herself dreams of glory thought she was better than all of themand shed die like a dog in a ditch or starve or sell herself like her whore of a mother no doubt talaysen kept an ear out for the sound of a lumberwagon behind them the road they followed was cleared of weeds if still little more than a path through the forestbut this was forested country the towns were small and the cleared fields few many of the villages hereabouts made their livings off the forest itself every other village boasted a sawmill or a cooper making barrels or a craftsman hard at work on some object made of wood the carpenters guild had many members here and there were plenty of craftsmen unallied with the guild who traded in furniture and carvings allendale was a halfday away and talaysen was both relieved and uneasy that their goal was so nearly in sight the past two weeks had been something of a revelation for him hed been forced to look at himself closely and he hardly recognized what he saw he glanced sideways at his apprentice who had her hat off and was fanning herself with it she didnt seem to notice his covert interest which was just as well in the first few weeks of the midsummer faire when runes arm was still healing hed been sorry for her protective of her and had no trouble in thinking of her strictly as a student hed felt in fact rather paternal she had been badly hurt and badly frightened she was terribly vulnerable and between what shed told him straight off and what shed babbled when she had a little too much belladonna he had a shrewd idea of all the hurtful things that had been said or done to her as a child because of her helplessness hed had no difficulty in thinking of her as a child and his heart had gone out to her she was so like him as a child differences in their backgrounds aside one unwanted superfluous child is very like another when it all comes down to it he had sought solace in music so had she it had been easy to see himself in her and try to soothe her hurts as his father would never soothe his but once she stopped taking the medicines that fogged her thoughts and even more once her arm was out of the sling and she began playing again all that changed drastically overnight the child grew up he strode through the anklehigh weeds at the walking pace that was secondnature to him now paying scant attention to the world about him except to listen for odd silences that might signal something or someone hidden beside the road aheadand the steady clopclopping of the hooves of drafthorses pulling timberwagons this was the right stretch of road for them which was why the weeds were kept down along here bandits wouldnt bother with a timberwagon but he and rune would make a tempting target highwaymen knew the faire schedule as well as he did and would be setting up about now to try to take unwary travelers with their pouches of coin on the way to the faire they wouldnt be averse to plucking a couple of singing birds like himself and his apprentice if the opportunity presented itself and if talaysen didnt anticipate them hed been accused of working magic he was so adept at anticipating ambushes funny really too bad he wasnt truly a mage he could transform his wayward heart back to the way it had been it was as hot today as it had been for the past two weeks and the dogdays of summer showed no sign of breaking now was haying season for the farmers which meant that every hot sunny day was a boon to them same for the lumberjacks harvesting and replanting trees in the forest he was glad for them for a good season meant more coin for themand certainly it was easier traveling in weather like thisbut a short storm to cool the air would have been welcome at this point a short storm summer thunderstorms were something he particularly enjoyed even when he was caught out in the open by them the way the air was fresh brisk and sharp with life afterwardsthe way everything seemed clearer and brighter when the storm had passed he wished there was a similar way to clear the miasma in his head about his apprentice hed hoped that being on the road with her would put things back on the studentteacher basis she didnt have real experience of life on the road and for all that she was from the country shed never spent a night camped under the open sky before she ran away from home this new way of life should have had her reverting to a kind of dependence that would have reawakened his protective self and pushed the other under for good and all but it didnt she acted as if it had never occurred to her that she should be feeling helpless and out of her depth out here instead of submissively following his lead she held her own with him insisting on doing her share of everything however difficult or dirty when she didnt know how to do something she didnt make a fuss about it she simply asked himthen followed his directions slowly but with confidence she took to camping as if she was born to it as if she had gypsy blood somewhere in her she never complained any more about the discomforts of the road than he did and she was better at bartering with the farmwives to augment their provisions than he was then there was music god help them both she was a full partner there though oddly that was the only place her confidence faltered she was even challenging him in some areas musically speaking she wanted to know why some things worked and some didnt and he was often unable to come up with an explanation and her fiddling was improving day by day both because she was getting regular practice and because shed had a chance to hear some of the best fiddlers in the country at the faire soon shed be second to none in that area he was as certain of that as he was of his own ability not that he minded not in the least he enjoyed the novelty of having a full partner to the hilt he liked the challenge of a student of her ability even more no that wasnt the problem at all this was all very exciting but he couldnt help but notice that his feelings towards her were changing more so every day it was no longer that he was simply attracted to hernor that he found her stimulating in other areas than the intellectual it was far worse than that hed noticed back at the last faire that when theyd sung a love duet he was putting more feeling into the words than he ever had before it wasnt acting it was real and therein lay the problem when they camped after dark he was pleased to settle the camp with her doing her half of the chores out there in the darkness even if she didnt do things quite the way he would have when he woke up in the middle of the night he found himself looking over at the dark lump rolled in blankets across the fire and smiled when he traded sleepy quips over the morning fire he found himself not only enjoying her companyhe found himself unable to imagine life without her and that frankly frightened him frightened him more than anything hed ever encountered from bandits to guild bards he watched her matching him strideforstride out of the corner of his eye and wanted to reach out to take her hand in his they suited each other there was no doubt of it they had from the first moment theyd met even ardis noticed it and had said as much shed told him they were two of a kind then had given him an odd sort of smile shed told him over and over that his affair with lyssandra wouldnt work that they were too different and shed been right by the time her father had broken off the engagement because hed fled the guild they were both relieved that it was over that little smile said without words that ardis reckoned that this would be different even the way they conversed was similar neither of them felt any great need to fill a silence with unnecessary talk but when they did talk it was always enjoyable stimulating he could with no effort at all see himself sharing the rest of his life with this young woman that frightened him even more how could he even think something like that the very idea was appalling she was younger than he was much younger he was not exaggerating when he had told ardis that he was twice her age he was and a bit more on the shady side of thirtyfive to her seventeen or eighteen how many songs were there about young women cuckolding older lovers enough to make him look like a fool if he took up with her enough to make her look like a woman after only his fame and fortune if she took up with him there was nothing romantic about an old man pairing with a young woman and much that was the stuff of ribald comedy furthermore she was his apprentice that alone should place her out of bounds he was appalled at himself for even considering it in his alltoovivid dreams hed always had the greatest contempt for those teachers who took advantage of a youngsters eagerness to please of their inexperience to use them there were plenty of ways to take advantage of an apprentice from extracting gifts of money from a wealthy parent to employing them as unpaid servants but the worst was to take a child sexually inexperienced but ripe and ready to learn and twist that readiness and enthusiasm that willingness to accommodate the master in every way and pervert it into the crude slaking of the masters own desires with no regard for how the child felt or what such a betrayal would do to it and he had seen that more than once even in the allmale guild if the church thundered against the ways of a man and a maid this was the sin the priests did not even whisper aloudbut that didnt mean it didnt occur especially in the hothouse forcingground of the guild that was one of the many reasons why hed left in a rage so long ago not that men sought comfort in other menwhile he did not share that attraction he could at least understand it the church called a great many things sins that were nothing of the sort this was just another example no what drove him into a red rage was that there were masters who abused their charges in body and spirit and were never ever punished for it the last straw was when two poor young boys had to be sent away to one of the church healers in a state of hysterical halfmadness after one of the most notorious lechers in the guild seduced them both then insisted both of them share his bed at the same time the exact details of what he had asked them to do had been mercifully withheldbut the boys had been pitiful and he would not blame either of them if they had chosen to seek the cloisters and live out their lives as hermits in the space of six months that evil man had changed two carefree happy children into frightened whimpering rabbits hed broken their music and it was even odds that it could be mended talaysen still boiled with rage it was wrong to take advantage of the trust that a student put in a teacher he respectedit was worse when that violation of trust included a violation of their young bodies hed gone to the master of the guild when hed learned of the incident demanding that the offending teacher be thrown out of the guild in disgrace insisting that he be turned over to the justiciars quite ready to take a horsewhip to him and flay the skin from his body hed been shaking physically shaking from the need to rein in his temper and the master of the guild had simply looked down his nose at him and suggested he was overreacting to a minor incident after all master jordain had said scornfully they were only unproven boys master larant is a full bard his ability is a proven fact the guild can do without them it cannot do without him besides if they couldnt handle themselves in a minor situation like that they probably would not have passed their journeyman period they were just too unstable its just as well master larant weeded them out early now his valuable time wont be wasted in teaching boys who would never reach full status he had restrained himself from climbing over the masters desk and throttling him with his bare hands by the thinnest of margins he still wasnt certain how hed done it he had stalked out of the office headed straight to his own quarters packed his things and left that afternoon seeking shelter with some gypsies hed met as a young man and had kept contact with renouncing the guild and all that it meant changing his name and his entire way of life but there it was hed seen how pressure of that nature could ruin a young life how could he put rune in the untenable position those poor boys had been in especially if hed been misreading her and what hed been thinking was flirtation was simple country friendliness and there was one other thing the stigma associated with female musicians rune didnt deserve that and if they remained obviously student and teacher all would be well or at least as well as it could be if she wore skirts but he wouldnt ever want her to bear that stigma which she would if she were ever associated with him as his lover assuming she was willing which might be a major assumption on his part oh if he wasnt misreading her if she was interested in him as a lover he could wed her hed be only too happy to wed her dear gods why would she ever want to actually wed him him twice her age shed be nursing a frail old man while she was still in the prime of her life bound to him and cursing herself and him both furthermore there would always be the assumption by those who knew nothing about music that shed become his apprentice only because she was his lover that she was gaining her fame by borrowing the shine of his no he told himself every time his eyes strayed to her and his thoughts wandered where they shouldnt no and no and no its impossible i wont have it its wrong but that didnt keep his eyes from straying orhis heart rain fell unceasingly down from a flat gray sky plopping on her raincape her hat and into the puddles along the road rune wondered what on earth was wrong with talaysen besides the weather of course hed been out of sorts about something from the moment theyd left the allendale faire not that he showed itmuch he didnt snap rail about anything or break into arguments over little nothings no he brooded he answered questions civily enough but neither his heart nor his thoughts were involved in the answer it could be the weather there was more than enough to brood over in the weather after weeks of dry sunny days their streak of good luck had finally broken drowning the allendale faire in three days of dripping sullen rain but theyd gotten around that theyd succeeded in finding a cooktent big enough to give them a bit of performing room and theyd done reasonably well monetarily speaking despite the weather the rain had kept away all the wealthy guildmasters and the three sires that lived within riding distance however perhaps that was the problem theyd made no progress towards finding a winteringover spot and she sensed that made talaysen nervous at the next several large faires he had told her soberly they could expect to encounter guild musicians journeymen looking for permanent places for themselves and they could encounter toughs hired by the guild either to teach them a lesson or to keep them from taking hire with one of the sires for the winter one thing was certain and only one she was just as outofsorts as he was but her mood had nothing to do with the weather or the state of their combined purse she knew precisely why she was restless and unhappy talaysen if this was love it was damned uncomfortable it wasnt lust or rather it wasnt lust aloneshe was quite familiar with the way that felt the problem was talaysen didnt seem inclined to do anything to relieve her problem despite all the hints shed thrown out and shed thrown plenty too the only thing she hadnt tried was to strip stark naked and creep into his bedroll after he fell asleep drat the man anyway was he made of marble she trudged along behind him watching his back from under her dripping hatbrim why didnt he respond to her it must be me she finally decided her mood of frustration turning to one of depression as the rain cooled her temper and she started thinking of all the logical reasons why he hadnt been responding obviously he could have anyone he wanted gwyna for instance and shes not like me shes adorable me im too tall too bony and i can still pass for a boy any time i choose he just doesnt have any interest in me at all and i guess i cant blame him she sighed the clouds chose that moment to double the amount of rain they were dropping on the two bards heads so that they were walking in their own roadsized waterfall she tallied up her numerous defects and compared herself with the flower of the free bard feminine contingent and came to the even more depressing conclusion that she not only wasnt in the running she wasnt even in the race when it came to attracting her master in any way other than intellectually and even thenthe free bards were anything but stupid any of the bright lovelies wearing the brotherhoods ribbons could match witticisms with talaysen and hold her own i dont have a prayer i might as well give up depression turned to despondency fueled by the miserable weather she sank deep inside herself and took refuge in composing the lyrics to songs of unrequited love each one worse and more trite than the one before it brother pell would have had a fit she stayed uncharacteristically silent all morning when they stopped for a brief soggy lunch she couldnt even raise her spirits enough to respond when he finally did venture a comment or two he must have sensed that it would be better to leave her alone for that was what he did addressing her only when it was necessary to actually tell her something and otherwise leaving her to her own version of brooding on the the fifteenth repeat of rhyming death with breath she noticed that talaysen had slowed and was looking about for something whats the matter she asked dully were going to have to stop somewhere for the night he said the worry evident in his voice although she couldnt see his expression under his dripping drooping hat brim im trying to find some place with at least a little shelterhowever small that may be oh she took herself mentally by the scruff of the neck and shook herself being really useful rune why dont you at least try to contribute something to this effort hmm what did you have in mind she asked he shruggedat least that was what she guessed the movement under his raincape and pack meant id like a cave but thats asking for a bit much around here she had to agree with him there this area was sandy and hilly rather than rocky and hilly not a good area for cavesand if they found one say under the roots of a tree it would probably already have a tenant she was not interested in debating occupancy with bears badgers or skunks lets just keep walking she said finally if we dont find anything by the time the light starts to fade maybe we can make a leanto against a fallen tree or something good enough he replied sounding just as depressed as she was you watch the righthand side of the track ill watch the left they trudged on through the downpour without coming to anything that had any promise for long enough that rune was just about ready to suggest that they not stop that they continue on through the night but it would be easy to get off the track in weather like this and once tangled in the underbrush they might not be able to find their way back to the road until daylight if there was anything worse than spending a night huddled inside a drippy leanto wrapped in a raincape it was spending it caught in a wild plum thicket while the rain beat down on you unhindered even by leaves meanwhile her thoughts ran on in the same depressing circle talaysen was tired of her that was what it was he was tired of his promise to teach her tired of her company and he didnt know how to tell her he wanted to be rid of her not that she blamed him it would be much easier for him to find that winteringover place with only himself to worry about and if that failed it would be very much harder for him to make the winter circuit with an inexperienced girl in tow he must be bored with her by now too she wasnt very entertaining she wasnt citybred she didnt know anything about the courts that she hadnt picked up from tonnoand that was precious little and he must be disgusted with her as well the way shed been shamelessly throwing herself at himhe was used to ladies not tavernwenches illmannered and coarse a country peasant despite her learning too ugly even to think about too she felt a lump of selfpity rising in her throat and didnt even try to swallow it down too ugly too tall too stupidthe litany ran around and around in her thoughts and made the lump expand until it filled her entire throat and made it hard to swallow it overflowed into her eyes and tears joined the rain that was leaking through her hat and running down her face her eyes blurred and she rubbed the back of her cold hand across them they blurred so much in fact that she almost missed the little path and halfruined gateposts leading away from the road almost she sniffed and wiped her eyes again hastily master wren she croaked around the lump in her throat he stopped turned there she said pointing and hoping he didnt notice her tearmarred face she was under no illusions about what she looked like when she cried awful blotchy face and swollen eyes red nose he looked where she pointed huh he said sounding surprised i dont remember that there before it looks like there might have been a farmhouse there a while back she said inanely stating the obvious maybe you didnt notice it because the last time you were through here you werent looking for a place to shelter in if theres a single wall standing itll be better than what we have now he replied wearily if theres two we can put something over them if theres even a corner of roof ill send ardis a donation for her charities the next time we reach a village with a priest he set off towards the forlorn little gate she followed as overgrown as that path looked there wasnt going to be enough room for them to walk in anything other than single file it was worse than it looked the plants actually seemed to reach out to them to tangle them to send out snags to trip them up and thorns to rake across their eyes the deeper they went the worse it got finally rune pulled the knife from her belt and started to hack at the vegetation with it to her surprise the going improved after that evidently there was point of bottleneck and then the growth wasnt nearly so tangled the bushes stopped reaching for them the trees stopped fighting them within a few moments they broke free of the undergrowth into what was left of the clearing that had surrounded the little house there was actually something left of the house more than they had hoped certainly although vines crawled in and out of the windows the door and shutters were gone entirely and there was a tree growing right through the roof there were still walls and a good portion of the roof remaining perhaps because the back of it had been built into the hill behind it they crossed the clearing stepped over a line of mushrooms ringing the house and entered there was enough light coming in for them to seeand hearthat the place was relatively dry except in the area of the tree talaysen got out his tinderbox and made a light with a splinter of wood dirt floorat least it isnt mud rune fumbled out a rushlight and handed it to him he lit it at his splinter in the brighter flare of illumination she saw that the floor was covered with a litter of dead leaves and less identifiable objects including a scattering of small roundish objects and some white splatters talaysen leaned down to poke one and came up with a mouseskull he grinned back at rune teeth shining whitely from under his hat brim at least we wont have to worry about vermin provided you dont mind sharing your quarters with an owl id share this place with worse than an owl if its dry she replied more sharply than she intended then she laughed in a shaky attempt to cover it lets see what we can do about putting together someplace to sleep away from where the owl is i can do without getting decorated with castings and mutes why rune we could set a whole new fashion talaysen teased his good humor evidently restored he stuck the rushlight up on what was left of a rock shelf at the back of the house and they set about clearing a space to bed down in chapter seventeen there rune said setting her makeshift broom of broken branches aside thats as clean as its going to get she made a face at the piled debris on the other side of the ash tree there had been too much garbage to simply sweep out the door thats clean enough talaysen told her from where he knelt just under the window striking his flint and steel together as he had been the entire time shed been sweeping he had a knack for fires that she didnt making a fire from sparks was a lot harder than villagefolk or especially cityfolk realized now if i can justthere he blew frantically at the little pile of dry leaves and shavings in front of him and was rewarded this time with a glow and then with a tiny flame carefully sheltering it from an errant breeze he fed it with tiny twigs then branches then finally built a real fire with wood scavenged from the cottages interior about his coreblaze just as well as it was definitely getting darker outside hopefully the smoke would go out the window and not decide to fill the cottage the chimney of this place was choked with birds nests and other trash rune took a look around now that she had more light to see by this hadnt been a big farmhouse one room with a tiny loft just under the roof for sleeping but the inside looked very odd for a place gone to ruin and she puzzled over it as talaysen picked up wood trying to figure it out then she had it the cottage had been abandoned in a hurry nothing had been taken not even the smallest stool the wood that talaysen was collecting had come from wrecked furniture the doors and windows had been forcedbut forced out not in and the shutters over the windows had been smashed at about the same time something got in here then smashed its way out but what could have been strong enough to do thatand nasty enough to keep the owner from coming back for his goods she felt a chill finger of fear trace a line down the back of her neck but then she shrugged and turned her attention to setting up their camp whatever had done this was long gone and not likely to return there was no sign that anything had been living here except the owl he handed their nesting cookpot and kettle to her she dug out the dried meat and vegetables and the canister of herb tea it was talaysens turn to cook while she spread out the sleeping rolls and went to get water well that wouldnt be hard there was a lot of water available right now she stuck the kettle then the pot out the window holding them under the stream of water coming off the eaves after all the rain theyd been having the roof was surely clean as clean as most streams anyway the presence of the owl probably kept birds from perching on the roof by day and there wasnt much else that would matter already it was hard to see across the clearing she was profoundly grateful that theyd found this bit of shelter when they had now theyd be able to have a hot meal warm and dry their clothing by the fire check their instruments maybe even practice a little as if he had followed her thoughts talaysen looked up from his cooking get my lute out will you rune i think its warm and dry enough in here that it wont come to any harm she nodded and took the instrument out of its oiledleather case inspecting it carefully for any signs that the rain or damp might have gotten to it satisfied that it was untouched she laid it on his unrolled bedding and did the same with her fiddle like any good musician she made a detailed examination of both instruments so detailed in fact that by the time she was finished the food and tea were both ready she dug into her own portion with a nod of thanks a little surprised at how hungry she was the food evaporated from her wooden bowl and she mopped every last trace of juice up with a piece of tough travelers bread the bowl hardly needed to be washed after she was through and talaysens was just as clean once they had finished eating talaysen was not to give her any time to brood over the thoughts that had caused her depression today either instead he insisted that they rehearse a number of songs she was only vaguely familiar with odd she thought after the first few he seemed to have chosen them all for subjectmatter rather than styleevery single one of them was about young women who were married off to old men and disappointed in the result in a great many of the songs they cuckolded their husbands with younger lovers in the rest they mourned their fates shackled for life to a man whose prowess was long in the past sometimes the songs were comic sometimes tragic but in all of them the women were unhappy after about the fifth or sixth of these she wondered if he was trying to tell her something after the fifteenth she was certain of it and despite the message she grew more and more cheerful with every chorus he had noticed how shed been flinging herself at him and this wasnt the reaction shed been thinking hed had to her was the message in these ballads that he was attracted but thought he was too old to make her happy it surely seemed likely where did he get an idea like that he wasnt that much older than she was girls in westhaven got married to men his age all the timeusually after theyd worn out their first wives with work and childbearing and were ready for a pretty young thing to warm their beds at night oh at thirtymumble if he had been a fat merchant or an even fatter guild bard maybe shed have been repulsed but it would have been the overstuffed condition of his body that would have come between them not his age at first she was too startled by what she thought he was trying to tell her to act on itthen after a moment of reflection she decided shed better not do anything until shed had a chance to plan her course of attack she held her peace and played the dutiful apprentice keeping her thoughts to herself until they were both too tired to play another note by then the fire was burning low and she was glad to creep into her nowwarmed blankets but although she intended to ponder all the possible meanings of the practice session though she did her best to hold off sleep it overtook her anyway there i think ive gotten my message across talaysen put his lute back in its case with a feeling of weary and slightly bitter satisfaction hopefully now his young apprentice would think about what she was doing and stop making calfseyes at him what he was going to do about the way he felt was another matter altogether suffer mostly eventually though he figured that he would be able to convince himself that their relationship of friendship was enough after all it was enough with all the other free bard women hed known maybe he could have another brief fling with nightingale to get the thought of rune out of his head nightingale had yet to find the creature that would capture her heart but she enjoyed an amorous romp as well as anyone at least hed given rune something to think about and the next time they met up with one of the gypsy caravans or another gathering of free bards shed start looking around her for someone her age that should solve the problem entirely once he saw her playing the young fool with all the other young fools his heart would stop aching for her he looked down at her sleeping face for a moment all soft shadows and firekissed angles maybe i shouldnt have been so hard on raven he thought dispiritedly maybe i should have encouraged him he was one of her teachers before he knows her better than i do they might get on very well together but though the idea of rune with another was all right in the abstract once he gave the idea a face it wrenched his heart so painfully that his breath caught dear god i am a fool he slipped inside his own bedroll certain that he was going to toss and turn for the rest of the night only to fall asleep so quickly he might have been taken with a spell of slumber it was the sound of a harp being played that woke him he found himself not lying in his bedroll in the tiny earthenfloored cottage but standing on his feet in the middle of a luxuriously green field overhead was not a sky filled with rain cloudsnot even a sky at allbut a rocky vault studded with tiny unwinking lights and a great silver globe that shone softly down on the gathering around him before him not a dozen yards away was a gathering of brightclad folk about a silver throne after a moment of breathlessness and confusion he concluded that the throne was solid silver for the being that sat upon it was certainly not human nor were those gathered about him eyes as amber as a cats stared at him unblinking from under a pair of upswept brows hair the black of a ravens wing was confined about the wide smooth marblepale brow by a band of the same silver as the throne the band was centered by an emerald the size of talaysens thumb the face was thin with high prominent cheekbones and a sensuous mouth but it was as still and expressionless as a statue peeking through the long straight hair were the pointed ears that told talaysen his host could only be one of the elven races there were elvenkin who were friends and allies to humans there were more who were not at the moment he had no idea which these were though the odds on their being the latter got better with every passing moment the man was clothed in a tunic of emeraldgreen silk with huge flowing sleeves confined about the waist with a wide silver belt and decorated with silver embroidery his legs were encased in green trews of the same silk and his feet in soft green leather boots his hands resting quietly on the arms of his throne were decorated with massive silver rings wrought in the forms of beasts and birds a young man sat at his feet clad identically but without the coronet and playing softly on a harp those about the throne were likewise garbed in silks of fanciful cut and jewelbright colors some wore so little as to be the next thing to naked others were garbed in robes with such long trains and flowing sleeves that he wondered how they walked without tripping themselves their hairstyles differed as widely as their dress from a short cap like a second skin of brilliant auburn to tresses that flowed down the back in an elaborate arrangement of braids and tied locks to puddle on the floor at the owners feet in a liquid fall of silverwhite all of them bore the elvenkings pointed ears and strange eyes his pale flesh and upswept brows some of them were also decorated with tiny quasiliving creations of magic dragonbelts that moved with the wearer faerielights entwined in the hair talaysen was no fool and he knew very well that the elves reputation for being touchy creatures was wellfounded and if these considered themselves to be the enemies of men they would be all the touchier stillthey hadnt killed him out of hand they might want something from him he went to one knee immediately bowing his head as he did so he saw that his lute was lying on the turf beside him still in its case you ventured into our holding mortal said a clear dispassionate tenor he did not have to look up to know that it was the leader who addressed him king was probably the best title to default to most lords of elvenkin styled themselves kings your pardon sire he replied just as dispassionately i pray you will forgive us when he said nothing else the elvenking laughed what no pleas for mercy no assertions that you didnt know no sire he replied carefully choosing his words as he would choose weapons for they were all the weapon that he had i admit that i saw the signs and i admit that i was too careless to think about what they signified and he had seen the signs the vegetation that tried to prevent them from entering the clearing until rune drew her iron knife the fairie ring of mushrooms encircling the house the ash tree growing right through the middle and the condition of the house itself the mortal who built his house at our very door was a fool and an arrogant one the elvenking replied to his thought his words heavy with lazy menace he thought that his god and his church would defend him against us that his iron weapons were all that he needed besides his faith he knew this was our land that he built his home against one of our doors he thought to keep us penned that way we destroyed him a faint sigh of silk told him that the king had shifted his position slightly he still did not look up but you were weary and careless with cold and troubles the king said his tone changed silken and sweet you had no real intention to trespass now he looked up the elf lounged in his throne in a pose of complete relaxation that did not fool talaysen a bit all the bard need do would be to make a single move towards a weapon of any kind at all and he would be dead before the motion had been completed if the king didnt strike him down with magic the courtiers would with the weapons they doubtless had hidden on their persons the softest and most languid of them were likely the warriors no sire he replied we had no intention of trespass though we were careless it was an honest mistake still the elf regarded him with halfclosed eyes that did not hide a cold glitter letting you go would set a bad example he felt his hands moving towards his instrument he tried to stop them but his body was no longer his to control he picked up his lute and stripped the case from it then tuned it i think we shall resolve your problems and ours with a single stroke the elf said sitting up on the throne and steepling his hands in front of his chin i think we shall keep you here as our servant to pay for your carelessness we have minstrels but we have no bards you will do nicely he waved his hand languidly you may play for us now rune awoke to a thrill of alarm a feeling that there was something wrong she sat straight up in her bedand a faint scrape of movement made her look not towards the door but to the back of the cottage where it was built into the hillside she was just in time to see the glitter of an amber eye the flash of a pointed ear and the soles of talaysens boots vanishing into the hillside as he stumbled through a crack in the rock wall at the rear of the cottage then the door in the hill snapped shut leaving her alone staring at the perfectly blank rock wall that broke her paralysis she sprang to her feet and rushed the wall screaming at the top of her lungs kicking it pounding it with hands and feet until she was exhausted and dropped to the ground panting elves that was what shed seen elves and they had taken talaysen she had seen the signs and she hadnt paid any attention she should have known the mushrooms the ashtreethe bushes that tried to keep us out they were all there the fairiecircle the guardian ash the treewarriorsall of them in the songs shed learned all of them plain for any fool to see if the fool happened to be thinking too late to weep and wail about it now there must be something she could do there had to be a way to open that door from this side she felt all over the wall pressing and turning every rocky projection in hopes of finding a catch to release it or a trigger to make it open nothing it must be a magic door she pulled out her knife knowing the elves legendary aversion to iron and steel and picked at anything she found hoping to force the door open the way she had forced the trees to let them by but the magic in the stone was sterner stuff than the magic in the trees and although the wall trembled once or twice beneath her hand it still refused to yield thinking that the ash tree might be something more than just a tree she first threatened it with her dagger then stabbed it but the tree was just a tree and nothing happened at all other than a shower of droplets that rained down on her through the hole in the roof as the branches shook elves elves what do i know about elves god there has to be a way to get at them to get talaysen out what do i have to use against them not much and not a lot of information about them nothing more than was in a halfdozen songs or so she paced the floor her eyes stinging with tears that she scrubbed away refusing to give in trying to think what did she know that could be used against them the gypsies deal with them all the time how did the gypsies manage to work with them shed heard the gypsies spoken of as elftouched time and time again as if they had somehow won some of their abilities from the secretive race what could the gypsies have that gave them such power over the elvenkin gypsies elves she stopped in midstride balancing on one foot as she realized the secret it was in one of the songs the gypsy called nightingale had taught her music they can be ruled by music they cant resist it thats what the song implied anyway she dashed to her packs and fumbled out her fiddle elves traditionally used the harp but the fiddle was her instrument of choice and she wasnt going to take a chance with anything other than her best weapon she tuned the lovely instrument with fingers that shook placed it under her chin and stood up slowly to face the rock wall then she began to play she played every gypsy song she knew improvised on the themes then played them all over again the wailing melodies sang out over the sound of the storm getting worse overhead she ignored the distant growl of thunder and the occasional flicker of lightning against the rock in front of her she concentrated all of her being on the music the hidden door and how much she wanted that door to open let me in let me in let me in to be with him let me in so i can get him free she narrowed her eyes to concentrate better she thought she felt somethingor rather heard something only it was as if she had an extra ear somewhere deep inside that was listening to something echo her playing echo no it wasnt an echo this was a different melody not by muchbut different enough that she noticed it was she somehow hearing the musickey to the spell holding the door closed resonating to the tune she was playing she didnt stop to think about it obeying her instinctive feelings she left the melodyline she was playing and strove to follow the one she heard with that inner ear she felt a tingle along her arms the same tingle she had felt when gwyna had been transformed back to her proper form not quite a match she tried harder speeded up a little trying to anticipate the next notes closer closer as she suddenly snapped into synch with that ghostly melody the door in the wall cracked openthen gaped wide she found herself in a tunnel that led deep into the hillside a tunnel that was floored with darkness and had walls and a ceiling of swirling colored mist if she had doubted before this was the end of doubts only elves would build something like this the door remained open behind her she could only hope it would stay that way and not snap shut to block her exit if she got a chance to make one she clutched her fiddle in her hand and ran lightly down the tunnel it twisted and turned like a rabbits run but at length she saw light at the end more than that she heard music and with her ears not whatever shed used to listen before music she knew talaysens lute but not his voice he was not singing and that lack shouted wrongness at her there was a stiffness to his playing as if he was being constrained by something forced to play against his will she ran harder and burst through a veil of brightcolored mist at the very end of the tunnel she stumbled onto a field of grass as smooth and closeclipped as a carpet under a sky of stone bejeweled with tiny artificial stars and a featureless moon of silver small wonder the songs spoke of elven halls for all that they aped the outdoors this was an artifice and would never look like a real greensward the elves gathered beneath that artificial moon in the decorous figures of a pavane stopped and turned to stare in blank surprise at her talaysen stood between them and herand his expression was of surprise warring with fear she knew she darent give them a moment to get over their surprise if they did theyd attack her and if they attacked her theyd kill her the songs made that perfectly clear as well she grasped for the only weapon she had so you want to dance do you she shoved the fiddle under her chin set bow to strings and played a wild reel a dancetune that never failed to bring humans to their feet and called the faerie reel she hoped there was more in the name than just the clever title there was or else the elves were as vulnerable to music as gypsy legend suggested they seized partners by the hands and began flinging themselves through the figures of the dance just as wildly as she played as if they couldnt help themselves she didnt give them a respite either when that tune had been played through three full sets she moved smoothly from that piece into another then another each piece was repeated for three sets she had a guess from some of what the gypsy songs said that three was a magic number for binding and unloosing and she wanted to bind them to their dancing keeping them occupied and unable to attack she played for them as fiercely as she had for the ghost willing them to dance faster and faster until their eyes grew blank and their limbs faltered finally some of them actually began dropping from exhaustion fainting in the figures of the dance unable to get up again one dropped then two then a half dozen the rest staggered in the steps stumbling over the fallen ones as if they could not stop unless they were as unconscious as the ones on the ground seemed to be another pair fainted into each others arms and the elvenking whirled his face set in a mask of unthought then she changed her tune literally she brought the tune home and paused for just a heartbeat the elves eyes all turned toward her again most of them blank with weariness or pleading for her to stop the elvenking stronger than the rest staggered towards her a step or two she set bow to the strings again and saw the flicker of fear in their eyes and she launched into the gypsy laments before she had finished the first the weariest of the elves were weeping as she had suspected the gypsy songs in particular held some kind of strange power over the elves a power they themselves had no defense against by the time she had completed the last sorrowing lament that nightingale had taught her even the elf with the coronet was in tears helpless caught in the throes of grief that rune didnt understand even though she had evoked it she took her bow from her strings now there was no sound but soft sobbing theyre mine no matter what they try theyre too tired and too wrought up to move fast i can play them into the ground if i have to i think provided my arms hold out elves she couldnt help but notice resentfully looked beautiful even when weeping their eyes and cheeks didnt redden their noses didnt swell up they simply sobbed musically perfect crystal tears dropping from their clear amber eyes to trickle like raindrops down their cheeks she looked for the one with the coronet he was climbing slowly to his feet tears in his eyes but his chin and mouth set with anger she strode quickly across the greensward to get past talaysen as the elvenking brought himself under control and by the time he was able to look squarely at her she was between him and her master with her bow poised over the strings again and her face set in an expression of determination she hoped he could read no he shouted throwing out a hand fear blazing from his eyes she removed her bow a scant inch from the strings challenge in hers no he said in a calmer voice please play no more your magic is too strong for us mortal we have no defense against it about him his people were recovering some of them anyway the ones who could control themselves or who had not fainted with exhaustion earlier were helping those who were still lying on the velvety green grass trying to wake them from their faint helping them to their feet rune said nothing she only watched the elven king steadily he glanced at his courtiers and warriors and his pale face grew paler still you are powerful for all that you are a green girl he said bitterly turning a face full of carefully suppressed anger back to her i knew that the man was powerful and i confined him carefully wrapping his music in bonds he could not break so that he could not work against us but you you i had not expected you have destroyed my defenses you have brought my people to their knees no he said again as she inadvertently lowered her bow a trifle no ibeg you do not play again elves do not weep readily many more tears and my people may go mad with grief all right she replied steadily speaking aloud for the first time in this encounter controlling her voice as talaysen had taught her though her knees trembled with fear and her stomach was one icecold knot of panic maybe i wont if you give me what i want what the elvenking replied swiftly ask and you shall have it gold jewels the treasures of the earth objects of enchantment him she interrupted before he could continue the litany and perhaps distract her long enough to work against both of them i want my lover back again then she bit her lip in vexation damn damn damn damn she had meant to say master but her heart and her nerves conspired to betray her lover the elvenking said one eyebrow rising in disbelief as he looked from talaysen to her and back to talaysen lover youand he what falsehood is this but then he furrowed his brows and peered at her as if he was trying to look into her heart lover no he said slowly but beloved yes i had not thought of this either small wonder your music had such power against me with all the strength of your heart behind it you cant keep him she said swiftly trying to regain the ground she had lost with her inadvertent slip of the tongue if you can see our thoughts then you know i am not lying to you if you cage a songbird it wont sing if you keep a falcon mewed up forever it will die do the same to my master and hell die just as surely as that falcon will he gave up everything for freedomtake it from him and you take away everything that makes him a bard hell waste away and leave you with nothing and i will never forgive you youll have to kill me to rid yourself of me and the cost will be higher than you may want to pay believe me the elvenkings eyes narrowed theres truth in that he said slowly truth in everything you have said thus far but you mortal girlyoure made of sterner more flexible stuff you would not pine away like a linnet in a cage tell me would you trade your freedom for his yes she said just as talaysen cried out behind her no the elf considered them both for a moment longer then shook his head no he said anger filling his voice no it must be both of you or neither cage the one and the other will come to free it keep you both and you will have my kingdom in ruins within the span of a single moon you are too powerful to hold too dangerous to keep both of you go he flung his arm up pointing at the tunnel behind her but rune wasnt finished yet the treachery of elves was as legendary as their power and secretiveness she dropped the bow to the strings and played a single grieffilled phrase stop the elvenking cried over it tears springing into his eyes hands clapped futilely over his ears what more do you want of us she lifted the bow from the strings your pledge she replied steadily your pledge of our safety she saw the flash of rage that overcame him for a moment and knew that she had been right the elvenking had planned to ambush them as soon as their backs were turned and probably kill them he had lost a great deal of pride to her and her music only destroying them would gain it back swear she insisted by the moon our mother the blood of the stars and the honor of the clan talaysen whispered swear by the moon our mother the blood of the stars and the honor of the clan that you will set us free you will not hinder our leaving you will not curse us nor set magic nor weapons against us swear it she warned as the rage the elvenking held in check built in his eyes and threatened to overwhelm his selfcontrol swear it or ill play till my arms fall off i played all one night before i can do it again he repeated it between gritted teeth word for word she slowly lowered her arms and tucked fiddle and bow under one of them never betraying by a single wince how both arms hurt she turned just as slowly and finally faced talaysen just as fearful of what she might see in his eyes as of all the power the elvenking could raise against them he smiled weakly his face a mask that covered warring emotions that flickered behind his eyes but he picked up his lute and case and offered her his arm as if she was his lady she took it gravely and they strolled out of that place of danger as outwardly calm as if they strolled down the aisles of a faire but once they reached the cottage the rock door slammed shut right on their heels and she began throwing gear into her pack taking time only to wrap her fiddle in her bedding and stow it in the very bottom for safety he joined her are you thinking what im thinking he said over the steady boom of thunder from overhead the fire was almost out but they didnt need it to see lightning flashing continuously gave them plenty of light to see by i think so she shouted stuffing the last of her gear into her pack with her tiny harp cushioned inside her clothing to keep it safe i dont trust him no matter what he swore by hell find a way to get revenge on us wed better get out of here this may be his revenge talaysen said grimly packing up his own things and slinging them on his back throwing his raincape over all then pointing to the storm outside the windows he didnt swear not to set the weather on us as long as he doesnt touch us directly he hasnt violated his pledge a storm lightningthose arent strictly weapons she swore elves she spat they should be churchmen or lawyers lets get out of here a moving target is harder to hit talaysen was in perfect agreement with her apparently he strode right out into the teeth of the storm and she was right behind him the trees didnt stop them this time evidently the prohibition against using magic held the grasping branches off but the storm was incredible lightning striking continuously all about them rain lashed them pounding them with hammers of water sluicing over their raincapes until they waded ankledeep on the path talaysen insisted shouting in her ear to be heard over the storm that they walk down in the streambed next to the road it was full of rushing water that soaked them to their knees but with the rain lashing them from every angle it didnt much matter they were wet anyway and when lightning struck the roadway not once but repeatedly she saw the sense of his orders the streambed was deep enough that not even their heads were above the roadway lightning always sought the highest point they had to make certain that point wasnt them but the streambed turned away from the roadway eventually and ran back into the trees now the question was follow the road and take their chances with the lightning or follow the streambed and hope it led somewhere besides into the wilderness talaysen wavered she made up his mind for him pushing past him and following the streambed under the trees people always built their homes beside water with luck theyd come across something in a day or two with no luck at least they wouldnt be turned into bardshaped cinders and they could retrace their path if they had to until they met up with the road again the terrain was getting rockier when she could see through the curtains of water the streambed looked as if it had been carved through what looked like good solid stone and the banks were getting higher if they couldnt find a house maybe they could find a cave if they couldnt find either maybe they could just walk out the storm it was awfully hard to think with rain beating her skull and water tugging at her ankles forcing her constantly off balance she was so cold she couldnt remember being warm the thunder and lightning raged above their heads but none of it was getting down to the ground anymore not even the strikes that split whole trees in half and the very worst of it seemed to be behind them although the rain pounded them unabated her head was going to be sore when they were out of this maybe they were getting out of the elvenkings territory how far could magic reach she found out as there was a sudden slackening in the rain a moment when the lightning and thunder stopped both she and talaysen looked up as one but rune was not looking up with hope she felt only a shudder of fear this did not have the feeling of a capitulation it had the feeling of a summoning the elvenking was bringing one final weapon to bear upon them that was when they saw the wall of wind and water rushing down on them walking across the trees and bending them to the earth as it came not like a whirlwindlike a moving waterfall a barrier of water too solid to see through talaysen was nearer to shelter he flung himself down in a gully carved into the side of the streambed she looked about frantically for something big enough to hold her too late the wind struck her staggering hershe flailed her arms to keep her balance then in a flash of lightning saw what looked like half a tree heading straight for her pain and blackness talaysen saw the tree limb as thick around as he was hit rune and drop her like a stone into the water pinning her in the stream beneath its weight he might have cried out it didnt matter in the next instant he had fought through the downpour and was clawing at the thing trying to get it off her as the wind screamed around him and battered him with other debris shed been knocked over a boulder so at least her head was out of the waterbut that was all that fortune had granted her she was unconscious she had a pulse but it was weak and slow and he couldnt budge the limb frantic now he forced himself to calm to think halfremembered hunters lessons sprang to mind and he recalled shifting a dead horse off another boys leg with the help of a lever he searched until he found another piece of limb long and stout enough wedged it under the one pinning rune and used another boulder for a fulcrum there should have been two people doing thished had the help of the huntsman before heave kick a bit of flotsam under the limb to brace it his arms screamed with pain heave another wedge of wood his back joined the protest heave finally sweating and shaking he had it balanced above her it wouldnt hold for long hed have to be fast he let go of the lever grabbed her ankle and pulled he got her out from under the limb just as it came crunching back down smashing to splinters one of the bits of wood hed used to brace it up the wind died and the rain was slackening as if with runes injury the elvenking was satisfied but the lightning continued which now was a blessing at least he had something to see by he bent down and heaved rune pack and all over his shoulders as if she was a sack of meal fear made a metallic taste in his mouth but lent him strength he didnt know he had and mercifully blanked the pain of his overburdened aging body he looked about frantically for a bit of shelter anything somehow he had to get her out of the rain get her warm again her skin was as cold as the stones hed pried her out ofif he couldnt get her warm she might die lightning flickered just as his eyes passed over what hed thought was a dark boulder is that he staggered towards it overbalanced by the burden he carried and by the press of the rushing water against his legs lightning played across the sky overheadhe got another look at the dark blot in the stream wall no it wasnt a boulder and it was bigger than he thought he climbed up onto the bank peered at it in another flash of lightningand nearly wept with relief it was it was a cave a small one but if it wasnt too shallow it should hold them both with no difficulty pure luck had formed it from boulders caught in the roots of a tree so big two men couldnt have spanned the trunk with their arms and a pair of bright eyes looked out of it at him he didnt care whatever it was it would have to share its shelter tonight the eyes werent far enough apart for a bear and that was all he cared about somehow he got himself up into the cave somehow he dragged rune up with him erratic lightning showed him what it was in the cave with him an entire family of otters they stared at him fearlessly but made no aggressive moves towards him he ignored them and began pawing through the packs for something warm and dry to put on her he encountered the instruments first his luteintact hers was cracked but might be repaired later her pennywhistle was intact and the tiny harp hed given her the bodhran drum was punctured his larger harp needed new strings all this in mental asides as he pawed through the packs pulling out soaked clothing and discarding it to the side finally he reached the bottom of the packs and in the very bottom their bedding somehow dry her fiddle wrapped in the middle of it safe there wasnt much time and he didnt hesitate every moment she stayed chilled was more of a threat he stripped her skinbare and bundled her into both sets of bedding then he stripped himself and eased in with her wrapping her in his arms and willing the heat of his body into her for a long time nothing happened the storm died to the same dull rain theyd coped with for the length of the faire the lightning faded away leaving them in the dark rune breathed but shallowly and her body didnt warm in the least her breathing didnt change she wasnt waking she wasnt falling into normal sleep if he couldnt get her warm lady of the gypsies help me you are the queen of the forests and wildshelp us both finally he heard faint snuffling sounds and felt the pressure of tiny feet on his leg and knee the otters curiosity had overcome their fear they sniffed around the bundle of humans and blankets poking their noses into his ear and sneezing into his face once it would have been funny if he hadnt been sick with worry for rune she wasnt warming she was hardly breathing one of the otters yawned another before he realized what was happening they were curling up on him on rune everywhere there was a hollow in the blankets there was an otter curling up into a lithewarmball and flowing over the sides of the hollows as they settled he began to warm up from the heat of their six bodies and as he warmed so at last did rune her breathing eased and finally she sighed moved a littlethe otters chittered sleepily in complaintand settled into his arms truly asleep he tried to stay awake but in a few moments exhaustion and warmth stole his consciousness away and he joined her and their strange bedcompanions in dreams he woke once just after dawn when the otters stirred out of sleep and left them but by then they were not only warm they were a bit too warm and he bade the beasts a sleepy but thankful goodbye one of the adultsthe female he thoughtlooked back at him and made a friendly chitter as if she understood him then she too was gone leaving the cave to the humans rune woke with an ache in her head a leg thrown over hers and arms about her behind her someone breathed into her ear what happened she closed her eyes trying to remember they werent in the cottage theyd found that much was for certain then she remembered the elves her onesided fight with music and magic then the flight through the storm after that was a blur but she must have gotten hurt somehow she wormed one arm out of the blankets reached up to touch the place on her head that hurt worst and found a lump too tender to bear any pressure at all with a bit of a gash across the middle of it that was when she realized that she wasnt wearing so much as a stitch and neither was talaysen he murmured in his sleep and held her closer his hands moved in halfaware patterns fitfully caressing her breasts her stomach and there was something quite warm and insistent poking her in the small of the back she held very still afraid that if she moved hed stop despite the ache in her head her body tingled all over and she had to fight herself to keep from squirming around in his arms and suddenly he froze one hand on her breast the othersomewhat lower he woke up and now hes going to go all proper on me if you stop she said conversationally i am going to be very angry with you i thought you taught me to always finish a tune youve started please god please whoevers listening dont let him go all formal now iiuh he seemed unable to form any kind of a reply besides she continued trying to think around the pain in her skull ive been trying to get you into this position for weeks rune he yelped im your teacher i cant you cant what what difference does being my master make youve only got one apprentice you cant be accused of favoring me over anyone else you havent been trying to seduce me ive been trying to waylay you theres a difference there she thought with a certain satisfaction that takes care of that particular argument its not as if youre taking unfair advantage of your position butthe pressuremy position i like the pressure she replied thoughtfully though id prefer to change the position and she started to squirm around to face him he choked thats not what i meant he said and then it was too late they were facetoface cozily wound in blankets and he couldnt pretend he didnt understand her she could read his expression quite clearly from here she smiled into his eyes he blushed i know thats not what you meant she told him i just dont see any pressure on me to drag you into my bed except the pressure of wanting you but and if youre going to tell me something stupid like youre too old for me well you can just forget that entirely she kissed his nose and he blushed even redder i wouldnt drink wine that was a month old i wouldnt play a brand new fiddle and i wouldnt hope for fruit from a sapling tree but i also wouldnt go to an apprentice in any craft for anything important id go to a master but she blinked at him willing the pain in her head to go away youre not going to try and tell me that youve been celibate all these years are you if you are then gwyna was lying or you are and much as id hate to accuse my master of telling falsehoods id believe gwyna on this subject more than id believe you his mouth moved but no words emerged she decided he looked silly gasping like a fish and saved his dignity by stopping it with a kiss he disengaged just long enough to say i yield to your superior logic and then the time for talk was over and the time for a different sort of communication finally arrived chapter eighteen you are going to marry me arent you talaysen asked plaintively picking his nowdry clothing off the rocks beside the stream and packing it away there was no sign of last nights storm even most of the debris had been washed downstream and as if in apology the day had turned bright and sunny around noon rune had caught a fish using some of their soggy bread for bait hed managed to get a fire going so they could cook it the rest of the day theyd spent in laying out everything that had gotten wet to dry and figuring out just how badly rune had gotten hurt shed gotten off fairly easily as it turned out she had gotten a bad knock on the head but nothing a lot of valerian couldnt help they were now a day behind of course but that was better than being lightning victims or confined in the elvenkings hall rune looked over at talaysens anxious face and grinned wickedly despite the black eye and bruises the tree limb had gifted her with isnt it supposed to be me thats asking that she mocked you sound like one of the deflowered village maidens in a really awful bardic guild ballad he flushed im serious iyouwe we cant just go on like this youre going to get harassed enough if were legally wed if we arent she looked at him with an expression of exasperation and carefully folded one of her shirts before answering is that the only reason to make an honest woman out of me to protect me from disgrace no he blurted and flushed again i meani ah she put the shirt back into her pack thats just as well since protecting a nameless bastard from disgrace is pretty much like protecting a thief from temptation why dont you just tell me why youre so set on this and let me think about your reasons for a moment he sat back on his heels and stared at her helplessly for all that he was a bard and supposed to be able to work magic with words he felt suddenly bereft of any talent with his tongue whatsoever how could he tell her she waited patiently favoring her left side a little he marshaled his thoughts tried to remember what he always told others when they were tonguetied when the gift seemed to desert them begin at the beginning so he did she listened once or twice she nodded it got easier as he went along easier to find the words though they didnt come out of his mouth with any less effort hed lived for so long without telling people how he felthow he really felt the deep feelings that it was generally better not to revealthat each confession felt as if he was trying to lift another one of those trees only this time the back he was lifting it from was his own the logical reasons why it was better not to give the guild another target how being legally married would actually cut down on petty jealousy within the bards how it might keep petty officials of the church not only from harassing them but from harassing other free bard couples who chose to perform as a pair the reasons with no logic at all and these were harder to get out that he not only loved her he needed her presence that she made him feel more alive his secret daydreams of spending the rest of his days with her how she brought out the best in everything for him the reasons that hurt to confess how he was afraid that without some form of formal tie binding them one day shed tire of him and leave him without warning how he felt as if her refusal to formally wed him was a kind of rejection of him as if she were saying she didnt feel he was worth the apparent sacrifice of her independence finally he came to the end he had long since finished his packing and he sat with idle hands clenched on stones to either side of him she let out her breath in a sigh have you thought about this she asked i mean have you really thought it through things likehow are the other free bards going to react to a wife you think that it will cut down on petty jealousywhy i think it might just make things worse a loverthat would be no problem but a wife wouldnt they see me as some kind of interloper im the newest free bard how did i get you to wed me wouldnt they think im likely to try interfering with you and the rest of them i cant read minds he said slowly but i truly dont think thered be any problem i know every one of the free bards personally and i just dont think the kinds of problems youre worried about would even occur marriage might make things easier actually i cant be everywhere at once and sometimes ive wished there were two of me and there are things the females havent always felt comfortable in bringing to methey tell gwyna a lot of the time but that really isnt the best solution with you theremy legal partnertheres a partnership implied with marriage that there isnt with a lover stability they arent going to tell you something then discover the next time we met that theres someone else with me and wonder what that means to their particular problem he relaxed a little as she nodded all righti can see that but we should try to anticipate problems and head them off before they become problems for instance divided authority someone trying to work us against each other if you give me authority it should be only as your other set of ears all right she waited for his nod of agreement before continuing what about children she said surprising him completely what about them he replied without thinking i want them do you have you thought about what it would take to raise them as free bards she held up her hand to forestall his protest that it would not be fair to her to saddle her with children she might well have to raise alone dont tell me that youre old youll die and leave me to raise them alone i dont believe that for a minute and neither do you he snapped his mouth shut on the words well she said rubbing her head to relieve the ache in it is there a way to have children and still be free bards we could settle somewhere for a while he suggested tentatively she shook her head and winced no no i dont think that would work you have to be visible and that means traveling if we lived in a big city wed have to leave the children alone while we buskedno matter how good we were we would still be taking whatever jobs the guild minstrels didnt want and thats pretty precarious living for a family and the guild would be only too happy to flaunt their riches in the face of your povertythen come by and offer you your old position if you just gave all the free bard nonsense up she watched him shrewdly to see if hed guess the rest of that story and of course that would mean either giving you up or persuading you to turn yourself into a good little bardwife and give up your music he shook his head what a recipe for animosity you know them better than i thought you did she snorted just figured that if there was a way to make people jealous of each other and drive a wedge between them theyd know it i imagine theres a lot of that going on in the guild he pondered her original question for a moment and emptied his mind waiting to see if an answer would float into the emptiness he watched the dance of the sunlight on the sparkling waters flexing and stretching his fingers and as always waiting for the tell tale twinges of weathersoreness his father had suffered terribly from it but then his father had also shamelessly overindulged himself in rich food and wine and seldom stirred from his study and office that might have had something to do with it theres another way he said suddenly as the image of a gypsy wagon did indeed float into his mind we could join a caravan of gypsy families get our own wagon travel with them and raise children with theirs if there are older children adolescents they watch the younger ones and if there arent theres always someone with a task that can be done at the encampment that minds the children for everyone else she raised an eyebrow skeptically mind you this is all nasty taletelling from evilmouthed smallminded villagers butive never heard anything about gypsy parents except that they were terrible selling their children forcing them to work maiming them and putting them out to beg have you ever actually seen any of that with your own eyes he asked she shook her head carefully its not true any of it they know how to prevent having children so they never have more than they can feedif something does happen to one or both parents every family in the caravan is willing to take on an extra mouth the children are tended carefully the encampment is always guarded by dogs that would take on a wolfpack for their sakes and the children loved by everyone in the caravan they grow up to be pretty wonderful adults well look at gwyna raven and erdric she gave a dry chuckle sounds too good to be true oh therere exceptions he admitted there are families other gypsies refuse to travel withthere are families that are hard on their children and a general nuisance to the rest of the adults any child that doesnt learn how to get out of the way of a drunk or a serious situation is going to be on the receiving end of a cuff you must admit though that can happen anywhere mostly gypsy children are the healthiest and happiest ive ever seen the drawback is that they wont learn reading writing or the holy bookthe gypsies dont hold with any of the three reading and writing we can teach them ourselves rune countered and the holy bookthey should read it when theyre old enough to understand that what theyre reading is as much what the church wants you to believe as it is holy words she thought that proposition over for a long moment that would work she concluded finally having a wagon to live in eliminates one of the biggest expenses of living in a town or city too what the rent he grinned shed already told him about her job at ambers and he knew very well they could always find something comparable if they ever cared to settle in one place for long no she countered the damned tithe and tax if they cant catch you they cant collect it and if you leave before they catch you point taken he admitted though ill warn you i do pay tax ive been paying both our shares if you want decent government you have to be prepared to pay for it he saw a shadow of somethingsome remembered painpass across her face point taken she said quietly tonnofelt the same way as you and lectured me about it often enough but the tithe serves no damned purpose at all if it got into the hands of priests like your cousin that would be different most of the time though it ends up in the hands of men that are no better than thieves he snorted and tried not to think too hard about most of his dealings with the churchthose that hadnt involved ardis seeking out someone specific for him to speak to ive known thieves with more honorand ardis would be the first to agree with you but we werent talking about ardis no we werent she leaned forward intently talaysen what do you intend to do with the free bards do was she really asking what he thought she was asking what exactly do you mean what i said she replied what are you going to do with them oh it was enough to form them to keep the bardic guild from getting rid of them when there were only a handful of you im sure but there are nearly fifty of you nownot counting the ones that didnt come to the midsummer faire and there are more joining every year they think of you not only as the founder but as the leadernow what are you going to lead them to or is this just going to be a kind of gypsy clan with no other purpose than to live and play music of all of the free bards rune was the only one that had asked him that question the question he had been asking himself for about three years there are a lot of things i would like to do he said slowly but all of them involve having more power than we do now thats why ive gotten the rest involved in trying to ingratiate ourselves with the sires and guildmasters outside the big cities so that when you come to demand a change there will be someone backing you she nodded enthusiastically whats the change mostly weiwant to see some of the privileges and monopolies taken away from the bardic guild he replied i want them put on a completely equal footing with us i dont want to set up the free bards in place of the guild but i want any musician to be free to take any place thats been offered him i want the sires able to hire and fire members of the guild the same way they can hire and fire free bards and traveling minstrels and there are some abuses of power within the guild that i want looked into she sat back on her heels and smiled thatll do she replied thats enough for anyones lifetime let your successor worry about the next step are you going to marry me now he asked trying to sound plaintive and actually sounding testy she laughed since you ask me so romantically i think so she said tossing a shirt at him that he had forgotten but dont think that you can go back to being aloof until the bonds are set she bared her teeth at him in a playful little snarl that was oddly erotic he restrained himself from doing what he would have liked to do for one thing he wanted a more comfortable bed than the boulders of the streambank sunwarmed though they were i dont know why i shouldnt he replied provokingly after all youve been hurt your head probably aches and im sure you couldnt possibly be interested in she pounced on him and proved that she could most definitely be interested in and he found that the rocks werent as bad as he had thought rune would have laughed at her lover if she hadnt been so certain that she would badly hurt his feelings by doing so now that they were lovers she was perfectly content but he was heading them into brughten despite the fact that there was no faire there and the pickings would be slim because he wanted to find a priest to marry them immediately incredible well there was a priest and a church and the town was at least on the road it wasnt the road they had left this one theyd struck after following the stream for a couple of days rather than backtrack over the elvenkings territory and they might be able to get lodging and food at one of the towns two inns talaysen left her at the marketplace in the center of the town and she was grateful for a chance to find some fresh supplies the storm had washed away or ruined most of their food and they had been living off the land thanks to the fish in the stream and her scant knowledge of forest edibles that had been mostly limited to the fact that cattail roots could be eaten raw knowing what watercress looked like and recognition of some bramblebushes with fruit on them their money hadnt washed away but it was hard to get a squirrel to part with a load of nuts in exchange for a copper penny she had just about completed her final purchase when she turned and caught sight of talaysen striding towards her through the light crowd most people wouldnt have noticed and he was being quite carefully courteous to the other shoppers as he made his way past and around thembut she saw the set jaw and the stiff way that he held his head and knew he was furious whats wrong she whispered as he reached her side he shook his head not here he said quietly and she heard the anger in his voice are you done just a moment she turned back to the old farmwife and quickly counted out the money for another bag of travelers bread without stopping to bargain any further the old woman blinked in surprise but took the coinsit wasnt that much in excess of what the real price should have beenand gave her the coarse string bag full of rounds of bread in exchange all right she said tying the bread to her belt until she got a chance to put it in her pack lets go he led her straight out of town setting a pace that was so fast she had to really stretch her legs to keep up with him until he finally slowed when they were well out of sight of the last of the buildings she tugged at his arm forcing him to slow still further all right she exclaimed catching sight of the rage on his face now that he was no longer having to wear a polite mask what happened i was told by the priest he said tightly that we were vagabonds and tramps he told me that trash such as you and i werent fit to even set foot on sacred ground much less participate in the sacrament of marriage he further told me that if we didnt want him to call the sires watch to have us both pilloried even though you werent even there that wed better take ourselves out of town he took a deep breath and let it out in a long sigh there was a great deal more that he said and i wont repeat it the look on his face alarmed her you didnt do anything to him oh i wanted to throw him into the duck pond on the green talaysen replied and the rage slowly eased out of him but i didnt i did something that was a lot worse he began to smile then and the more he thought about whatever it was that hed done the more he smiled she had a horrified feeling that he had done something that really would get them pilloried and her face must have reflected that because he tossed back his head and laughed oh dont worry i didnt do anything physical but it will be a very long time before he insults another traveling musician he waited the smile still on his face for her to ask the obvious question well what did you do she asked impatiently obliging him i informed him that he had just insulted master bard gwydainand i proved who i was with this he reached into his pocket and extracted the medallion of guild membership that she had only seen on satin ribbons about the necks of the guild masters at the trials this medallion was tarnished and it no longer hung from a bright purple satin ribbon but there was no mistaking it for the genuine article a masters medallion the priest must have been just about ready to have a cat he handed it to her she turned it over and there was his name engraved on it she gave it back to him without a word i dont think it ever occurred to him to question the fact that i had this talaysen continued with satisfaction i mean i could have stolen itbut the fact that i had puffed myself up like the proud young foolish peacock i used to be probably convinced him that it and i were genuine he started gaping like a stranded fish then he went quite purple and tried to apologize and she prompted well i was so angry i didnt even want to be in the same town with him talaysen said with a glance of apology to her i informed him that if he heard a song one day about a priest so vain and so full of pride that he fell into a manurepit because he wouldnt listen to a poor mans warning he would be sure and recognize the description of the priest if he looked into a mirror then i told him that i wouldnt be wedded by him or in his chapel if the high king himself commanded it i shoved him away and i left him on the floor flapping his sleeves at me and still babbling some sort of incoherent nonsense i wouldnt be wedded by a toad like that if it meant id never be wedded she said firmly and if thats the attitude of their priest wed better tell the rest of the free bards that brughten is probably not a good place to stop the priest generally sets the tone for the whole village and if this one hates minstrels he could make a lot of trouble for our folk im sorry though he said still looking guilty i never meant to deprive you of your wedding our wedding and i really dont care my love it gave her such a thrill to be able to say the words my love that she beamed at him and he relaxed a bit i told you before amber showed me a lot of things one of them was that there are plenty of people who have the proper appearance who arent fit to clean a stable and more who that fat priest would pillory who have the best truest hearts in the world she touched his hand and he caught hers in his a delightful shiver ran down her back i dont care you love me i love you and if a ceremony means that much to you well get one of your gypsy friends to wed us it will be just as valid and binding and more meaningful than anything that fat lout could have done she looked up at his green green eyes now shadowed and started to say something morewhen a dark cloud behind his head just at the tree line caught her eye and instead of continuing her reassurance she said whats more we have a bit more to worry about than one stupid priest look there she freed her hand to point and he turned and swore the cloud crept a little more into view how long have we got until that storm hits us she asked motioning to him to turn his back to her so she could free his raincape from the back of his pack then doing the same so he could get hers and stow the bread away so it wouldnt get soaked as quickly as that blew up he handed her the cape with a shake of his head i dont know a couple of hours perhaps would you rather turn back not for a moment she declared id rather have rain id rather be soaked than take shelter in a place that has people in it like that priest lets see how far we can get before it hits us if we spot a place to take shelter along the way no deserted farmhouses he exclaimed she laughed after all if it hadnt been for that farmhouse hed still be avoiding me like a skittish virgin mare no she promised no deserted farmhouses only ones with farmers wives and a dozen children to plague us and make us wish we were back with the elves just as the storm was close enough for them to feel the cold breath of it on their backs talaysen spotted a wooden shrine by the roadside those shrines usually marked the dwelling of a hedgepriest or a hermit a member of one of the religious orders that called for a great deal of solitary meditation and prayer rune had seen it too but after talaysens earlier experience she hadnt been certain she ought to mention it but talaysen headed right up the tiny path from the shrine into the deeper woods and she followed this time at least the trees werent reaching out to snag them in fact the path was quite neatly kept if relatively untraveled thunder growledto their right now rather than behind themand lightning flickered above and to the right of them as the woods darkened and the clouds rolled in overhead she caught a glimpse of the black rainswollen bellies of the clouds and a breath of cold wind snaked through the trees this is going to be another bad one talaysen had gotten a bit ahead of her but abruptly stopped she just about ran into him she peeked around him to see what had made him halt and stared straight into the face of one of the biggest mastiffs she had ever seen in her life the dog was absolutely enormous a huge brindle with a black mask and earsand more teeth than she really wanted to see at such a close range she froze talaysen had already gone absolutely still there was another dog behind the first this one tawnyandblack if anything it looked even bigger the first dog sniffed talaysen over carefully while the second stood guard when it got to his boots rune quietly slipped his knife from the sheathe and pressed it into his hand then drew her own knives werent much against a dog the size of a small pony but if the creature took it into its head to attack knives were better than bare hands the dog raised its head turned and barked three times as its companion watched them to make certain they didnt move it waited a moment then barked again the same pattern but this time there was no denying the impatience in its voice all right all right im coming a voice from the path beyond the dogs called sounding a little out of breath what on earth can you two haveoh a brownrobed man graybrown hair cut in the bowlshaped style favored by some of the orders and a few years older than talaysen came around the turning in the path that had blocked him from their view he stared at them for a moment as if he hadnt expected to see anything like them and stopped at the second dogs rump you great loon he scolded affectionately and the first mastiff lowered its head and wagged his tail its just a couple of musicians i would have thought youd cornered an entire pack of bandits from all the noise you were making the dog wagged its tail and panted grinning talaysen relaxed marginally oh come off you louts the robed man said hauling at the second dogs tail until it turned around and repeating the process with the first one go on be off with you back home idiots the dogs whuffed and licked his hands then obediently padded up the path out of sight the robed man turned to them and held out his hand after first wiping it on his robe to talaysen im father bened he said shaking the hand that talaysen offered in turn vigorously well save other introductions for the cottage he looked up as a particularly spectacular bolt of lightning arced over their heads if youll just follow me i think we might just outrace the rain without any further ado he picked up the skirts of his robes and ran in the same direction the dogs had taken without any regard for dignity talaysen wasnt far behind him and rune was right at talaysens heels they all made the shelter of the cottage barely in time just as they reached the door the first fat drops began falling by the time rune got inside and got her pack and gear off the storm was sending down sheets of water and thumbsized hailstones into the bargain she pushed forward into the room so that the priest could get at the door but things seemed to be a confusion of firelight shadows and human and canine bodies there father bened slammed the door shut on the storm outside and took runes pack away from her stowing it in a little closet next to the door beside talaysens now do come in push those illmannered hounds over and find yourself a bit of room im afraid they take up most of the space until they lie down down you overgrown curs the last was to the dogs who paid no attention to him whatsoever being much too interested in sniffing the newcomers over for a second time in case they had missed some nuance on the first round of sniffs after a great deal of tugging on the dogs collars and exasperated commands which the beasts largely ignored father bened got the mastiffs lying down in what was evidently their proper place curled up in the chimney corner on one side of the hearth together they took up about as much space as a bed so it wasnt too surprising that the father didnt have much in the way of furniture at least in this room just three chairs and a table and cupboards built into the wall father bened busied himself at one of those cupboards bringing out a large cheese half a loaf of bread and a knife he followed that with three plates and knives and a basket of pears very plainly he was setting out supper for all three of them talaysen coughed and father bened looked over at him startled excuse father the bard said but you dont but i do son the priest said with a look of reproach indeed i do youve arrived on my doorstep on the wings of a stormwhat am i to do sit here and eat my dinner and offer you nothing i am not so poor a son of the church as all that or so niggardly a host either while he was speaking he was still bringing things down out of the cupboards a couple of bottles of good cider three mugs and in a bowl a beautiful comb of honey that was so rich and golden it made runes mouth water just to look at it there he said in satisfaction not at all bad i dont think the bread and honey are mine the cheese is locali trade honey for it i can trade the honey for nearly everything that my local friends dont give me here let me toast you some cheesethere is only one toastingfork i fear im not much used to getting visitors there didnt seem to be anything they could do to stop him so rune made herself useful by pouring cider while talaysen cut the bread and cheese the dogs looked up hopefully at the proceedings and rune finally asked if they needed to be fed as well the greedy louts would gladly eat anything that hits the floor and look for more father bened said as he laid a second slab of toasted cheese just beginning to melt on a slice of bread ive fed them but theyll try to convince you otherwise i could feed them a dozen times a day until their eyes were popping out and theyd still try to tell you they were starving what on earth do you feed them talaysen asked staring at the dogs as if fascinated and where did you get them theyre staghounds arent they i thought only sires raised staghounds father bened ducked his head a little and looked guilty wellthe truth is they arent mine really they belong to aaha friend iahkeep them for him he comes by every few days with meat and bones for them the rest of the time i feed them fish or whatever rabbits i canahthat happen to die rune began to get a glimmering of what was going on it was a good thing no one had ever questioned the good father he was a terrible liar and if the meat your friend brings them is deer its just really lucky that he found the dead carcass before it was too gone to be of use hmm she said father bened flushed even redder father bened she said with amusement i do believe that youre a poacher and so is this friend of yours a poacher well now i wouldnt go that far he said indignantly sire thessalay claims more forest land hereabouts than he has any right to ive petitioned the sires and the barons through the church i dont know how many times to have someone come out and have a look but no one ever seems to read my letters my friend and i are simplydoing the work of the church feeding the hungry clothing the naked with venison cony and buckskin and fur talaysen supplied i take it that a lot of the smallholders out here go hungry in the winter else the father nodded soberly when the sire claimed the forest lands he also laid claim to lands that had been used for grazing and for pigherding many of the smallholders lost half their means of support youre free bards arent you at talaysens nod he continued i thought you might be a year ago last winter one of your lot stayed with me for a bit a good man called himself starling if i mind me right i told him a little about our problem he went out with my friend a few times to augment food supplies i know him talaysen replied from a smallholder family himself i thought as much father bened shrugged and laid out the third slice of cheese then wasted no time in digging into his portion rune picked up the bread and nibbled gingerly the cheese was still quite hot and would burn her mouth if she wasnt careful it tasted like goatcheese it was easier to raise goats on marginal land than cattle especially if your grazing lands had been taken from you im citybred myself the father continued when i was a youngster the church was very special to me and i grew up with this vision of what it must be likefull of men and women whod gotten rid of what was bad in them and had their hearts set on god always felt as if the church was calling me went straight into orders as soon as i could he sighed talaysen nodded sympathetically i think the same thing happened to you that happened to my cousin ardis if she had a crisis of conscience yes father bened replied sadly that was when i found out that the church was just like anyplace else just as many bad folk as good and plenty that were indifferent since i hadnt declared for an order yet i traveled a little to see if it was simply that id encountered an unusual situation i came to the conclusion that i hadnt and i almost left the church ardis decided to fight from within talaysen told him she got assigned to the justiciars i decided the same but to work from below not above father bened replied there were more of the bad and indifferent kind when you were in the city in the big cloisters attached to the cathedrals or so it seemed to me so i got myself assigned to the order of saint clive its a mendicant order that tends to wayside shrines i thought that once i was out in the country id be able to do more good why rune asked it seems to me if you were citybred youd have a hard time of it out in the wilds you must have spent all your time trying to keep yourself fed and out of the weather i didnt think of that he admitted and laughed and it was a good thing for me that god takes care of innocent fools my prior took pity on me and assigned me here this cottage was already built and my predecessor had been well taken care of by the locals i simply settled in and took up where hed left off what do you think of the priest in brughten talaysen asked carefully father beneds face darkened father bened can only say that his brother in the church could be a little more charitable he replied carefully but i am told that there is a poacher of rabbits who roams these woods that has called him a thief who preys on widows and orphans a liar and a toady to anyone with a title or a fat purse and the poacher has heard that he goes so far as to deny the sacraments to those he feels are too lowly to afford much of an offering id say the poacher is very perceptive talaysen replied then described his encounter with the brughten priest though not the part where he revealed himself to be gwydain father bened listened sympathetically and shook his head at the end i can only say that such behavior is what i have come to expect of him the priest said but at least i can offer a remedy to your problem friends if all you wanted was to be wedwell i have the authority i dont have even a chapel but if this room will suit you a marsh would suit me better than a cathedral right now rune said firmly and that fat fool in brughten may have joy of his this room will be fine father bened beamed at her at talaysen and even at the dogs who thumped their tails on the floor looked hopefully for a morsel of cheese and panted wonderful he exclaimed do you know youll be my first wedding how exciting here finish your dinner and let me hunt up my book of offices he crammed the last of his bread and cheese into his mouth and jumped up from his chair to rummage through one of the cupboards until he came to a little leathercovered book i should have some contracts in here too if the beetles havent gotten to them he mumbled mostly to himself it seemed ah here they are he emerged with a handful of papers looked them over and found the one he wanted it had been nibbled around the edges but was otherwise intact he placed it on the table next to the cider and leafed through the book here it is wedding he looked up im supposed to give you a great long lecture at this point about the sanctity of marriage and the commitment it means to each of you but you both strike me as very sensible people i dont think you need a lecture from me who doesnt know a thing about women and i dont expect youre doing this because you dont have anything else to do tonight so well skip the lecture shall we and go right into the business certainly talaysen said and took runes hand she nodded and smiled at father bened who smiled back and began well did that suit you talaysen asked as they spread their blankets in father beneds hardly used spare room there was no furniture the light was from one of their own candles and the only sounds were the snores of father beneds mastiffs in the other room and the spattering of rain on the roof practical short to the point and yes it suited me rune replied carefully spreading their blankets to make one larger bed it practically filled the entire room theres a duly signed sheet of parchment in your pack that says were married and the next town we go through well drop the church copy off at the clerks office she stood up and surveyed her work now are you happy talaysen sighed if i told you how happy i was you probably wouldnt believe it rune turned smiled and moved closer to him until there was less than the width of a hair between them so why dont you show me she breathed he did it was a long time before they slept chapter nineteen i cannot believe this talaysen fumed testing the bonds about his wrists and giving the effort up after a few moments a good thing too since they were roped together at the wrists his efforts had been wrenching runes shoulders out of their sockets first the damn guild gets all freelance musicians barred from the last three fairesand now this rune didnt say anything which was just as well there wasnt much she could sayand certainly none of it would have made their guards vanish eased his temper or gotten them free of their bonds there were three major faires up here in the north of the kingdom all within a week of each other the wool faire at naneford the cattle faire at overton and the faire of saint jewel at hynes crossing talaysen had planned to make all of them for all three of them were good places to make contacts for winteringover all three were held within the cathedral grounds inside each cityand at all three when talaysen and rune had tried to gain entrance they had been turned back by guards at the gates church guards even though the faires were supposed to be secular undertakings each guard looked down his nose at them as he explained why they had been barred there were to be no musicians allowed within except those with guild badges that was the beginning and the end of it the guild had petitioned the city council and the church and they had so ruled the council on the grounds that licensing money was being lost the church on the grounds that musicians encouraged revelry and revelry encouraged licentiousness if rune and talaysen wished to play in the streets of the city or within one of the inns they could purchase a busking permit and do so but only guild musicians and their apprentices would be playing inside the faire they found out later that there was no free entertainment in the faires this year anyone who wished to hear music could pay up a copper to listen to apprentices perform within a guild tent or a silver to hear journeymen that was the entertainment by dayanyone who sought music after dark could part with three silvers to listen to a single master at night there were no dancers in the streets or otherwise in fact there was nothing within the faire grounds but commerce and church rituals rune would not have been overly surprised to learn that the guild had even succeeded in banning shepherds from playing to their herds within the faire bounds it was runes private opinion that there would be so many complaints that this particular experiment would be doomed after this year and talaysen agreedbut that didnt help them now talaysen had been angry at the first faire furious at the second and incoherent with rage at the third rune had actually thought that he might brain the third gateguardwho besides his churchhireling uniform had worn guild colors and had been particularly nastywith his own two hands but he had managed to get control of his temper and had walked away without doing the man any damage but by then of course their coinreserve was seriously low and their efforts to find an inn that did not already have a resident musician had been completely without result so rather than risk a worse depletion of their reserves they headed out into the countryside where with judicious use of fishhook and rabbit snare they could at least extend their supplies in a few days they had gotten as far as sire brador joffereys lands and that was where they ran into a trouble they had never anticipated sire brador it seemed was involved in a border dispute with his neighbor sire harlan dettol by the time they entered sire bradors lands the dispute had devolved into warfare under the circumstances strangers were automatically suspect a company of sire bradors menatarms had surrounded them as they campedand rune thanked god that they had not put out any rabbit snaresand took them prisoner with hardly more than a dozen words exchanged a thin and nervouslooking man guarded them now as they sat wrists bound behind their backs and feet hobbled in the shade of an enormous oak at least they gave us that much rune thought wearily they could have been left in the full sun easily enough the sires men were not very happy about the way things were going she had picked that up from listening to some of the conversations going on around them exchanging of insults and stealing or wrecking anything on the disputed land was one thingbut so far six men had been killed in this little enterprise and the common soldiers were rune thought justifiably upset they had signed on with the sire to be guards and deal with banditsand to harass their neighboring sire now and again no one had told them they were going to go to war over a silly piece of land another manatarms approached on heavy feet walking towards them like a clumsy young bull and the nervous fellow perked up rune reckoned that their captivity was at an endor that at least they were going somewhere else good theres pebbles digging into my behind the capn ll see the prisoners now the burly fellow told their guard who heaved a visible sigh of relief and wandered off without any warning at all that left the burly man to stare at them doubtfully as if he wasnt quite certain what to do with them you got t get tyer feet he said tentatively you got t come with me talaysen heaved a sigh of pure exasperation thats going to be a bit difficult on both counts he replied angrily we cant get to our feet because youve got us tied back to back and we cant walk because youve got us hobbled like a couple of horses now unless youre going to do something about that were going to be sitting right here until harvest the man scratched his beard and looked even more uncertain i dont got no authority to do nothin about that he said i just was told i gotta bring you t the capn so you gotta get tyer feet talaysen groaned rune sighed this would be funny if it werent so stupid and if they werent trussed up like a couple pigs on the way to market it might get distinctly unfunny if their guard decided that the application of his boot to their bodies would get them standing up she contemplated her knees rather than antagonize him by staring at him she looked up at the sound of footsteps approaching yet another manatarms neared this one in a tunic and breeches that were of slightly better quality and showing less wear than the other mans never mind hollis said the newcomer i decided to come have a look at them myself he surveyed them with an air of vacant boredom well what do you spies have to say for yourselves spies talaysen barked in sheer outrage spies where in gods sacred name did you get that idea rune fixed the captain if that was what he was with an icy glare since when do spies camp openly beside a road and carry musical instruments she growled dear god the only weapons we have are a couple of dull knives what were we supposed to do with those dig our way into your castle that would only take ten or twenty years im sure the captain looked surprised as if he hadnt expected either of them to talk back to him if all hes caught so far are poor frightened farmers i suppose no one has he blinked at them doubtfully well he said at last if you arent spies then youre conscripts as talaysen stared at him in complete silence he continued looking them over as if they were a pair of sheep youwith the gray hairyoure a bit long in the tooth but the boy there im not a boy rune replied crisply im a woman and im his wife and you can go ahead and conscript me if you want but having me around isnt going to make your men any easier to handle and theyre going to be even harder to handle after i castrate the first man who lays a hand on me the captain blanched but recovered well if youre in disguise as a boy then youre obviously a spy after all its not a disguise talaysen said between clenched teeth its simply easier for my wife to travel in breeches its not her fault you cant tell a woman in breeches from a boy im sure youll find half the women in this area working the fields in breeches are you going to arrest them for spying too the captain bit his lip you must be spies he continued stubbornly otherwise why were you out there on the road youre not peddlers and the faires are over nobody travels that road this time of year were musicians rune said as if she was speaking to a very simple child we are carrying musical instruments we play and sing we were going to kardown faire and your road was the only way to get there how do i know youre really musicians he said suspiciously spies could be carrying musical instruments too he smiled at his own cleverness talaysen cursed under his breath rune caught several references to the fact that brothers and sisters should not marry and more to the inadvisability of intercourse with sheep for this man was surely the lamentable offspring of such an encounter why dont you untie us and give us our instruments and well prove were musicians she said spies wouldnt know how to play now would they isuppose not the captain replied obviously groping after an objection to her logic and unable to find one but i dont know obviously she thought but she smiled charmingly just think youll get a free show as well were really quite good weve played before dukes and barons if you dont trust both of us just cut me loose and let me play not quite a lie im sure there were plenty of dukes and barons who were passing by at kingsford when we were playing what are you up to talaysen hissed as she continued to keep her mouth stretched in that ingenuous smile i have an idea she muttered back out of the corner of her mouth and as the captain continued to ponder she laughed oh come now you arent afraid of one little woman are you that did it he drew his dagger and cut first the hobbles at her ankles then the bonds at her wrists she got up slowly her backside aching her shoulders screaming her hands tingling with unpleasant pinsandneedles sensations she did have an idea if she could work some of the same magic on this stupid lout that shed worked on the elves she might be able to get him to turn them loose shed noticed lately that when they really needed money shed been able to coax it from normally unresponsive crowdsas long as she followed that strange little inner melody shed heard when she had played for the elvenking it was always a variation on whatever she happened to be playing one just a little different from the original the moment she matched with it whatever she needed to have happen would occur she was slowly evolving a theory about it how it wasnt so much that the melody itself was important it was that the melody was how she heard and controlled magic somehow she was tapping magic through music but she couldnt explain that to talaysen or rather she couldnt explain it right now later maybe if this really worked the captain poked their packs with his toe as she stood there rubbing her wrists which one is yours he asked without any real interest that one there she told him why dont you hand me that fiddlethats right that one a spy would never be able to learn to play this it takes years a spy could learn to play a couple of tunes on it the captain said in a sudden burst of completely unexpected thought thats all a spy would need he looked at her triumphantly she sighed took the instrument from him before he dropped it and took it out of its case to tune it a spy could learn a couple of tunes she agreed but a spy wouldnt know them all pick one pick anything i couldnt possibly know what you were going to pick to learn to play it in advance so if i know it then im not a spy all right she saw talaysen wince out of the corner of her eye and she didnt blame him no fiddler could know every tune she was taking a terrible risk with this but it was a calculated risk taken out of experience if hed been a bright man she wouldnt have tried this he might purposefully pick something really obscure hoping to baffle her but he wasnt bright he was in fact the very opposite so he did what any stupid man would do he blurted the first thing that came into his mind which was as she had gambled shepherds hey one of the halfdozen fiddletunes every fiddler wishes he would never have to play again and which someone in every audience asks for she played it thinking very hard about getting him to release them and listening with that inner ear for the first notes of the magic he started tapping his toe halfway through the first repetition a good sign but not quite what she was looking for but his eyes unfocused a bit which meant she might be getting through to him or that he was so dense he could be entranced like a sheep by perfectly ordinary music three times through three times was what had worked with the elves three times had coaxed pennies from otherwise tight fists two repetitionsinto the thirdand there just an echo a faint sigh of melody but it was there she was afraid to play the tune again though repeating it a fourth time might break the magic pick something else she called out to him breaking into his reverie he stared at her with his mouth hanging open for a moment then stammered foxhunter another one of the tunes she had learned to hate while she was still at the hungry bear she sighed if her feelings got in the way of the music this might turn out to be a bad idea instead of a good one but the magic was still with her and stronger as she brought the hey around into the first notes of foxhunter his eyes glazed over again and she began to get the sense of the inner melody stronger and just a little off the variant she played she strove to bring them closer but hadnt quitenot before shed played foxhunter three times as well but this was a subtle slippery magic that she was trying to work she had to get inside him somehow and control the way he thought about them this called for something quieter maybe that was why she hadnt quite managed to touch the magictune yet this time she didnt ask him to pick something she slowed the final bars of foxhunter dragged them out and sent the tune into a minor key and turned the lively jig into something else entirely different a mournful rendition of captive heart that did it the hidden melody strengthened suddenly grew so clear in fact that she glanced at talaysen and was unsurprised to see a look of concentration on his face as if he could hear it too once twiceand on the third repetition something dropped into place and her tune and the magic one united just as the sun touched the horizon she played it to the end then took her bow from the strings and waited to see what if anything the result of her playing was going to be the captain shook himself as if he was waking from a long sleep i musthowi think he shook himself again then drew his knife and cut talaysens bonds offering him a hand to pull the master to his feet i dont know what i was thinking of the captain said vaguely thinking two minstrels like you were spies stupid of course these past couple of weeks theyve been hard on us were looking for spies behind every bush it seems no harm done captain talaysen said heartily as rune put up her fiddle as quickly as she could and slung her pack on her back she dragged his over to his feet and he followed her example still talking no harm done at all good thinking really after all how could you know im sure your sire is very pleased to have a captain like you when talaysen stopped for a moment to get his pack in place rune took over pulling on his elbow to get him moving towards the edge of camp and the road of course how could you know but we obviously are musicians and you dont need to detain us now do you of course not well just be on our way thank you no you neednt send anyone after us well be finewe know exactly where we need to go well be off your sires land before you know it she got talaysen moving and waved goodbye talaysen let her take the lead and wisely kept quiet the other menatarms seeing that their captain was letting the former captives go were content to leave things the way they were one or two of them even waved back as rune and talaysen made all the speed they could without hopefully seeming to do so it wasnt until they were on the open road again that rune heaved a sigh of relief and slowed her pace all right confess talaysen said moving up beside her and speaking quietly out of the corner of his mouth i saw what happened and i thought i heard something how much do you know about magic rune asked interrupting him and gazing anxiously at the darkening sky not much only the little ardis tells me and whats in songs of course he hitched his pack a little higher on his shoulders youre telling me that youre a mage she shook her head slightly then realized he might not be able to see the gesture in the gathering gloom im noti mean i dont know if i am or not i know what happened with the elves but i thought that was just because the elves were easier to affect with music than humans nowi dont know i hear something when im doingwhatever it is and this time i think you heard it too ardis told me every mage has his own way of sensing magic talaysen said thoughtfully some see it as a web of light some as colorpatterns some feel it some taste or smell it maybe a mage who was also a musician would hear it as music he faltered and she added what she thought he was going to say but you heard it too didnt you you heard what i was trying to follow i heard something he replied carefully whether it was the same thing you heard or not i dont know well whatever is going onwhen i really need something to happen i think about it hard and listen inside for a melody at the same time when i find it i try to match it but since its a variation on what ive playing it takes a little bit of time to do that to figure out what the pattern is going to be and it seems like i have to play things in repeats of three to get it to work its the moment that i match with that variation that i seem to be able to influence people but what about with the elves he asked you werent doing any variations then i dont know im only guessing she replied looking to the west through the trees and wondering how long they had before the sun set but what i was playing was all gypsy music or music already associated with the elves like the faerie reel maybe theyre more susceptible to music or maybe the music itself was already the right tune to be magic next midsummer faire we are going to have to talk to your cousin about all thisi dont like doing things and not knowing how or why they work or what they might do if they dont work the way i think they will she was looking at him now peering through the blue twilight and not at the road so she missed spotting the trouble ahead her first inkling of a problem was when talaysens head snapped up and he cursed under his breath well do that if were not languishing in a dungeon talaysen groaned if this isnt the worst run of luck ive ever hadif i hadnt already been expecting the worst she turned her headand echoed his groan of disgust just ahead of them was a roadblock manned by armed soldiers with a banner flapping above them in sire harlans blackandwhite stripes well theres no point in trying to avoid them theyll only chase us talaysen sighed as the soldiers stirred proving that theyd been sighted too god help us here we go again this time lets see if we cant get them to let us prove were minstrels right off rune said thinking quickly ill try and work magic on them again and since you heard what i was trying to follow you join me on this one maybe with both of us working on them we can do better than just get them to let us go all right talaysen replied quietly for they were just close enough to the barricade that a sharpeared man might hear what they were saying follow my lead he raised his arm and waved smiling ho there he called we are certainly glad to see you looks of astonishment on every face told rune that hed certainly managed to confuse them yousir are you the captain he continued pointing at one of the men who seemed to be in charge at the others wary nod talaysens smile broadened thank goodness we have a lot to tell you about ten pennies and quite a little stock of provisions and an escort to the border talaysen said in satisfaction patting the pouch at his belt not bad for what started out a disaster maybe our luck is turning maybe were turning it ourselves rune countered but lazily she was not going to argue about results however they came about a good nights sleep in the sires camp had helped matters theyd done so well that theyd become honored guests by the time they were through playing instead of captives and while sire harlan was not interested in taking on a musician until his little feud with his neighbor had been settled he did know about the banning of nonguild minstrels from the previous three faires when they had played for him personally he spent quite some time talking with them afterwards over a cup of wine he had assured them that a similar attempt at kardown had been blocked did you hear the rest of the story about the faires talaysen asked i asked captain nours about it and got an earful she shook her head no i wasnt close enough to listen and that terribly earnest cousin of the sire was pouring his lifestory into my ear thats what you get for being sympathetic he chuckled and kicked at a rock to keep from stepping on it it wasnt just the bardic guild all the guilds got together and barred nonguild participants sire harlans captain is also a woodcarver and hes heard that if they try the same again next year the nonguild craftspeople have threatened to hold their own fairesoutside the gates and just off the road which means no church tax or city tax on sellers as well as an open faire she widened her eyes can they do that she asked i dont know why not he replied one of the farmers has agreed to let them use his fallow fields for free for the first year that may be how the kingsford faire started i seem to recall something like thatthe church putting a ban on entertainment or levying an extra usetax i can tell you that most common folk would rather go to an open faire given a choice anyway he asked me to spread that bit of news as well so that the small crafters are ready come next year she nodded stowing the information away in her memory that was another thing the free bards did that she hadnt known they passed news wherever they went often it was news that those in power would prefer others didnt know ordinary minstrels might or might not impart news as the whim and the generosity of their audience moved them bardic guild musicians never did so in a way we are spies she reflected only not in a way that sheepbrained captain would ever recognize arent we going to meet gwyna at kardown she asked suddenly squinting into the sunlight and taking off her hat to fan herself with it that was the plan he replied why oh nothing she replied vaguely she hadnt thought about the coming encounter until the association of news brought it to mind she and talaysen were news so far as the free bards were concerned when they had parted from the free bards she and talaysen had been master and apprentice now their relationship was something altogether different gwyna planned a course of travel that put her in and out of contact with a good half of the free bards over the year not to mention all the gypsy clans she would be the one telling everyone she met of master wrens change of status and if she didnt approve rune realized then that she wanted not only gwyna to approve but all the rest of the free bards including people she didnt even know yet and not just for her own sake if there was divisiveness in the free bards trouble with talaysens leadership the things she and talaysen had talked about would never come to pass the group might even fall apart we will never make a difference if that happens she thought worriedly and then realized with a start that for the first time in her life she was thinking of herself as a part of a group worrying about we where we meant people shed never met as well as those she knew and liked it was a curious feeling having been a loner most of her life to suddenly find herself a part of something if gwyna didnt approve of what had happened between her and talaysen then she mentally took herself by the scruff of the neck and shook herself of course shell approve she scolded she was practically throwing us into bed together before we all broke up im running from shadows that arent even there the fact that were married shouldnt make any kind of a difference to her she told me herself that talaysen spent too much time alone she noticed that talaysen was watching her with a concerned frown and smiled at him its all right no disasters just thinking things through she said cheerfully tell me something do you think we were working magic last night or not he hesitated a moment taking the time to wipe some of the dust from his face with his scarf i never thought of myself as a mage or anything like one he said finally even though everything ive ever really wanted ive gotten now that i think about it that is rather odd i dont know of anyone who always gets what he wants or needs i always thought it was plain fool luck but maybe it wasnt just extraordinary good luck maybe it was magic all along your cousins a mage she pointed out id always been told that sort of thing runs in families thats the way it is in ballads anyway that might explain it he paused a moment and rune had an idea that he was gathering his thoughts last night i told you that i heard the melody you were trying to match the first time we were caught you wanted me to see if i could actually match it myself when we were wooing sire harlans men and i said id try and we didnt have a chance to talk about what i did in private well i heard the melody just like before and i tried to match it easier on a lute than a fiddle by the way she nodded and you did it i felt you snap into the melody at the end of the first time through and the tune got stronger as we played it which was probably why they asked us to stay and play for them why the men gave us supplies and why the sire gave us money and an escort i think its also why the sire talked to us personally he said she raised an eyebrow in surprise and he nodded when we played for his men he was listening just beyond the fire i didnt see him but somehow i knew he was there and i knew we needed his goodwill i saw you were doing all right with the men so i turned my attention to him i hoped i could get him to help us out the captain was pretty reluctant to exceed his authority he frowned as if thinking of something unpleasant id say it worked she replied wondering why he was frowning thats the trouble it did and too well his frown deepened and he tucked his scarf around his neck again he talked to us very like equals he gave us money and an escort he shouldnt have done any of those things its just not in the character of most sires to welcome strangers into their camps and treat them like old friends what i did somehow made him act completely differently maybe not she countered he was camped out there with his men after all and hes obviously liked as well as respected maybe he would have done all that anyway maybe hes used to treating underlings well maybe he just likes music maybe but its not likely he shook his head but thats not the point the problem here isnt what he did its that i made him do it i made him do those things just as surely as if id held a knife to his throat and ordered him to tell us the same things even though it kept us out of trouble i dont like the implications being able to change the way people think and react iswell its frightening she started to object then shut her mouth thinking about it it was frightening and she found many reasons why what she was doing was wrong can ardis do that she asked he nodded that and other things healing for one mostly she doesnt use her magic i think she told me that she uses it only whenafter very careful considerationshe thinks its just and fair to do so and not simply convenient how would i feel about somebody coming in and changing my thinking around she wondered was it just and fair of us to keep those menatarms from throwing us in a dungeon or conscripting us she countered i certainly think it was they wouldnt listen to reason or logic and i was running out of patience he grinned id have to say yes and you know it he mocked thats a cheating question would it have been just and fair to get that priest to marry us she continued now that is a good question he mulled that over for a bit i would have to say no even though he was being an officious uncharitable vain and foolish man why not she asked wanting to hear his reasoning it would not have been just and fair to change his mind because we were only inconvenienced on the other hand if those menatarms had jailed or conscripted us we would undoubtedly have been harmed he smiled feebly i dont do well in damp dungeons and i wouldnt know one end of a sword from the other in the former id probably become ill rather quickly and as a conscript id probably become dead just as quickly obviously the same goes for the elvenking she replied thoughtfully he nodded elves arent predictable he might have kept us a while or killed us when he tired of us now whether or not we should have used this power of ours to change the minds of people at those faires to let us ini dont know its not worth debating she told him as a jay overhead called raucous agreement we couldnt have done anything to help ourselves or others at the last three faires because the people we needed to influence directly were not going to come out to listen to us true but we could have started a riot he said so soberly that she knew he was not joking all wed have needed to do would be stand outside the church gates and sing rabblerousing songs with that power behind them people were annoyed enough already especially the ones being turned away we could quite easily have started a riot without anyone suspecting we were to blame the morning seemed suddenly cold and she shivered shed never seen a riot she didnt want to see one people could be killed in riots children often were trampled and either killed outright or maimed for life we dont do that she said forcefully we dont ever do that i agree he replied just as forcefully it would have to be something worlds away more serious than what we encountered to make starting a riot justified she paused to collect her thoughts you do realize that were talking about this as if its real and not the product of some really good luck and our imaginations dont you i dont have any doubt that its real he told her weve managed to change things three times with thiswhatever it is when something happens three times its not a coincidence its real its more times than that she thought wryly remembering how she had coaxed money from unresponsive audiences and then she sobered thinking about what shed done in a new light had that been fair and just after all she hadnt done anything important to them had she they wouldnt have parted with their coins if they hadnt had them to spend would they yes but she had still changed their thoughts the most private thing a person could have the poorest person in the world the man accused of heresy and thrown into the churchs dungeons a cripple who couldnt move arms or legsthey could still claim their thoughts as their own and in that much they were wealthy and free but what she and talaysen did could change that not in any large way but it was still a change and for what convenience again the convenience perhaps of not working quite so hard never mind that finding that elusive thread of magicsong and matching it was harder work than simply playing well she had to assume that one day it might become easy what then wouldnt it be a temptation to simply sit back and play indifferently knowing that she would be wellpaid no matter how she played she thought of all the cold days in the winter busking on a corner in nolton and had to admit that it would have been more than a temptation if shed known about this shed have done it and shed have probably teased her audiences into buying hot cider and sausage rolls from her vendor friends as well whether the listeners were hungry or not no that was wrong absolutely wrong it was a cheat and it made her music into a lie we dont use it to make audiences like us either she said into the silence with more force than she intended they either appreciate us on their own or not at all he raised an eyebrow at her outburst but agreed immediately what do we have then not for the sake of convenience not when there are other ways to deal with a situation only when its fair and just she nodded and sighed you know i hate to admit this but it sounds as if were saying we cant use it to help ourselves at all he laughed oh partially we cant use it unless were really being threatened shall we say or its for something that truly needs to be done that sounds good she glanced at him and couldnt help grinning now does threat of hunger count i dont or how about if i wait until youre hungry to ask that question she said and chuckled he only shook his head women he said as if that explained everything and then changed the subject just like a man she thought with amusement and let him chapter twenty the kardown faire lasted only three days it wasnt a very large faire but because it was a woolmarket faire it tended to be a wealthy one they found gwyna waiting for them at the bare excuse for a gate in the sketchy fence surrounding the faire on the town common she had already found a good camping site screened on three sides by bushes and trees and claimed it for all three of them rune was happy to see her a real friendly face a known face was a luxury shed missed without realizing it three days were just enough time for them to recoup some of their lossesand barely time for gwyna to finish telling them the news of her adventures and those of the other free bards shed met with rune noticed something a little odd about gwynas behavior from the first though it was nothing having to do with either her or talaysen gwyna would keep glancing about nervously when she thought she was alone and no longer bantered with strangers and whenever she saw someone in a long robe she became very very quiet they had stayed together as a trio during the entire faire gwyna had been delighted to hear of the wedding much to runes relief but that wasnt why they stayed as a group their primary consideration was that gwyna no longer seemed quite so fearlessly selfreliant which accounted for the odd behavior rune had noticed her misadventure with the magepriest had shaken her more than she would admit to anyone even rune but rune saw it in the way she constantly looked over her shoulder for trouble even when there was no reason to and in her troubled dreams at night gypsy robin had gotten a bad shock and she hadnt recovered from it yet shed parted with master stork about a week after the midsummer faire and it looked to rune as if she hadnt had a steady night of sleep since talaysen told her he thought gwyna must be sleeping with one eye open and rune figured he was probably right gwyna played at being lighthearted still but her jesting often fell flat her spirits were dampened and she seemed to be certain that there was danger lurking just out of sight especially at night not that rune blamed her but she was carrying more knives now and openly something that had the potential for serious problems if she felt herself threatened if someone propositioned her in a way she thought was dangerous in her state of heightened nerves she might well draw on himand use what she drew at the end of the third day gwyna went off to bring back water for their little camp leaving rune cleaning vegetables and talaysen setting the fire alone together for the first time that day she decided to broach what had been on her mind since shed seen the state gwyna was in is it going to be any harder to find a winteringover spot for a trio than it is for a duet she asked he looked up from the fire no i dont think so he said are you thinking what im thinking rune nodded we cant let her go out there by herself until she gets over her nerves shell either wear herself out or hurt someone or herself he sat back on his heels i hadnt wanted to ask you because it meanswell he blushed we wont have our privacy lecher she said and grinned oh we can have our privacy we just ask her to take a long walk seriously though we ought to invite her you ought to invite her to what gwyna asked lightly as she rounded the corner of the halfshelter theyd erected coming into their little protective circle of trees we thought you ought to come with us for a while talaysen said wed like your company weve missed you and gwyna replied setting down the canvas bucket in the hole theyd dug to hold it youre not inviting me because of my sparkling conversation and you two have got quite enough companionship on your own thanks you look awful rune said frankly i told wren that i thought it was because youre trying to stay up all night on guard and we could use a third to split the watches with its hard enough sleeping at night with two you never get a full nights sleep going watchonwatch and if you both fall asleep well you take your chances three can keep watches and still have time for a decent nights sleep true gwyna replied thoughtfully twining a strand of her hair around one finger theres a lot of unrest out in the countryside i know theres been more feuds lately they say its because the high king is getting old and hes not keeping the twenty kings in line what difference does that rune began then made the connection herself oh the twenty kings are busy trying to compete to be high king and ignoring the barons and dukes and theyre playing their own power games and ignoring the sires who are now free to take up their feuds again talaysen finished it all comes down to the bottom eventually that means us who end up having to deal with bandits on the road bandits who are there because the sires arent hunting them down he grimaced the church should be taking a hand here but they wont other things come down to the common folk too gwyna said i havent seen any more bandits but thats because i dont travel the main roads some of the others have run into trouble though and it seems to me to be more this year than last she sat in thought for a while her skirts spread in a colorful puddle around her ill tell you what ill stick with you until the first snow if you havent found a winteringup place for all three of us by then well go thirds on a wagon and join one of my family caravans will that suit you talaysen nodded and rune heaved a silent sigh of relief gwyna could be so touchy when she thought someone was trying to protect her but this time she needed protection she was a lot younger than she looked sounded or acted gypsy children tended to grow up very quickly but that didnt mean she was as mature as she appeared a shock like shed gotten could unseat the reason of someone talaysens age gwyna needed time to find her balance again that solves our problem pretty neatly rune offered with absolute truth after getting shut out of three faires we were wondering if we were going to have even a chance at finding a winter position so if we dont she shruggedthen we dont and weve got an alternate plan well good then gwyna replied relaxing glad to be able to help and dont worry about my getting underfoot too much ill find lots of reasons to take long walks and some of them may even be genuine she winked and rune blushed glad that the sunset color hid the red flush of her cheeks are we leaving tomorrow morning early or late late talaysen said all the heavy wagons and the herds are moving out at dawn and id rather wait until theyre well on their way its easier for us to pass them on the road than it is to get around the tangle when they leave he grimaced and the drivers are a little less the unusual sound of the clopping of hooves coming towards their campsite made him look up from his fire who or what could that be rune shrugged and looked over to gwyna who also shrugged odd its plainly someone with beasts what can he want with us a weathered old man a horsetrader by the harnessbits attached to his jacket came around the corner of the halfshelter he led a pair of sturdy ponymules of the kind that the gypsies used to pull their wagons and carry their goods and stopped just as he reached conversational distance the beasts stopped obediently behind him and one nuzzled him and blew into his hair be you a minstrel called rune he asked looking directly at her rune nodded in surprise can ye name me yer ma and yer village the old man continued my mother is stara who last worked in the hungry bear inn thats in my old village of westhaven she replied politely this had the sound of someone trying to identify her for some reason possibly a letter from amber but why send it via a horsetrader an who would ye says yer best friend there the man persisted though just as politely as she thats an easy one she said i only had one good friend when i left jib the horseboy then ye be the rune i be lookin fer the man doffed his hat and grinned yon jibs the lad i took on as mpartner this spring an damn if he aint done better nor any on us had reason t think he sens ye these liddle lads by wayo thanks he says he proffered the leadreins and rune rose to take them stunned with surprise he says yes a right nuff lass an ye know how t take care of a beasti mind ye got a gyppo there by ye though he nodded towards gwyna who nodded back there aint none born can take care f a horse like a gyppo sos ye make suren lissen t the lady eh ill do that rune promised solemnly too stunned to say anything else these are vargians right aye the man replied an good lads too i wouldna let em go t none but a gyppo or a friend or friend athe lad hes a good lad jib is that he is rune replied faintly this was a little too much to take in all at once one of the best in the world aye well i seen ye an yer man an yer fren here at faire an ye got all th right friends the man told her so serious in his frankness that she couldnt even think of him as being rude free bards eh free bards an gyppos yere the best folks on th road so ill tell jib i caught up wi ye an give his presents an ill tell im yere doin right well hell be happy fer ye he turned to go and rune stopped him for a moment with one hand on his leather sleeve how is he really she asked anxiously is he all right is he happy the man smiled slowly like the sun coming out from behind a cloud i reckon he chuckled oh i reckon hed say hes all right though since hes set on weddin m girl an i know her temper i dunno how all right hell stay stilltheyll be settlin down i spect her mam had same temper an we never kilt each other enough sos yed notice like as not yell catch em both at midsummer next year and with that he put his hat carefully back on his head and walked back down the road in the darkness leaving rune staring after him with the mules reins still in her hands well that solves one big problem gwyna said breaking the silence and i know where we can get a wagon cheap if youre willing to stay over a day while we get it refitted i know ive got a third shares worth of coin how about you two oh we have it talaysen replied as rune broke out of her stunned state and came over to the fire for a couple pieces of wood for tethers and some rope for hobbles and draft beasts are always the expensive part of fitting up a wagon am i right gwyna nodded then rose and came over to look at the new acquisitions she patted them down expertly running her hands over their legs checking their feet then opening their mouths to have as good a look as she could with only firelight to aid her a little old for a horsemule but middleaged for ones out of a pony she said giving them both a final pat and turning to help rune stake them out to graze especially for this breed just like rune said theyre vargians theyll live thirty useful years and probably die in harness and they can eat very nearly anything a goat can eat hard to tell without pushing them but their wind seems sound i know their legs are and he hasnt been doctoring them to make them look good the same one that had blown into the old mans hair nuzzled her theyre gentle enough even for you to handle master wren she laughed as if at some private joke and talaysen flushed here let me see what theyre called she nudged the mules head around so she could read the letters stamped on his halter in the flickering firelight this lad is socks evidently andshe squinted at the second halterthe other is tam good short names easy to yell she left the mules who applied themselves to grass with stolid singlemindedness i like your choice of friends lady lark she concluded its nice to have friends who know when you might need a mule the mules were a gift that impinged perilously on too good to be true and talaysen pummeled his brain ceaselessly to reassure himself that neither he nor rune had worked any of their magic to get them finally he slept conscience appeased they had not been anywhere near the animalsellers there had been no way that the old man could have heard them sing and been inadvertently magicked into giving them a pair of beasts the mules were therefore exactly what they appeared to be repayment of runes generosity to her old friend when rune had explained what shed done gwyna had questioned her about the amount of money shed sent the boy and gwyna had nodded knowingly thats the rightsize return on a gift like that she had pronounced when rune worried aloud that she had bankrupted the boy truly he didnt send you horses nor young mules he didnt include any harness but the halters if his years been as good as the old man says thats about right and hell still have profit rune had been even more concerned how the old man had found them since there was no wayshe had thoughtfor jib to find out where she was shed been afraid the gift might have been some machination of the guild in disguise but gwyna and talaysen had both been able to put her mind at ease on that score it was the gypsies of course rune had sent her gift with them they in turn knew all the news of the free bards and would have known as soon as rune had joined them when jib wanted to find her he would likely have turned to the gypsies who had brought him the money in the first place sooner or later he would have found someone whod been at midsummer and who would have known the general direction of the free bards travels and by extension what faires rune and talaysen were planning on going to then it was just a matter for the old man of planning his selling trip to try intercepting them at one or more of those faires with everyones fears eased all three of them slept soundly in fact it was the rattle of the mules halters the next morning that awoke them as the beasts tried in vain to reach grass outside the circles theyd eaten bare rune took them down to the well to water them while talaysen and gwyna set off in search of a wagon many gypsies settled in kardown for it was on the edge of the treeless rolling plains of the arden downs the soil was thin and rocky too hard to farm but it made excellent pasturage and most of the folk hereabouts depended on the sheep that were grazed out there most households had a little flock and the most prosperous had herds of several hundred there was always work for someone good with animals and when gypsies chose to settle they often became hired shepherds such a life enabled them to assuage their urge to wander in the summer but gave them a snug little home to retire to when the winter winds roared and the sheep were brought back into the fold because of that there were often gypsy wagons for sale here gwyna obviously a gypsy and fluent in their secret language was able to make contact with one of the resident families as soon as they reached the marketplace from there it was a matter of tracking down who had wagons for sale who had wagons they were keeping but might be induced to part with and where they were they had looked at three so far the first two were much too small fit only for two or one and a fair amount of trade goods the third was a little too old and rickety gwyna clucked her tongue over it and told its owner that hed waited a bit long to sell it hed have to spend a lot of time fixing it up now before it was roadworthy again the owner agreed and said with a sigh that hed not been truly certain he wanted to settle until this summer they traded road stories for a bit then moved on to the fourth and last this lad will take a bit of persuading i think gwyna said as they approached the cottage he came off the road because his wife wanted to settle a bit though he didnt that means the wife will be on our side if she can get him to part with the wagon it means shell not have to fret about him taking the bit in his teeth packing them all up and rolling out without so much as a do you think we should or a word of warning thus armed talaysen set about charming the lady of the house while gwyna tackled the man he was very young to have come off the road a halfdozen children playing in the yard told talaysen why the wife had wanted to settle two children in a wagon werent bad but a mob like this would strain the seams of even the largest wagons hed seen he couldnt hear what gwyna was telling the man a very handsome gypsy with long immaculately kept black locks and a drooping mustache of which he seemed very proud he didnt make much of an effort to overhear either she was giving the young man some advice from a womans point of view he thought the gypsies believed in the right of a woman to make her own decisions and she was probably telling him that if he decided to pack up and take to the road again he might well find himself doing so alone whatever it was she told him it had the desired effect he agreedreluctantly but agreedto show them the wagon and sell it if it was what they wanted he kept it in a shed in the rear of his cottage and unlike the wagon that had been kept out in the garden it was easy to see that the owner of this rig had been serious about his desire to return to the road one day the bright red and yellow paint was fresh and shiny every bit of brightwork from the twin lamps at the front to the single lamp over the window at the rear was polished until it gleamed like gold the leather of the seat had been kept oiled and the wheels were in perfect repair not a spoke missing right away talaysen knew that it was the kind of wagon they needed this was a twobeast rig and provided the ponymules could pull it they would have the strength of both at their service with a onebeast rig the mule not in harness would have to be tethered to the rear it was possible to switch them off to keep them fresh but a dreadful nuisance to harness and unharness in the middle of the day but when the young man pushed the rig out talaysen knew that without a shadow of a doubtif the mules were up to itthis was exactly what theyd been looking for it slept four two in one bed at the rear and two in narrow single bunks along the sides that doubled as seating there was ample storage for twice what they carried the harness was coiled neatly in the box built beneath the righthand bunk there was even a tiny kitchen arrangement that could be used in foul weather and a charcoal stove to keep it warm in the winter can the little mules pull it he asked gwyna and her fellow gypsy she looked over at the man vargians she said he nodded no problem its built light lighter than it looks he showed them by pushing it forward by himself i had vargians the harness is already rigged for them then he sighed and made mournful eyes at his wife who did her best to hide her smile of triumph looks like the lady meant this rig for you id best resign myself to being off the road till the little ones are marriagehigh gwyna then began some spirited bargaining that ended with them shaking hands and most of talaysens money joining hers the wife looked even happier at that which made him guess that she had some plans for the unexpected windfall bring the mules here and ill harness her and you can drive her over the man said looking less resigned and more content by the moment that eased talaysens mind quite a bit he would never have willingly deprived someone of a cherished dream however impractical it was they returned to camp and gwyna took charge of the mules leaving talaysen and rune to divide the chores of breaking camp there wasnt much to do since theyd be reloading everything into the wagon and shortly after they were finished burying the little garbage theyd produced in the firepit covering it with the ashes and putting the frame of the halfshelter over it all gwyna appeared driving the wagon up the road with the mules moving briskly and looking altogether content to be in harness it was a matter of moments to load the wagon and stow everything talaysen was amazed at how pleased and proprietary he felt now what he asked gwyna now we drive back to town leave the wagon at a stable for safekeeping and go up to the market to buy what we need oil for cooking oil for the lamps harnessmending kit salt and fodder for the mules she looked over at rune hmm flour salt honey some vegetables that keep well spices a couple of pots and a frying pan runes brow wrinkled as she thought featherbeds if were going to winter over in there charcoal for the stove a bit of milk cider oh a freshwater keg there doesnt seem to be one currycomb brush and hoofpick i think thats it that sounds about right gwyna agreed if i can get some eggs id like to talaysen grinned completely at sea in this barrage of domesticity and perfectly content a chicken he said suddenly bacon the bacon will keep fairly well sausage and cheese he tried to remember what the family horses had needed oh blankets for both mules theyll need them in the winter good gwyna nodded now the big question have we enough money for all that they put their heads and their resources together and decided that they didif they skipped the bacon and chicken and bargained well split up rune asked gwyna shook her head better stay together master wren try and look pinchpursed and disapproving as if everything were buying is a luxury he set his face obediently in a scowl and she chuckled thatll do rune well take turns when we get into a sticky spot the other one will jump in and say hes cheating you or something like that good and look like the vendors a thief exactly gwyna surveyed the marketplace well shall we attack the market wasnt as large as some but it was held every day rather than just one day a week talaysen found his part altogether easy and watched the women bargain with the stallkeepers like a couple of seasoned housewives at the vegetable stall rune leaned over and pointed out the discolored places caused by insects that might hide softspots or larvae and gave the poor man a glare as if hed put them there himself he capitulated immediately the cheesemaker was a fellow gypsy and so came in only for some goodnatured bantering the miller was condescending and the women bent their entire attention on him and to both his and talaysens amazement actually caught him cheating with sacks with gravel weighting the bottom when they threatened to expose him there and then he gave them their flour they then went back to the cheesemaker and betrayed his secret gwyna grinned nastily as they went on to the charcoalmaker he wont be able to get away with that anymore she said i suspect the only reason hes gotten by this long is because he only pulls that trick on strangers but short measures against the law and he knows it he could be pilloried for that she looked well content once we get the charcoal well have everything we need i think it was at just that moment that talaysen felt ghostly fingers on his pouch he reached back quick as a striking snake and caught a wrist a bony wrist he pulled on it hauling the owner forward before he could bolt the owner made not a sound as talaysen dragged himfor it was a hearound to the front of them what rune said in surprise then nodded so someone who didnt do well at the faire hmm caught a lightfingers gwyna asked mildly she crossed her arms and stared at the boy who dropped his gaze to his bare dirty feet you should know better than to try that game with a gypsy sirrah we invented that game the thief was a lot older than talaysen had expected roughly runes or gwynas age undersized though for his age he didnt top gwyna by more than an inch the bones under talaysens hand were sharp the bones of the face prominent threequarters starved and filthy with an expression of sullen resignation he made no effort whatsoever to escape talaysen shook him a little have you anything to say for yourself before i turn you over to the constables he asked there was a flash of fear in the boys face as he looked up but then he dropped his eyes again and simply shook his head he doesnt look much like a thief does he rune mused at least not a good thief i thought they tended to look a bit more prosperous gwyna tilted her head to one side and considered the boy youre right he doesnt he looks to me like someone whos desperate enough to try anything including picking a pocket but he doesnt look much like a real thief talaysen thought privately that what the boy looked like was badblood and bone but he held his peace though no stranger would know it gwyna had already warmed to this ragman i dont think you should turn him over to anyone rune continued the boy looked up quickly surprise then apprehension flashing over his face before he dropped his eyes again talaysen sighed i dont think we should turn him over to anyone either gwyna put in she reached over and shook the boys shoulder here youif we feed you and give you a chance to clean up will you promise not to run off until weve talked to you he looked up again and the expression of bewildered gratitude made talaysen abruptly revise his opinion that was not the expression of a bad youngsterit was more along the lines of a beaten dog who has just been patted instead of whipped maybe there was something worth looking into with this boy after all the boy nodded violently and talaysen released the hold he had on the boys wrist the youngster rubbed it a little but made no move to escape even though he probably could have gotten away in the crowd here gwyna said shoving her load of packages at him he took them automatically his eyes widening with surprise as he staggered beneath the weight make yourself useful and carry these for me come along the boy followed her with complete docility or perhaps he was just stunned if he was about gwynas age he might not be too eager to run away at this point older men than he had been stunned by gwyna on a fairly regular basis talaysen smiled a little there was a method to gwynas seeming foolishness with that much burdening him he couldnt rununless he dropped the entire load he was effectively hobbled and if he dropped the packages theyd know he was going to run they finished their purchases and returned to the wagon the youngster handed his packages up to rune to be stowed away and lookedlongingly talaysen thoughtat the ponymules gwyna looked the boy up and down critically youll never fit master wrens clothes nor mine she said rune do you have a pair of breeches and a shirt i can borrow his clothing wont be fit to wear without a lot of cleaning and maybe not then if you dont mind that theyre not that far from the ragbin themselves rune replied doubtfully gwyna snorted its better than what hes wearing now talaysen thought he detected a flushof embarrassmentunder the layer of dirt coating the young mans face he still hasnt spoken a word i wonder why with clean clothes in one hand and the boy in the other gwyna marched him off to the stream that had been serving for their bathing pool hed either bathe or gwyna would hold him down and wash him herself talaysen knew that look he wouldnt have bet on the master of the bardic guild against gwyna when she wore that look and maybe this young man will give her something to think about besides her fear for a little while anyway despite gwynas determination talaysen wasnt entirely certain that theyd see the lad again on the other hand he hadnt been acting as if he was going to run off so talaysen led the horses and wagon to their old campsite and waited for gwyna to reappear with her charge or without him she returned with himand cleaned up he looked a great deal better than talaysen had expected some of the sullenness proved to be nothing more than dirt here lad the bard said weve got time to eat before we go i think he cut the boy a chunk of bread and cheese and poured him a mug of water presenting him with both as soon as the pair reached the wagon the boy didnt snatch at the food as talaysen would have expected from his starved appearance instead he took it politely with a little bow and ate it slowly and carefully rather than bolting it which was something of a relief in talaysens experience food bolted by someone in the boys condition tended to come right back up again all right talaysen said as the young man finished the last crumb of his meal the ladies here seem to have taken a liking to you i suspect they want me to invite you to come along with us for a bit on the other hand you did try to lift my purse so what do you have to say for yourself im ssssorry ssssir the young man stammered i was sssstarving i ddddidnt knknknow whwhwhat else ttttto dddo the stutter severe as it was seemed to be something habitual rather than feigned or out of fear the youngster was obviously forcing the words out and having a hard time of it he was red with effort and embarrassment by the time hed completed the simple sentence talaysen wanted to ask him more but he was at a loss of how to get any information from the youngster without a similar struggle then he noticed that the lads attention wasnt on him but on something in the wagon he turned to see what it wasbut the only thing in sight was gwynas threeoctave harp the one she could only play while seated she rarely took it out unless they were somewhere that it wouldnt be moved much shed been about to cover it for the trip in its oiledcanvas case but during the packing it had been wedged between the side bunk and their packs for safekeeping do you play lad talaysen asked the young man nodded vigorously without prompting gwyna climbed up into the wagon and handed the harp down he sat right down on a stone with it cradled in his arms placed it reverently on the ground and began to play talaysen had heard many masters play in his time but this young man was as good on the harp as rune was on her fiddle and this was an original composition it had to be talaysen knew most of the harp repertory and this piece wasnt in it so the boy could compose as well as play the young mans face relaxed as he lost himself in the music and his expression took on the otherworldly quality seen in statues of angels in repose he was as gently attractive as he had been sullenly unattractive when talaysen caught him talaysen felt something else as well the undercurrent of melody he associated with magic the young man made no effort to match it but it harmonized with what he was playing and talaysen found himself being lulled into a meditative trance perhaps he hasnt learned to match it because he doesnt know he canbut the power is there and so is the heart oh yes the power was there indeed he shook off the lulling effect of the music to glance over at runejust in time to intercept her glance at him he inclined his head toward the young man she nodded she hears it too insofar as music went this boy was a bard in everything but name now who is he where is he from and how in heavens name did he get that way chapter twentyone talaysen reflected that it was a good thing that the wagon slept four they looked to have acquired a second apprentice after hearing the young man play there was no way that talaysen was going to let him wander off on his own again even if he hadnt been determined in that direction the ladies were so they packed everything down for travel and he and the boy went into the back while gwyna handled the reins and rune watched and learned remember speak slowly he told the ladno not the lad the youngster had a name jonny brede he was going to have to remember that a personable lad thin and wiry with a heartshaped face and an unruly tangle of wavy brown hair his eyes were the most attractive feature he had probably because he tried to do most of his speaking with them rather than expose himself to ridicule that stutterthe youngster must have gotten a lot of cruel teasing over it speak very slowly take your time im in no hurry and neither are you so take all the time you need strange lying here at ease on a bed instead of trudging down the dusty road very strange but obviously much more comfortable though he knew why he hadnt done this long ago and it had nothing to do with money he knew very little about the care of horses and nothing about harnessing or drivingall of his knowledge was of riding and hunting that didnt serve to tell him what to do with these stout little draftbeasts how often should they be rested for instance and how on earth did one manage two sets of reins what did one do if they didnt want to get between the shafts of the wagon rune and gwyna took up the bench seat in front with their backs to the interior although they could hear everything he and jonny said rune evidently knew enough about mules from her days at the inn that she was a logical candidate for secondary driver he and jonny took their ease back in the wagon itself tell me the earliest thing you remember he said staring at the bottom of a cupboard just over his head like the rest of the interior of the wagon it was of brown wood polished to a high gloss jonny shook his head his hands knotting and unknotting in his lap dont you remember being very small talaysen prompted do you recall schoolmates siblings tutors or priests a birthday party perhaps jonny shook his head even harder nnno he replied nnnothing like that jusjust being sick for a long llong time and mmmy mmmaster start with that then talaysen told him slowly dont force the words out think of speech as a song you wouldnt rush the cadence i was rrreal sick jonny said thoughtfully fever i wwwas hot all the time i was seeing things tttoo men ffffighting buildings bbburning pppeople yelling he bit his lip thththen i was at kkkingsford and mmmaster was taking care of me master who mmmaster dddarian the young man replied promptly interesting that was a name talaysen knew largely because master darians arrival had caused such a fuss master darian wasnt rightly at kingsford at all he was from the guild in birnam he should have gone there to retire not to our kingdom talaysen remembered the minor stir that had caused master darian halfsenile demanding to be allowed to lodge in the great guildhall at kingsford claiming outrageous things that his life was in danger that there were assassins looking for him how had that ended up there had been something about a usurper yes he had it now there had been a palace uprising with the king of birnam deposed by his brother and a lot of the usual civil unrest that followed such a coup darian had been one of the kings bardsa position that did not normally make one a target for assassins the guild had decided that old master darian might have seen a thing a two that had proved too much for his mind and voted to permit him to stay instead of forcing him back to a place where he was afraid to go had there been a boy with him an apprentice talaysen couldnt remember wait there had been and the boy had been sick with a marshfever that was it and that was another reason why the guild had decided to let the master stay by the time theyd reached kingsford the boy had been in a bad way it seemed too cruel even to the normally callous guild bards to turn them out for the boy to die on the road hmm if hed been at kingsford one of the mages might have healed him of it ardis would know he made a mental note to write to her and ask so you were ill and when you finally got well you were in kingsford what then mmmaster darian took care of mmme and when he got sick i tttook care of him the chin came up and the big brown eyes looked defiantly into his thththey said he was mmmad he wwwasnt he jjjust had trouble remembering yes and that was why they had permitted him to keep the apprentice even though the boy probably wasnt learning anything from the old man he took care of his master and that had freed up a servant to run attendance on other masters as long as he didnt get in the way the rest of the members of the guild ignored him talaysen recalled now thinking that he ought to do something about the boy himself teach him perhaps but then other things had gotten in the way and hed forgotten all about it by the time he left the guild in a rage thththey left us alone until mmmaster died thththen they said i had tttto lllleave the stutter got worse as he grew more distressed why talaysen asked bbbecause i dddidnt have a mmmaster any mmmore he said his eyes dark with anguish and thththey ssssaid it wwwasnt wwworth wwwasting tttime on a hahahalfwit talaysens fists clenched and he forced himself to relax them the bastards the lazy bastards a stutter is curableand even if it wasnt most people dont stutter when they sing and they knew it but this poor child had no one to speak for him and he was a foreigner so out he went jonny you are not a halfwit he said quietly but forcefully whoever told you that was an idiot the guild masters were too lazy to train you and too foolish to see your worth so they got rid of you and told you that to keep you from trying to get your rights he thought quickly about all he knew of guild law you came to kingsford as an acknowledged apprentice you had a right to another master when yours died you could have gone to any other guild in kingsford and gotten help to enforce that rightbut the bardic guild masters told you that you were a halfwit to prevent you from claiming that right thththey did jonnys eyes cleared a little i would bet fair coin on it its just the kind of thing they would do he kept a tight hold on his temper this was all in the past nothing could be done about it nowexcept to rectify what the guild had done himself bbbut they sssaid i cccouldnt sssing or wrwrwrite mmmusic he objected and i ccccant jonny when did anyone ever teach you to do those things talaysen asked gently those are skills not things that you absorb just by being around bards ask rune shell tell you two years rune replied leaning back into the wagon so she could be heard it took me two years to learn those things and several different masters you see talaysens lips tightened now if you really want to know what i think was going onits simple the bardic guild is full of lazy selfcentered fools they saw you had no master you werent important to anyone and in fact no one in this country even knew you were here so they decided you were too much trouble and sent you out the door jonny nodded slowly his own hands clenched at his sides knotted into tight little whiteknuckled fists then what did you do talaysen prompted after you left i wwworked at whwhwhatever i cccould whwhwhen the faire came i wwworked the faire animals mmmostly animals lllike me talaysen could well imagine how the inarticulate lad had sought refuge in caring for creatures who didnt demand speech of him how did you get from kingsford to the kardown faire he asked hhhiring fairs the lad said simply gggot jjobs all over had a jjjob with a herder bbbrought me here bbbut he sold his gggoats and he dddidnt need me and the mmman that bbbought them had his own hhhherders hiring fairs that made sense hiring fairs were held in the spring and the fall mostly for the benefit of farmers looking for hands or servants sometimes other folk would come looking for skilled or unskilled laborersand talaysen had heard of fairs that even had mercenaries for hire the problem was the unskilled labor jobs seldom lasted more than a season as jonny had undoubtedly learned so that got you to the downs when abbbbout two wwweeks agggo he said sighing heavily was all right ddduring faire bbbut there wasnt nothing fffor me after gwyna laughed without humor true when the kardown faire is over the town pretty much dries up unless youre an experienced hand with sheep shepherds classed as skilled labor not unskilled and the only person that might be trusted to come on without experience is a gypsy and i take it youve always applied as unskilled talaysen asked the young man and youve never learned a trade he shook his head dumbly gggot nnno one he whispered and nnnothing nnno gggood for anything i wwwas hhhungry and i sssaw you bbbuying thththings i thththought you wwwouldnt mmmiss a cccopper or tttwo you play the harp the way you just did and you say that talaysen replied indignantly the young mans mouth opened and closed as he tried to say something talaysen held up a hand silencing him you listen to me he said fiercely youre among friends now the guild bards may be fools but the free bards arent i dont ever want to hear you say that you arent good for anything not ever again is that understood the young man had scooted back on the bunk as far as the limited space would permit when talaysen began the tirade with wide eyes he nodded his agreement both gwyna and rune had turned around and their eyes carried a message to him that was childs play to read not that he minded since hed already made his decision about this young man all right talaysen said as much to them as to jonny youre a free bard now well undertake to do for you what the guild should have you in turn will have to abide by our rules no theft no troublemaking no lawbreaking treat us the way you would treat your family when we play together its share and share alike no holding anything back for yourself abide by those and well teach you everything we know take you with us with chores and profits shared alike will that do for a moment talaysen feared the young man might burst into tears but instead he pulled himself up looked each of them straight in the eyes and said with only a trace of a stammer yyes sir that wwill do yyou have my wword on it hell need an instrument gwyna said from the front bench her attention seeming to be entirely on the team he can use my harp until we get him his ownunless i find one i like better this time talaysen distinctly saw him blink away tears before replying ththank you he said very much ill teach you lute since we have two talaysen continued in fact if it wont bother the drivers i can begin now it wont bother the drivers rune assured him and were making splendid time well be just outside abbeydown at sunset thats about two hours from now which is more than enough time for a first lute lesson she turned and grinned and wriggled her fingers as i should know go ahead and use mine the young man looked completely overwhelmed and paralyzed with indecision unable to think of what to say or do next talaysen solved his problem for him stripping runes lute of its case and putting it into his hands now he said positioning jonnys fingers this is an amajor chord three more days brought them to ralenvale and the saint brisa faire technically this was the first of the harvest faires that took place during the autumn months since it featured all of the traditional harvest faire activities there were competitions in vegetables livestock and farm activities like tossing hay contests in baking preserving and handicrafts there were races for anything that ran from humans to ungelded stallions most of the trade here dealt with farm livestock from chickens to enormous draft horses the nobly born siresunless they thought of themselves as gentlemen farmersseldom attended saint brisas but their stewards and seneschals did it was barely possible that the quartet could find their winteringover position through them since this was the end of summer few people wished to call it a harvest faire winter was too close now and no one wanted to be reminded of that to reinforce that there was a tradition that if anyone had the poor taste to refer to saint brisas as a harvest faire winter would arrive six weeks early talaysen had no idea if that was true or not he was looking forward to it as a chance to meet up with some of gwynas kin most especially he wanted to speak with peregrine a gypsy horsetrader who had a reputation as a mage and was reputed to deal regularly with elves because they were here every year in such numbers the gypsies had their own traditional camp for this faire outside the faire palisade and on one side of a springfed pool the other side was where most folk watered their beasts but it was said that the spring was hauntedsome said by the spirit of a jilted shepherdand no one would camp there except the gypsies and their free bard friends there was already a substantial group in place when they drove their new wagon up the trail towards the camp enthusiastic greetings met them when their identity was established and gypsies swarmed towards them but when gwyna stood up on the wagonseat and announced to the entire camp that rune and talaysen were vanderiein the gypsy tongue weddedthe greetings turned into an impromptu wedding celebration in fact for one moment talaysen was afraid theyd all demand that the pair wed again just so the entire gathering could witness it talaysen was just glad that they no longer had to worry about setting up a camp for they would have had no chance to do so a swirl of adolescents descended on the surprised ponymules and had them unharnessed rubbed down and picketed with the rest of the campbeasts before the poor mules knew what had happened the wagon was parked in the outermost circle pulled there by a dozen gypsy men amid the cheers of the rest and the entire party was carried off to the great fire in the center of the camp where food and drink of every description was pressed upon them as soon as they settled into seats around the fire more gypsies broke out instruments and struck up a dancing tune even jonny found himself seized upon and greeted with the same wild enthusiasm as the others for all that he was a stranger to them talaysen was afraid at first that he might bolt for the wagon to hide or even worse just run away but he didnt he stayed and even though talaysen saw his eyes were wide with surprise tinged with apprehension he managed a tremulous smile the gypsiesparticularly the girlswere chattering at him like so many magpies half in their own language and half in the common tongue most of it completely unintelligible talaysen thought about interfering then hung back waiting to see how jonny would handle it the young man was going to have to learn to deal with crowds of strangers some time far better that it be a friendly crowd jonny let the group carry him along let them press food and drink into his hands and sat where they put him still with that shy little smile that was slowly slowly warming he didnt speaknot surprising since he was still painfully embarrassed by his stutterbut he let his eyes speak for him and for the gypsies that was enough hell do talaysen decided and turned his attention to his own greetingparty as they tried to press enough food and drink on him for five men later when the party had quieted down talaysen excused himself from the circle of musicians that had claimed him and went wandering over the camp peregrine was here hed found out that much but he hadnt appeared at the fire or at the dancing as darkness fell then again talaysen hadnt expected him although he was a superb dancer peregrine seldom displayed his talent to such a large circle there was no point in looking for peregrine hed learned long ago that peregrine would permit himself to be found when peregrine was ready so it didnt much surprise him to find the gypsy appear discretely at his elbow as he exchanged greetings with the clan chief how goes your journeying my brother peregrine asked when the amenities had been attended to and he turned to greet the gypsy who some claimed was a mage the gypsy looked much the same as always ageless lean face muscular body of a born fighter or dancer bright black eyes and long flowing black hair without a single strand of gray talaysen raised an eyebrow something is going on here peregrine has never called me brother beforeonly old friend strangely he supplied how strangely the gypsy asked leading him to a pair of stools in the relative privacy of the shadow of his wagon he took one talaysen settled on the other from here they could see most of the camp but because of the shadow most of the camp could not see them i have heard a new music he replied following the gypsy way of circling around a subject for a while before plunging in no gypsy ever came straight to the point on any serious subject if he had come out and asked peregrine about magic the gypsy would assume he wanted to talk about something else entirely small wonder those who did not know them found the gypsies infuriating to speak to music of what sort peregrine returned patient as a falcon waitingon as they moved their stools to get a better view of the camp music that is not heard by the ears talaysen stated calmly music that sings to the thoughts unheard and sometimes unnoticed music that follows its own melody and not that of the musician peregrine was very quiet for a moment music that causes things to happen perhaps or so it seems music that the musician must match his own song to yes talaysen offered only that one word answer peregrine sat in silence again in silence offering bread and sausage in silence pouring wine it was talaysens turn to be patient while the offering of food and drink was a kind of ritual of hospitality with most gypsies he sensed that this time it represented something more an offering of fellowship perhaps i have waited for you to come into your power my brother he said when the food was accepted and eaten and the wine drunk that was the meaning of my greeting i have long known that you and a handful of others among the free bards were among the drukkerarejekthe mages of musicas i am the sign of the power is without mistaking to one trainedas is the sign that a mage has come into his power and nowthere is much that i must tell you and little time to do it in talaysens pulse quickened so this is magic that i have touched talaysen would have said more but peregrine hushed him and the bard subsided into silence it is magic indeed it is the magic that the bards and the elves both use and there is one here who would speak to you peregrine waved his hand in an unobtrusive signal and a shrouded shadow detached itself from the back of the wagon to approach them and resolve itself into a twolegged creature enveloped from head to toe in a hooded cape talaysen had not seen anyone there nor had he noticed anyone move there while he and peregrine were speaking he restrained himself from starting with surprise only with great effort the figure pulled back the hood of its cape to show that it was maleand elven now talaysen started his hand going briefly to the hilt of his knife before dropping away he trusted peregrine the gypsy had apparently invited the elf here and besides if the elf truly wanted talaysen dead the knife would be of little use against him striking him down where he sat would be childs play for an elven mage stars light your path he said instead the solemn elven mouth lifted in a slight smile and the elf moved a few steps closer i see you have courtesy when you choose mortal the elf came within arms length of them then examined talaysen as if the darkness and dim firelight was more than enough for him to see by maybe it is elves were popularly supposed to have enhanced senses of hearing and sight i have courtesy when i am not constrained against my will and when i am an invited guest instead of being considered a superior type of pet he replied boldly we mortals have a saying like begets like that holds true with manners as well as livestock peregrine bit off a bark of a laugh and the elf nodded his smile now ironic i warned you not to match wits with a full bard the gypsy mocked and this one most of all not just because of his training as a bard which makes of words a weapon talaysen dares to speak only the truthwhich makes his speech bite all the sharper when he chooses to make it so peregrines feral smile gleamed whitely in the darkness he has fangs this one i would not care to match either wits or magic against this one new and raw as he is to his power the elf replied with complete seriousness not at all affected by the gypsys derisive speech then he turned back to talaysen listen for i bear word for you from our high king he knows what occurred and you need not anticipate reprisals to master wren he says think not to be caged for that has been forbidden to lady lark he says courage is rewarded and he sends these tokens the elf held out a pair of slender silver bracelets that gleamed in the firelight with a liquid sheen so perfect it looked like the still surface of a pond place these upon your wrists they shall close never to be removed but fear not they are meant to mark you as mortals with the high kings favor now the elf smiled a wry smile that mimicked peregrines there shall be no more dances with lightning peregrine laughed at that in a way that made talaysen think that hed heard at least part of the story the elf raised an eyebrow at him knowingly talaysen reached out gingerly and took the cool silver bracelets sliding one over his hand and as promised once around his wrist it shrank to fit comfortably the metal band becoming just a fraction thicker in the process his stomach felt a little queasy watching itthis was the first time hed ever seen magic close at hand magic that affected the material world there would be no removing this token without first removing his hand thank you he said to the elf and meant it we have enemies enough without angering the fair ones oh you angered only a greedy hothead with no thought but his own pleasure the elf replied offhandedly he got his own desert and that speedily that it was delivered by a mere mortal simply humiliated him beyond bearing there were those in his own court who thought he had gone too far when he took you and were certain of it when he set the storm upon you the high king has cooled his temper i promise you still i thank you talaysen replied then added with a rueful grin is it now safe to cross a faerie ring even by accident the elf laughed aloud safe enough een by accident he said with polite invitations tendered to you once you are within it to play for a brief evening your fame has traveled from hill to hill and i think you should expect such invitations in the future there will be many who wish to see the mortal bards that could subdue king meraiel and more who will wish to hear your side of the tale and with no warning and only those parting words he swirled his cloak about his shoulders and stepped into the shadows to melt into them and vanish completely as talaysen had not seen him arrive so he had no idea how the elf leftalthough he thought he heard a faint whisper of music as the shadows swallowed him peregrine sighed and shook his head melodramatic as ever he commented trust an elf to make a great show of simple leavetaking talaysen chuckled and relaxed a bit more was that what you wished to show me and speak to me about he asked i must admit that alone was worth being here for he glanced over his shoulder at the nowempty shadows at the tail of the wagon i havent said anything to the others but the fact is ive been uneasy about camping outside of settled lands ever since that particular incident occurred this little trinkethe tapped the bracelettakes a tremendous load off my mind peregrine sobered in part but only in part i must speak to you of magic of the usage and taming some of what i tell you you may not understand for yearsbut it is all important and i must ask you to pay close attention and grave it deeply in your excellent memory if all goes as we wish i may be able to continue to teach you for years to come but if fate rules against us this may be all the instruction you will ever receive i would give you as much as you can hold planning for that talaysen nodded and quickly put himself into the little halftrance he used when he memorized lyrics in a foreign tongue everything he heard would be remembered regardless of whether or not he understood it good peregrine took a deep breath and held his hands out a soft blue glow played over them and talaysen heard a faint flutelike song somewhere deep inside of him this is the way of the inner path the hidden power the way of magic and nowit begins rune watched gwyna out of the corner of her eye and grinned there was no doubt about it gypsy robin was well and truly smitten with their new charge even though she might not know it yet she didnt act a great deal differently in fact it wasnt likely that anyone else noticed but she paid no attention to anyone else in the camp and when over the course of the evening several young men came up to her and whispered invitations in her ear she declined them all with a shake of the head that was not normal gwyna had a reputation as a lusty lover that rivaled any of the male free bards and rune had never heard of her declining all invitations for dalliance before and especially not when several of those she declined had been her lovers in the past but she didnt leave the firelit circle with anyone not even for an hour and she stayed with jonny who smiled much and said little he was doing very well now that he had begun to relax the gypsies paid no heed to his stutter which was putting him at ease he had begun to laugh at the jokes and look up from his knees occasionally gwyna was praising his melodic ability just now which made him blush over the past two days he had set melodies to several of robins lyrics that were easily the equal of any of the younger free bards efforts oh but its true she said to his mumbled disclaimer the words come easily to me but melody never you have the hardest part jonny bbut i ccannot find wwords he replied earnestly i am jjust nnot clecleclecleclecleclecleoh dddamn his face twisted up and rune started to get to her feet afraid that such a blatant exposure of his stutter would send him fleeing to solitude but he stayed as the silence deepened and the gypsies held their breaths sensing how precarious his moment of courage was he stared at his fists which were balled up on his knees and rune hoped that it was not because he was about to go silent again finally he looked up from his clenched fists and managed a feeble smile dddamn it he repeated ssstupid ssstutter clecleclei sssound lllike a kkkestrel a relieved laugh answered his feeble joke and giorgio one of the largest of the clan slapped him lightly on the back with a care to his thin body and small stature then you have named yourself my friend he boomed master kestrel you shall be and never disparage the kestrel for he is bolder for his size than even the goshawk brave enough to take on enemies that would make a meal of him if they could brave enough even to attack the human who comes too near his nest giorgio raised his mug of wine to master kestrel he shouted the rest followed his lead to master kestrel they replied rune shouting just as loudly as the rest and when she had drained her mug in the toast and looked again jonnys eyes were shining and he no longer stared at his hands later gwyna even coaxed him out of his seat to dance with her by then gwynas other suitors had noticed her interest in the young musician and had turned their attentions elsewhere rune couldnt help wondering at that point if gwyna herself realized what had happened to her she finally decided that the gypsy probably hadnt recognized the symptoms of a condition she had caused so often in others gwyna had been heartwhole until now enjoying her companions the way she enjoyed a round of good music or a dance the oldest game of man and maid had been a sport to her and nothing more i dont think its a sport anymore rune thought with amusement i wonder how long its going to take her to notice that her outlooks changed in the past few days the music dance and talespinning continued on long into the night until the stars had swung halfway around in their nightly dance and the moon had set at moonset the gypsies and free bards began to trickle away to tents and wagons singly in pairs and in family groups with sleeping children draped like sacks over their parents backs just as rune started to yawn and wonder where talaysen was he appeared at her side and sat down beside her where have you been she askedcuriously rather than with any hint of accusation you said you were going to talk to peregrine and then no one knew where you were i thought the earth had swallowed you up it almost did he replied rubbing his temple with one hand as if his head ached she saw a gleam of silver in the firelight and caught at the wrist of that hand he was wearing a silver bracelet that fit so closely to his wrist that it might have been fitted to him yet which had no visible catch where did you get that from peregrine she asked fascinated by the trinket its really lovelybut i thought you didnt wear jewelry i usually dont here he slipped an identical bracelet over her hand before she could pull away and she muffled an exclamation as it shrank before her eyes to fit her wrist just as tightly as talaysens fit his he put his lips to her ear a gift from the high king of the elves his messenger says that it marks us as under his protection she blinked as a thousand possible meanings for protection occurred to her is that good or bad she whispered back i dont think im interested in another visit under a hill like the last one according to the messenger these are supposed to keep visits like that within polite boundaries by invitation and of reasonable duration she lifted an eyebrow at talaysen and he shrugged peregrine said that the messengers word was good and hes been dealing with elves for longer than we have id be inclined to trust his judgment all right she replied still dubious but willing to take his word for it so what else have you been doing besides collecting bits of jewelry that are likely to get us condemned by the church as elfloving heretics he chuckled and put his arms around her drawing her close to him so that her back nestled against his chest and they could both watch the dancing nothing much really just learning things that would get us condemned by the church as renegade mages she restrained herself from jumping to her feet with a startled exclamation i hope youre going to explain that she said carefully since i assume it has something to do with that music weve both been playing with peregrine is a mage it seems that we are too he told me that hed identified the fact that weve come into our power by something he saw when we showed up at camp then he gave me a very quick course in the bardic use of magic most of which i havent sorted out yet he sighed and his breath stirred her hair its all in my head though i expect well get it figured out a bit at a time i think im relieved she replied after a moment to ponder it all and turn the implications over in her mind i dont think its a good idea to go wandering all over the countryside playing about with magic without even knowing the first thing about it thats almost exactly what peregrine said word for word talaysen chuckled he gave me quite a little lecture on the bracelet tightened painfully around runes wrist and she gasped her first thought was that the elvenmade object was trying to cut her hand offbut then it released the pressure on her wrist just as quickly as it had clamped down and talaysen released her he sat up quickly and scanned the area outside the fire theres someone out there someone using offensive magic he said in a low urgent voice peregrine told me that these bracelets being magic would react to magic offensive magic she repeated but what is it i dont see anything going onhow do we know its being used against us or even against the camp he hushed her absently we dont he said unhelpfully but peregrine will know we might not be seeing anything because whoever it is may be using something to watch us or to try and identify someone peregrine has all kinds of tricks and traps around this campand whoever it is will trip one of them sooner or a cry of anguish from behind them interrupted him and rune turned just in time to see a pillar of flame twice the height of a man rise up from the shore of the pond a moment later she realized that it wasnt a pillar of flameit was a man standing bolt upright transfixed in agony burning like a pitchcovered torch she turned away her stomach heaving just in time to hear peregrine shouting in the gypsy tongue of which she only knew a few words she couldnt make out what he was saying but the warning was clear enough she flattened herself to the ground instinctively and just in time for an arrow sang out of the darkness buzzing wasplike past her ear and thocking into the wood of a wagon just where jonny had been sitting a moment before two more followed it both obviously aimed at jonny before the gypsies got over their shock and counterattacked she had no weapons to hand and no idea of where the enemy was so rune stayed right where she was as angry gypsies men and women both boiled out of the camp they headed for the place where the arrows had come from ignoring the man who was still burning he had fallen and was no longer moving the gypsies parted about the grisly bonfire as if his presence was inconsequential they spread out over the area around the pond with torches in one hand and knives at the ready but after an agonizingly long time it still didnt look as if they were finding anything rune got slowly to her feet and made her way over to where jonny and gwyna had taken shelter behind a logseat are you all right she asked jonny who nodded his eyes wide and blank with fear how about you she said to gwyna the gypsy sat up slowly her mouth set in a grim line ive been better but im not hurt she replied what in the name of the lady was that i dont know rune told heras movement caught her eye and she saw peregrine striding towards her something shiny clutched in one hand and a long knife in the other but i have the feeling were about to find out and that we wont like it when we do peregrine sat back against the wooden wall of the wagon his face impassive this was no accident rune snorted and gave peregrine one of her most effective glares why heavens peregrine i thought assassins with magic amulets always hung around outside of farm faires looking for random targets the gypsy met her look with one of unruffled calm all right gwyna said irritably we know it wasnt an accident and i dont think anyones going to doubt that jonny was the target now why whos behind this and why are they picking on a simple musician a lad with a stutter who wasnt even a good thief talaysen shook his head and sighed all five of them were huddled inside peregrines wagon one of the largest rune had ever seen so big it had to be pulled by a team of four horses the windows had been blocked with wooden shutters and the only way at them was through the door at the front guarded by peregrines fierce lurcherhounds and still rune kept feeling her neck crawl as if there was someone creeping up behind her jonny shivered inside one of peregrines blankets a glass of hot brandy inside of him his eyes telling them what his tongue couldnt that he was frightenedthat was easy to understand they were all frightened but jonny was terrified so petrified with fear that he balanced on a very thin rope of sanity with an abyss on either side of him peregrine watched jonny with an unfathomable expression and the rest of them watched peregrine as the silence thickened finally the gypsy cleared his throat making them all jump nervously the secret to all of this ishim he said stabbing a finger at jonny this is not the first such attack is it boy jonny started and shrank backbut as peregrine stared at him he shook his head slowly and it will not be the last two of the men got away they will return rune didnt know why peregrine was so certain of that but it didnt seem wise to argue with him soyoung kestrel it comes down to you you are the target of men who are very expensive to hire and you say that you do not know the reason peregrine rubbed his upper lip thoughtfully yet there must be one and before we can decide what to do about this we must discover it gwyna obviously could stand no more of this well she demanded waspishly are you going to stop playing the great mage and tell us how were going to do this peregrine turned his luminous black eyes on her and she shrank back i am he said slowly but it is a path that will require courage and cooperation from one who has no reason to trust me he turned his gaze back to jonny that one is you he said are you willing to place your mind and soul in my hands tell me kestrel are you as brave as your namesake are you willing to face your pasta past so fearful that you no longer remember it jonny stared at him and rune wondered if peregrine had snapped that last link he had with a sane world chapter twentytwo talaysen touched jonnys forehead and his closed eyelids didnt even flutter he held the young mans wrist for a moment and found a pulse slow but steady he had seen ardis work this spell before but never for this effect for her the sleeptrance was an end not a means he wondered if ardis knew of this application to search the patients memory even finding things he had forced himself to forget i think hes ready he said to peregrine as ready as hes ever likely to be oh he is ready the gypsy replied what he may not be prepared for is his own fear i hope in the days you have been with him that you have taught him trust to go with that fear else all is lost peregrine leaned forward and tapped the young mans forehead three times right between the eyes kestrel he rumbled do you hear me i hear you jonny whisperedwithout so much as a hint of a stammer out of the corner of his eye talaysen saw both gwyna and rune start with surprise you will answer my questions the one you know as master wren will also ask you questions and you must answer him as well do you trust him peregrines brow furrowed as he waited for an answer i do jonny said his voice a bit stronger good you have placed your trust well he and i will not do anything to harm you and we will keep you safe from harm we will be with you even though you cannot see us you will believe this i believe this jonny affirmed peregrine gestured curtly ask he said you know more of this than i and you know more of the world that spawns those who hire assassins than any gypsy i would not know what questions are meaningful and what without meaning talaysen leaned into the tiny circle of light cast on jonnys face by the lantern peregrine had used to place him in a trance jonnykestreldo you hear me yes the young man sighed i want you to remember the first day you came to kingsford to the guild hall can you remember that yes jonnys forehead wrinkled and his voice took on the petulant quality of a sick child im cold my head hurts my eyes hurt master darian says im going to get better but i dont and i feel awful he relives this peregrine said with a bit of surprise this is useful but it can be dangerous if he believes himself trapped in his past have a care master wren talaysen swallowed and wet his dry lips jonny can you remember farther back go back in time go back to before you entered kingsford can you remember before you were sick abruptly the young man began to scream peregrine moved as quickly as a ferret clamping his right hand over the young mans forehead and his left on jonnys wrist the screaming stopped as if cut off who are you peregrine said with no inflection in his voice whatsoever who are you talaysen thought bewildered what kind of a question is that ii cant jonny bucked and twisted in peregrines grip the mage held fast and repeated the question with more force the young musician wept in terrortalaysen had heard that sort of weeping before from the boys that had been ruined by their guild masters peregrine had no more pity than they had but his harshness was for a far better cause who are you ah jonny panted like a frightened bird iiahsional im sional i have to run please let me go master darian master darian theyre killing my father help me ahhhhhhhhh sleep peregrine snapped and abruptly the young man went limp the mage sat back on the bunk and wiped sweat from his brow he looked to talaysen as if he had been running for a league he was silent for a moment staring at the young musician as if he had never seen him before so peregrine took a sip of water from the mug safely stored in a holder mounted on the wall just above him so we know this jonny brede is nothing of the kind and that his true name is sional and that someone wished his father dead do you know of any sionals especially ones who would have run to a guild bard for help talaysen shook his head rune and gwyna both shrugged peregrine scratched his head and his eyes unfocused for a moment well whoever he is he is importantand long ago someone killed his father i think we must find out who and what this father was are you going to hurt him gwyna asked in a small voice peregrine shook his head i can promise nothing i can only say i will try not to hurt him the alternative is to find out nothingand one day there will be nothing to warn him of the assassin in the dark i think this the lesser of two bad choices gwyna nodded unhappily peregrine touched jonnyssionalsforehead again sional do you hear me ihear you said a small young and very frightened voice it sounded nothing like jonny it sounded like a young child of about twelve how old was he when he came to you at the guild peregrine asked talaysen the bard furrowed his brow and tried to remember what the nondescript child had looked like on the few occasions he had seen the boy the memory was fuzzy at best and the child had been quite ordinary twelve thirteen he shook his head he cant have been much younger than that or id have noticed thirteen is just about as young as apprentices are allowed to be in bardic guild children younger than that are just thatchildren they arent ready for the kind of intensive study we give them their bodies and minds arent suited for sitting in one place for hours at a time good that gives me a safer place to start he raised his voice again sionalyou are ten years old it is your birthday you are waking up in the morning abruptly all the tenseness poured out of sionals body and a happy smile transformed his face good a safe time and a happy one peregrine muttered sional what is to happen today today i get my first horse sionals voice really did sound like a tenyearolds and talaysen started in surprise its my birthday present from father a real horse not a pony victor and i get to go to the palace stables and pick it out too victors going to teach me trick riding then master darian will give me the present from mother that hes been saving for me its a harp a big harp with lots more strings than my little harp why isnt your mother giving it to you peregrine asked curiosity creeping into his voice shes dead sional said matteroffactly she died when we moved to this place that was a long time ago though i hardly remember her at all just the way she sang his voice faltered a moment she was a wonderful musician and master darian says that if she hadnt been a woman and a princess shed have been a bard and stop peregrine glanced over at talaysen with one eyebrow raised talaysen didnt have to ask what he was thinking a princess is that realor just a childs fantasy and an old teachers flattery sional who is your father peregrine asked slowly and carefully the king once again the voice was completely matteroffact i have to call him my lord father master darian calls him your majesty everybody else has to call him your royal highness but i dont see him very often stop peregrine was sweating again sional where do you live in the dowagers palace no i mean what land do you live in oh that birnam its the red place on the map the green one next to it is leband the blue one is falwane the yellow one is stop now talaysen was sweating do realize what we have here he whispered this is the crown prince of birnamnothe king of birnam he groped for runes hand and held it tell me the gypsy demanded tell me what you know of this i have to think talaysen replied shivering despite the heat of the wagon dear god what a cockatrice they had hatched their foundling was the rightful king of birnamand small wonder there were assassins seeking him the current king was not likely to tolerate any rivals to his power about six years ago i think it was the king of birnam was overthrown by his brother mind you the only reason i know about this is was because i was on the guild council at the time and we were dealing with that entire business of master darian the old man came to us with a boy he called his apprentice claiming sanctuary with our branch of the guild because he was supposedly in danger as a supporter of the former king so your understanding is likely to be accurate if sketchy peregrine asked he nodded we did do some checking with the guild in birnam the way i heard it the brother slipped his men into the palace by night murdered the king and all his supporters and by dawn there was a new king on the throne and all the bloodstains had been politely cleaned away peregrine snorted howtidy of them talaysen shrugged at that point i imagine that there was nothing anyone could do darian swore to the guild that hed escaped death at the hands of the assassins as one of the old kings retainersand he swore that both the king and his only child were dead obviously that wasnt true obviously peregrine said with heavy irony well our kestrel has turned into a most peculiar cuckoo what are we to do with him it is plain that his uncle knows that he is alive and where he is or we would not have killers at our wagons cant we hide him gwyna asked but her voice betrayed her own doubt peregrine confirmed that doubt with a shake of his head not possible he said the amulet i found upon the man my trap took was one of seeking no matter how or where we hid him in this land they could find him with another such he himself has confirmed that there have been attempts to slay him before this talaysen remained silent as gwyna and peregrine discussed other possibilities concealing the young man with magic or even asking the elves to take him under one of their hills that was chancy what the elves took they might not want to give back once theyd heard young sional play he had the glimmering of an idea then it had occurred to him that there was too much they didnt know and the only place to learn that information was in birnam so why not go there after all why would the current king ever look for sional in his own kingdom the assassins could comb all of rayden from border to borderbut if the object of their search was in the last place they expected him we dont know nearly enough he said into an opportune silence we dont know if this is an idea of the kings or if its something one of his advisors thought was best we dont even know if this is something set in motion long ago and forgotten this king may be a tyrantthere may already be a movement in place to topple him that only lacks a focus it seems to me that jonnyi mean sionalought at least to find these things out until he does no matter where he goes or how he runs hell be running away from something not to something peregrine raised his eyebrows thoughtfully a good point my brother he acknowledged and there are things about the young man now that the assassins cannot know unless i miss my guess they have associated him with you but only at a distance and as a chancemet set of friends they would be looking for a group of three men and a womannot two couples rune has been in breeches most of the time yes rune shrugged its habit mostly she said but yes and most men dont look twice at me in breeches they assume im a boy so now you wear skirts and become most extravagantly feminine master wren we shall dye your hair as black as mine but with magery so that the dye neither grows out nor washes out peregrine grinned and if i ever wished to be a rich man i would sell the working of that spell eh it is a pity it only is effective on one who is already a mage so well have two young gypsy couples traveling together good talaysen played that over in his head and found no flaw with it most wagons look alike to outsiders once were on the road therell be no telling us from dozens of others without one of those amulets those have to be expensive im sure not every hired killer has one and if you leave by darkness tomorrow we can make certain you are not followed peregrine told him now what of the kestrel do i wake him with his memories or no with them gwyna put in quickly peregrine turned to stare at her if i was in his place thats what i would want she said defensively while he still thinks hes jonny brede he doesnt know why these people want to kill him as sional he will it seems to me that makes them less frightening talaysen nodded i agree with her fear is worse when you dont know what it is youre afraid of right now these people are simply faceless irrational attackers from a nightmare once he has his memories and identity as sional back they arent faceless anymore and they have a reason for what theyre doing peregrine nodded slowly very well let me see if i can do this he has built him a very stout wall between himself and those memories it may take some doing to breech it when they showed no sign of moving he coughed delicately i have no need of you now and this were better done in private they took the hint and left crawling over the drivers seat and the lurcherhounds draped over and on top of it and down to the ground again now what gwyna asked we go back to our wagon and sleep talaysen told her and rune both rune nodded gwyna looked rebellious look we cant help peregrine and were all tired we need sleep we already know the worst and nothing we do or dont do in the next few hours is going to change it so so we sleep gwyna sighed though personally i dont think im going to be able to do anything but stare into the dark gwyna had been wrong of course despite their tension all three of them fell deeply asleep once they reached the safety of their beds and thanks to their gypsy friends their beds were as safe as possible in an open camp the wagon had been moved from the outer to the inner circle and a halfdozen fierce lurchers had been tied about it to keep away intruders the wagon itself was stoutly built enough to withstand a siege once the doors and shutters were closed talaysen thought it a pity to shut out the cool night air but better stuffy air than unexpected knives and arrows when he woke it was near noon by the sun coming through the little smokehole over the charcoal stove and the fourth bunk had a clothed and wakeful occupant it was kestreland yet it wasnt jonny brede talaysen couldnt put his finger on the differences but they were there in the way the young man held himself in the direct way he met talaysens gaze sional he said tentatively the young man nodded solemnly bbetter stick to kkestrel though he replied his stammer improved but still very much a part of his speech ththats not a nname we ought to bbe using much point taken he sat up and scrutinized the young man carefully he looked much older in an indefinable waynow he looked his real age when he had been jonny he had looked several years younger interesting pperegrine ttold me what you want to ddo the young man continued i ththink youre rright i ththink wwe ought to at lleast ffind out whwhat my uncle ththinks hes ddoing ththeres jjust one thinghe ssaid yyou wwere maybe ththinking of ffinding a rrrebellion wwell mmaybe im a pprince bbut i dont knknow anything abbout bbeing a kking talaysens estimation of the young man rose several notches whatever master darian had taught himwhatever he had learned himself in his years of rootless wanderingthis was the wisest conclusion he could possibly have come to thats very astute of you kestrel he said im not being patronizing youre very right if there is a movement afoot to depose your uncle we are going to have to investigate it very carefully they may only be interested in putting a puppet on the throne and rright now ththats all id bbe kestrel replied without bitterness ththeres some other ththings you should knknow my ffather he wwasnt a nnice man he pput mme and mmother away in the ddowager ppalace and jjust trtrotted us out on sspecial occasions ththats why she dddied shshe ccaught ssomething and he ddidnt bother sending a ddoctor until it was ttoo llate sowhat are you getting at talaysen asked i ddont knknow really kestrel said frankly jjust that i ddont ffeel like ggoing after my uncle ffor rrevenge i gguess i hardly ever ssaw my ffather i mmean i knknew who hhe wwas and he ggave mme ppresents whwhen it ssuited him bbut ththat was all i ssaw him ddie by accident bbut it wwas jjust ssomeone i knknew ddying nnot mmy father rrevenge wwould bbe ppretty sstupid he shrugged and talaysen read in that gesture that the young man was confused on any number of subjects but that on this one he was certain he was not interested in heroic vendettas most young men your age with your background would be champing at the bit hardly able to wait to get their uncle at the point of a sword and give the big speech about you scum killed my noble sainted father now you die by the sons blade i was all ready to try and calm you down mmost pprinces hhavent sspent ththe last ffour yyears ssweeping ffloors and ttending ggoats kestrel interrupted with that disarming matteroffactness i ddont know im ppretty cconfused i jjust wwant tto ssee whats gggoing on and i really wwant ppeople tto stop ttrying tto kkill me fine talaysen replied well take it from there and see where it leads good kestrel replied nodding vigorously the young mans reaction gave talaysen a great deal of food for thought as they waited for darkness to fall so that they could sneak away that reaction was as he had told sional not what he had expected it was a great deal more practical than he had anticipated it might be wise to see if there was a rebellion brewing the rebels might be able to protect sional better than they could but then againthey might already have their figurehead for revolt and they might not welcome the intrusion of the rightful king into their plans there was a possibility that they could stage sionals death convincingly enough to get the hounds called off that was another plan to be discussed and plotted out gwyna slowly coaxed a few more of his memories out of him over the course of the day talaysen slowly built a picture up in his mind of the boy sional had been some eight years ago a lonely boy packed away in what was apparently a drafty damp palace in constant need of repair with a single halfdeaf servant and his tutor master darian that surprised him guild bardsand darian had been a guild bard his credentials were impeccablewere not normally employed as tutors for boys not even when they were princes although he could not be certain talaysen framed the notion that master darian had been a great friend and admirer of the unhappy queen and had volunteered his services in the capacity of tutor when the lady died the obvious romantic notionthat darian was really sionals father and that queen and prince had been mewed up out of sight because of the scandaltalaysen discarded after only a few moments of consideration if it had been true the king would have gotten rid of the erring spouse and unfortunate offspringeither directly or discreetly there were a dozen routes he could have taken and a dozen princesses who would have brought a great deal of advantage to birnam as new brides no it seemed that master darians relationship with the queen was the same as tonnos with rune friend and mentor so why had the queen been put away most likely was that the king disliked her intensely but that she was too circumspect to give him a reason to be rid of her but then why had the prince been discarded with her in the hopes that he too would die and leave his father free to seek a spouse more to his taste with the urgency of the succession giving him a reason to urge the wife he wanted on his councilors it wouldnt have been the first time that particular ploy had been used particularly not when the first wife was one chosen for the king by his own father sional as he had said had seen very little of his father he had been in the crown palace completely by accident the night that his father had been murdered it would have been comic if the circumstances had not been so dire he had discovered on a previous visit that there was a greenhouse full of fruittrees that were forced to bloom and bear out of season he got very little in the way of luxurious food it seemed that he darian and the servant were brought whatever was left from meals at the crown palace after the servants had taken their shares he never saw outofseason fruit and boylike had decided to filch himself a treat the greenhouse was just under the kings private chambers and the way into itif you were an adventurous childwas through the air vents in the glassedover roof not only had it been a marvelous adventure it had been an unrivaled opportunity to spy on his mysterious and aloof father double the guilty pleasure for a single act even better had been to discover that his father was not alone master darian had described the goingson between men and women in a singularly detached fashion that had left him wondering why anyone bothered now he saw why they botheredand he stayed and stayed so he had been looking in the windows when the assassins surprised his fatherand the ladyin bed just about ready to finish their evenings exertions the men sent to kill the king had not been expert and in a panic at the ladys screams they had also butchered her terrorstricken sick and in shock he had run straight to master darian his only friend and protector poor old man talaysen thought pityingly no wonder we thought him halfmad how did he do it how did he smuggle a child out of a place crawling with killers get the boy away and smuggle him out of the country he was no herohe wasnt even young he was an old tired man with his best days behind him one day i am going to have to write a song about him bravery and intelligence like that are all too rare and we never even recognized them while he was alive sional must have been in shock for some time shock that made him terribly vulnerable to illness small wonder he took marsh fever crossing the fens at the birnamrayden border but that must have been a blessing to master darian for during the boys illness he managed to convince him that he was someone else entirelythe boy named jonny brede and that made it easier to hide him the rest talaysen knewexcept for one small detail the reason why jonny brede had been unable to hold a job anywhere the killers the mysterious murderers who would appear out of nowhere and try to take his life theyd made their first attempt right after master darian had died hed had three close calls not counting the attempt last night and on numerous occasions he had learned they were looking for him just in time to flee small wonder hed been starving the place talaysen had offered must have seemed godgivenfor surely if he moved about every few days no mysterious killer was going to be able to find him talaysen could hardly imagine the hellish life the boy must have endured having no friends for more than a few months constantly hungry cold lonelywith people out of a nightmare one step behind him and never knowing the reason why now he knew one difference in kestrels demeanor relief now sional knew why the killers were after him there was a logical reason he no longer lived in an irrational nightmare now he lives in a rational one somehow that made him angrier than anything else talaysen made himself a small promise if and when they found sionals uncle in a position of vulnerability he was going to give the man a little taste of what hed been dealing out to sional all these years just a little but it would be a very sharp taste they moved out by night with gypsies spread all over the downs on either side of the road to make sure they werent spied upon in company with three other wagons of the same general shape and size the other three turned back at moonrise gwyna kept the ponies moving on to the north across the downs and past the fens on the other side was the border with birnam it could be crossed two waysby the causeway or if you were desperate through the fens on paths only the marchdwellers knew talaysen guessed that the latter was the way master darian and sional must have arrived they would take the causeway there was no reason not toand every reason to be as open as possible birnam itself could cause them any number of problems none of them other than sional had ever been there the few gypsies who had could give no real details about the place and in any event they hadnt been much past the border area the fens were too tedious to cross and in bad seasons the causeway flooded once you crossed the fens birnam had no large faires most commerce took place at weekly markets instead goods moved through the auspices of the traders guild the free bards were not yet numerous enough to expand outside this kingdom so talaysen had no idea of what the lot of the traveling musician was like within birnam not terribly helpful he thought sleepily taking his turn at the reins while gwyna dozed inside somehow young kestrel was sound asleepbut perhaps like a soldier the young man had learned to take sleep when and where he could get it he and rune were to drive while the moon was up giving the mules light enough to see the road since it was a straight track across the downs bounded on either side by hedgerows there was small chance theyd get lost the worst that could happen would be that the mules would stop pull the wagon over to the side of the road and proceed to gorge themselves or sleep in their harness until someone woke up and got them back on the job even if something frightened them they likely wouldnt boltor so gwyna claimed saying that was the reason the gypsies preferred mules over horses as draft animals she claimed that when startled they would probably stand stock still and wait for whatever it was that frightened them to show itself to be either aggressive and dangerous or not a threat after all and if they do bolt shed told him let them have their heads if they run theyve either been hurt badly by something you cant see or theyve seen something they already know is dangerous they probably have a better idea of whats safe to do when theres real danger than you do let them follow their instincts as if he could do anything else if they took it into their stolid heads to run off he wasnt even sure hed be able to hang onto the reins rune climbed out of the back to sit beside him on the drivers bench after a moment she began massaging his shoulders and he sighed with pleasure ive been thinking she said about magic so have i he replied i know we dont know everything i know peregrine doesnt know everything however much he likes to pretend that he does exactly she nodded her head vigorously he glanced out of the corner of his eye at her and smiled can i say something gauche and male he asked i think you look wonderful the dress your hair down no leather hat hiding your face oh thats gauche and male all right she grinned but i like the compliment i have to admit sometimes i get a little tired of breeches and loose tunics a pretty dresswellgwyna will probably tell you i was preening like a popinjay when we were going through the outfits the other women offered me and picking out the new clothing he cautiously took his attention from the road for a moment to steal a kiss she stole one back now about magic she said he sighed there was no getting her mind off business when she was determined all right about magic for every offense in everything else theres always a defense i cant believe that theres no defenses against this seekingtalisman those killers are using she braced herself against the swaying of the wagon over an uneven stretch of road and waited for his response ive been thinking the same thing he said that was why i managed to talk peregrine out of the one he took from the dead man i was hoping we could find a way to fool it if we studied it long enough he transferred the reins cautiously to his left hand and fished the talisman out of his breeches pocket here he said handing it to her and taking proper control of the reins again she examined it as best she could by the illumination of the threequarter moon it wasnt very impressive by either sun or moonlight there wasnt much there but a small copper disk with a thin lens of glass cemented over it suspended from a copper chain she peered at it is there something under that glass she asked she had better eyes than he did peregrine says its a single strand of hair he says that places where magic is used more openly tend to be very careful about things like nailclippings and hair wed probably better assume that birnam is one of those places theyd probably been keeping every strand of hair he lost since he was a baby and when they knew he was alive they started making talismans to find him talaysen had no idea how the thing had been made but the fact that it had survived the fire intact was remarkable enough it didnt look at all damaged in spite of the fact that it had been the actual focus of peregrines defenses the point from which the fire sprang a distinct disadvantage of having a magical object unless you also had a magical defensewhich peregrine called a shieldyour object could actually call an offensive spell to it simply by existing once theyd figured out how to outwit this thing talaysen planned to sink it in a deep well does it still work she asked try it for yourself he told her hold it in your hand and tell yourself that you want to find sional she obeyedand frowned it still works all right nasty thing she rubbed the hand that had been holding it against her skirt although there was nothing physically there to rub off talaysen had done exactly the same thing after peregrine had shown him the trick of working it i havent been able to figure out how it works he confessed though i have to admit i havent done as much with it as i might have if it didnt feel soslimy she agreed grimacing distastefully stilli grew up working in an inn i emptied chamber pots cleaned up after sick drunks mucked out the stables it wont be the first time ive had to do something nasty and so far this doesnt make me feel any worse than one of those jobs ill see what i can do with it she was quiet for a very long time her brow furrowed her eyes halfclosed after a while he began to hear with that strange inner ear little snatches of melody and dissonance when she finally spoke he wasnt ready for it and he jumped startled sorry she apologized i guess i should have moved or something first its all right he assured her i was sort of dozing anyway and i shouldnt have been have you gotten anything figured out well i think i know why peregrine said nothing could be done about it she replied thoughtfully this doesnt work like our magicin fact id be willing to believe that it wasnt made by a human at all huh that made sense especially if you were doing something that you didnt want countered there were pockets of strange races scattered all over the twenty kingdoms it wouldnt be unheard of to find other races that worked magic and unless you found another mage of the same race your odds against countering what had been done might be high that could be why it feelsand soundsso unpleasant he offered its not operating by laws of melody that we understand or even feel comfortable with ive been told that there are some things living off by themselves in the swamps in the south that can make you sick by humming at you she nodded vigorously you know thats really whats going on here it isnt that it really feels bad its that it makes you feel bad i had a chance to talk to a mintak about music once he said he couldnt stand human sopranos and a lot of human instruments because they were too shrill for him and i couldnt hear half of the notes of a mintak folksong he sang for me he bent his head down so he could scratch the bridge of his nose one of the mules looked back at him annoyed at getting a reinsignal it didnt understand maybe what we need to do is figure out the logic the pattern in itthen and try and disrupt or block that pattern with something we can stand he offered i dont know she replied dubiously that could be like trying to catch a mintak with a minnownet or a minnow in a snare but i suppose thats the best we can do right now you want to try he took the charm with distaste i dont want to but i will besides maybe some of this stuff peregrine stuck in my head will help maybe she replied it couldnt hurt anyway as long as you remember we arent playing by human rules anymore i dont think i could forget he said and bent with grim determination to his task chapter twentythree runes stomach heaved you know she said conversationally to kestrel as they neared the borderpost at the edge of the fens if i didnt like you so much i think id have left you back in the mud with that copper charm and saved myself this heat pressed her down and humidity made her head ache the everpresent reek of the marsh permeated everything gnats and midges buzzed in annoying clouds around her head but thanks to the thick sticky herbjuice the gypsies had given them neither landed nor bit but the juice itself had a bitter unpleasant smell and that added to her misery the sun glared down through a thick heathaze making the road shimmer and dance after much trial and error she and talaysen had worked out the counter to the magic of the talisman comprised of notes they felt more than heard it only made them slightly ill to work just enough that rune refused to eat anything this morning since they were going to have to cross the border before noon she hadnt wanted anything in her stomach and right now she was chewing a sprig of mint in the vain hope that it would settle her rebellious insides sional grimaced id ddo it mmyself but im not ggood enough yet he held out his hands and shrugged i wwish i wwas oh dont worry about it she replied closing her eyes to subdue another surge of nausea besides if id dumped you in the mud robin would have gone back after you and then wed have gotten to smell fenstink until we cleaned you up as she opened her eyes she saw him flush and turn away and smiled in spite of her roiling stomach robin was in love with kestrel and he was returning her feelings with interest how long it would last she had no idea nor did she know whether it would survive the kinds of pressures put on a wouldbe king worry about that if we get there she told herself firmly we have enough trouble to handle right now one problem they did not have to worry about was whether sional would be recognized from a physical description anyone looking for jonny brede as he had last appeared would never see him in this young man regular meals and hauling the wagon out of soft spots in the road through the fens had put a lot of muscle on him and the sun had tanned him as dark as any gypsy in clothing given by some of the younger men and his long hair tied back in a tail he didnt look much like jonny brede and even less like a prince the borderstation grew from a dot at the end of the long straight causeway to a tiny blob of brown to a dolls house with dollguards to something her eyes would accept as a building this flat expanse of fen was disorienting to someone used to forested hills there were no trees no points of referencejust an endless sea of manhigh grass stretching in either direction forever as far as eyes could determine the borderguards had plenty of time to see them coming and take up their stations in a leisurely manner no surprise inspections at this post assuming anyone ever bothered inspecting at all and if there should ever be hostilities between rayden and birnam it was improbable that anyone would ever try to bring an army along this way she would not have been at all surprised to see that the guards were slack and slovenly but in fact they were the very opposite brisk businesslike they did a brief inspection of the wagon and the occupants and sent them on their way in fact there were only two jarring notes the first was that they were plainly looking for someone the serjeant in charge consulted a piece of paper and kept glancing from it to them as if comparing them with a set of notes the second was that one of the men did not come out at all rune caught a glimpse of him in the doorway he was not wearing a uniform of birnams soldiers and she thought she saw a glimpse of copper in his handand that was when she thought she heard a bit of that unsettling drone that came from the seekingcharm she increased the humming that rattled her teeth unpleasantly and made her stomach churn and concentrated very hard on creating a barrier between kestrel and the rest of the world finally the inspection was over and the man shed seen moved to the door again just long enough to shake his head at the serjeant she didnt get a good look at him but she thought he had a face that was so ordinary that the fact in itself was remarkable and it occurred to her that if she was creating a disguise that was precisely how she would go about doing so it wasnt until after they were out of sight of the guardhouse that she stopped her humming and dropped her magical defenses by then they were nearing the end of the causeway and in the distance there was a haze of green that marked the blessed presence of trees gwyna fanned herself with her hat her hair curling from the heat and damp blessed lady no wonder no one comes this way she said faintly its fall for heavens sake doesnt it ever cool off in there all that shallow water holds heat very well robin talaysen said from his place on the drivers bench the damp air makes it seem worse than it is just be glad we had that juice vixen made up to rub on us or wed have been eaten alive by insects and the mules with us i want a bath rune said sick to death of feeling sticky and hot i want a bath and fresh food and i dont want to have to hum that shielding spell again or at least not for a while kestrel silent until now roused at that ddid you ssee the sssorcerer the one in the guardhouse i did she replied grimly and he was looking for you for us he didnt catch that we were what he was looking for though we hope talaysen replied pessimistically kestrel shook his head he ddidnt ththey wwouldnt have llet us by ththeyd have kkilled us true oh doubting wren gwyna said they havent hesitated for a moment before this even when kestrel was nothing more than a harmless boy they would have had no reason to hesitate now and every reason to cut all four of us down after all whod miss a few gypsies talaysens shoulders relaxed youre right he admitted i probably worry too much i think of all the sneaking things i might try then assume someone else would do the same things i would but theres no reason for them to let us into birnam to kill us when they could kill us with impunity anywhere well the first hurdle is passed rune told him were in birnam now what now we find a good place to camp and people who are willing to talk in that order talaysen told them all turning for a moment to meet their eyes each in turn and remember this is the enemys home ground we have to be much cleverer than he is quiet elusive and completely harmless as far as anyone can tell we have to keep the enemys eyes sliding right past us and mmost of all kestrel added unexpectedly wwe have tto find out whwhat hes up to and why exactly rune said exactly and maybe the why is more important than the what kestrel met her eyes and nodded but a week later they were no nearer to the answer to either question they camped for the night in the shelter of an arm of a greater forest that stretched the length of birnam and set up a camp complete with a very welcome fire now that they were out of the marsh it got cold at night and the days of frost werent far off rune sat and stared at the flames beside talaysen waiting for kestrel and robin to settle down too if i were looking for a place to foment rebellion id throw up my hands in despair talaysen said as he leaned back against the tree trunk behind him these people are so contented it sounds like a tale i find it all very hard to believe except that the evidence is right before my eyes the king cant have paid everyone off to pretend to contentment sional nodded reluctantly rune held her peace both of the men had done their level best to find trouble they had found nothing at all no trouble no discontent just a placid contented countryside this was grazing land full of sheep and dairy cattle though it was not the hilly stony ground of the downs they had left in rayden these hills were rich covered with a lush grass that cattle thrived on not only cattle but every other grazing animal and the people were as fat and contented as their cattle i wish we could find someone to talk to that we knew we could trust talaysen said fretfully i dont like it these people are like sheep theyre so happy with king rolend that it makes no sense everyone has at least a little grievance against those in power rune fingered the elvenbracelet on her arm then stopped and stared at it as an idea slowly formed in her mind maybe we can find someoneat least someone whos neutral that is if youre willing to trust the word of an elf talaysen sat straight up his laziness vanishing an elf where would we find an elf we call one she told him staring into his eyes from across the fire all four of us together i think that if we work as a group were strong enough to manage it talaysen licked his lips nervously the other two watched her with speculation whwhat did you have in mmind sional asked theres a song we do with the name of elfcall and now that i know about this magic we can do with music i wonder just how close to the truth the title is she said speculatively especially since that friend of peregrines gave us these she held up her wrist was it her imagination or did the silver seem to shine with an especially brilliant gleam so what do you intend us to do talaysen asked with one eyebrow raised well were in a forest and there might be a hill of elves around here she replied thinking as she spoke if we sang elfcall and thought about how wed like someone to come talk to uswell maybe someone would wed better hedge that in talaysen said grimly put conditions around it before we get ourselves in trouble wed better limit our wish to elves nearby and to elves who dont have anything particular they want to do tonight i dont want to get another king angry with me uhmright neither did she actually one such experience was enough for a lifetime all right how many conditions do we have four one for each of us gwyna supplied an elf who actually knows the answers to the questions we have one who is willing to talk to humans one who is nearby and who would probably be amused by our ingenuity and audacity she stood up shall i get the instruments rune nodded do that ill help ill ready the circle talaysen offered kestrel would you make sure we have enough wood for the fire and food were all going to be hungry after this sional nodded without speaking while his stammer was much better and improving daily he preferred not to speak if he could avoid it rune couldnt help wondering what that would do to his effectiveness as a leader well maybe theyll think hes just very wise too wise to waste words she and gwyna brought out the harp talaysens rounddrum gwynas lute and runes fiddle elfcall required a strong hypnotic rhythm pattern quite as complex as any of the instrumental parts talaysen was by far and away the best drummer of the four of them while sional piled wood between his place in the circle and gwynas she and robin set up the instruments and tuned them talaysen positioned their cushions so that they would all be comfortable enough to concentrate and so that each of them was precisely at a compass point talaysen had north rune east robin was in the south and kestrel beside her in the west male faced female across the fire this they had worked out was the best way to perform bardic magic in a group much of what they were doing now was in the nature of experiment in some things they had completely outstripped everything peregrine had taught master wren and in others they had barely scratched the surface of those teachings they settled into their places each taking up his instrument as if it was a weapon at least that was the way rune felt ill take the condition of friendly she said that may be the hardest to find ah nearby for me gwyna decided im not as good as the rest of you are at this thats going to be the easiest to concentrate on knowledge kestrel chose with as few words as possible that leaves me with willing the compliment to friendly and probably just as difficult a condition to fill talaysen finished all right are we ready in tune one runthrough to get the fingers working and the mind set then we start concentrating remember listen for the undersong and match it and on four mortals so ponderous the voice behind rune was full of humor and amusement but it startled her heart right out of her body she jumped a good foot and dragged her bow across her strings with a most unmusical squawk with a fullthroated laugh their visitor stepped between her and talaysen into the circle of firelight stole a cushion from the pile behind her back and dropped gracefully down onto it if all she had seen was his costume shed have known him for elven no human could have stitched those fanciful silken feathers of scarlet and gold a tunic in the likeness of a phoenix but the sharply pointed ears gave his race away as well and the distinctly unhuman cast of his features as he turned to smile at her you really should have learned by now that youve trained your wills he scolded gently for creatures sensitive to magic you need only be thinking about your needs and channeling the magic with the thought of the music for mortals perhaps as earthbound as you are you will need a formal ceremony or the music sung aloud but not for us now what is it that i can answer for you in return of course you will come to the hill to play for our dancing tonight of course talaysen said with grave courtesy rune couldnt speak she was still trying to get her heart to take its proper place in her chest thank you for responding to us oh how could i not the elf laughed you are legend after all the mortals favored by the high kingyou do realize dont you that one day youll have to perform for him and the favor he will ask for his protection might be a weighty one ornot he has his whims does the high king his smile was a bit malicious but talaysen simply shrugged nothing comes without a price he said philosophically but what we would ask of you is so little that you may consider it inconsequential and that is the elf crossed his legs tailorfashion propped one elbow on his knee and rested his chin on his hand we want to know what the people of this land think of their kingand what they thought of the last one what this lads father at kestrels start he laughed again dont trouble your head child your secret is safe with us while king rolend has the wisdom to welcome us and leave us in peace we never meddle in mortal politics so you wish the tale of king rolend and his wicked brother king charlis hmm wicked brother talaysen raised an eyebrow is that an elven judgment or the judgment of history as written by the victor the fire popped and crackled flaring up briefly and reflecting from their visitors eyes both actually the elf sobered i hope the boy there has no great illusions about the quality of his parent kestrel shook his head hhardly knew him good your father should never have been given power and that is our judgment he was illsuited to it being spoiled and accustomed to having his will in all things i take it you have been asking discreet questions of the fat herds out there the elf nodded towards the road and the dairy farms beyond and they have been full of praise for king rolend they are right to be under his brother they and their lands groaned beneath taxes so ruinous that their children went to bed hungry one night out of threeand that here in the richest land in the kingdom and what did the wicked king charlis spend their money on he looked at rune who shrugged armies she hazarded shifting her position a little they might have forgiven armies no he spent it on his own amusement on exotic pleasureslaves on foods from far beyond his borders on magical toys and rare beasts for his menagerie on extravagant entertainments for himself and his courtcaging the gardens under a great tent and heating it until the trees bloomed in midwinter flooding the walled court with water and staging a battle of ships the elf shook his head and his long hair rippled with the motion he neglected his queen who did not share his exotic tastes and his son who was an inconvenience that neglect killed his queen and cost him the regard of that son oh a few loved him the bardic guild whom he showered with gifts and gold the men of the church whom he gave license to pursue anything not human as unholy and anathemawhich meant ourselves of course the select courtiers he favored and the dukes and sires who he left to themselves so that they could feud and rule their lands and people as they chose and make riot of the countryside but no one else but king rrolend kestrel asked as far as rune could tell he wasnt the least upset by the unflattering description of his father ah now that is interesting the elf taped the bridge of his nose with a long graceful finger he is mixed like most mortals some bad but most good he remitted many of the taxes when he stole the throne and spent what was left in the treasury restoring the lands the honest churchmen whom he raised up after casting adown the corrupt and proud favor him and his policy of tolerance to those not human his people love him and love his son who is so like the father that one must look for gray hairs to determine which is which the elf smiled sardonically and cast a glance at the bracelets rune and talaysen wore he has received certainconsiderationsfrom my people the courtiers no longer receiving rich gifts do not favor him the corrupt men of the church curse his name and lineage the sires who must now bend to the laws of the land grumble among themselves and the bardic guild isvery quiet lest he recall where so much of the kingdoms coin vanished from time to time men gather and speak of a rightful king and talk of rebellion but nothing comes of it no one is as perfect as you claim king rolend is talaysen said dryly did i say he was perfect the elf shrugged and his winglike eyebrows flew up towards his scalp he is mortal no mortal is perfect he hears the rumors of a rightful king and he fears of course he has had men put to death for simply whispering such words with every year he grows less flexible less forgiving harder power brings him temptations and he does not always withstand them but as kings go there have been worse and these people give praise to their sacrificed god daily for the one they have he stood up from his cushion so smoothly rune hardly knew he was doing so until he was looking down at them have i given you all that you desire talaysen looked over at kestrel who nodded slowly well then i have answered your invitation now you must answer mine willingly talaysen said getting to his feet rune and the others did the same gathering up their instruments she cast a nervous glance at the wagon and mules the elf followed her glance and thoughts with the lightningquick understanding of his kind never fear for your goods and beasts he saidhe didnt quite mock they will be guarded the fire will be tended now to the hill and the feast and the dancing certainly and allow me to get my little dig in at you and yours my friend gladly she said sweetly as they followed him into the forest and we promise to stop when you are weary his teeth gleaming back at her in a vulpine smile were all the answer he gave the kings private study seemed full of lurking shadows tonight not all of them born of firelight some of them were born of unpleasant memory why did i ever take the throne rolends temple throbbed and nothing the healerpriests did for him would make the pain stop one of them had the audacity to tell him that he was doing it to himself he slumped over his desk and buried his head in his hands he was doing it to himself whatever the hell that was supposed to mean the question of why he had taken the crown was rhetorical of course hed usurped the throne to keep his brother from looting the country to the point where the people would rise up and slaughter anyone with a drop of noble blood in his veins and that had been nearer than anyone but he and a few choice advisors even guessed shadows danced on the wall shadows that mimed the conflict of men and their dreams he had hoped to capture prince sional the boy had been young young enough he had hoped to be trained young enough even to come to understand what his uncle had done and why and forgive him one day perhaps perhaps not it didnt matter the boys tutor had taken him and fled for years he had forgotten the childhad hoped when he thought of him at all that the boy had died but then the rumors had startedthat the old man had fled to the bardic guild in rayden that he had the boy with him there was no telling what hatefilled lies hed brought the child up on the bardic guild hated him because there were no more rich plums falling into their laps from the crown doubtless the guild in rayden had seen to it that the boy learned only to hate and fear his uncle and to dream of the day when he would take back the throne doubtless they had filled his head with idle ballads of foul usurpers and the noble heroes who threw them down doubtless they had made him grateful to them for sheltering himencouraged him to trust in their word and the words of those who waited for his return doubtless he was now a handsome young puppet for their playing everything a king should look like but nothing of substance and certainly no more in his head but the insubstantial sugarfluff of vanity and dreams the bardic guild was very very good at creating the semblance of dreams those churchmen he trusted had warned him of this when he heard their prophecies fulfilled he acted he dared be nothing less than ruthless so he called upon the wizened unhuman folk of the fens the ones his people termed goblins and gave them sionals hair bidding them make him seekingcharms and when the charms came back wrapped in leaves he gave them to his agents and told them to kill his conscience had troubled him but he had soothed it with visions of who would use the boy for their own ends if they found him he would not give them that focus he had slept better then except for the times when he agonized about ordering the death of a mere childhe had been sure despite the three times that the boy had escaped that eventually they would find him and dispose of him he had been utterly certain of thatuntil tonight tonight the last of his agents had sent him word one of their number was dead killed by magic the boy was gone no one knew where or how the entire area had been combed and recombed and not a trace of him could be found the gypsies he had last been with professed to know nothing of him and had closed ranks against king rolends agents there were forty or more of them and only three of the agents the men had wisely deemed it time to retreat my hold on the throne is shaky enough once my enemies find out the boy livesand they willtheyll track him down he may even come to them even if hes still innocenteven if by some miracle the guild did not fill him full of hate for me they will when they find him and theyll use him a boy of eighteen has no chance against them he groaned aloud and then looked up as footsteps from the royal suite warned him of someones approach from the private rooms he had no fear that it might be an enemy his guards were loyal and alert and the only way into the suite besides this door was through a window but he hoped that it wasnt his wife she was as dear to him as his right hand but he did not want to be soothed at the moment father his son hesitated on the threshold just within the reach of the firelight and rolend sighed with relief victor was welcome he wouldnt try to pretend that troubles would just go away if he ignored them and he wouldnt try to soothe his father father i heard youah its my head again victor he replied it doesnt matter i was going to call for you anyway ah the young mantwenty and mature for his agewalked on catquiet feet into his fathers study then settled into a chair beside rolends desk looking into his sons face was like looking into a timereversing mirror the same frank brown eyes under heavy brows now knitted with concernthe same long nose the same thin lips and rounded jaw bad news i take it theyve lost him no further explanation was needed rolend had kept his son advised of everything from the day hed taken the crown that accounted for his maturity perhaps sometimes rolend felt a pang of guilt for having robbed the boy of a carefree childhood but at least if something happened to him victor would have the knowledge the wits and the skill to keep himself and his mother alive oh victors expression darkened with unhappiness father speak your piece victor was about to say something he thought rolend wouldnt like but the king had never forbidden his son to speak his mind before and he wasnt about to start now father i cant be sorry i think you were wrong to try and the young man hesitated choosing his words with care to try toget rid of himin the first place he has never done anything to give you a moment of lost sleepnever even tried to come home why should he try to conspire against you now rolend sighed and tried once more to make the boy see the whole truth of the situation he didnt blame victor for the way he felt the boy remembered his cousin quite clearly and when victor thought of the assassins his father had sent out to rayden he probably pictured himself in sionals place even if he were as innocent as a babe son hes still a danger to me as long as he lives he can be used against me and the hard fact is hes not the cousin who you taught to ride and the one you gave your old pony to hes probably been fed hate and bitter words with every meal and hes probably looking forward to spitting you like a skewered capon right beside me victor shook his head stubbornly i cant believe that father master darian loved queen felice and he hated uncle charlis for what he did to her hes the one that took sion and he took him into rayden not to the guild here you know that no branch of the guild really gives a clipped coin for what happens to another so long as nothing happens to them i cant believe that master darian would bring sion up to be as twisted as you think it doesnt matter son rolend sighed it really doesnt matter once the church and the guild here find out hes alive theyll have him and once the church mages have himthe dark ones anywaytheyll strip his mind bare and put what they want in there now victor fell silent and nodded reluctantly but in agreement hed seen at first hand what a dark mage could do to someones mind when theyd taken back what had once been a faithful guard from those who had captured him no matter what had been in there before when the dark mage was done there was nothing left of the original but the shell i dont like it he said finally but i cant think what else you could do do you think i like it rolend burst out he lurched up out of his chair and began to pace in front of the fire ive ordered a murderi ordered the murder of a child i sent those agents out when the boy was fourteenperhaps fifteen but what else am i to do he sat down again heavily buried his face in his hands and confessed to his son what he would not have told another living man not even his priest i hate what ive done and i hate myself for ordering it and sometimes i think that perhaps this is my punishment from god for trying to murder a child maybe i deserve to find myself facing sional across a blade but what else could i have done i dont know father victor whispered i dont know rune took her turn at the reins with everyone else closeted inside the wagon the capital city of kingstone loomed ahead of them a huge place that had long ago spilled out past its walls she wondered what was going on in kestrels mind right now they were near the end of their goal and still he had not decided what he wanted to do well if he has he hasnt told us the elf hadnt lied or even exaggerated the people of birnam were content with king rolend on the throne and were secure in the belief that his son would be just as good a ruler as his father nor had the elf made any mistake in the quality of king rolends enemies he had them but they were all too often the kind of menand a few womenwho made runes skin crawl selfish greedy venial powerhungry there were some honest folk among them people who felt that the rightful king should be on the throne frequently they voiced a legitimate concern could a man who had ordered the murder of his own brother for whatever reason however good remain uncorrupted himself how long would it be before he found other reasons to order the deaths of those who opposed himand how long would it be before merely disagreeing with him became opposing him power corrupted power made it easy to see what you wanted as something that was morally right power made it easy to find excuses had king rolend already fallen victim to the seductive magic that power sang those who voiced those questions hoped for the lost prince to return as someone who had not yet fallen victim to that seductive song rune couldnt help noticing that they used the same words in describing this mythical sional as the priests used in describing the sacrificed god but behind all these wellmeaning and earnest folk these dreamers and mystics there were always the others the powerful who had lost the power they craved the priests who had been toppled from thrones of their own the pampered and indulged who had fallen from grace if they found sional theyd make him over into exactly the image the others craved the pure innocent the pure innocent fool wholl say whatever they tell him to say but there was one possible way that sional could win back his throne without becoming a puppet to take it the same way that his uncle had except that instead of soldiers hed have bardic magic on his side magic that might even make it possible to avoid killing king rolend and the cousin he vaguely remembered and if that was what he truly wantedwell rune would back him and she suspected that talaysen would too theyd had some long latenight discussions about good government about the seduction of power discussions that reminded her poignantly of the ones shed had with tonno theyd slipped into more than a dozen meetings of these purported enemies of the king most of which were held on church grounds which somehow hadnt surprised her much she and talaysen had gotten fairly adept at rooting out who the malcontents were convincing them to reveal what they knew with a focused thought and a few hummed phrases of music they were even more adept at going to the meetingplaces cloaked and persuading the guards with their magic that they were trusted conspirators once or twice theyd even put guards to sleep that way this magic though it left them weary still represented a lot of power and it was very tempting to use it for more than defense and it was in one of those discussions of power that rune had realized with a little shock how easy it was to just use it power was as seductive as anything else and now she could see why others had succumbed to the lure of it even in the church how close had she and the others come to that kind of attitude where the end was more important than the means and all that mattered was that the end be theirs that was when theyd had other discussions about the kind of people who were behind the uneasy stirrings of unrest unspoken agreement had been reached about the use of magic then and the latenight sorties into the camps of the conspirators ended she knew that talaysen was worried however wellmeaning sion was how could he stay out of the hands of those people for long once he revealed who and what he was and if he somehow managed to against all odds how long would he be able to hold his throne how long could he play their game without getting caught at it she sighed and the mules flicked back their ears at the sound theyd turn against him eventuallyunless he managed to play the church against the nobles and vice versaand use the guild to keep both sides stirred up she shook her head and rubbed her temple her head ached from all the unresolved problems a man as old as rolend and as experienced could probably do just that in fact there were some signs that he had begun to play that very game now that his country was stable and prosperous several of the little cabals they had visited had been very suspicious of outsiders and not as agents from the king but as agents from one of the other groups that must surely be rolends work at least in part but could sional play that kind of game i dont know talaysen couldbut sionalhes no older than i am and i dont think i could not for long and there was one final concerninsignificant so far as the fate of a kingdom was concerned but one that was tearing her heart in two gwyna gypsy robin had fallen in love with kestrel and he with her and now the nearer they came to the palace and the throne the more gwyna looked at kestrel and saw prince sional prince sional who could not possibly marry even with a commoner much less with a gypsy gwyna grievedcharacteristically in silence hiding her grief behind a smile and a quick wit but she mourned kestrels loss already rune felt it and she could do nothing for there was nothing she could do their worlds could not be reconciled if prince sional took his throne kestrel died if prince sional failed in his attempt to take his throne kestrel died but if kestrel was to live something must be done about the assassins and what that solution was rune had no idea it wasnt possible that the king would believe that sional didnt want the throne and even if he did he must know that the moment his enemies discovered sionals existence theyd try to use him so even if prince sional gave up his throne sooner or later kestrel would die if talaysen had any plans on that score he hadnt confided them to her so they had their answers nowbut they werent any help and rune couldnt keep herself from feeling that she was driving their little wagon into a maze with no escape chapter twentyfour the wagon seemed the safest place to stay all things considered rune found a travelers inn that would let them pull their wagon in behind the stable for a fee it was clean shaded and secluded back there evidently there were often travelers staying in their own conveyances and the inn had set up this little yard for them a little more money produced fodder and water for the mules and gave them use of the inn bathhouse while the others got their baths she fetched some hot food from the inns kitchen they were all tired of their own limited cooking abilities they returned about the same time she did and she went for her wash by the time she got back it was obvious from the tense atmosphere in the wagon that kestrel was about to make a decision and had been waiting for her to return he and gwyna sat on one bunk not touching and talaysen sat facing them the food was hardly touched gwyna was sitting very still and her face had no color at all and talaysen had not bothered to light the lamps rune climbed into the wagon lit the lamp beside the door herself and shut the door behind her kestrel cleared his throat selfconsciously and gwyna jumped ii dddont want the dddddamn ththrone he said thickly i wwouldnt bbe hahahalf the kking mmy uncle is im a gggood mmusician id be a hohorrible kking gwyna made a curious little sound half laugh half sob talaysen let out the breath hed been holding in and rune sat down on the bunk with a thud i cant tell you how glad i am that youve decided that talaysen said wiping his brow with the back of his hand i agree with you but that just gives us another problem how the hell are we going to keep you alive he reached for his mug of cider and took a long drink rune picked up a barely warm meat pie to nibble on their problems werent over yet in fact as talaysen had pointed out theyd just begun ccant we kkeep ddoing what wwe have bbeen kestrel asked after a moment of forlorn hesitation rune and talaysen both shook their heads and rune spoke first sooner or later hes going to find another kind of seekingcharm and give the new ones to his agents we wont know how to counter them and theyll find you again and while were waiting for that to happen some of these other lunatics weve seen are going to realize you really are alive and come looking for you themselves then what she put the pie down her appetite was entirely gone sional set his mouth stubbornly and raised his chin i ttell them tto ggo tto hell and when they find a mage to change your mind for you talaysen asked gently oh dont shake your head kestrel theyve got mages especially church mages and ask gwyna how powerful some of them are she spent several days as a birda real bird with feathersand for anyone who can turn a woman into a bird taking over your mind would be a mere exercise he closed his eyes for a moment what weve begun to learnits nothing compared to what happened to gwyna i think that one day we will be powerful enough to protect you from all of them rune especially ive never heard of anyone facing down elves the way she did but we arent that strong yet ii ddd he paused and flushed i hhave to ttalk tto my uncle he said his eyes meeting first runes then gwynas i ddont knknow what else ttto ssay hhe wwasnt always llike ththis mmmaybe if i ttalk tto him hell unddderstand and lleave mme alllone ththats ththe only ththing i ccan ththink of his face twisted up and he looked about to cry rrobin i lll she caught his hands in hers i know that she replied i do i know that i love you and if theres any way i can make you safe how are we going to get you to him rune asked thats the first question i ccan remember ththe ppalace gggood enough to ddraw a mmap he said if master wrwren ccan ddo what ppperegrine ddid to mmake mme remember i can talaysen said slowly then what i ffind a wway to ttalk tto my uncle alone sion repeated in hhis bbedroom mmaybe if i ccan ttalk tto him alone hhell have to believe me first problem rune pointed out getting into the palace you can leave that to me talaysen told her ive slipped into a fair number of buildings in my time the easiest way in is as a servant openly since servants are invisible to those they serve next problemwhat if your uncle wont believe you gwyna was still pale and she didnt look as if she liked this plan at all magic rune said at least we can keep him convinced long enough for us to get out of here and somewhere safer after thatwell our influence is going to wear off after a while i say we can fake kestrels death once were well away talaysen said unexpectedly i faked my own i ought to be able to do his slowly gwynas color came back and she nodded that should work she said and grinned a littlea feeble grin but it was there and real if it makes him safe from his uncle and those greedy fools thats the best solution of all rune sighed with relief good sense to the rescue she thought the only question i can see is the fake wont hold foreverit didnt for master wren then what were right back at the beginning talaysen chuckled much to her surprise and evidently to kestrel and robins as well from the incredulous looks they gave him kestrel wasnt a famous bardic guild master who refused to quit making music he said that was my own fault if id had the sense to become a carpenter or something theyd never have found me again kestrel on the other hand is not going to go find himself another position as a prince and no one but us knows he really is a bard all right rune said i can accept that so now the question ishow to we get into the palace everything we want to do hinges on that if we cant get in and convince rolend long enough to give us that breathing space to fake a death we cant make all this work ive been thinking for the past week or so talaysen said slowly trying to come up with a plan that would work whether kestrel wanted the crown or notand i think ive got one he couldnt possibly have said anything that would have had a better chance of capturing their attention as one they leaned forward to listen talaysen nodded as if he was satisfied remember what i said about servants being invisible think about thatthen remember what rune and i can do to fog peoples thoughts and confuse them combine those two factors and i think we can get in ourselves find a way into the private quarters for all of us and once we have that we have everything nowhere is what we do to start or rather what rune and i do rune scrubbed pots with a will her hands deep in lukewarm soapy water and kept her head down with her hair straggling into her eyes she hummed as she worked concentrating on not being noticed the girl whose clothes she had stolen was her same height and general build but she looked nothing like the bardand while she could use magic to keep people from looking too closely at her if she worked too hard at bespelling people now shed have no energy reserves for dealing with king rolend later the kitchen suffered from lack of light though which was to her advantage talaysen and the other two looked a great deal more like their own counterparts but she was the weakest link here there simply werent too many women with runes inches too bad she didnt have another job rune thought with an idle corner of her mind as she chipped away at some burnton porridge that had been left there since this morning when i left the bear i thought id left this behind me too ick i hate potscrubbing the stonewalled kitchen too small for the number of people crowded into it was illlit with only two lanterns for the whole room cramped and hot in the inevitable confusion of dinner preparation it had been fairly simple for them to slip into the rootcellar to hide then to lure individuals away and knock them out with a song of sleep their victims would be found in the cellar sometime tomorrow but the chances of their being discovered before then was fairly remotetalaysen had waited until the last foray after roots and onions was over before sending them to dreams there was no reason for anyone to go down there now and raw roots werent high on anyones list of edibles to steal king rolends expert handling of his people extended to his kitchens and servantsthey were all wellfed and if they stole anything to munch on it would be a bit of meat or a pastry not a raw onion the potscrubbers ate first even before the courtiers and high servants that the meal had been prepared for so the only time anyone said anything to rune and her fellow cleaners it was about the dirty dishes other than that they were left alone she freed a hand long enough to wipe sweat from her forehead and the back of her neck the other three had taken the place of other cleaners and sweepers gwyna was two stations over in charge of pewter mugs and utensils talaysen and sional had been in charge of carrying garbage out to the compostheaps now they waited brooms in hand for the signal that the nobles were finished eating that was when they and the other cleaners would trot up the steps into the dininghall that is thats what they would do if they really were sweepers the lowest of the low the invisibles dullwitted just bright enough to clean up after others not bright enough to be any danger to anyone that was the kind of servant talaysen had been looking for to impersonate someone no one in his right mind would ever suspect it wouldnt be long now the great ovens were closed the last of the pastry courses had been sent out servants were trickling out of the kitchen in the opposite direction of the stair they were going to take heading for the barnlike servants hall and their own dinner a gong sounded above as rune watched them out of the corner of her eye that was the signal that dinner was over and no one was lingering over food or wanted something else the cooks gathered up the last of their utensils and dropped them in the nearest dishtub the cleaners could now begin their job the chief cook and all her helpers swept out of the room chattering and complaining which left no one to oversee the kitchen itself the drudges on dishwashing duty were normally halfwits at best like maeve dull creatures that would do anything theyd been set at until the last dish was washed or until they were stopped and set on something new they wouldnt notice when gwyna and rune left talaysen and sional hung back from the rest of the sweepers like the drudges the sweepers werent the brightest of folk probably no one would notice that they were missing until noses were countedand then it would be assumed that the missing men were either off drinking filched wine or tupping the missing drudges when servants were missing their superiors generally assumed improper conduct rather than anything sinister and the lowlier the servant the more likely that was that was why talaysen had chosen the ones he had the ones thought to be shiftless neerdowells when he and rune had made their earlier foray into the kitchens thered been trouble with those two men over laziness and slacking for the kitchen steward it would simply seem a repetition of the same with the tall simpleton drawn into the group to make up a foursome gwyna and rune dropped what theyd been working on back into the dishtubs and joined the men as they had figured the other drudges didnt even look up form their work follow me talaysen whispered propping his broom in an outoftheway corner full of shadows where it might not be seen for a while kestrel did the same rune wiped her hands on her apron grateful that the kings concern for his servants extended to keeping them bathed and clean some of the drudges shed seen in inn kitchens would have given them away by the reek of their stolen clothing and there werent any fleas to torment the conspirators with unexpected biting at precisely the wrong moment they followed talaysen up a back stairnot quietly but yawning and letting their feet scuff against the stairsteps talking among themselves as if they had just finished dinner and were heading for bed talaysen first followed by kestrelthen robin and rune together as if they were two best friends whispering and giggling behind kestrels back this part of the staircase was well and brightly lit and it would have been impossible to slip past the guard posted at the entrance to the second floorso they werent even going to try instead they were going to be as obvious as possible the guard on the landing of the second floorthe floor with the royal suite on itnodded to each of the men and winked slyly at the women rune giggled and hid her face behind her hand as if she was shy robin gave him a saucy wink right back and wrinkled her nose at him he gave her a pinch as she went by she squealed and slapped playfully at his handbut once again the kings care for choosing his servants came to the fore he made no effort to follow them and no effort to back up his flirtation except a verbal one saucy wench like you needs a man t keep her warm onights the guard said with a grin but without leaving his post tell ye what ye be tired of an empty bed or cold around about midnight ye come lookin for lerson eh by then i be off i might gwyna replied smartly not betraying by so much as a blink that the guard had just told them something they hadnt knownwhen the change of guard was then again i might not ah lerson growled playfully faking a swat at her with his halberd get along with ye she scampered up the stairs behind rune whod waited for her they giggled together all the way up to the next landingwhich was unguardedwhere they opened and closed the door twice to make it seem as if theyd gone to their quarters but instead of leaving the stairs at the servants floor they continued quietly carefully to the top and the seldomused storage rooms for old furniture talaysen had been here before them in the guise of a dimwitted fellow assigned to carrying up barrels of summer clothing and he had made certain that the door at the top of the stairs was welloiled nevertheless rune held her breath as he opened it they all filed through it and he closed it behind them without a betraying creak the darkness in this hall was total and the air was thick with dust she suppressed a sneeze this part of the plan was pivotal she waited as talaysen felt his way past them then took gwynas hand at his whispered command gwyna held kestrels hand and kestrel had hold of talaysen careful questioning of palace servants on talaysens last visit had told him of the existence of a spiral stairway that went straight from the royal suite to the attics with no doorways out onto any other floors it was guardedbut by only one man it came out in a linen closet at the end of the hall and had been built so that bedding and furniture could be lowered down the hollow center of the stairs by means of a block and tackle that had been talaysens second job herelowering down the boxes of warmingpans and featherbeds for winter with no landings in between the stairs could be made as narrow as feasible and still be used by men to guide the burden up or down there was however no railing and the stairs were bound to be just as dark as these attics talaysen found the door and opened it a little at a time it did creak and rune just hoped that the guard at the bottom would attribute the tiny squeaks as talaysen moved it bit by bit to mice she tried not to think of the drop that awaited her if she missed her step and waited until it was her turn to follow gwyna into the stairway she felt her way along the wall and inched her foot over the doorframe there her hand encountered the rough brickwork of the inside of the staircase and her foot found the first step and the abyss beyond it she pulled her foot back and began the agonizingly slow progress down there was no way of telling time in the thick stuffy darkness she thought she heard gwyna breathing just ahead of her and the occasional scuff of a toe against the stone of the stair but that was all she couldnt have seen her hand if it was right in front of her face rather than feeling the wall she counted twenty stepsthirtybegan to wonder if there was going to be an end to them maybe this was all a dreamor worse yet maybe they were all really dead killed protecting kestrel and this was their own private little hell to descend this staircase forever and ever and never come to the bottom of it but before she managed to give herself a case of the horrors her questing foot found only a flat surface and she bumped into gwyna talaysen held his breath for a moment and pressed his ear against the crack that marked the door into the linen closet he heard nothing good the king never expected any serious threat from aboveso the guard on this stair was really one of the guards that patrolled the hallway beyond and if what he had been toldunder the influence of a trust me spell on another of the guardswas true the guard stationed here was more in case someone broke in through one of the windows he never checked in with anyone from the moment he went on station to the moment he turned his watch over to the next guard talaysen eased the door open slowlythis one thank god had been better taken care of than the one above it opened with scarcely a squeak now there was light outlining the door at the other end of the closet he motioned to the others to stay where they were and eased himself up to kneel beside it pressing his ear against the gap between door and frame therethere were the steps slow and steady of the guard he began to hum under his breath timing his magic so that the guard would begin to feel sleepy just about when he reached the door to the linen closet the footsteps recededthen neared and began to falter a little he heard a yawn quickly stifled then another he hummed a little louder concentrating with all his might he would have to overcome the will of a stubborn trained manone who knew his duty was to stay awake and would fight the magic although he didnt know what he was fighting another yawn a stumble a gasp the sound of a heavy body falling against the wall beside the door and sliding to the floor he flung open the door quickly squinting against light that was painful after the darkness of the stairway a man in guarduniform sprawled untidily on the dark wooden floor his brow creased as if he was still trying to fight off the effects of the spell with a quick gesture talaysen summoned kestrel and together they pulled the guard into the closet in a few moments as the women sent him deeper into sleep they had stripped him of weapons bound and gagged him and muffled him in a pile of sheets and comforters talaysen took his sword while he wasnt an expert he knew the use of one kestrel who hadnt held a sword since childhood seized the knife with a quick glance up and down the hall to be certain they were unobserved they stole out and headed for the kings private study at the end of the suitethe one place they knew they had a chance of catching the king alone that had been the last bit of information theyd gotten on their scouting foray no one entered that room without rolends express permission not even servantsand rolend always went there directly after dinner it was a rather ordinary room when they finally found it talaysen had been expecting something much grander this place looked to have been a kind of heated storage closet before rolend had taken it over a single lantern burned on the desk the rest of the light came from a cheerful blaze in the tiny fireplace there were no windows the walls were lined with bookshelves and the only furniture was a scratched and dented desk and three comfortablelooking chairs it was an oddshaped room as well with a little niche behind the door just large enough for all four of them to squeeze into without having the door hit them in the faces when it opened which was exactly what they did rune tapped his shoulder once they were in place with kestrel as the youngest and most agile at the front of the group he leaned over so that she could put her lips right up against his ear and whisper it would be just our luck that he decided to go straight to bed wouldnt it she said silently he begged god and the gypsys lady that rune wouldnt prove to be a prophet they huddled there long enough for him at least to start feeling stiff and cramped and more than long enough for him to begin to think about all the possible things that could go wrong with the plan footsteps they stiffened as one and he held his breath listening someone was coming this way someone with the slow heavy gait of the middleagedsomeone wearing mens boots someone who saw no need to carry a candle someone who knew there would be light and a fire waiting in here the door opened closed again before them was the back of a large powerful man kestrel struck like his falconnamesake sheer youth and desperation gave him the reflexes to overwhelm a man who had fought for most of his life he had a knife across his uncles throat in a heartbeat and talaysen was right behind him as the older man whirled his first instinct to throw his attacker off he found himself facing the point of one of his guards swords in the hands of someone he didnt recognize i wouldnt shout if i were you talaysen whispered quietly between us sional and i can take out your throat before you could utter a single sound the mans eyes widened at sionals name and the blood drained from his face leaving it pasty and white his eyes went dead and talaysen sensed that he expected to die in the next few moments that and the family resemblance to sional convinced him that they had the right man that had been a possibility he hadnt mentioned to anyonethat someone else might be caught in their little trap so king rolend what have you got to say for yourself he continued cruellyknowing that he was being cruel but with the memory of kestrels own frightened face in the back of his mind and what do you have to say to your nephew the man was brave he had to give him that much as sional relaxed his grip a little and talaysen transferred the tip of his sword to the base of rolends throat and backed him up against the desk so that sional could come to stand beside him rolend didnt beg didnt plead his eyes went to sional then back to talaysen who are you with he said harshly whose pay are you in talaysen shook his head slightly that wasnt what i expected to hear he chided youve been sending killers after this young man for years dont you think an explanation is in order before i die you mean rolend drew himself up with as much dignity as a man with a sword at his throat could muster i did what i thought i had to do for the good of the country for the good of the countryor for your own good rune asked challengingly coming up behind talaysen her own knife in her hand theyre not the same and dont try to pretend they are the kings eyes widened in surprise and he opened his mouth as if to shout but nothing came out and talaysen heard gwyna humming behind him robins got him silenced rune said not taking her eyes off rolend she raised her chin with that defiant look talaysen recognized from the past you can whisper if you want king but it wont do you any good to call for help his eyes were now as round as coins and his lips formed a single word magic yyyou ought to knknow uncle kestrel said bitterly yyou sset it on mmme enough he moved closer and strangely talaysen saw tears in his eyes whwhy uncle he whispered in anguish whwhy i nnnever dddid anything tto you vvvictor wwwas ththe only fffriend i hhad bbesides mmaster ddarian the young mans obvious anguish got through to rolend as nothing else had i thoughti thoughtyoud hate me rune was humming and talaysen recognized the trust me spell so far the plan theyd made had fallen in placeto find rolend alone and somehow convince him with the aid of magic if need beto leave kestrel in peace but would it work he sensed the king fighting the spelland a man with a strong will could get himself clear of it then a gleam of silver on the kings wrist suddenly caught his attention and he remembered that the elf they had spoken with had mentioned something about the nonhumans of birnam now being under a sort of royal protection he held up his wrist to show the elven bracelet there and once again the kings eyes went round in surprise the surprise at seeing the elven token made his resistance falter you asked me whose pay i was in he said fiercely nonot the elves and not the churchs nor the bardic guild nor the men you cast down out of power and sional is not here as my puppet wewe are here beside him because he is our friend for no more reason than that we are under the protection of the high king of the elves rune said breaking off her humming and showing her own elven token think on that a momentthink what that might mean if you harmed usand listen to your nephew i dddont want ththe dddamned ththrone sional hissed i dddont wwant the cccrown mmy ffather wwwas a

you go freethe moment someone discovers that youre alive hes weakening we have him offbalance and hes weakening wait talaysen said and held up the bracelet again remember this remember that we are mages we could have killed you we didnt if we say we know of a way to take sional out of the game completely will you believe us and at least listen the king nodded slowly and talaysen took a chance and lowered the sword rolend sagged back against his desk then made his way to the chair behind it and collapsed into its embrace llisten to me uncle sional said im nnot a rruler dddo you ththink for a mminute that ppeople wwould rrrespect a mman whwho ssounds llike i dddo he laughed a sound with no humor in it nnot even a chchurch mmage ccould mmake ppeople bbelieve im anyththing other ththan a

have the situation well in hand stutter and all talaysen joined her the king had stopped resisting the spellnow if they could just get it to take bbut ive ssseen whwhat yyouve dddone ive bbbeen one of ththe pppeople ththeyd rrather a gggood ruler ththan a fool ttomorrow mmorning yyou and i cccan gggo stand on ffathers dddamned bbalcony and ill rrrenounce ththe throne he took a deep breath as i am

tttalk about it even aunt fefefe noplease rolend said closing his eyes and putting his hand to his head not your aunt felice shell raise half the palace and then shell take you off and have you married to one of her ladiesinwaiting before the sun rose go get victor hes in the rose room he looked each of the bards in the eyes in turn youre right we should talk perhaps talaysen saw hope dawning in the kings eyes slowly and the relief of seeing the end of a burden in sight perhaps we can make this work talaysen watched from the steps of the balcony over the audience square standing with the other servants from the kings retinue with one arm around rune and one at gwynas waist sional was doing very well though he doubted that anyone else was under that impression the abdication ceremony took three times as long as expected because of sionals stutter enough witnesses were found to swear that this was the lost prince to have convinced most peopleand one of rolends mages clinched it by casting a spell over the young man that proved that hair known to have been sionals had been his as he had promised he never changed from his rough workingmans garments and if anyone had any notions of a romantic hero he managed to crush them all surely before he was through a good portion of the people watchingand criers had gone through the city at dawn to ensure that the square was fullwere going to be convinced he was a halfwit but how long will rolend believe that hes no danger that was the one doubt that kept nagging at him while they remained all would be wellbut the spell theyd worked would fade in timeand then what how long could they hope to keep sional safe despite his earlier assurances it was not easy to fake a death would they have time to set up kestrels demise convincingly enough there were few cheers as sional completed the ceremony swearing on the holiest relics that could be found that neither he nor any of his progeny would ever return to claim the throne from rolend and his heirs but as rolend and the priest in charge of the ceremony turned to lead the way off the balcony he stopped those few cheers with an upraised hand this wasnt in the plan what was the boy up to i knknow that ththere are sstill ppeople who wwont believe mmy swsworn wword he said clearly now looking down on the folk below suddenly transformed from the bumpkin to something else entirely despite the stutter ssso im ggoing to mmake ccertain that nno one ccan ever use mme or mmine aggainst my uncle he turned ran down the stairs to the assembled servants caught gwynas hand and drew her up the stairs to the front of the balcony where everyone could see her she looked around in confusion not certain what he had in mind rune squeezed talaysens hand in excitement and he hugged her back was the boy about to do what he thought there were gasps from the people below as they saw her in all her gypsy finery gasps of outrage mostly bad enough to have this bumpkinprince on the royal balcony but a gypsy they were about to get an even bigger shock ggwyna kravelen free bbard will you mmarry me he asked his voice carrying clearly to the edge of the square the silence could have been cut and eaten iohi she stammered just as badly as he had and rune giggled ill ttake that for a yes he said and looked over her head at the priest who had conducted the abdication ceremony yyouve wwwitnessed it father he continued and kissed her at that victor could no longer restrain himself he was already half delirious at having his cousin backand discovering that sional didnt hate them now he lost every shred of dignity he gave a wild whoop of joy threw his hat into the air where it sailed up and landed on the roofand threw his arms around the both of them then the cheers began chapter twentyfive so whos the happiest man in birnam today rune asked talaysen as they showered the mob of mixed gypsy and servant children under the balcony with candy to keep them out of mischief kestrel talaysen hazarded she shook her head and pitched sweets to some of the littlest who werent getting any almost but not quite she told him he will be when he gets robin out of here but the celebrating is wearing thin weddings are really for women anyway she giggled i think the happiest person not only in birnam but in all of alanda is the queen she not only got to plan an entire wedding she got to play mother to the groom and the bride the king talaysen guessed noprobably not when he offered to host this wedding he never guessed that every gypsy within three kingdoms was going to descend on him they both laughed though rune couldnt help but think he deserved at least that much anxiety after all those years of pain that hed given kestrel but there would be bills coming to the palace for pilfered goods and stolen livestock for the next month at least and stodgy little birnam would never be the same again theyd been invaded by an army of folk who had no ties but to the road no responsibilities but to each other and they had been set on their ears by the experience it isnt me the bard said after a moment really she raised an eyebrow at him you got what you wanted free bards have exactly the same privileges as guild bards in birnam he nodded and sighed but to get that i had to agree to be laurel bard to the throne that had been to keep the bardic guild out of making mischief with the kings enemies now there would be an information network everywherethe free bards and the gypsies who remainedthat the church the guild and the disgruntled sires couldnt touch or even trace she tsked at him and threw another handful of candy poor master wren property the title of sirei know people whod kill for that i had that all and gave it up he reminded her never mind we can go scandalize birnam some more and build a free bard school in the manorhow does that sound good she told him contentedly but you still havent answered my question i give up he said and popped a candy in her mouth victor she said tucking it into her cheek why victor that answer had clearly surprised him firsthe got his cousin back secondhis mother got to have a wedding and he didnt have to get married shell probably leave him alone for a few more months thirdthe king isnt a childkilling ogre anymore and i dont think hes in any danger of making that grave a moral decision againand last but by no means leastprince victor has been very popular with our gypsy friends she laughed at the look on his face hes their favorite gejo at the moment he has gotten quite an education i promise you frankly im surprised he can walk of a morning so thats why hes talaysen broke off what he was going to say much to her disappointment lookhere comes the wagon a brand new and beautifully painted wagon the kings wedding gift to the happy couple driven by raven and drawn by two glossy black mares clattered across the cobblestones of the courtyard nightingale balanced on the top scattering coppers to all sides which had the effect of sending the children out of harms way shrieking with delight raven pulled them up smartly and just below the balcony the great doors flew open kestrel and robin dressed headtotoe in the gypsy finery in whichto the utter scandal of the courtthey had been wedded ran handinhand out onto the cobblestones raven jumped down off the drivers bench as nightingale slid from the top raven handed gwyna up holding her long enough for a hearty kiss then turned the reins over to kestrel kestrel jumped up onto the drivers bench and took his place beside gwyna he had proved to be a good driver with raven to tutor him and the mares responded to his touch on the reins promptly as he got the spirited mares turned the thunder of hooves rang out from the entrance to the courtyard a flood of of gypsy riders poured in each one trying to outdo the other in stuntriding they swirled around the wagon and as kestrel cracked the whip above the horses heads they surrounded it whooping at the tops of their lungs and just as the entire equipage started to pull out escort and all another rider appeared at the far side of the courtyard from the direction of the royal stables he let out a wild warcry that caught even the gypsies attention and plunged towards them is thatvictor talaysen said incredulously it was dressednot quite in wild gypsy regalia but certainly in the brightest gear his closet had to offer he spurred his horse towards the wedding cortege with another wild cry circled the group three times and cried come on the road wont wait forever he pounded off towards the courtyard gate the clear leader of the pack with the rest of the mob streaming along behind him wagon in their midst the stunned silence that filled the courtyard was more eloquent than words finally talaysen shook his head poor birnam he sighed poor stiffnecked birnam weve unmade their king turned their princes into gypsies their lands into a haven for neerdowell vagabonds elves and free bards and stolen the power from their bardic guild whats left oh she said thinking of a little secret she had just shared with gwyna hell find out about it in a month or two i think hell like being a father ill think of something trust me and youll probably manage to surprise me as much as weve surprised birnam he chuckled she just smiled and waved to the vanishing gypsies end
