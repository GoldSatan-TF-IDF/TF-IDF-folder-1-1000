michael crichton prey within fifty to a hundred years a new class of organisms is likely to emerge these organisms will be artificial in the sense that they will originally be designed by humans however they will reproduce and will evolve into something other than their original form they will be alive under any reasonable definition of the word these organisms will evolve in a fundamentally different manner the pace will be extremely rapid the impact on humanity and the biosphere could be enormous larger than the industrial revolution nuclear weapons or environmental pollution we must take steps now to shape the emergence of artificial organisms doyne farmer and alletta belin there are many people including myself who are quite queasy about the consequences of this technology for the future k eric drexler introduction artificial evolution in the twentyfirst century the notion that the world around us is continuously evolving is a platitude we rarely grasp its full implications we do not ordinarily think for example of an epidemic disease changing its character as the epidemic spreads nor do we think of evolution in plants and animals as occurring in a matter of days or weeks though it does and we do not ordinarily imagine the green world around us as a scene of constant sophisticated chemical warfare with plants producing pesticides in response to attack and insects developing resistance but that is what happens too if we were to grasp the true nature of natureif we could comprehend the real meaning of evolutionthen we would envision a world in which every living plant insect and animal species is changing at every instant in response to every other living plant insect and animal whole populations of organisms are rising and falling shifting and changing this restless and perpetual change as inexorable and unstoppable as the waves and tides implies a world in which all human actions necessarily have uncertain effects the total system we call the biosphere is so complicated that we cannot know in advance the consequences of anything that we do that is why even our most enlightened past efforts have had undesirable outcomeseither because we did not understand enough or because the everchanging world responded to our actions in unexpected ways from this standpoint the history of environmental protection is as discouraging as the history of environmental pollution anyone who is willing to argue for example that the industrial policy of clearcutting forests is more damaging than the ecological policy of fire suppression ignores the fact that both policies have been carried out with utter conviction and both have altered the virgin forest irrevocably both provide ample evidence of the obstinate egotism that is a hallmark of human interaction with the environment the fact that the biosphere responds unpredictably to our actions is not an argument for inaction it is however a powerful argument for caution and for adopting a tentative attitude toward all we believe and all we do unfortunately our species has demonstrated a striking lack of caution in the past it is hard to imagine that we will behave differently in the future we think we know what we are doing we have always thought so we never seem to acknowledge that we have been wrong in the past and so might be wrong in the future instead each generation writes off earlier errors as the result of bad thinking by less able mindsand then confidently embarks on fresh errors of its own we are one of only three species on our planet that can claim to be selfaware yet selfdelusion may be a more significant characteristic of our kind sometime in the twentyfirst century our selfdeluded recklessness will collide with our growing technological power one area where this will occur is in the meeting point of nanotechnology biotechnology and computer technology what all three have in common is the ability to release selfreplicating entities into the environment we have lived for some years with the first of these selfreplicating entities computer viruses and we are beginning to have some practical experience with the problems of biotechnology the recent report that modified maize genes now appear in native maize in mexicodespite laws against it and efforts to prevent itis just the start of what we may expect to be a long and difficult journey to control our technology at the same time longstanding beliefs about the fundamental safety of biotechnologyviews promoted by the great majority of biologists since the snow appear less secure the unintended creation of a devastatingly lethal virus by australian researchers in has caused many to rethink old assumptions clearly we will not be as casual about this technology in the future as we have been in the past nanotechnology is the newest of these three technologies and in some ways the most radical it is the quest to build manmade machinery of extremely small size on the order of nanometers or a hundred billionths of a meter such machines would be about times smaller than the diameter of a human hair pundits predict these tiny machines will provide everything from miniaturized computer components to new cancer treatments to new weapons of war as a concept nanotechnology dates back to a speech by richard feynman called theres plenty of room at the bottom forty years later the field is still very much in its infancy despite relentless media hype yet practical advances are now being made and funding has increased dramatically major corporations such as ibm fujitsu and intel are pouring money into research the us government has spent billion on nanotechnology in the last two years meanwhile nanotechniques are already being used to make sunscreens stainresistant fabrics and composite materials in cars soon they will be used to make computers and storage devices of extremely small size and some of the longanticipated miracle products have started to appear as well in one company was manufacturing selfcleaning window glass another made a nanocrystal wound dressing with antibiotic and antiinflammatory properties at the moment nanotechnology is primarily a materials technology but its potential goes far beyond that for decades there has been speculation about selfreproducing machines in a nasa paper discussed several methods by which such machines could be made ten years ago two knowledgeable scientists took the matter seriously within fifty to a hundred years a new class of organisms is likely to emerge these organisms will be artificial in the sense that they will originally be designed by humans however they will reproduce and will evolve into something other than their original form they will be alive under any reasonable definition of the word the pace of evolutionary change will be extremely rapid the impact on humanity and the biosphere could be enormous larger than the industrial revolution nuclear weapons or environmental pollution we must take steps now to shape the emergence of artificial organisms and the chief proponent of nanotechnology k eric drexler expressed related concerns there are many people including myself who are quite queasy about the consequences of this technology for the future we are talking about changing so many things that the risk of society handling it poorly through lack of preparation is very large even by the most optimistic or dire predictions such organisms are probably decades into our future we may hope that by the time they emerge we will have settled upon international controls for selfreproducing technologies we can expect such controls to be stringently enforced already we have learned to treat computer virusmakers with a severity unthinkable twenty years ago weve learned to put hackers in jail errant biotechnologists will soon join them but of course it is always possible that we will not establish controls or that someone will manage to create artificial selfreproducing organisms far sooner than anyone expected if so it is difficult to anticipate what the consequences might be that is the subject of the present novel michael crichton los angeles its midnight now the house is dark i am not sure how this will turn out the kids are all desperately sick throwing up i can hear my son and daughter retching in separate bathrooms i went in to check on them a few minutes ago to see what was coming up im worried about the baby but i had to make her sick too it was her only hope i think im okay at least for the moment but of course the odds arent good most of the people involved in this business are already dead and there are so many things i cant know for sure the facility is destroyed but i dont know if we did it in time im waiting for mae she went to the lab in palo alto twelve hours ago i hope she succeeded i hope she made them understand how desperate the situation is i expected to hear from the lab but so far there has been no word i have ringing in my ears which is a bad sign and i feel a vibrating in my chest and abdomen the baby is spitting up not really vomiting i am feeling dizzy i hope i dont lose consciousness the kids need me especially the little one theyre frightened i dont blame them i am too sitting here in the dark its hard to believe that a week ago my biggest problem was finding a job it seems almost laughable now but then things never turn out the way you think they will home day am things never turn out the way you think they will i never intended to become a househusband stayathome husband fulltime dad whatever you want to call itthere is no good term for it but thats what i had become in the last six months now i was in crate barrel in downtown san jose picking up some extra glasses and while i was there i noticed they had a good selection of placemats we needed more placemats the woven oval ones that julia had bought a year ago were getting pretty worn and the weave was crusted with baby food the trouble was they were woven so you couldnt wash them so i stopped at the display to see if they had any placemats that might be good and i found some pale blue ones that were nice and i got some white napkins and then some yellow placemats caught my eye because they looked really bright and appealing so i got those too they didnt have six on the shelf and i thought wed better have six so i asked the salesgirl to look in the back and see if they had more while she was gone i put the placemat on the table and put a white dish on it and then i put a yellow napkin next to it the setting looked very cheerful and i began to think maybe i should get eight instead of six that was when my cell phone rang it was julia hi hon hi julia hows it going i said i could hear machinery in the background a steady chugging probably the vacuum pump for the electron microscope they had several scanning electron microscopes at her laboratory she said whatre you doing buying placemats actually where crate and barrel she laughed you the only guy there no oh well thats good she said i could tell julia was completely uninterested in this conversation something else was on her mind listen i wanted to tell you jack im really sorry but its going to be a late night again uhhuh the salesgirl came back carrying more yellow mats still holding the phone to my ear i beckoned her over i held up three fingers and she put down three more mats to julia i said is everything all right yeah its just crazy like normal were broadcasting a demo by satellite today to the vcs in asia and europe and were having trouble with the satellite hookup at this end because the video truck they sentoh you dont want to know anyway were going to be delayed two hours hon maybe more i wont get back until eight at the earliest can you feed the kids and put them to bed no problem i said and it wasnt i was used to it lately julia had been working very long hours most nights she didnt get home until the children were asleep xymos technology the company she worked for was trying to raise another round of venture capitaltwenty million dollarsand there was a lot of pressure especially since xymos was developing technology in what the company called molecular manufacturing but which most people called nanotechnology nano wasnt popular with the vcsthe venture capitaliststhese days too many vcs had been burned in the last ten years with products that were supposedly just around the corner but then never made it out of the lab the vcs considered nano to be all promise no products not that julia needed to be told that shed worked for two vc firms herself originally trained as a child psychologist she ended up as someone who specialized in technology incubation helping fledgling technology companies get started she used to joke she was still doing child psychology eventually shed stopped advising firms and joined one of them fulltime she was now a vice president at xymos julia said xymos had made several breakthroughs and was far ahead of others in the field she said they were just days away from a prototype commercial product but i took what she said with a grain of salt listen jack i want to warn you she said in a guilty voice that eric is going to be upset why well i told him i would come to the game julia why we talked about making promises like this theres no way you can make that game its at three oclock whyd you tell him you would i thought i could make it i sighed it was i told myself a sign of her caring okay dont worry honey ill handle it thanks oh and jack the placemats whatever you do just dont get yellow okay and she hung up i made spaghetti for dinner because there was never an argument about spaghetti by eight oclock the two little ones were asleep and nicole was finishing her homework she was twelve and had to be in bed by ten oclock though she didnt like any of her friends to know that the littlest one amanda was just nine months she was starting to crawl everywhere and to stand up holding on to things eric was eight he was a soccer kid and liked to play all the time when he wasnt dressing up as a knight and chasing his older sister around the house with his plastic sword nicole was in a modest phase of her life eric liked nothing better than to grab her bra and go running around the house shouting nicky wears a braa nicky wears a braa while nicole too dignified to pursue him gritted her teeth and yelled dad hes doing it again dad and i would have to go chase eric and tell him not to touch his sisters things this was what my life had become at first after i lost the job at mediatronics it was interesting to deal with sibling rivalry and often it seemed not that different from what my job had been at mediatronics i had run a program division riding herd over a group of talented young computer programmers at forty i was too old to work as a programmer myself anymore writing code is a young persons job so i managed the team and it was a fulltime job like most silicon valley programmers my team seemed to live in a perpetual crisis of crashed porsches infidelities bad love affairs parental hassles and drug reactions all superimposed on a forcedmarch work schedule with allnight marathons fueled by cases of diet coke and sun chips but the work was exciting in a cuttingedge field we wrote what are called distributed parallel processing or agentbased programs these programs model biological processes by creating virtual agents inside the computer and then letting the agents interact to solve realworld problems it sounds strange but it works fine for example one of our programs imitated ant foraginghow ants find the shortest path to foodto route traffic through a big telephone network other programs mimicked the behavior of termites swarming bees and stalking lions it was fun and i would probably still be there if i hadnt taken on some additional responsibilities in my last few months there id been put in charge of security replacing an outside tech consultant whod had the job for two years but had failed to detect the theft of company source code until it turned up in a program being marketed out of taiwan actually it was my divisions source codesoftware for distributed processing that was the code that had been stolen we knew it was the same code because the easter eggs hadnt been touched programmers always insert easter eggs into their code little nuggets that dont serve any useful purpose and are just put there for fun the taiwanese company hadnt changed any of them they used our code wholesale so the keystrokes altshiftm would open up a window giving the date of one of our programmers marriage clear theft of course we sued but don gross the head of the company wanted to make sure it didnt happen again so he put me in charge of security and i was angry enough about the theft to take the job it was only parttime i still ran the division the first thing i did as security officer was to monitor workstation use it was pretty straightforward these days eighty percent of companies monitor what their workers do at terminals they do it by video or they do it by recording keystrokes or by scanning email for certain keywords all sorts of procedures out there don gross was a tough guy an exmarine who had never lost his military manner when i told him about the new system he said but youre not monitoring my terminal right of course not i said in fact id set up the programs to monitor every computer in the company his included and that was how i discovered two weeks later that don was having an affair with a girl in accounting and had authorized her to have a company car i went to him and said that based on emails relating to jean in accounting it appeared that someone unknown was having an affair with her and that she might be getting perks she wasnt entitled to i said i didnt know who the person was but if they kept using email id soon find out i figured don would take the hint and he did but now he just sent incriminating email from his home never realizing that everything went through the company server and i was getting it all thats how i learned he was discounting software to foreign distributors and taking large consultant fees into an account in the cayman islands this was clearly illegal and i couldnt overlook it i consulted my attorney gary marder who advised me to quit quit i said yeah of course why who cares why you got a better offer elsewhere youve got some health problems or some family issues trouble at home just get out of there quit wait a minute i said you think i should quit because hes breaking the law is that your advice to me no gary said as your attorney my advice is that if you are aware of any illegal activity you have a duty to report it but as your friend my advice is to keep your mouth shut and get out of there fast seems kind of cowardly i think i have to notify the investors gary sighed he put his hand on my shoulder jack he said the investors can look out for themselves you get the fuck out of there i didnt think that was right i had been annoyed when my code had been stolen now i found myself wondering if it actually had been stolen maybe it had been sold we were a privately held company and i told one of the board members it turned out he was in on it i was fired the next day for gross negligence and misconduct litigation was threatened i had to sign a raft of ndas in order to get my severance package my attorney handled the paperwork for me sighing with every new document at the end we went outside into the milky sunshine i said well at least thats over he turned and looked at me why do you say that he said because of course it wasnt over in some mysterious way i had become a marked man my qualifications were excellent and i worked in a hot field but when i went on job interviews i could tell they werent interested worse they were uncomfortable silicon valley covers a big area but its a small place word gets out eventually i found myself talking to an interviewer i knew slightly ted landow id coached his kid in little league baseball the year before when the interview was over i said to him what have you heard about me he shook his head nothing jack i said ted ive been on ten interviews in ten days tell me theres nothing to tell ted he shuffled through his papers looking down at them not at me he sighed jack forman troublemaker not cooperative belligerent hotheaded not a team player he hesitated then said and supposedly you were involved in some kind of dealings they wont say what but some kind of shady dealings you were on the take i was on the take i said i felt a flood of anger and started to say more until i realized i was probably looking hotheaded and belligerent so i shut up and thanked him as i was leaving he said jack do yourself a favor give it a while things change fast in the valley your rйsumй is strong and your skill set is outstanding wait until he shrugged a couple of months id say four maybe five somehow i knew he was right after that i stopped trying so hard i began to hear rumors that mediatronics was going belly up and there might be indictments i smelled vindication ahead but in the meantime there was nothing to do but wait the strangeness of not going to work in the morning slowly faded julia was working longer hours at her job and the kids were demanding if i was in the house they turned to me instead of our housekeeper maria i started taking them to school picking them up driving them to the doctor the orthodontist soccer practice the first few dinners i cooked were disastrous but i got better and before i knew it i was buying placemats and looking at table settings in crate barrel and it all seemed perfectly normal julia got home around ninethirty i was watching the giants game on tv not really paying attention she came in and kissed me on the back of my neck she said they all asleep except nicole shes still doing homework jeez isnt it late for her to be up no hon i said we agreed this year she gets to stay up until ten remember julia shrugged as if she didnt remember and maybe she didnt we had undergone a sort of inversion of roles she had always been more knowledgeable about the kids but now i was sometimes julia felt uncomfortable with that experiencing it somehow as a loss of power hows the little one her cold is better just sniffles shes eating more i walked with julia to the bedrooms she went into the babys room bent over the crib and kissed the sleeping child tenderly watching her i thought there was something about a mothers caring that a father could never match julia had some connection to the kids that i never would or at least a different connection she listened to the babys soft breathing and said yes shes better then she went into erics room took the game boy off the bed covers gave me a frown i shrugged faintly irritated i knew eric played with his game boy when he was supposed to be going to sleep but i was busy getting the baby down at that time and i overlooked it i thought julia should be more understanding then she went into nicoles room nicole was on her laptop but shut the lid when her mother walked in hi mom youre up late no mom youre supposed to be doing homework i did it then why arent you in bed because i dont want you spending all night talking to your friends on the computer mom she said in a pained voice you see them every day at school that should be enough mom dont look at your father we already know hell do whatever you want im talking to you now she sighed i know mom this kind of interaction was increasingly common between nicole and julia i guess it was normal at this age but i thought id step in julia was tired and when she was tired she got rigid and controlling i put my arm around her shoulder and said its late for everybody want a cup of tea jack dont interfere im not i just yes you are im talking to nicole and youre interfering the way you always do honey we all agreed she could stay up until ten i dont know what this but if shes finished her homework she should go to bed that wasnt the deal i dont want her spending all day and night on the computer shes not julia at that point nicole burst into tears and jumped to her feet crying you always criticize me i hate you she ran into the bathroom and slammed the door that woke the baby who started to cry julia turned to me and said if you would please just let me handle this myself jack and i said youre right im sorry youre right in truth that wasnt what i thought at all more and more i regarded this as my house and my kids she was barging into my house late at night when id gotten everything quiet the way i liked it the way it should be and she was raising a fuss i didnt think she was right at all i thought she was wrong and in the last few weeks id noticed that incidents like this had become more frequent at first i thought julia felt guilty about being away so much then i thought she was reasserting her authority trying to regain control of a household that had fallen into my hands then i thought it was because she was tired or under so much pressure at work but lately i felt i was making excuses for her behavior i started to have the feeling julia had changed she was different somehow tenser tougher the baby was howling i picked her up from the crib hugged her cooed at her and simultaneously stuck a finger down the back of the diaper to see if it was wet it was i put her down on her back on top of the dresser and she howled again until i shook her favorite rattle and put it in her hand she was silent then allowing me to change her without much kicking ill do that julia said coming in its okay i woke her up its only right i do it really honey its fine julia put her hand on my shoulder kissed the back of my neck im sorry im such a jerk im really tired i dont know what came over me let me change the baby i never get to see her okay i said i stepped aside and she moved in hi poopsiedoopsie she said chucking the baby under the chin hows my little winkiedinkie all this attention made the baby drop the rattle and then she started to cry and to twist away on the table julia didnt notice the missing rattle caused the crying instead she made soothing sounds and struggled to put on the new diaper but the babys twisting and kicking made it hard amanda stop it i said she does that now and it was true amanda was in the stage where she actively resisted a diaper change and she could kick pretty hard well she should stop stop the baby cried louder tried to turn away one of the adhesive tabs pulled off the diaper slid down amanda was now rolling toward the edge of the dresser julia pulled her back roughly amanda never stopped kicking god damn it i said stop julia said and smacked the baby on the leg the baby just cried harder kicked harder amanda stop it stop it she slapped her again stop it stop it for a moment i didnt react i was stunned i didnt know what to do the babys legs were bright red julia was still hitting her honey i said leaning in lets not julia exploded why do you always fucking interfere she yelled slamming her hand down on the dresser what is your fucking problem and she stomped off leaving the room i let out a long breath and picked the baby up amanda howled inconsolably as much in confusion as in pain i figured i would need to give her a bottle to get her to sleep again i stroked her back until she settled down a little then i got her diaper on and brought her into the kitchen while i heated a bottle the lights were low just the fluorescents over the counter julia was sitting at the table drinking beer out of a bottle staring into space when are you going to get a job she said im trying really i dont think youre trying at all when was your last interview last week i said she grunted i wish youd hurry up and get one she said because this is driving me crazy i swallowed anger i know its hard for everybody i said it was late at night and i didnt want to argue anymore but i was watching her out of the corner of my eye at thirtysix julia was a strikingly pretty woman petite with dark hair and dark eyes upturned nose and the kind of personality that people called bubbly or sparkling unlike many tech executives she was attractive and approachable she made friends easily and had a good sense of humor years back when we first had nicole julia would come home with hilarious accounts of the foibles of her vc partners we used to sit at this same kitchen table and laugh until i felt physically sick while little nicole would tug at her arm and say whats the funny mom whats the funny because she wanted to be in on the joke of course we could never explain it to her but julia always seemed to have a new knock knock joke for nicole so she could join in the laughter too julia had a real gift for seeing the humorous side of life she was famous for her equanimity she almost never lost her temper right now of course she was furious not even willing to look at me sitting in the dark at the round kitchen table one leg crossed over the other kicking impatiently while she stared into space as i looked at her i had the feeling that her appearance had changed somehow of course she had lost weight recently part of the strain of the job a certain softness in her face was gone her cheekbones protruded more her chin seemed sharper it made her look harder but in a way more glamorous her clothes were different too julia was wearing a dark skirt and a white blouse sort of standard business attire but the skirt was tighter than usual and her kicking foot made me notice she was wearing slingback high heels what she used to call fuckme shoes the kind of shoes she would never wear to work and then i realized that everything about her was differenther manner her appearance her mood everythingand in a flash of insight i knew why my wife was having an affair the water on the stove began to steam and i pulled out the bottle tested it on my forearm it had gotten too hot and i would have to wait a minute for it to cool the baby started to cry and i bounced her a little on my shoulder while i walked her around the room julia never looked at me she just kept swinging her foot and staring into space i had read somewhere that this was a syndrome the husbands out of work his masculine appeal declines his wife no longer respects him and she wanders i had read that in glamour or redbook or one of those magazines around the house that i glanced through while waiting for the washing machine to finish its cycle or the microwave to thaw the hamburger but now i was flooded with confused feelings was it really true was i just tired making up bad stories in my mind after all what difference did it make if she was wearing tighter skirts and different shoes fashions changed people felt different on different days and just because she was sometimes angry did that really mean she was having an affair of course it didnt i was probably just feeling inadequate unattractive these were probably my insecurities coming out my thoughts went on in this vein for a while but for some reason i couldnt talk myself out of it i was sure it was true i had lived with this woman for more than twelve years i knew she was different and i knew why i could sense the presence of someone else an outside person some intruder in our relationship i felt it with a conviction that surprised me i felt it in my bones like an ache i had to turn away the baby took the bottle gurgling happily in the darkened kitchen she stared up at my face with that peculiar fixed stare that babies have it was sort of soothing watching her after a while she closed her eyes and then her mouth went slack i put her on my shoulder and burped her as i carried her back into her bedroom most parents pat their babies too hard trying to get a burp its better to just rub the flat of your hand up their back and sometimes just along the spine with two fingers she gave a soft belch and relaxed i set her down in the crib and i turned out the nightlight now the only light in the room came from the aquarium bubbling greenblue in the corner a plastic diver trudged along the bottom trailing bubbles as i turned to go i saw julia silhouetted in the doorway dark hair backlit she had been watching me i couldnt read her expression she stalked forward i tensed she put her arms around me and rested her head on my chest please forgive me she said im a real jerk youre doing a wonderful job im just jealous thats all my shoulder was wet with her tears i understand i said holding her its okay i waited to see if my body relaxed but it didnt i was suspicious and alert i had a bad feeling about her and it wasnt going away she came out of the shower into the bedroom toweling her short hair dry i was sitting on the bed trying to watch the rest of the game it occurred to me that she never used to take showers at night julia always took a shower in the morning before work now i realized she often came home and went straight to the shower before coming out to say hello to the kids my body was still tense i flicked the tv off i said how was the demo the what the demo didnt you have a demo today oh she said oh yes we did it went fine when we finally got it going the vcs in germany couldnt stay for all of it because of the time change butlisten do you want to see it what do you mean i have a dub of it want to see it i was surprised i shrugged okay sure id really like to know what you think jack i detected a patronizing tone my wife was including me in her work making me feel a part of her life i watched as she opened her briefcase and took out a dvd she stuck it in the player and came back to sit with me on the bed what were you demoing i said the new medical imaging technology she said its really slick if i say so myself she snuggled up tucking herself into my shoulder all very cozy just like old times i still felt uneasy but i put my arm around her by the way i said how come you take showers at night now instead of in the morning i dont know she said do i i guess i do it just seems easier honey mornings are so rushed and ive been getting those conference calls from europe they take so much timeokay here we go she said pointing to the screen i saw blackandwhite scramble and then the image resolved the tape showed julia in a large laboratory that was fitted out like an operating room a man lay on his back on the gurney an iv in his arm an anesthesiologist standing by above the table was a round flat metal plate about six feet in diameter which could be raised and lowered but was now raised there were video monitors all around and in the foreground peering at a monitor was julia there was a video technician by her side this is terrible she was saying pointing to the monitor whats all the interference we think its the air purifiers theyre causing it well this is unacceptable really yes really what do you want us to do i want you to fix it julia said then we have to boost power and you have i dont care she said i cant show the vcs an image of this quality theyve seen better pictures from mars fix it beside me on the bed julia said i didnt know they recorded all this this is before the demo you can fast forward i pushed the remote the picture scrambled i waited a few seconds and played it again same scene julia still in the foreground carol her assistant whispering to her okay but then what do i tell him tell him no but he wants to get started i understand but the transmission isnt for an hour tell him no on the bed julia said to me mad dog was our experimental subject he was very restless impatient to get started on the screen the assistant lowered her voice i think hes nervous julia i would be too with a couple of million of those things crawling around inside my body its not a couple of million and theyre not crawling julia said anyway theyre his invention even so isnt that an anesthesiologist over there no just a cardiologist well maybe the cardiologist can give him something for his nervousness they already did an injection on the bed beside me julia said fast forward jack i did the picture jumped ahead okay here i saw julia standing at the monitor again with the technician beside her thats acceptable onscreen julia was saying pointing to the image not great but acceptable now show me the stm the what the stm the electron microscope show me the image from that the technician looked confused uh nobody told us about any electron microscope for gods sake read the damn storyboards the technician blinked its on the storyboards did you look at the storyboards im sorry i guess i must have missed it theres no time now to be sorry fix it you dont have to shout yes i do i have to shout because im surrounded by idiots she waved her hands in the air im about to go online and talk to eleven billion dollars of venture capital in five countries and show them submicroscopic technology except i dont have a microscope feed so they cant see the technology on the bed julia said i kind of lost it with this guy it was so frustrating we had a clock counting down to the satellite time which was booked and locked we couldnt change it we had to make the time and this guy was a dimbus but eventually we got it working fast forward the screen showed a static card which read a private demonstration of advanced medical imaging by xymos technology mountain view ca world leader in molecular manufacturing then on the screen julia appeared standing in front of the gurney and the medical apparatus shed brushed her hair and tucked in her blouse hello to all of you she said smiling at the camera im julia forman of xymos technology and were about to demonstrate a revolutionary medical imaging procedure just developed here our subject peter morris is lying behind me on the table in a few moments were going to look inside his heart and blood vessels with an ease and accuracy never before possible she began walking around the table talking as she went unlike cardiac catheterization our procedure is one hundred percent safe and unlike catheterization we can look everywhere in the body at every sort of vessel no matter how large or small well see inside his aorta the largest artery of the body but well also look inside the alveoli of his lungs and the tiny capillaries of his fingertips we can do all this because the camera we put inside his vessels is smaller than a red blood cell quite a bit smaller actually xymos microfabrication technology can now produce these miniaturized cameras and produce them in quantitycheaply quickly it would take a thousand of them just to make a dot the size of a pencil point we can fabricate a kilogram of these cameras in an hour im sure you are all skeptical were well aware that nanotechnology has made promises it couldnt deliver as you know the problem has been that scientists could design molecularscale devices but they couldnt manufacture them but xymos has solved that problem it suddenly hit me what she was saying what i said sitting up in bed are you kidding if it was true it was an extraordinary development a genuine technological breakthrough and it meantits true julia said quietly were manufacturing in nevada she smiled enjoying my astonishment onscreen julia was saying i have one of our xymos cameras under the electron microscope hereshe pointed to the screenso you can see it in comparison to the red blood cell alongside it the image changed to blackandwhite i saw a fine probe push what looked like a tiny squid into position on a titanium field it was a bulletnosed lump with streaming filaments at the rear it was a tenth of the size of the red blood cell which in the vacuum of the scanning electron microscope was a wrinkled oval like a gray raisin our camera is one tenbillionth of an inch in length as you see it is shaped like a squid julia said imaging takes place in the nose microtubules in the tail provide stabilization like the tail of a kite but they can also lash actively and provide locomotion jerry if we can turn the camera to see the nose okay there thank you now from the front you see that indentation in the center that is the miniature gallium arsenide photon detector acting as a retina and the surrounding banded areasort of like a radial tireis bioluminescent and lights the area ahead within the nose itself you may be able to just make out a rather complex series of twisted molecules that is our patented atp cascade you can think of it as a primitive brain which controls the behavior of the cameravery limited behavior true but enough for our purposes i heard a hiss of static and a cough the screen image opened a small window in the corner and now showed fritz leidermeyer in germany the investor shifted his enormous bulk im sorry ms forman tell me please where is the lens there is no lens how can you have a camera with no lens ill explain that as we go she said watching i said it must be a camera obscura right she said nodding camera obscuralatin for dark roomwas the oldest imaging device known the romans had found that if you made a small hole in the wall of a dark room an upsidedown image of the exterior appeared on the opposite wall that was because light coming through any small aperture was focused as if by a lens it was the same principle as a kids pinhole camera it was why ever since roman times imagerecording devices were called cameras but in this casewhat makes the aperture i said is there a pinhole i thought you knew she said youre responsible for that part me yes xymos licensed some agentbased algorithms that your team wrote no i didnt know which algorithms to control a particle network your cameras are networked all those little cameras communicate with each other yes she said theyre a swarm actually she was still smiling amused by my reactions a swarm i was thinking it over trying to understand what she was telling me certainly my team had written a number of programs to control swarms of agents those programs were modeled on behavior of bees the programs had many useful characteristics because swarms were composed of many agents the swarm could respond to the environment in a robust way faced with new and unexpected conditions the swarm programs didnt crash they just sort of flowed around the obstacles and kept going but our programs worked by creating virtual agents inside the computer julia had created real agents in the real world at first i didnt see how our programs could be adapted to what she was doing we use them for structure she said the program makes the swarm structure of course it was obvious that a single molecular camera was inadequate to register any sort of image therefore the image must be a composite of millions of cameras operating simultaneously but the cameras would also have to be arranged in space in some orderly structure probably a sphere that was where the programming came in but that in turn meant that xymos must be generating the equivalent ofyoure making an eye kind of yes but wheres the light source the bioluminescent perimeter thats not enough light it is watch meanwhile the onscreen julia was turning smoothly pointing to the intravenous line behind her she lifted a syringe out of a nearby ice bucket the barrel appeared to be filled with water this syringe she said contains approximately twenty million cameras in isotonic saline suspension at the moment they exist as particles but once they are injected into the bloodstream their temperature will increase and they will soon flock together and form a metashape just like a flock of birds forms a vshape what kind of a shape one of the vcs asked a sphere she said with a small opening at one end you might think of it as the equivalent of a blastula in embryology but in effect the particles form an eye and the image from that eye will be a composite of millions of photon detectors just as the human eye creates an image from its rods and cone cells she turned to a monitor that showed an animation loop repeated over and over again the cameras entered the bloodstream as an untidy disorganized mass a kind of buzzing cloud within the blood immediately the blood flow flattened the cloud into an elongated streak but within seconds the streak began to coalesce into a spherical shape that shape became more defined until eventually it appeared almost solid if this reminds you of an actual eye theres a reason here at xymos we are explicitly imitating organic morphology julia said because we are designing with organic molecules we are aware that courtesy of millions of years of evolution the world around us has a stockpile of molecular arrangements that work so we use them you dont want to reinvent the wheel someone said exactly or the eyeball she gave a signal and the flat antenna was lowered until it was just inches above the waiting subject this antenna will power the camera and pick up the transmitted image she said the image can of course be digitally stored intensified manipulated or anything else that you might do with digital data now if there are no other questions we can begin she fitted the syringe with a needle and stuck it into a rubber stopper in the iv line mark time zero point zero here we go she pushed the plunger down quickly as you see im doing it fast she said theres nothing delicate about our procedure you cant hurt anything if the microturbulence generated by the flow through the needle rips the tubules from a few thousand cameras it doesnt matter we have millions more plenty to do the job she withdrew the needle okay generally we have to wait about ten seconds for the shape to form and then we should begin getting an image ah looks like something is coming now and here it is the scene showed the camera moving forward at considerable speed through what looked like an asteroid field except the asteroids were red cells bouncy purplish bags moving in a clear slightly yellowish liquid an occasional much larger white cell shot forward filled the screen for a moment then was gone what i was seeing looked more like a video game than a medical image julia i said this is pretty amazing beside me julia snuggled closer and smiled i thought you might be impressed onscreen julia was saying weve entered a vein so the red cells are not oxygenated right now our camera is moving toward the heart youll see the vessels enlarging as we move up the venous system yes now we are approaching the heart you can see the pulsations in the bloodstream that result from the ventricular contractions it was true i could see the camera pause then move forward then pause she had an audio feed of the beating heart on the table the subject lay motionless with the flat antenna just over his body were coming to the right atrium and we should see the mitral valve we activate the flagella to slow the camera there the valve is now we are in the heart i saw the red flaps like a mouth opening and closing and then the camera shot through into the ventricle and out again now we are going to the lungs where you will see what no one has ever witnessed before the oxygenation of the cells as i watched the blood vessel narrowed swiftly and then the cells plumped up and popped brilliantly red one after another it was extremely quick in less than a second they were all red the red cells have now been oxygenated julia said and we are on our way back to the heart i turned to julia in the bed this is really fantastic stuff i said but her eyes were closed and she was breathing gently julia she was asleep julia had always tended to fall asleep while watching tv falling asleep during your own presentation was reasonable enough after all shed already seen it and it was pretty late i was tired myself i decided i could watch the rest of the demo another time it seemed pretty lengthy for a demo anyhow how long had i been watching so far when i turned to switch off the tv i looked down at the time code running at the bottom of the image numbers were spinning ticking off hundredths of a second other numbers to the left not spinning i frowned one of them was the date i hadnt noticed it before because it was in international format with the year first the day and the month it read september yesterday shed recorded this demo yesterday not today i turned off the tv and turned off the bedside light i lay down on the pillow and tried to sleep day am we needed skim milk toastieos poptarts jello dishwasher detergentand something else but i couldnt read my own writing i stood in the supermarket aisle at nine oclock in the morning puzzling over my notes a voice said hey jack hows it hanging i looked up to see ricky morse one of the division heads at xymos hey ricky how are you i shook his hand genuinely glad to see him i was always glad to see ricky tanned with blond crewcut hair and a big grin he could easily be taken for a surfer were it not for his sourceforge tshirt ricky was only a few years younger than i was but he had an air of perpetual youthfulness id given him his first job right out of college and hed rapidly moved into management with his cheerful personality and upbeat manner ricky made an ideal project manager even though he tended to underplay problems and give management unrealistic expectations about when a project would be finished according to julia that had sometimes caused trouble at xymos ricky tended to make promises he couldnt keep and sometimes he didnt quite tell the truth but he was so cheerful and appealing that everyone always forgave him at least i always did when he worked for me i had become quite fond of him and thought of him almost as a younger brother id recommended him for his job at xymos ricky was pushing a shopping cart filled with disposable diapers in big plastic bundles he had a young baby at home too i asked him why he was shopping and not at the office marys got the flu and the maids in guatemala so i told her id pick up some things i see youve got huggies i said i always get pampers myself i find huggies absorb more he said and pampers are too tight they pinch the babys leg but pampers have a layer that takes moisture away and keeps the bottom dry i said i have fewer rashes with pampers whenever i use them the adhesive tabs tend to pull off and with a big load it tends to leak out the leg which makes extra work for me i dont know i just find huggies are higher quality a woman glanced at us as she pushed past with her shopping cart we started to laugh thinking we must sound like we were in a commercial ricky said loudly so hey how about those giants to the womans back as she continued down the aisle fuckin a are they great or what i said scratching myself we laughed then pushed our carts down the aisle together ricky said want to know the truth mary likes huggies and thats the end of the conversation i know that one i said ricky looked at my cart and said i see you buy organic skim milk stop it i said how are things at the office you know theyre pretty damn good he said the technologys coming along nicely if i say so myself we demoed for the money guys the other day and it went well julias doing okay i said as casually as i could yeah shes doing great far as i know ricky said i glanced at him was he suddenly reserved was his face set the muscles controlled was he concealing something i couldnt tell actually i rarely see her ricky said shes not around much these days i dont see much of her either i said yeah shes spending a lot of time out at the fab complex thats where the action is now ricky glanced quickly at me you know because of the new fabrication processes the xymos fab building had been completed in record time considering how complex it was the fabrication building was where they assembled molecules from individual atoms sticking the molecule fragments together like lego blocks much of this work was carried out in a vacuum and required extremely strong magnetic fields so the fab building had tremendous pump assemblies and powerful chillers to cool the magnets but according to julia a lot of the technology was specific to that building nothing like it had ever been built before i said its amazing they got the building up so fast well we kept the pressure on molecular dynamics is breathing down our necks weve got our fab up and running and weve got patent applications by the truckload but those guys at moldyne and nanotech cant be far behind us a few months maybe six months if were lucky so youre doing molecular assembly at the plant now i said you got it jack fullbore molecular assembly we have been for a few weeks now i didnt know julia was interested in that stuff with her background in psychology id always regarded julia as a people person shes taken a real interest in the technology i can tell you also theyre doing a lot of programming up there too he said you know iterative cycles as they refine the manufacturing i nodded what kind of programming i said distributed processing multiagent nets thats how we keep the individual units coordinated working together this is all to make the medical camera yes he paused among other things he glanced at me uneasily as if he might be breaking his confidentiality agreement you dont have to say i said no no he said quickly jeez you and i go way back jack he slapped me on the shoulder and you got a spouse in management i mean what the hell but he still looked uneasy his face didnt match his words and his eyes slid away from me when he said the word spouse the conversation was coming to an end and i felt filled with tension the kind of awkward tension when you think another guy knows something and isnt telling youbecause hes embarrassed because he doesnt know how to put it because he doesnt want to get involved because its too dangerous even to mention because he thinks its your job to figure it out for yourself especially when its something about your wife like shes screwing around hes looking at you like youre the walking wounded its night of the living dead but he wont tell you in my experience guys never tell other guys when they know something about their wives but women always tell other women if they know of a husbands infidelity thats just how it is but i was feeling so tense i wanted tohey look at the time ricky said giving me a big grin im late maryll kill me ive got to run shes already annoyed because i have to spend the next few days at the fab facility so ill be out of town while the maids gone he shrugged you know how it is yeah i do good luck hey man take care we shook hands murmured another goodbye ricky rolled his cart around the corner of the aisle and was gone sometimes you cant think about painful things you cant make your mind focus on them your brain just slips away no thank you lets change the subject that was happening to me now i couldnt think about julia so i started thinking about what ricky had told me about their fabrication plant and i decided it probably made sense even though it went against the conventional wisdom about nanotechnology there was a longstanding fantasy among nanotechnologists that once somebody figured out how to manufacture at the atomic level it would be like running the fourminute mile everybody would do it unleashing a flood of wonderful molecular creations rolling off assembly lines all around the world in a matter of days human life would be changed by this marvelous new technology as soon as somebody figured out how to do it but of course that would never happen the very idea was absurd because in essence molecular manufacturing wasnt so different from computer manufacturing or flowvalve manufacturing or automobile manufacturing or any other kind of manufacturing it took a while to get it right in fact assembling atoms to make a new molecule was closely analogous to compiling a computer program from individual lines of code and computer code never compiled the first time out the programmers always had to go back and fix the lines and even after it was compiled a computer program never ever worked right the first time or the second time or the hundredth time it had to be debugged and debugged again and again and again i always believed it would be the same with these manufactured moleculestheyd have to be debugged again and again before they worked right and if xymos wanted flocks of molecules working together theyd also have to debug the way the molecules communicated with each other however limited that communication was because once the molecules communicated you had a primitive network to organize it youd probably program a distributed net of the kind i had been developing at mediatronics so i could perfectly well imagine them doing programming along with the manufacturing but i couldnt see julia hanging around while they did it the fab facility was far from the xymos headquarters it was literally in the middle of nowhereout in the desert near tonopah nevada and julia didnt like to be in the middle of nowhere i was sitting in the pediatricians waiting room because the baby was due for her next round of immunizations there were four mothers in the room bouncing sick kids on their laps while the older children played on the floor the mothers all talked to each other and studiously ignored me i was getting used to this a guy at home a guy in a setting like the pediatricians office was an unusual thing but it also meant that something was wrong there was probably something wrong with the guy he couldnt get a job maybe he was fired for alcoholism or drugs maybe he was a bum whatever the reason it wasnt normal for a man to be in the pediatricians office in the middle of the day so the other mothers pretended i wasnt there except they shot me the occasional worried glance as if i might be sneaking up on them to rape them while their backs were turned even the nurse gloria seemed suspicious she glanced at the baby in my armswho wasnt crying and was hardly sniffling what seems to be the problem i said we were here for immunizations shes been here before yes she had been coming to the doctor since she was born are you related yes i was the father eventually we were ushered in the doctor shook hands with me was very friendly never asked why i was there instead of my wife or the housekeeper he gave two injections amanda howled i bounced her on my shoulder comforted her she may have a little swelling a little local redness call me if its not gone in fortyeight hours then i was back in the waiting room trying to get out my credit card to pay the bill while the baby cried and that was when julia called hi whatre you doing she must have heard the baby screaming paying the pediatrician bad time kind of okay listen i just wanted to say i have an early nightfinallyso ill be home for dinner what do you say i pick up on my way home thatd be great i said erics soccer practice ran late it was getting dark on the field the coach always ran practice late i paced the sidelines trying to decide whether to complain it was so hard to know when you were coddling your kid and when you were legitimately protecting them nicole called on her cell to say that her play rehearsal was over and why hadnt i picked her up where was i i said i was still with eric and asked if she could catch a ride with anybody dad she said exasperated youd think i had asked her to crawl home hey im stuck very sarcastic whatever watch that tone young lady but a few minutes later soccer was abruptly canceled a big green maintenance truck pulled onto the field and two men came out wearing masks and big rubber gloves with spray cans on their backs they were going to spray weed killer or something and everybody had to stay off the field overnight i called nicole back and said we would pick her up when were on our way now from the little creeps practice come on nic why does he always come first he doesnt always come first yes he does hes a little creep nicole sorry see you in a few minutes i clicked off kids are more advanced these days the teenage years now start at eleven by fivethirty the kids were home raiding the fridge nicole was eating a big chunk of string cheese i told her to stop it would ruin her dinner then i went back to setting the table when is dinner soon moms bringing it home uhhuh she disappeared for a few minutes and then she came back she says shes sorry she didnt call but shes going to be late what i was pouring water into the glasses on the table shes sorry she didnt call but shes going to be late i just talked to her jesus it was irritating i tried never to show my irritation around the kids but sometimes it slipped out i sighed okay im really hungry now dad get your brother and get into the car i said were going to the drivein later that night as i was carrying the baby to bed my elbow brushed against a photograph on the livingroom bookshelf it clattered to the floor i stooped to pick it up it was a picture of julia and eric in sun valley when he was four they were both in snowsuits julia was helping him learn to ski and smiling radiantly next to it was a photo of julia and me on our eleventh wedding anniversary in kona i was in a loud hawaiian shirt and she had colorful leis around her neck and we were kissing at sunset that was a great trip in fact we were pretty sure amanda was conceived there i remember julia came home from work one day and said honey remember how you said maitais were dangerous i said yes and she said well let me put it this way its a girl and i was so startled the soda i was drinking went up my nose and we both started to laugh then a picture of julia making cupcakes with nicole who was so young she sat on the kitchen counter and her legs didnt reach the edge she couldnt have been more than a year and a half old nicole was frowning with concentration as she wielded a huge spoon of dough making a fine mess while julia tried not to laugh and a photo of us hiking in colorado julia holding the hand of sixyearold nicole while i carried eric on my shoulders my shirt collar dark with sweator worse if i remembered that day right eric must have been about two he was still in diapers i remember he thought it was fun to cover my eyes while i carried him on the trail the hiking photo had slipped inside its frame so it stood at an angle i tapped the frame to try and straighten it but it didnt move i noticed that several of the other pictures were faded or the emulsion was sticking to the glass no one had bothered to take care of these pictures the baby snuffled in my arms rubbing her eyes with her fists it was time for bed i put the pictures back on the shelf they were old images from another happier time from another life they seemed to have nothing to do with me anymore everything was different now the world was different now i left the table set for dinner that night a silent rebuke julia saw it when she got home around ten im sorry hon i know you were busy i said i was please forgive me i do i said youre the best she blew me a kiss from across the room im going to take a shower she said and she headed off down the hallway i watched her go on the way down the hall she looked into the babys room and then darted in a moment later i heard her cooing and the baby gurgling i got out of my chair and walked down the hall after her in the darkened nursery she was holding the baby up nuzzling her nose i said julia you woke her up no i didnt she was awake werent you little honeybunny you were awake werent you poopsiedoopsie the baby rubbed her eyes with tiny fists and yawned she certainly appeared to have been awakened julia turned to me in the darkness i didnt really i didnt wake her up why are you looking at me that way what way you know what way that accusing way im not accusing you of anything the baby started to whimper and then to cry julia touched her diaper i think shes wet she said and handed her to me as she walked out of the room you do it mr perfect now there was tension between us after i changed the baby and put her back to bed i heard julia come out of the shower banging a door whenever julia started banging doors it was a sign for me to come and mollify her but i didnt feel like it tonight i was annoyed shed awakened the baby and i was annoyed by her unreliability saying shed be home early and never calling to say she wouldnt i was scared that she had become so unreliable because she was distracted by a new love or she just didnt care about her family anymore i didnt know what to do about all this but i didnt feel like smoothing the tension between us i just let her bang the doors she slammed her sliding closetdoor so hard the wood cracked she swore that was another sign i was supposed to come running i went back to the living room and sat down i picked up the book i was reading and stared at the page i tried to concentrate but of course i couldnt i was angry and i listened to her bang around in the bedroom if she kept it up shed wake eric and then i would have to deal with her i hoped it wouldnt go that far eventually the noise stopped she had probably gotten into bed if so she would soon be asleep julia could go to sleep when we were fighting i never could i stayed up pacing and angry trying to settle myself down when i finally came to bed julia was fast asleep i slipped between the covers and rolled over on my side away from her it was one oclock in the morning when the baby began to scream i groped for the light knocked over the alarm clock which turned the clock radio on blaring rock and roll i swore fumbled in the dark finally got the bedside light on turned the radio off the baby was still screaming whats the matter with her julia said sleepily i dont know i got out of bed shaking my head trying to wake up i went into the nursery and flicked on the light the room seemed very bright the clown wallpaper very yellow and burning out of nowhere i thought why doesnt she want yellow placemats when she painted the whole nursery yellow the baby was standing up in her crib holding on to the rails and howling her mouth wide open her breath coming in jagged gasps tears were running down her cheeks i held my arms out to her and she reached for me and i comforted her i thought it must be a nightmare i comforted her rocked her gently she continued to scream unrelenting maybe something was hurting her maybe something in her diaper i checked her body that was when i saw an angry red rash on her belly extending in welts around to her back and up toward her neck julia came in cant you stop it she said i said theres something wrong and i showed her the rash has she got a fever i touched amandas head she was sweaty and hot but that could be from the crying the rest of her body felt cool i dont know i dont think so i could see the rash on her thighs now was it on her thighs a moment before i almost thought i was seeing it spread before my eyes if it was possible the baby screamed even louder jesus julia said ill call the doctor yeah do by now i had the baby on her backshe screamed moreand i was looking carefully at her entire body the rash was spreading there was no doubt about it and she seemed to be in terrible pain screaming bloody murder im sorry honey im sorry i said definitely spreading julia came back and said she left word for the doctor i said im not going to wait im taking her to the emergency room do you really think thats necessary she said i didnt answer her i just went into the bedroom to put on my clothes julia said do you want me to come with you no stay with the kids i said you sure yes okay she said she wandered back to the bedroom i reached for my car keys the baby continued to scream i realize its uncomfortable the intern was saying but i dont think its safe to sedate her we were in a curtained cubicle in the emergency room the intern was bent over my screaming daughter looking in her ears with his instrument by now amandas entire body was bright angry red she looked as if she had been parboiled i felt scared id never heard of anything like this before a baby turning bright red and screaming constantly i didnt trust this intern who seemed far too young to be competent he couldnt be experienced he didnt even look as if he shaved yet i was jittery shifting my weight from one foot to the other i was beginning to feel slightly crazy because my daughter had never stopped screaming once in the last hour it was wearing me down the intern ignored it i didnt know how he could she has no fever he said making notes in a chart but in a child this age that doesnt mean anything under a year they may not run fevers at all even with severe infections is that what this is i said an infection i dont know im presuming a virus because of that rash but we should have the preliminary blood work back inah good a passing nurse handed him a slip of paper uhh hmmm he paused well well what i said shifting my weight anxiously he was shaking his head as he stared at the paper he didnt answer well what its not an infection he said white cells counts all normal protein fractions normal shes got no immune mobilization at all what does that mean he was very calm standing there frowning and thinking i wondered if perhaps he was just dumb the best people werent going into medicine anymore not with the hmos running everything this kid might be one of the new breed of dumb doctor we have to widen the diagnostic net he said im going to order a surgical consult a neurological consult we have a dermo coming we have infectious coming thatll mean a lot of people to talk to you about your daughter asking the same questions over again but thats okay i said i dont mind just what do you think is wrong with her i dont know mr forman if its not infectious we look for other reasons for this skin response she hasnt traveled out of the country no i shook my head no recent exposures to heavy metals or toxins like what dump sites industrial plants chemical exposure no no can you think of anything at all that might have caused this reaction no nothing wait she had vaccinations yesterday what vaccinations i dont know whatever she gets for her age you dont know what vaccinations he said his notebook was open his pen poised over the page no for christs sake i said irritably i dont know what vaccinations every time she goes there she gets another shot youre the goddamned doctor thats okay mr forman he said soothingly i know its stressful if you just tell me the name of your pediatrician ill call him how is that i nodded i wiped my hand across my forehead i was sweating i spelled the pediatricians name for him while he wrote it down in his notebook i tried to calm down i tried to think clearly and all the time my baby just screamed half an hour later she went into convulsions they started while one of the whitecoated consultants was bent over her examining her her little body wrenched and twisted she made retching sounds as if she was trying to vomit her legs jerked spastically she began to wheeze her eyes rolled up into her head i dont remember what i said or did then but a big orderly the size of a football player came in and pushed me to one side of the cubicle and held my arms i looked past his huge shoulder as six people clustered around my daughter a nurse wearing a bart simpson tshirt was sticking a needle into her forehead i began to shout and struggle the orderly was yelling scowvane scowvane scowvane over and over finally i realized he was saying scalp vein he explained it was just to start an iv that the baby had become dehydrated that was why she was convulsing i heard talk of electrolytes magnesium potassium anyway the convulsions stopped in a few seconds but she continued to scream i called julia she was awake how is she the same still crying is that her yes she could hear amanda in the background oh god she groaned what are they saying it is they dont know yet oh the poor baby there have been about fifty doctors in here to look at her is there anything i can do i dont think so okay let me know okay im not sleeping okay shortly before dawn the huddled consultants announced that she either had an intestinal obstruction or a brain tumor they couldnt decide which and they ordered an mri the sky was beginning to lighten when she was finally wheeled to the imaging room the big white machine stood in the center of the room the nurse told me it would calm the baby if i helped her prepare her and she took the needle out of her scalp because there couldnt be any metal during the mri reading blood squirted down amandas face into her eye the nurse wiped it away now amanda was strapped onto the white board that rolled into the depths of the machine my daughter was staring up at the mri in terror still screaming the nurse told me i could wait in the next room with the technician i went into a room with a glass window that looked in on the mri machine the technician was foreign dark how old is she is it a she yes she nine months quite a set of lungs on her yes here we go he was fiddling at his knobs and dials hardly looking at my daughter amanda was completely inside the machine her sobs sounded tinny over the microphone the technician flicked a switch and the pump began to chatter it made a lot of noise but i could still hear my daughter screaming and then abruptly she stopped she was completely silent uhoh i said i looked at the technician and the nurse their faces registered shock we all thought the same thing that something terrible had happened my heart began to pound the technician hastily shut down the pumps and we hurried back into the room my daughter was lying there still strapped down breathing heavily but apparently fine she blinked her eyes slowly as if dazed already her skin was noticeably a lighter shade of pink with patches of normal color the rash was fading right before our eyes ill be damned the technician said back in the emergency room they wouldnt let amanda go home the surgeons still thought she had a tumor or a bowel emergency and they wanted to keep her in the hospital for observation but the rash continued to clear steadily over the next hour the pink color faded and vanished no one could understand what had happened and the doctors were uneasy the scalp vein iv was back in on the other side of her forehead but amanda took a bottle of formula guzzling it down hungrily while i held her she was staring up at me with her usual hypnotic feeding stare she really seemed to be fine she fell asleep in my arms i sat there for another hour then began to make noises about how i had to get back to my kids i had to get them to school and not long afterward the doctors announced another victory for modern medicine and sent me home with her amanda slept soundly all the way and didnt wake when i got her out of her car seat the night sky was turning gray when i carried her up the driveway and into the house day am the house was silent the kids were still asleep i found julia standing in the dining room looking out the window at the backyard the sprinklers were on hissing and clicking julia held a cup of coffee and stared out the window unmoving i said were back she turned shes okay i held out the baby to her seems to be thank god she said i was so worried jack but she didnt approach amanda and didnt touch her i was so worried her voice was strange distant she didnt really sound worried she sounded formal like someone reciting the rituals of another culture that they didnt really understand she took a sip from her coffee mug i couldnt sleep all night she said i was so worried i felt awful god her eyes flicked to my face then away she looked guilty want to hold her i uh julia shook her head and nodded to the coffee cup in her hand not right now she said i have to check the sprinklers theyre overwatering my roses and she walked into the backyard i watched her go out in the back and stand looking at the sprinklers she glanced back at me then made a show of checking the timer box on the wall she opened the lid and looked inside i didnt get it the gardeners had adjusted the sprinkler timers just last week maybe they hadnt done it right amanda snuffled in my arms i took her into the nursery to change her and put her back in bed when i returned i saw julia in the kitchen talking on her cell phone this was another new habit of hers she didnt use the house phone much anymore she used her cell when i had asked her about it shed said it was just easier because she was calling long distance a lot and the company paid her cellular bills i slowed my approach and walked on the carpet i heard her say yes damn it of course i do but we have to be careful now she looked up and saw me coming her tone immediately changed okay uh look carol i think we can handle that with a phone call to frankfurt follow up with a fax and let me know how he responds all right and she snapped the phone shut i came into the kitchen jack i hate to leave before the kids are up but youve got to go im afraid so somethings come up at work i glanced at my watch it was a quarter after six okay she said so will you uh the kids sure ill handle everything thanks ill call you later and she was gone i was so tired i wasnt thinking clearly the baby was still asleep and with luck shed sleep several hours more my housekeeper maria came in at sixthirty and put out the breakfast bowls the kids ate and i drove them to school i was trying hard to stay awake i yawned eric was sitting on the front seat next to me he yawned too sleepy today he nodded those men kept waking me up he said what men the men that came in the house last night what men i said the vacuum men he said they vacuumed everything and they vacuumed up the ghost from the backseat nicole snickered the ghost i said i think you were dreaming son lately eric had been having vivid nightmares that often woke him in the night i was pretty sure it was because nicole let him watch horror movies with her knowing they would upset him nicole was at the age where her favorite movies featured masked killers who murdered teenagers after they had had sex it was the old formula you have sex you die but it wasnt appropriate for eric id spoken to her many times about letting him see them no dad it wasnt a dream eric said yawning again the men were there a whole bunch of them uhhuh and what was the ghost he was a ghost all silver and shimmery except he didnt have a face uhhuh by now we were pulling up at the school and nicole was saying i had to pick her up at instead of because she had a chorus rehearsal after class and eric was saying he wasnt going to his pediatrician appointment if he had to get a shot i repeated the timeless mantra of all parents well see the two kids piled out of the car dragging their backpacks behind them they both had backpacks that weighed about twenty pounds i never got used to this kids didnt have huge backpacks when i was their age we didnt have backpacks at all now it seemed all the kids had them you saw little secondgraders bent over like sherpas dragging themselves through the school doors under the weight of their packs some of the kids had their packs on rollers hauling them like luggage at the airport i didnt understand any of this the world was becoming digital everything was smaller and lighter but kids at school lugged more weight than ever a couple of months ago at a parents meeting id asked about it and the principal said yes its a big problem were all concerned and then changed the subject i didnt get that either if they were all concerned why didnt they do something about it but of course thats human nature nobody does anything until its too late we put the stoplight at the intersection after the kid is killed i drove home again through sluggish morning traffic i was thinking i might get a couple of hours of sleep it was the only thing on my mind maria woke me up around eleven shaking my shoulder insistently mr forman mr forman i was groggy what is it the baby i was immediately awake what about her you see the baby mr forman she all she made a gesture rubbing her shoulder and arm shes all what you see the baby mr forman i staggered out of bed and went into the nursery amanda was standing up in her crib holding on to the railing she was bouncing and smiling happily everything seemed normal except for the fact that her entire body was a uniform purpleblue color like a big bruise oh jesus i said i couldnt take another episode at the hospital i couldnt take more whitecoated doctors who didnt tell you anything i couldnt take being scared all over again i was still drained from the night before the thought that there was something wrong with my daughter wrenched my stomach i went over to amanda who gurgled with pleasure smiling up at me she stretched one hand toward me grasping air her signal for me to pick her up so i picked her up she seemed fine immediately grabbing my hair and trying to pull off my glasses the way she always did i felt relieved even though i could now see her skin better it looked bruisedit was the color of a bruiseexcept it was absolutely uniform everywhere on her body amanda looked like shed been dipped in dye the evenness of the color was alarming i decided i had to call the doctor in the emergency room after all i fished in my pocket for his card while amanda tried to grab my glasses i dialed onehanded i could do pretty much everything onehanded i got right through he sounded surprised oh he said i was just about to call you how is your daughter feeling well she seems to feel fine i said jerking my head back so amanda couldnt get my glasses she was giggling it was a game now shes fine i said but the thing is has she by any chance had bruising yes i said as a matter of fact she has thats why i was calling you the bruising is all over her body uniformly yes i said pretty much why do you ask well the doctor said all her lab work has come back and its all normal completely normal healthy child the only thing were still waiting on is the mri report but the mris broken down they say itll be a few days i couldnt keep ducking and weaving i put amanda back in her crib while i talked she didnt like that of course and scrunched up her face preparing to cry i gave her her cookie monster toy and she sat down and played with that i knew cookie monster was good for about five minutes anyway the doctor was saying im glad to hear shes doing well i said that i was glad too there was a pause the doctor coughed mr forman i noticed on your hospital admissions form you said your occupation was software engineer thats right does that mean you are involved with manufacturing no i do program development and where do you do that work in the valley you dont work in a factory for example no i work in an office i see a pause may i ask where actually at the moment im unemployed i see all right how long has that been six months i see a short pause well okay i just wanted to clear that up i said why im sorry why are you asking me those questions oh theyre on the form what form i said i filled out all the forms at the hospital this is another form he said its an ohs inquiry office of health and safety i said whats this all about theres been another case reported he said thats very similar to your daughters where sacramento general when five days ago but its a completely different situation this case involved a fortytwoyearold naturalist sleeping out in the sierras some wildflower expert there was a particular kind of flower or something anyway he was hospitalized in sacramento and he had the same clinical course as your daughtersudden unexplained onset no fever painful erythematous reaction and an mri stopped it i dont know if he had an mri he said but apparently this syndromewhatever it isis selflimited very sudden onset and very abrupt termination hes okay now the naturalist hes fine a couple of days of bruising and nothing more good i said im glad to hear it i thought youd want to know he said then he said he might be calling me again with some more questions and would that be all right i said he could call whenever he wanted he asked me to call if there was any change in amanda and i said i would and i hung up amanda had abandoned cookie monster and was standing in the crib holding on to the railing with one hand and reaching for me with the other her little fingers clutching air i picked her upand in an instant she had my glasses off i grabbed for them as she squealed with pleasure amanda but too late she threw them on the floor i blinked i dont see well without my glasses these were wireframes hard to see now i got down on my hands and knees still holding the baby and swept my hand across the floor in circles hoping to touch glass i didnt i squinted edged forward swept my hand again still nothing then i saw a glint of light underneath the crib i set the baby down and crawled under the crib retrieved the glasses and put them on in the process i banged my head on the crib dropped down low again and i found myself staring at the electrical outlet on the wall underneath the crib a small plastic box was plugged into the outlet i pulled it out and looked at it it was a twoinch cube a surge suppressor by the look of it an ordinary commercial product made in thailand the inputoutput voltages were molded into the plastic a white label ran across the bottom reading prop ssvt with a bar code it was one of those stickers that companies put on their inventory i turned the cube over in my hand where had this come from id been in charge of the house for the last six months i knew what was where and certainly amanda didnt need a surge suppressor in her room you only needed that for sensitive electronic equipment like computers i got to my feet and looked around the room to see what else was different to my surprise i realized that everything was differentbut just slightly different amandas nightlight had winniethepooh characters printed on the shade i always kept tigger facing toward her crib because tigger was her favorite now eeyore faced the crib amandas changing pad was stained in one corner i always kept the stain bottom left now it was top right i kept her diaperrash ointments on the counter to the left just out of her reach now they were too close she could grab them and there was morethe maid came in behind me maria i said did you clean this room no mr forman but the room is different i said she looked around and shrugged no mr forman the same no no i insisted its different look i pointed to the lampshade the changing cloth different she shrugged again okay mr forman i read confusion in her face either she didnt follow what i was saying or she thought i was crazy and i probably did look a little crazy a grown man obsessing about a winniethepooh lampshade i showed her the cube in my hand have you seen this before she shook her head no it was under the crib i dont know mr forman she inspected it turning it in her hand she shrugged and gave it back to me she acted casual but her eyes were watchful i began to feel uncomfortable okay maria i said never mind she bent over to scoop up the baby i feed her now yes okay i left the room feeling odd just for the hell of it i looked up ssvt on the net i got links to the sri siva vishnu temple the waffenss training school at konitz nazi regalia for sale subsystems sample display technology south shore vocationaltechnical school optical varitemp cryostat systems solid surfacing veneer tiles for home floors a band called slingshotvenus the swiss shooting federationand it went downhill from there i turned away from the computer i stared out the window maria had given me a shopping list the items scrawled in her difficult hand i really should get the shopping done before i picked up the kids but i didnt move there were times when the relentless pace of life at home seemed to defeat me to leave me feeling washed out and hollow at those times i just had to sit for a few hours i didnt want to move not right now i wondered if julia was going to call me tonight and i wondered if she would have a different excuse i wondered what i would do if she walked in one of these days and announced she was in love with someone else i wondered what i would do if i still didnt have a job by then i wondered when i would get a job again i turned the little surge suppressor over in my hand idly as my mind drifted right outside my window was a large coral tree with thick leaves and a green trunk we had planted it as a much smaller tree not long after we moved into the house of course the tree guys did it but we were all out there nicole had her plastic shovel and bucket eric was crawling around on the lawn in his diapers julia had charmed the workmen into staying late to finish the job after they had all gone i kissed her and brushed dirt from her nose she said one day itll cover our whole house but as it turned out it didnt one of the branches had broken off in a storm so it grew a little lopsided coral is soft wood the branches break easily it never grew to cover the house but my memory was vivid staring out the window i saw all of us again out on the lawn but it was just a memory and i was very afraid it didnt fit anymore after working for years with multiagent systems you begin to see life in terms of those programs basically you can think of a multiagent environment as something like a chessboard and the agents like chess pieces the agents interact on the board to attain a goal just the way the chess pieces move to win a game the difference is that nobody is moving the agents they interact on their own to produce the outcome if you design the agents to have memory they can know things about their environment they remember where theyve been on the board and what happened there they can go back to certain places with certain expectations eventually programmers say the agents have beliefs about their environment and that they are acting on those beliefs thats not literally true of course but it might as well be true it looks that way but whats interesting is that over time some agents develop mistaken beliefs whether from a motivation conflict or some other reason they start acting inappropriately the environment has changed but they dont seem to know it they repeat outmoded patterns their behavior no longer reflects the reality of the chessboard its as if theyre stuck in the past in evolutionary programs those agents get killed off they have no children in other multiagent programs they just get bypassed pushed to the periphery while the main thrust of agents moves on some programs have a grim reaper module that sifts them out from time to time and pulls them off the board but the point is theyre stuck in their own past sometimes they pull themselves together and get back on track sometimes they dont thoughts like these made me very uneasy i shifted in my chair glanced at the clock with a sense of relief i saw it was time to go pick up the kids eric did his homework in the car while we waited for nicole to finish her play rehearsal she came out in a bad mood she had thought she was in line for a lead role but instead the drama teacher had cast her in the chorus only two lines she said slamming the car door you want to know what i say i say look here comes john now and in the second act i say that sounds pretty serious two lines she sat back and closed her eyes i dont understand what mr blakeys problem is maybe he thinks you suck eric said rat turd she smacked him on the head monkey butt thats enough i said as i started the car seat belts little stinkbrain dimrod he doesnt know anything nicole said buckling her belt i said thats enough i know that you stink eric said peeyew thats enough eric yeah eric listen to your father and shut up nicole i shot her a glance in the rearview mirror sorry she looked on the verge of tears i said to her honey im really sorry you didnt get the part you wanted i know you wanted it badly and it must be very disappointing no i dont care well im sorry really dad i dont care its in the past im moving on and then a moment later you know who got it that little suckup katie richards mr blakey is just a dick and before i could say anything she burst into tears sobbing loudly and histrionically eric looked over at me and rolled his eyes i drove home making a mental note to speak to nicole about her language after dinner when she had calmed down i was chopping green beans so they would fit in the steamer when eric came and stood in the kitchen doorway hey dad wheres my mp i have no idea i could never get used to the idea that i was supposed to know where every one of their personal possessions was erics game boy his baseball glove nicoles tank tops her bracelet well i cant find it eric remained standing in the doorway not coming any closer in case i made him help set the table have you looked everywhere dad uhhuh you looked in your room all over family room everywhere in the car maybe you left it in the car i didnt dad you leave it in your locker at school we dont have lockers we have cubbies you look in the pockets of your jacket dad come on i did all that i need it since youve already looked everywhere i wont be able to find it either will i dad would you please just help me the pot roast had another half hour to go i put down the knife and went into erics room i looked in all the usual places the back of his closet where clothes were kicked into a heap i would have to talk to maria about that under the bed behind the bed table in the bottom drawer in the bathroom and under the piles of stuff on his desk eric was right it wasnt in his room we headed toward the family room i glanced in at the babys room as i passed by and i saw it immediately it was on the shelf beside the changing table right alongside the tubes of baby ointment eric grabbed it hey thanks dad and he scampered off there was no point in asking why it was in the babys room i went back to the kitchen and resumed chopping my green beans almost immediately daaad what i called it doesnt work dont shout he came back to the kitchen looking sulky she broke it who broke it amanda she drooled on it or something and she broke it its not fair you check the battery he gave me a pitying look course dad i told you she broke it its not fair i doubted his mp player was broken these things were solidstate devices no moving parts and it was too large for the baby to handle i dumped the green beans on the steamer tray and held out my hand give it to me we went into the garage and i got out my toolbox eric watched my every move i had a full set of the small tools you need for computers and electronic devices i worked quickly four phillips head screws and the back cover came off in my hand i found myself staring at the green circuit board it was covered by a fine layer of grayish dust like lint from a clothes dryer that obscured all the electronic components i suspected that eric had slid into home plate with this thing in his pocket that was probably why it didnt work but i looked along the edge of the plastic and saw a rubber gasket where the back fitted against the device theyd made this thing airtight as they should i blew the dust away so i could see better i was hoping to see a loose battery connection or a memory chip that had popped up from heat anyway something that would be easy to fix i squinted at the chips trying to read the writing the writing on one chip was obscured because there seemed to be some kind ofi paused what is it eric said watching me hand me that magnifying glass eric gave me a big glass and i swung my highintensity lamp low and bent over the chip examining it closely the reason i couldnt read the writing was that the surface of the chip had been corroded the whole chip was etched in rivulets a miniature river delta i understood now where the dust had come from it was the disintegrated remains of the chip can you fix it dad eric said can you what could have caused this the rest of the motherboard seemed fine the controller chip was untouched only the memory chip was damaged i wasnt a hardware guy but i knew enough to do basic computer repairs i could install hard drives add memory things like that id handled memory chips before and id never seen anything like this all i could think was that it was a faulty chip these mp players were probably built with the cheapest components available dad can you fix it no i said it needs another chip ill get you one tomorrow cause she slimed it right no i think its just a faulty chip dad it was fine for a whole year she slimed it its not fair as if on cue the baby started crying i left the mp player on the garage table and went back inside the house i looked at my watch i would just have time to change amandas diaper and mix her cereal for dinner before the pot roast came out by nine the younger kids were asleep and the house was quiet except for nicoles voice saying that sounds pretty serious that sounds pretty serious that sounds pretty serious she was standing in front of the bathroom mirror staring at herself and reciting her lines id gotten voice mail from julia saying shed be back by eight but she hadnt made it i wasnt about to call and check up on her anyway i was tired too tired to work up the energy to worry about her id picked up a lot of tricks in the last monthsmostly involving liberal use of tinfoil so i didnt have to clean so muchbut even so after i did the cooking set the table fed the kids played airplane to get the baby to eat her cereal cleared the table wiped down the high chair put the baby to bed and then cleaned up the kitchen i was tired especially since the baby kept spitting out the cereal and eric kept insisting all through dinner that it wasnt fair he wanted chicken fingers instead of the roast i flopped down on the bed and flicked on the tv there was only static and then i realized the dvd player was still turned on interrupting the cable transmission i hit the remote button and the disc in the machine began to play it was julias demo from several days before the camera moved through the bloodstream and into the heart again i saw that the liquid of blood was almost colorless with bouncing red cells julia was speaking on the table the subject lay with the antenna above his body were coming out of the ventricle and you see the aorta ahead and now we will go through the arterial system she turned to face the camera the images you have seen are fleeting but we can allow the camera to cycle through for as much as half an hour and we can build up highly detailed composites of anything we want to see we can even pause the camera using a strong magnetic field when we are finished we simply shunt the blood through an intravenous loop surrounded by a strong magnetic field removing the particles and then send the patient home the video image came back to julia this xymos technology is safe reliable and extremely easy to use it does not require highly trained personnel it can be administered by an iv nurse or a medical technician in the united states alone a million people die each year from vascular disease more than thirty million have diagnosed cardiovascular disease commercial prospects for this imaging technology are very strong because it is painless simple and safe it will replace other imaging techniques such as cat scans and angiography and will become the standard procedure we will market the nanotech cameras the antenna and monitor systems our pertest cost will be only twenty dollars this is in contrast to certain gene technologies that currently charge two to three thousand dollars a test but at a mere twenty dollars we expect worldwide revenues to exceed four hundred million dollars in the first year and once the procedure is established those figures will triple we are talking about a technology that generates one point two billion dollars a year now if there are questions i yawned and flicked the tv off it was impressive and her argument was compelling in fact i couldnt understand why xymos was having trouble getting their next round of funding for investors this should be a slam dunk but then she probably wasnt having trouble she was probably just using the funding crisis as an excuse to stay late every night for her own reasons i turned out the light lying in bed staring at the ceiling in the dark i began to see fleeting images julias thigh over another mans leg julias back arched julia breathing heavily her muscles tensed her arm reaching up to push against the headboard i found i couldnt stop the images i got out of bed and went to check the kids nicole was still up emailing her friends i told her it was time for lights out eric had kicked off his covers i pulled them back up the baby was still purple but she slept soundly her breathing gentle and regular i got back into bed i willed myself to go to sleep to think of something else i tossed and turned adjusted the pillow got up for a glass of milk and cookies eventually finally i fell into a restless sleep and i had a very strange dream sometime during the night i rolled over to see julia standing by the bed undressing she was moving slowly as if tired or very dreamy unbuttoning her blouse she was turned away from me but i could see her face in the mirror she looked beautiful almost regal her features looked more chiseled than i remembered though perhaps it was just the light my eyes were halfclosed she hadnt noticed i was awake she continued to slowly unbutton her blouse her lips were moving as if she were whispering something or praying her eyes seemed vacant lost in thought then as i watched her lips turned dark red and then black she didnt seem to notice the blackness flowed away from her mouth across her cheeks and over her lower face and onto her neck i held my breath i felt great danger the blackness now flowed in a sheet down her body until she was entirely covered as if with a cloak only the upper half of her face remained exposed her features were composed in fact she seemed oblivious just staring into space dark lips silently moving watching her i felt a chill that ran deep into my bones then a moment later the black sheet slid to the floor and vanished julia normal again finished removing her blouse and walked into the bathroom i wanted to get up and follow her but i found i could not move a heavy fatigue held me down on the bed immobilizing me i was so exhausted i could hardly breathe this oppressive sense of fatigue grew rapidly and overwhelmed my consciousness losing all awareness i felt my eyes close and i slept day am the next morning the dream was still fresh in my mind vivid and disturbing it felt utterly real not like a dream at all julia was already up i got out of bed and walked around to where i had seen her the night before i looked down at the rug the bedside table the creased sheets and pillow there was nothing unusual nothing out of order no dark lines or marks anywhere i went into the bathroom and looked at her cosmetics in a neat line on her side of the sink everything i saw was mundane however disturbing my dream had been it was still a dream but one part of it was true enough julia was looking more beautiful than ever when i found her in the kitchen pouring coffee i saw that her face did indeed look more chiseled more striking julia had always had a chubby face now it was lean defined she looked like a highfashion model her body toonow that i looked closelyappeared leaner more muscular she hadnt lost weight she just looked trim tight energetic i said you look great she laughed i cant imagine why im exhausted what time did you get in about eleven i hope i didnt wake you no but i had a weird dream oh yes yes it was mommy mommy eric burst into the kitchen its not fair nicole wont get out of the bathroom shes been in there for an hour its not fair go use our bathroom but i need my socks mommy its not fair this was a familiar problem eric had a couple of pairs of favorite socks that he wore day after day until they were black with grime for some reason the other socks in his drawer were not satisfactory i could never get him to explain why but putting on socks in the morning was a major problem with him eric i said we talked about this youre supposed to wear clean socks but those are my good ones eric you have plenty of good socks its not fair dad shes been in there an hour im not kidding eric go choose other socks dad i just pointed my finger toward his bedroom shees he walked off muttering about how it wasnt fair i turned back to julia to resume our conversation she was staring at me coldly you really dont get it do you get what he came in talking to me and you just took over you took over the whole thing immediately i realized she was right im sorry i said i dont get to see the children very much these days jack i think i should be able to have my interaction without your taking control im sorry i handle this kind of thing all day and i guess this really is a problem jack i said im sorry i know thats what you said but i dont think you are sorry because i dont see you doing anything to change your controlling behavior julia i said now i was trying to control my temper i took a breath youre right im sorry it happened youre just shutting me out she said and you are keeping me from my children julia god damn it youre never here a frosty silence then i certainly am here she said dont you dare say i am not wait a minute wait a minute when are you here when was the last time you made it for dinner julia not last night not the night before not the night before that not all week julia you are not here she glared at me i dont know what youre trying to do jack i dont know what kind of game you are playing im not playing any game im asking you a question im a good mother and i balance a very demanding job a very demanding job and the needs of my family and i get absolutely no help from you what are you talking about i said my voice rising still higher i was starting to have a sense of unreality here you undercut me you sabotage me you turn the children against me she said i see what youre doing dont think i dont you are not supportive of me at all after all these years of marriage i must say its a lousy thing to do to your wife and she stalked out of the room fists clenched she was so angry she didnt see that nicole was standing back from the door listening to the whole thing and staring at me as her mother swept past now we were driving to school shes crazy dad no shes not you know that she is youre just pretending nicole shes your mother i said your mother is not crazy shes working very hard right now thats what you said last week after the fight well it happens to be true you guys didnt used to fight theres a lot of stress right now nicole snorted crossed her arms stared forward i dont know why you put up with her and i dont know why you were listening to what is none of your business dad why do you pull that crap with me nicole sorry but why cant you have a real conversation instead of defending her all the time its not normal what shes doing i know you think shes crazy i dont i said from the backseat eric whacked her on the back of the head youre the one whos crazy he said shut up butt breath shut up yourself weasel puke i dont want to hear any more from either of you i said loudly i am not in the mood by then we were pulling into the turnaround in front of the school the kids piled out nicole jumped out of the front seat turned back to get her backpack shot me a look and was gone i didnt think julia was crazy but something had certainly changed and as i replayed that mornings conversation in my head i felt uneasy for other reasons a lot of her comments sounded like she was building a case against me laying it out methodically step by step you are shutting me out and keeping me away from my children i am here you just dont notice im a good mother i balance a very demanding job with the needs of my family you are not supportive of me at all you undercut me you sabotage me you are turning the children against me i could easily imagine her lawyer saying these things in court and i knew why according to a recent article i had read in redbook magazine alienation of affection was currently the trendy argument in court the father is turning the children against the mother poisoning their little minds by word and deed while the mom is blameless as always every father knew the legal system was hopelessly biased in favor of mothers the courts gave lip service to equality and then ruled a child needed its mother even if she was absent even if she smacked them around or forgot to feed them as long as she wasnt shooting up or breaking their bones she was a fit mother in the eyes of the court and even if she was shooting up a father might not win the case one of my friends at mediatronics had an exwife on heroin whod been in and out of rehab for years theyd finally divorced and had joint custody she was supposedly clean but the kids said she wasnt my friend was worried he didnt want his ex driving the kids when she was loaded he didnt want drug dealers around his kids so he went to court to ask for full custody and he lost the judge said the wife was genuinely trying to overcome her addiction and that children need their mother so that was the reality and now it looked to me as if julia was starting to lay out that case it gave me the creeps about the time i had worked myself into a fine lather my cell phone rang it was julia she was calling to apologize im really sorry i said stupid things today i didnt mean it what jack i know you support me of course you do i couldnt manage without you youre doing a great job with the kids im just not myself these days it was stupid jack im sorry i said those things when i got off the phone i thought i wish i had recorded that i had a ten oclock meeting with my headhunter annie gerard we met in the sunny courtyard of a coffee shop on baker we always met outside so annie could smoke she had her laptop out and her wireless modem plugged in a cigarette dangled from her lip and she squinted in the smoke got anything i said sitting down opposite her yeah as a matter of fact i do two very good possibilities great i said stirring my latte tell me how about this chief research analyst for ibm working on advanced distributed systems architecture right up my alley i thought so too youre highly qualified for this one jack youd run a research lab of sixty people base pay twofifty plus options going out five years plus royalties on anything developed in your lab sounds great where armonk new york i shook my head no way annie what else head of a team to design multiagent systems for an insurance company thats doing data mining its an excellent opportunity and where austin i sighed annie julias got a job she likes shes very devoted to it and she wont leave it now my kids are in school and people move all the time jack they all have kids in school kids adapt but with julia other people have working wives too they still move i know but the thing is with julia have you talked to her about it have you broached the subject well no because i jack annie stared at me over the laptop screen i think you better cut the crap youre not in a position to be picky youre starting to have a shelflife problem shelf life i said thats right jack youve been out of work six months now thats a long time in high tech companies figure if it takes you that long to find a job there must be something wrong with you they dont know what they just assume youve been rejected too many times by too many other companies pretty soon they wont even interview not in san jose not in armonk not in austin not in cambridge the boats sailed are you hearing me am i getting through here yes but no buts jack youve got to talk to your wife youve got to figure out a way to get yourself off the shelf but i cant leave the valley i have to stay here here is not so good she flipped the screen up again whenever i bring up your name i keep gettinglisten whats going on at mediatronics anyway is don gross going to be indicted i dont know ive been hearing that rumor for months now but it never seems to happen for your sake i hope it happens soon i dont get it i said im perfectly positioned in a hot field multiagent distributed processing and hot she said squinting at me distributed processings not hot jack its fucking radioactive everybody in the valley figures that the breakthroughs in artificial life are going to come from distributed processing they are i said nodding in the last few years artificial life had replaced artificial intelligence as a longterm computing goal the idea was to write programs that had the attributes of living creaturesthe ability to adapt cooperate learn adjust to change many of those qualities were especially important in robotics and they were starting to be realized with distributed processing distributed processing meant that you divided your work among several processors or among a network of virtual agents that you created in the computer there were several basic ways this was done one way was to create a large population of fairly dumb agents that worked together to accomplish a goaljust like a colony of ants worked together to accomplish a goal my own team had done a lot of that work another method was to make a socalled neural network that mimicked the network of neurons in the human brain it turned out that even simple neural nets had surprising power these networks could learn they could build on past experience wed done some of that too a third technique was to create virtual genes in the computer and let them evolve in a virtual world until some goal was attained and there were several other procedures as well taken together these procedures represented a huge change from the older notions of artificial intelligence or ai in the old days programmers tried to write rules to cover every situation for example they tried to teach computers that if someone bought something at a store they had to pay before leaving but this commonsense knowledge proved extremely difficult to program the computer would make mistakes new rules would be added to avoid the mistakes then more mistakes and more rules eventually the programs were gigantic millions of lines of code and they began to fail out of sheer complexity they were too large to debug you couldnt figure out where the errors were coming from so it began to seem as if rulebased ai was never going to work lots of people made dire predictions about the end of artificial intelligence the eighties were a good time for english professors who believed that computers would never match human intelligence but distributed networks of agents offered an entirely new approach and the programming philosophy was new too the old rulesbased programming was top down the system as a whole was given rules of behavior but the new programming was bottom up the program defined the behavior of individual agents at the lowest structural level but the behavior of the system as a whole was not defined instead the behavior of the system emerged the result of hundreds of small interactions occurring at a lower level because the system was not programmed it could produce surprising results results never anticipated by the programmers that was why they could seem lifelike and that was why the field was so hot becausejack annie was tapping my hand i blinked jack did you hear anything i just said to you sorry i dont have your full attention she said she blew cigarette smoke in my face yes youre right youre in a hot field but thats all the more reason to worry about shelf life its not like youre an electrical engineer specializing in opticaldrive mechanisms hot fields move fast six months can make or break a company i know youre at risk jack i understand so will you talk to your wife please yes okay she said make sure you do because otherwise i cant help you she flicked her burning cigarette into the remains of my latte it sizzled and died she snapped her laptop shut got up and left i put a call in to julia but didnt get her i left voice mail i knew it was a waste of time even to bring up moving to her shed certainly say noespecially if she had a new boyfriend but annie was right i was in trouble i had to do something i had to ask i sat at my desk at home turning the ssvt box in my hands trying to think what to do i had another hour and a half before i picked up the kids i really wanted to talk to julia i decided to call julia again through the company switchboard to see if they could track her down xymos technology julia forman please please hold some classical music then another voice ms formans office i recognized carol her assistant carol its jack oh hi mr forman how are you im fine thanks are you looking for julia yes i am shes in nevada for the day at the fab plant shall i try to connect you there yes please one moment i was put on hold for quite a while mr forman shes in a meeting for the next hour i expect her to call back when it breaks up do you want her to call you yes please do you want me to tell her anything no i said just ask her to call okay mr forman i hung up stared into space turning the ssvt box shes in nevada for the day julia had said nothing to me about going to nevada i replayed the conversation with carol in my mind had carol sounded uncomfortable was she covering i couldnt be sure i couldnt be sure of anything now i stared out the window and as i watched the sprinklers kicked on shooting up cones of spray all over the lawn it was right in the heat of midday the wrong time to water it wasnt supposed to happen the sprinklers had been fixed just the other day i began to feel depressed staring at the water it seemed like everything was wrong i had no job my wife was absent the kids were a pain i felt constantly inadequate dealing with themand now the fucking sprinklers werent working right they were going to burn out the fucking lawn and then the baby began to cry i waited for julia to call but she never did i cut up chicken breasts into strips the trick is to keep them cold almost frozen for dinner because chicken fingers were another meal they never argued about i got out rice to boil i looked at the carrots in the fridge and decided that even though they were a little old id still use them tonight i cut my finger while i was chopping the carrots it wasnt a big cut but it bled a lot and the bandaid didnt stop the bleeding it kept bleeding through the pad so i kept putting on new bandaids it was frustrating dinner was late and the kids were cranky eric complained loudly that my chicken fingers were gross that mcdonalds were way better and why couldnt we have those nicole tried out various line readings for her play while eric mimicked her under his breath the baby spit up every mouthful of her cereal until i stopped and mixed it with some mashed banana after that she ate steadily i dont know why i never thought to do that before amanda was getting older and she didnt want the bland stuff anymore eric had left his homework at school i told him to call his friends for the assignment but he wouldnt nicole was online for an hour with her friends i kept popping into her room and telling her to get off the computer until her homework was done and shed say in just a minute dad the baby fussed and it took a long time for me to get her down i went back into nicoles room and said now damn it nicole began to cry eric came in to gloat i asked him why he wasnt in bed he saw the look on my face and scampered away sobbing nicole said i should apologize to her i said she should have done what i told her to do twice before she went into the bathroom and slammed the door from his room eric yelled i cant sleep with all that racket i yelled back one more word and no television for a week not fair i went into the bedroom and turned on the tv to watch the rest of the game after half an hour i checked on the kids the baby was sleeping peacefully eric was asleep all his covers thrown off i pulled them back on him nicole was studying when she saw me she apologized i gave her a hug i went back into the bedroom and watched the game for about ten minutes before i fell asleep day am when i awoke in the morning i saw that julias side of the bed was still made up her pillow uncreased she hadnt come home last night at all i checked the telephone messages there were none eric wandered in and saw the bed wheres mom i dont know son did she leave already i guess so he stared at me and then at the unmade bed and he walked out of the room he wasnt going to deal with it but i was beginning to think i had to maybe i should even talk to a lawyer except in my mind there was something irrevocable about talking to a lawyer if the trouble was that serious it was probably fatal i didnt want to believe my marriage was over so i wanted to postpone seeing a lawyer that was when i decided to call my sister in san diego ellen is a clinical psychologist she has a practice in la jolla it was early enough that i figured she hadnt gone to the office yet she answered the phone at home she sounded surprised i had called i love my sister but we are very different anyway i told her briefly about the things id been suspecting about julia and why youre saying julia didnt come home and she didnt call right did you call her not yet how come i dont know maybe she was in an accident maybe shes hurt i dont think so why not you always hear if theres an accident theres no accident you sound upset jack i dont know maybe my sister was silent for a moment then she said jack youve got a problem why arent you doing something like what like see a marriage counselor or a lawyer oh jeez dont you think you should she asked i dont know no not yet jack she didnt come home last night and she didnt bother to call when this woman drops a hint she uses a bombsight how much clearer do you need it to be i dont know youre saying i dont know a lot are you aware of that i guess so a pause jack are you all right i dont know do you want me to come up for a couple of days because i can no problem i was supposed to go out of town with my boyfriend but his company just got bought so im available if you want me to come up no its okay you sure im worried about you no no i said you dont have to worry are you depressed no why sleeping okay exercising fair not really exercising that much uhhuh do you have a job yet no prospects not really no jack she said you have to see a lawyer maybe in a while jack whats the matter with you this is what youve told me your wife is acting cold and angry toward you shes lying to you shes acting strange with the kids she doesnt seem to care about her family shes angry and absent a lot its getting worse you think shes involved with someone else last night she doesnt even show up or call and youre just going to let this go without doing anything i dont know what to do i told you see a lawyer you think so youre damn right i think so i dont know she sighed a long exasperated hiss jack look i know youre a little passive at times but im not passive i said and i added i hate it when you shrink me your wife is screwing around on you you think shes building a case to take the kids away from you and youre just letting it happen id say thats passive what am i supposed to do i told you another exasperated sigh okay im taking a couple of days and coming up to see you ellen dont argue im coming you can tell julia im going to help out with the kids ill be up there this afternoon but dont argue and she got off the phone im not passive im thoughtful ellens very energetic her personalitys perfect for a psychologist because she loves to tell people what to do frankly i think shes pushy and she thinks im passive this is ellens idea about me that i went to stanford in the late seventies and studied population biologya purely academic field with no practical application no jobs except in universities in those days population biology was being revolutionized by field studies of animals and by advances in genetic screening both required computer analysis using advanced mathematical algorithms i couldnt find the kind of programs i needed for my research so i began to write them myself and i slid sideways into computer scienceanother geeky purely academic field but my graduation just happened to coincide with the rise of silicon valley and the personalcomputer explosion lownumber employees at startup companies were making a fortune in the eighties and i did pretty well at the first one i worked for i met julia and we got married had kids everything was smooth we were both doing great just by showing up for work i got hired away by another company more perks bigger options i just rode the advancing wave into the nineties by then i wasnt programming anymore i was supervising software development and things just fell into place for me without any real effort on my part i just fell into my life i never had to prove myself thats ellens idea of me my idea is different the companies of silicon valley are the most intensely competitive in the history of the planet everybody works a hundred hours a week everybody is racing against milestones everybody is cutting development cycles the cycles were originally three years to a new product a new version then it was two years then eighteen months now it was twelve monthsa new version every year if you figure beta debugging to golden master takes four months then you have only eight months to do the actual work eight months to revise ten million lines of code and make sure it all works right in short silicon valley is no place for a passive person and im not one i hustled my ass off every minute of every day i had to prove myself every dayor id be gone that was my idea about myself i was sure i was right ellen was right about one part though a strong streak of luck ran through my career because my original field of study had been biology i had an advantage when computer programs began to explicitly mimic biological systems in fact there were programmers who shuttled back and forth between computer simulation and studies of animal groups in the wild applying the lessons of one to the other but further i had worked in population biologythe study of groups of living organisms and computer science had evolved in the direction of massively parallel networked structuresthe programming of populations of intelligent agents a special kind of thinking was required to handle populations of agents and i had been trained in that thinking for years so i was admirably suited to the trends of my field and i made excellent progress as the fields emerged i had been in the right place at the right time that much was true agentbased programs that modeled biological populations were increasingly important in the real world like my own programs that mimicked ant foraging to control big communications networks or programs that mimicked division of labor among termite colonies to control thermostats in a skyscraper and closely related were the programs that mimicked genetic selection used for a wide range of applications in one program witnesses to a crime were shown nine faces and asked to choose which was most like the criminal even if none really were the program then showed them nine more faces and asked them to choose again and from many repeated generations the program slowly evolved a highly accurate composite picture of the face far more accurate than any police artist could make witnesses never had to say what exactly they were responding to in each face they just chose and the program evolved and then there were the biotech companies which had found they could not successfully engineer new proteins because the proteins tended to fold up weirdly so now they used genetic selection to evolve the new proteins instead all these procedures had become standard practice in a matter of just a few years and they were increasingly powerful increasingly important so yes i had been in the right place at the right time but i wasnt passive i was lucky i hadnt showered or shaved yet i went in the bathroom stripped off my tshirt and stared at myself in the mirror i was startled to see how soft i looked around the gut i hadnt realized of course i was forty and the fact was i hadnt been exercising as much lately not because i was depressed i was busy with the kids and tired a lot of the time i just didnt feel like exercising that was all i stared at my own reflection and wondered if ellen was right theres one problem with all psychological knowledgenobody can apply it to themselves people can be incredibly astute about the shortcomings of their friends spouses children but they have no insight into themselves at all the same people who are coldly cleareyed about the world around them have nothing but fantasies about themselves psychological knowledge doesnt work if you look in a mirror this bizarre fact is as far as i know unexplained personally i always thought there was a clue from computer programming in a procedure called recursion recursion means making the program loop back on itself to use its own information to do things over and over until it gets a result you use recursion for certain datasorting algorithms and things like that but its got to be done carefully or you risk having the machine fall into what is called an infinite regress its the programming equivalent of those funhouse mirrors that reflect mirrors and mirrors ever smaller and smaller stretching away to infinity the program keeps going repeating and repeating but nothing happens the machine hangs i always figured something similar must happen when people turn their psychological insightapparatus on themselves the brain hangs the thought process goes and goes but it doesnt get anywhere it must be something like that because we know that people can think about themselves indefinitely some people think of little else yet people never seem to change as a result of their intensive introspection they never understand themselves better its very rare to find genuine selfknowledge its almost as if you need someone else to tell you who you are or to hold up the mirror for you which if you think about it is very weird or maybe its not theres an old question in artificial intelligence about whether a program can ever be aware of itself most programmers will say it was impossible people have tried to do it and failed but theres a more fundamental version of the question a philosophical question about whether any machine can understand its own workings some people say thats impossible too the machine cant know itself for the same reason you cant bite your own teeth and it certainly seems to be impossible the human brain is the most complicated structure in the known universe but brains still know very little about themselves for the last thirty years such questions have been fun to kick around with a beer on friday afternoons after work they were never taken seriously but lately these philosophical questions have taken on new importance because there has been rapid progress in reproducing certain brain functions not the entire brain just certain functions for example before i was fired my development team was using multiagent processing to enable computers to learn to recognize patterns in data to understand natural languages to prioritize and switch tasks what was important about the programs was that the machines literally learned they got better at their jobs with experience which is more than some human beings can claim the phone rang it was ellen did you call your lawyer not yet for christs sake im on the to san jose ill see you around five at your house listen ellen it really isnt necessary i know that im just getting out of town i need a break see you soon jack and she hung up so now she was handling me in any case i figured there was no point in calling a lawyer today i had too much to do the dry cleaning had to be picked up so i did that there was a starbucks across the street and i went over to get a latte to take with me and there was gary marder my attorney with a very young blonde in lowcut jeans and crop top that left her belly exposed they were nuzzling each other in the checkout line she didnt look much older than a college student i was embarrassed and was turning to leave when gary saw me and waved hey jack hi gary he held out his hand and i shook it he said say hello to melissa i said hi melissa oh hi she seemed vaguely annoyed at this interruption although i couldnt be sure she had that vacant look some young girls get around men it occurred to me that she couldnt be more than six years older than nicole what was she doing with a guy like gary so hows it going jack gary said slipping his arm around melissas bare waist okay i said pretty good yeah thats good but he was frowning at me well uh yeah i stood there hesitating feeling foolish in front of the girl she clearly wanted me to leave but i was thinking of what ellen would say you ran into your lawyer and you didnt even ask him so i said gary could i speak to you for a minute of course he gave the girl money to pay for the coffee and we stepped to one side of the room i lowered my voice listen gary i said i think i need to see a divorce lawyer because what because i think julia is having an affair you think or you know for a fact no i dont know for sure so you just suspect it yes gary sighed he gave me a look i said and theres other things going on too shes starting to say that i am turning the kids against her alienation of affection he said nodding legal clichй du jour she makes these statements when when we have fights another sigh jack couples say all kinds of shit when they fight it doesnt necessarily mean anything i think it does im worried it does this is upsetting you yes have you seen a marriage counselor no see one why two reasons first because you should youve been married to julia a long time and as far as i know its been mostly good and second because youll start to establish a record of trying to save the marriage which contradicts a claim of alienation of affection yes but if youre right that she is starting to build a case then you have to be extremely careful my friend alienation of affection is a tough argument to defend against the kids are pissed at mom and she says youre behind it how can you prove its not true you cant plus youve been home a lot so its easier to imagine that it might be true the court will see you as dissatisfied and possibly resentful of your working spouse he held up his hand i know i know none of thats true jack but its an easy argument to make thats my point and her attorney will make it in your resentment you turned the kids against her thats bullshit of course i know that he slapped me on the shoulder so see a good counselor if you need names call my office and barbarall give you a couple of reputable ones i called julia to tell her that ellen was coming up for a few days of course i didnt reach julia just her voice mail i left a longish message explaining what was happening then i went to do the shopping because with ellen staying over wed need some extra supplies i was rolling my cart down the supermarket aisle when i got a call from the hospital it was the beardless er doctor again he was calling to check on amanda and i said her bruises were almost gone thats good he said glad to hear it i said what about the mri the doctor said the mri results were not relevant because the machine had malfunctioned and had never examined amanda in fact were worried about all the readings for the last few weeks he said because apparently the machine was slowly breaking down how do you mean it was being corroded or something all the memory chips were turning to powder i felt a chill remembering erics mp player why would that happen i said the best guess is its been corroded by some gas that escaped from the wall lines probably during the night like chlorine gas thatd do it except the thing is only the memory chips were damaged the other chips were fine things were getting stranger by the minute and they got stranger still a few minutes later when julia called all cheerful and upbeat to announce that she was coming home in the afternoon and would be there in plenty of time for dinner itll be great to see ellen she said why is she coming i think she just wanted to get out of town well itll be great for you to have her around for a few days some grownup company you bet i said i waited for her to explain why she hadnt come home but all she said was hey i got to run jack ill talk to you later julia i said wait a minute what i hesitated wondering how to put it i said i was worried about you last night you were why when you didnt come home honey i called you i got stuck out at the plant didnt you check your messages yes and you didnt have a message from me no i didnt well i dont know what happened i left you a message jack i called the house first and got maria but she couldnt you know it was too complicated so then i called your cell and i left you a message that i was stuck at the plant until today well i didnt get it i said trying not to sound like i was pouting sorry about that honey but check your service anyway listen i really have to go see you tonight okay kiss kiss and she hung up i pulled my cell phone out of my pocket and checked it there was no message i checked the phone log there were no calls last night julia hadnt called me no one had called me i began to feel a sinking sensation that descent into depression again i felt tired i couldnt move i stared at the produce on the supermarket shelves i couldnt remember why i was there i had just about decided to leave the supermarket when my cell phone rang in my hand i flipped it open it was tim bergman the guy who had taken over my job at mediatronics are you sitting down he said no why ive got some pretty strange news brace yourself okay don wants to call you don gross was the head of the company the guy who had fired me what for he wants to hire you back he wants what yeah i know its crazy to hire you back why i said were having some problems with distributed systems that weve sold to customers which ones well predprey thats one of the old ones i said who sold that predprey was a system wed designed over a year ago like most of our programs it had been based on biological models predprey was a goalseeking program based on predatorprey dynamics but it was extremely simple in its structure well xymos wanted something very simple tim said you sold predprey to xymos right licensed actually with a contract to support it thats driving us crazy why it isnt working right apparently goal seeking has gone haywire a lot of the time the program seems to lose its goal im not surprised i said because we didnt specify reinforcers reinforcers were program weights that sustained the goals the reason you needed them was that since the networked agents could learn they might learn in a way that caused them to drift away from the goal you needed a way to store the original goal so it didnt get lost the fact was you could easily come to think of agent programs as children the programs forgot things lost things dropped things it was all emergent behavior it wasnt programmed but it was the outcome of programming and apparently it was happening to xymos well tim said don figures you were running the team when the program was originally written so youre the guy to fix it plus your wife is high up in xymos management so your joining the team will reassure their top people i wasnt sure that was true but i didnt say anything anyway thats the situation tim continued im calling you to ask if don should call you because he doesnt want to get rejected i felt a burst of anger he doesnt want to get rejected tim i said i cant go back to work there oh you wouldnt be here youd be up at the xymos fab plant oh yes how would that work don would hire you as an offsite consultant something like that uhhuh i said in my best noncommittal tone everything about this proposal sounded like a bad idea the last thing i wanted to do was go back to work for that son of a bitch don and it was always a bad idea to return to a company after youd been firedfor any reason under any arrangement everybody knew that but on the other hand if i agreed to work as a consultant it would get rid of my shelflife problem and it would get me out of the house it would accomplish a lot of things after a pause i said listen tim let me think about it you want to call me back okay yes when will you call he said the tension in his voice was clear i said youve got some urgency about this yeah well some like i said that contracts driving us crazy we have five programmers from the original team practically living out at that xymos plant and theyre not getting anywhere on this problem so if youre not going to help us we have to look elsewhere right away okay ill call you tomorrow i said tomorrow morning he said hinting okay i said yes tomorrow morning tims call should have made me feel better about things but it didnt i took the baby to the park and pushed her in the swing for a while amanda liked being pushed in the swing she could do it for twenty or thirty minutes at a time and always cried when i took her out later i sat on the concrete curb of the sandbox while she crawled around and pulled herself up to standing on the concrete turtles and other playthings one of the older toddlers knocked her over but she didnt cry she just got back up she seemed to like being around the older kids i watched her and thought about going back to work of course you told them yes ellen said to me we were in the kitchen she had just arrived her black suitcase unpacked in the corner ellen looked exactly the same still railthin energetic blond hyper my sister never seemed to age she was drinking a cup of tea from teabags that she had brought with her special organic oolong tea from a special shop in san francisco that hadnt changed eitherellen had always been fussy about food even as a kid as an adult she traveled around with her own teas her own salad dressings her own vitamins neatly arranged in little glassine packs no i didnt i said i didnt tell them yes i said id think about it think about it are you kidding jack you have to go back to work you know you do she stared at me appraising youre depressed im not you should have some of this tea she said all that coffee is bad for your nerves tea has more caffeine than coffee jack you have to go back to work i know that ellen and if its a consulting job wouldnt that be perfect solve all your problems i dont know i said really what dont you know i dont know if im getting the full story i said i mean if xymos is having all this trouble how come julia hasnt said anything about it to me ellen shook her head it sounds like julia isnt saying much of anything to you these days she stared at me so why didnt you accept right away i need to check around first check what jack her tone conveyed disbelief ellen was acting like i had a psychological problem that needed to be fixed my sister was starting to get to me and wed only been together a few minutes my older sister treating me like i was a kid again i stood up listen ellen i said ive spent my life in this business and i know how it works theres two possible reasons don wants me back the first is the companys in a jam and they think i can help thats what they said right thats what they said but the other possibility is that theyve made an incredible mess of things and by now it cant be fixedand they know it so they want somebody to blame right they want a donkey to pin the tail on she frowned i saw her hesitate do you really think so i dont know thats the point i said but i have to find out which you will do by by making some calls maybe paying a surprise visit to the fab building tomorrow okay that sounds right to me im glad i have your approval i couldnt keep the irritation out of my voice jack she said she got up and hugged me im just worried about you thats all i appreciate that i said but youre not helping me okay then what can i do to help you watch the kids while i make some calls i figured i would first call ricky morse the guy id seen in the supermarket buying huggies i had a long relationship with ricky he worked at xymos and he was casual enough about information that he might tell me what was really going on there the only problem was that ricky was based in the valley and hed already told me that the action was all at the fab building but he was a place for me to start i called his office but the receptionist said im sorry mr morse is not in the office when is he expected back i really couldnt say do you want voice mail i left ricky a voicemail message then i called his home number his wife answered mary was getting her phd in french history i imagined her studying bouncing the baby with a book open on her lap i said how are you mary im fine jack hows the baby ricky tells me you never get diaper rash im jealous i tried to sound casual just a social call mary laughed shes a good baby and we didnt have colic thank god but ricky hasnt been around for the rashes she said weve had some i said actually im looking for ricky is he there no jack hes been gone all week hes out at that fab plant in nevada oh right i remembered now that ricky had mentioned that when we had met in the supermarket have you been out to that plant mary said i thought i detected an uneasy tone no i havent but julia is there a lot isnt she what does she say about it definitely worried well not much i gather they have new technology thats very hushhush why she hesitated maybe its my imagination what is well sometimes when ricky calls he sounds kind of weird to me how im sure hes distracted and working hard but he says some strange things he doesnt always make a lot of sense and he seems evasive like hes i dont know hiding something hiding something she gave a selfdeprecating laugh i even thought maybe hes having an affair you know that woman mae chang is out there and he always liked her shes so pretty mae chang used to work in my division at mediatronics i hadnt heard she was at the fab plant yes i think a lot of the people who used to work for you are there now well i said i dont think ricky is having an affair mary its just not like him and its not like mae its the quiet ones you have to watch out for she said apparently referring to mae and im still nursing so i havent lost my weight yet i mean my thighs are as big as sides of beef i dont think that they rub together when i walk squishy mary im sure is julia okay jack shes not acting weird no more than usual i said trying to make a joke i was feeling bad as i said it for days i had wished that people would level with me about julia but now that i had something to share with mary i wasnt going to level with her i was going to keep my mouth shut i said julias working hard and she sometimes is a little odd does she say anything about a black cloud uh no the new world being present for the birth of the new world order that sounded like conspiracy talk to me like those people who worried about the trilateral commission and thought that the rockefellers ran the world no nothing like that she mention a black cloak i felt suddenly slowed down moving very slowly what the other night ricky was talking about a black cloak being covered in a black cloak it was late he was tired he was sort of babbling what did he say about the black cloak nothing just that she paused you think theyre taking drugs out there i dont know i said you know theres pressure working around the clock and nobodys sleeping much i wonder about drugs let me call ricky i said mary gave me his cell phone number and i wrote it down i was about to dial it when the door slammed and i heard eric say hey mom whos that guy in the car with you i got up and looked out the window at the driveway julias bmw convertible was there top down i checked my watch it was only i went out into the hall and saw julia hugging eric she was saying it must have been sunlight on the windshield theres nobody else in the car yes there was i saw him oh yes she opened the front door go look for yourself eric went out onto the lawn julia smiled at me he thinks someone was in the car eric came back in shrugging oh well guess not thats right honey julia walked down the hall toward me is ellen here just got here great im going to take a shower and well talk lets open some wine what do you want to do about dinner ive got steaks ready great sounds great and with a cheerful wave she went down the hallway it was a warm evening and we had dinner in the backyard i put out the redcheckered tablecloth and grilled the steaks on the barbecue wearing my chefs apron that said the chefs word is law and we had a sort of classic american family dinner julia was charming and chatty focusing her attention on my sister talking about the kids about school about changes she wanted to make on the house that window has to come out she said pointing back at the kitchen and well put french doors in so itll open to the outside itll be great i was astonished by julias performance even the kids were staring at her julia mentioned how proud she was of nicoles big part in the forthcoming school play nicole said mom i have a bad part oh not really honey julia said yes i do i just have two lines now honey im sure youre eric piped up look here comes john now that sounds pretty serious shut up weasel turd she says em in the bathroom over and over eric announced about a billion gazillion times julia said whos john those are the lines in the play oh well anyway im sure youll be wonderful and our little eric is making such progress in soccer arent you hon its over next week eric said turning sulky julia hadnt made it to any of his games this fall its been so good for him julia said to ellen team sports build cooperation especially with boys it helps with that competitiveness ellen wasnt saying anything just nodding and listening for this particular evening julia had insisted on feeding the baby and had positioned the high chair beside her but amanda was accustomed to playing airplane at every mealtime she was waiting for someone to move the spoon toward her saying rrrrrrrowwwww here comes the airplane open the doors since julia wasnt doing that amanda kept her mouth tightly shut which was part of the game too oh well i guess shes not hungry julia said with a shrug did she just have a bottle jack no i said she doesnt get one until after dinner well i know that i meant before no i said not before i gestured toward amanda shall i try sure julia handed me the spoon and i sat beside amanda and began to play airplane rrrrrowwww amanda immediately grinned and opened her mouth jacks been wonderful with the kids just wonderful julia said to ellen i think its good for a man to experience home life ellen said oh it is it is hes helped me a lot she patted my knee you really have jack it was clear to me that julia was too bright too cheerful she was keyed up talking fast and obviously trying to impress ellen that she was in charge of her family i could see that ellen wasnt buying it but julia was so speedy she didnt notice i began to wonder if she were on drugs was that the reason for her strange behavior was she on amphetamines and work julia continued is so incredible these days xymos is really making breakthroughsthe kind of breakthroughs people have been waiting for more than ten years to happen but at last its happening like the black cloak i said fishing julia blinked the what she shook her head whatre you talking about hon a black cloak didnt you say something about a black cloak the other day no she shook her head i dont know what you mean she turned back to ellen anyway all this molecular technology has been much slower to come to market than we expected but at last it really is here you seem very excited ellen said i have to tell you its thrilling ellen she lowered her voice and on top of it well probably make a bundle thatd be good ellen said but i guess youve had to put in long hours not that long julia said all things considered it hasnt been bad just the last week or so i saw nicoles eyes widen eric was staring at his mother as he ate but the kids didnt say anything neither did i its just a transition period julia continued all companies have these transitional periods of course ellen said the sun was going down the air was cooler the kids left the table i got up and started to clear ellen was helping me julia kept talking then said id love to stay but i have something going on and i have to get back to the office for a while if ellen was surprised to hear this she didnt show it all she said was long hours just during this transition she turned to me thanks for holding the fort honey at the door she turned blew me an air kiss love jack and she left ellen frowned watching her go just a little abrupt wouldnt you say i shrugged will she say goodbye to the kids probably not shell just run right out the door right ellen shook her head jack she said i dont know if shes having an affair or not butwhats she taking nothing as far as i know shes on something im certain of it would you say shes lost weight yes some and sleeping very little and obviously speedy ellen shook her head a lot of these hardcharging executives are on drugs i dont know i said she just looked at me i went back into my office to call ricky and from the office window i saw julia backing her car down the driveway i went to wave to her but she was looking over her shoulder as she backed away in the evening light i saw golden reflections on the windshield streaking from the trees above she had almost reached the street when i thought i saw someone sitting in the passenger seat beside her it looked like a man i couldnt see his features clearly through the windshield with the car moving down the drive when julia backed onto the street her body blocked my view of the passenger but it seemed as if julia was talking to him animatedly then she put the car in gear and leaned back in her seat and for a moment i had a brief clear look the man was backlit his face in shadow and he must have been looking directly at her because i still couldnt make out any features but from the way he was slouching i had the impression of someone young maybe in his twenties though i honestly couldnt be sure it was just a glimpse then the bmw accelerated and she drove off down the street i thought the hell with this i ran outside and down the driveway i reached the street just as julia came to the stop sign to the end of the block her brake lights flaring she was probably fifty yards away the street illuminated in low slanting yellow light it looked as if she was alone in the car but i really couldnt see well i felt a moment of relief and of foolishness there i was standing in the street for no good reason my mind was playing tricks on me there was nobody in the car then as julia made the right turn the guy popped up again like he had been bent over getting something from the glove compartment and then the car was gone and in an instant all my distress came flooding back like a hot pain that spread across my chest and body i felt short of breath and a little dizzy there was somebody in the car i trudged back up the driveway feeling churning emotions not sure what to do next youre not sure what to do next ellen said we were doing the pots and pans at the sink the things that didnt go in the dishwasher ellen was drying while i scrubbed you pick up the phone and call her shes in the car she has a car phone call her uhhuh i said so how do i put it hey julia whos the guy in the car with you i shook my head thats going to be a tough conversation maybe so thatll be a divorce for sure she just stared at me you dont want a divorce do you hell no i want to keep my family together that may not be possible jack it may not be your decision to make none of this makes any sense i said i mean the guy in the car he was like a kid somebody young so thats not julias style oh ellens eyebrows went up he was probably in his twenties or early thirties and anyway are you so sure about julias style well ive lived with her for thirteen years she set down one of the pots with a bang jack i understand that all this must be hard to accept it is it is in my mind i kept replaying the car backing down the driveway over and over i was thinking that there was something strange about the other person in the car something odd in his appearance in my mind i kept trying to see his face but i never could the features were blurred by the windshield by the light shifting as she backed down the drive i couldnt see the eyes or the cheekbones or the mouth in my memory the whole face was dark and indistinct i tried to explain that to her its not surprising no no its called denial look jack the fact is you have the evidence right in front of your eyes youve seen it jack dont you think its time you believed it i knew she was right yes i said its time the phone was ringing my hands were up to the elbows in soap suds i asked ellen to get it but one of the kids had already picked it up i finished scrubbing the barbecue grill handed it to ellen to dry jack ellen said you have to start seeing things as they really are and not as you want them to be youre right i said ill call her at that moment nicole came into the kitchen looking pale dad its the police they want to talk to you day pm julias convertible had gone off the road about five miles from the house it had plunged fifty feet down a steep ravine cutting a track through the sage and juniper bushes then it must have rolled because now it lay at an angle wheels facing upward i could see only the underside of the car the sun was almost down and the ravine was dark the three rescue ambulances on the road had their red lights flashing and the rescue crews were already rappelling down on ropes as i watched portable floodlights were set up bathing the wreck in a harsh blue glow i heard the crackle of radios all around i stood up on the road with a motorcycle police officer i had already asked to go down there and was told i couldnt i had to stay on the road when i heard the radios i said is she hurt is my wife hurt well know in a minute he was calm what about the other guy just a minute he said he had a headset in his helmet because he just started talking in a low voice it sounded like a lot of code words i heard update a fourohtwo for seventhreenine here i stood at the edge and looked down trying to see by now there were workers all around the car and several hidden behind the upturned frame a long time seemed to pass the cop said your wife is unconscious but shes she was wearing her seat belt and stayed in the car they think shes all right vital signs are stable they say no spinal injuries but she sounds like she broke her arm but shes all right they think so another pause while he listened i heard him say i have the husband here so lets eightseven when he turned back to me he said yes shes coming around shell have to be checked for internal bleeding at the hospital and shes got a broken arm but they say shes all right theyre getting her on a stretcher now thank god i said the policeman nodded this is a bad piece of road this has happened before he nodded every few months not usually so lucky i flipped open my cell phone and called ellen told her to explain to the kids there was nothing to worry about that mom was going to be okay especially nicole i said ill take care of it ellen promised me i flipped the phone shut and turned back to the cop what about the other guy i said shes alone in the car no i said there was another guy with her he spoke on his headset then turned back to me they say no theres no sign of anyone else maybe he was thrown i said theyre asking your wife now he listened a moment she says she was alone youre kidding i said he looked at me shrugged thats what she says in the flashing red lights of the ambulances i couldnt read his expression but his tone implied another guy who doesnt know his own wife i turned away looked over the edge of the road one of the rescue vehicles had extended a steel arm with a winch that hung over the ravine a cable was being lowered i saw the workers struggling for footing against the steep slope as they attached a stretcher to the winch i couldnt see julia clearly on the stretcher she was strapped down covered in a silver space blanket she started to rise passing through the cone of blue light then into darkness the cop said theyre asking about drugs and medicines is your wife taking any drugs or medicines not that i know of how about alcohol was she drinking wine at dinner one or two glasses the cop turned away and spoke again quietly in the darkness after a pause i heard him say thats affirmative the stretcher twisted slowly as it rose into the air one of the workers halfway up the slope reached out to steady it the stretcher continued upward i still couldnt see julia clearly until it reached the level of the road and the rescue workers swung it around and unclipped it from the line she was swollen her left cheekbone was purple and the forehead above her left eye was purple as well she must have hit her head pretty hard she was breathing shallowly i moved alongside the stretcher she saw me and said jack and tried to smile just take it easy i said she gave a little cough jack it was an accident the medics were maneuvering around the motorcycle i had to watch where i was going of course it was its not what you think jack i said what is julia she seemed to be delirious her voice seemed to drift in and out i know what youre thinking her hand gripped my arm promise me you wont get involved in this jack i didnt say anything i just walked with her she squeezed me harder promise me youll stay out of it i promise i said she relaxed then dropping my arm this doesnt involve our family the kids will be fine youll be fine just stay out okay okay i said just wanting to mollify her jack yes honey im here by now we were approaching the nearest ambulance the doors swung open one of the rescue team said you related to her im her husband you want to come yes hop in i got into the ambulance first then they slid the stretcher in one of the rescue team got in and slammed the doors shut we started down the road siren moaning i was immediately moved aside by the two paramedics working on her one was recording notes on a handheld device and the other was starting a second iv in her other arm they were worried about her blood pressure which was dropping that was a great cause for concern during all this i couldnt really see julia but i heard her murmuring i tried to move forward but the medics pushed me back let us work sir your wifes got injuries we have to work for the rest of the way i sat on a little jump seat and gripped a wall handle as the ambulance careened around curves by now julia was clearly delirious babbling nonsense i heard something about the black clouds that were not black anymore then she shifted into a kind of lecture talking about adolescent rebellion she mentioned amanda by name and eric asking if they were all right she seemed agitated the medics kept trying to reassure her and finally she lapsed into repeating i didnt do anything wrong i didnt mean to do anything wrong as the ambulance sped through the night listening to her i couldnt help but worry the examination suggested julias injuries might be more extensive than they first thought there was a lot to rule out possible pelvic fracture possible hematoma possible fracture of a cervical vertebra left arm broken in two places and might need to be pinned the doctors seemed most worried about her pelvis they were handling her much more gingerly when they put her into intensive care but julia was conscious catching my eye and smiling at me from time to time until she fell asleep the doctors said there was nothing for me to do they would wake her up every half hour during the night they said that she would be in the hospital at least three days probably a week they told me to get some rest i left the hospital a little before midnight i took a taxi back to the crash site to pick up my car it was a cold night the police cars and rescue ambulances were gone in their place was a big flatbed tow truck which was winching julias car up the hill a skinny guy smoking a cigarette was running the winch nothing to see he said to me everybodys gone to the hospital i said it was my wifes car cant drive it he said he asked me for my insurance card i got it out of my wallet and handed it to him he said i heard your wifes okay so far youre a lucky guy he jerked his thumb pointing across the road are they with you across the street a small white van was parked the sides were bare with no markings or company logo but low on the front door i saw a serial number in black and underneath it said ssvt unit i said no theyre not with me been here an hour he said just sitting there i couldnt see anyone inside the van the front windows were dark i started across the street toward them i heard the faint crackle of a radio when i was about ten feet away the lights came on the engine started and the van roared past me and drove down the highway as it passed i had a glimpse of the driver he was wearing a shiny suit of some kind like silvery plastic and a tight hood of the same material i thought i saw some funny silver apparatus hanging around his neck it looked like a gas mask except it was silver but i wasnt sure as the car drove away i noticed the rear bumper had two green stickers each with a big x that was the xymos logo but it was the license plate that really caught my eye it was a nevada plate that van had come from the fabrication plant out in the desert i frowned it was time for me to visit the fab plant i thought i pulled out my cell phone and dialed tim bergman i told him i had reconsidered his offer and i would take the consulting job after all thats great tim said don will be very happy great i said how soon can i start desert day am with the vibration of the helicopter i must have dozed off for a few minutes i awoke and yawned hearing voices in my headphones they were all men speaking well what exactly is the problem a growling voice apparently the plant released some material into the environment it was an accident now several dead animals have been found out in the desert in the vicinity of the plant a reasonable organized voice who found them growly couple of nosy environmentalists they ignored the keepout signs snooped around the plant theyve complained to the company and are demanding to inspect the plant which we cant allow no no how do we handle this said a timid voice i say we minimize the amount of contamination released and give data that show no untoward consequence is possible organized voice hell i wouldnt play it that way said growling voice were better off flatly denying it nothing was released i mean whats the evidence anything was released well the dead animals a coyote some desert rats maybe a few birds hell animals die in nature all the time i mean remember the business about those slashed cows it was supposed to be aliens from ufos that were slashing the cows finally turned out the cows were dying of natural causes and it was decomposing gas in the carcasses that split them open remember that vaguely timid voice im not sure we can just deny fuck yes deny arent there pictures i think the environmentalists took pictures well who cares what will the pictures show a dead coyote nobody is going to get worked up about a dead coyote trust me pilot pilot where the fuck are we i opened my eyes i was sitting in the front of the helicopter alongside the pilot the helicopter was flying east into the glare of low morning sun beneath my feet i saw mostly flat terrain with low clumps of cactus juniper and the occasional scraggly joshua tree the pilot was flying alongside the powerline towers that marched in single file across the desert a steel army with outstretched arms the towers cast long shadows in the morning light a heavyset man leaned forward from the backseat he was wearing a suit and tie pilot are we there yet we just crossed the nevada line another ten minutes the heavyset man grunted and sat back id met him when we took off but i couldnt remember his name now i glanced back at the three men all in suits and ties who were traveling with me they were all pr consultants hired by xymos i could match their appearance to their voices a slender nervous man twisting his hands then a middleaged man with a briefcase on his lap and the heavyset man older and growly obviously in charge why the hell did they put it in nevada anyway fewer regulations easier inspections these days california is sticky about new industry there was going to be a years delay just for environmentalimpact statements and a far more difficult permitting process so they came here growly looked out the window at the desert what a shithole he said i dont give a fuck what goes on out here its not a problem he turned to me what do you do im a computer programmer you covered by an nda he meant did i have a nondisclosure agreement that would prevent me from discussing what i had just heard yes i said you coming out to work at the plant to consult i said yes consultings the way to go he said nodding as if i were an ally no responsibility no liability just give your opinion and watch them not take it with a crackle the pilots voice broke in over the headsets xymos molecular manufacturing is dead ahead he said you can just see it now twenty miles in front of us i saw an isolated cluster of low buildings silhouetted on the horizon the pr people in the back all leaned forward is that it said growly thats all it is its bigger than it looks from here the pilot said as the helicopter came closer i could see that the buildings were interlocked featureless concrete blocks all whitewashed the pr people were so pleased they almost burst into applause hey its beautiful looks like a fucking hospital great architecture itll photograph great i said why will it photograph great because it has no projections the man with the briefcase said no antennas no spikes no things poking up people are afraid of spikes and antennas there are studies but a building thats plain and square like this and whiteperfect color choice associations to virginal hospital cure purea building like this they dont care those environmentalists are fucked said growly with satisfaction they do medical research here right not exactly they will when i get through trust me medical research is the way to go on this the pilot pointed out the different buildings as he circled them that first concrete block thats power walkway to that low building thats the residences next door fab support labs whatever and then the square windowless threestory one thats the main fab building they tell me its a shell its got another building inside it then over to the right that low flat shed thats external storage and parking cars have to be under shade here or the dashboards buckle get a firstdegree burn if you touch your steering wheel i said and they have residences the pilot nodded yeah have to nearest motel is a hundred and sixtyone miles over near reno so how many people live in this facility growly said they can take twelve the pilot said but theyve generally got about five to eight doesnt take a lot to run the place its all automated from what i hear what else do you hear not very damn much the pilot said theyre closedmouthed about this place ive never even been inside good said growly lets make sure they keep it that way the pilot turned the stick in his hand the helicopter banked and started down i opened the plastic door in the bubble cockpit and started to get out it was like stepping into an oven the blast of heat made me gasp this is nothing the pilot shouted over the whirr of the blades this is almost winter cant be more than a hundred and five great i said inhaling hot air i reached in the back for my overnight bag and my laptop id stowed them under the seat of the timid man i have to take a piss said growly releasing his seat belt dave said the man with the briefcase in a warning tone fuck its just for a minute dave an embarrassed glance toward me then lowering his voice they said we dont get out of the helicopter remember aw hell i cant wait another hour anyway whats the difference he gestured toward the surrounding desert theres nothing the fuck out here for a million miles but dave you guys give me a pain im going to pee damn it he hefted his bulk up and moved toward the door i didnt hear the rest of their conversation because by then i had taken off my earphones growly was clambering out i grabbed my bags turned and moved away crouched beneath the blades they cast a flickering shadow on the pad i came to the edge of the pad where the concrete ended abruptly in a dirt path that threaded among the clumps of cholla cactus toward the blocky white power building fifty yards away there was no one to greet mein fact no one in sight at all looking back i saw growly zip up his trousers and climb back into the helicopter the pilot pulled the door shut and lifted off waving to me as he rose into the air i waved back then ducked away from the swirl of spitting sand the helicopter circled once and headed west the sound faded the desert was silent except for the hum of the electrical power lines a few hundred yards away the wind ruffled my shirt flapped my trouser legs i turned in a slow circle wondering what to do now and thinking about the words of the pr guy they said we dont get out of the helicopter remember hey hey you i looked back a door had cracked open in the white power block a mans head stuck out he shouted are you jack forman yes i said well what the hell you waiting for an engraved invitation get inside for chrissake and he slammed the door shut again that was my welcome to the xymos fabrication facility lugging my bags i trudged down the dirt path toward the door things never turn out the way you expect i stepped into a small room with dark gray walls on three sides the walls were some smooth material like formica it took my eyes a moment to adjust to the relative darkness then i saw that the fourth wall directly ahead of me was entirely glass leading to a small compartment and a second glass wall the glass walls were fitted with folding steel arms ending in metal pressure pads it looked a little bit like what youd expect to see in a bank vault beyond the second glass wall i could see a burly man in blue trousers and a blue work shirt with the xymos logo on the pocket he was clearly the plant maintenance engineer he gestured to me its an airlock doors automatic walk forward i did and the nearest glass door hissed open a red light came on in the compartment ahead i saw grillwork on floor ceiling and both walls i hesitated looks like a fuckin toaster dont it the man said grinning he had some teeth missing but dont worry itll just blow you a little come ahead i stepped into the glass compartment and set my bag on the ground no no pick the bag up i picked it up again immediately the glass door behind me hissed shut the steel arms unfolding smoothly the pressure pads sealed with a thunk i felt a slight discomfort in my ears as the airlock pressurized the man in blue said you might want to close your eyes i closed my eyes and immediately felt chilling spray strike my face and body from all sides my clothes were soaked i smelled a stinging odor like acetone or nail polish remover i began to shiver the liquid was really cold the first blast of air came from above my head a roar that quickly built to hurricane intensity i stiffened my body to steady myself my clothes flapped and pressed flat against my body the wind increased threatening to tear the bag from my hand then the air stopped for a moment and a second blast came upward from the floor it was disorienting but it only lasted a few moments then with a whoosh the vacuum pumps kicked in and i felt a slight ache in my ears as the pressure dropped like an airplane descending then silence a voice said thats it come ahead i opened my eyes the liquid theyd sprayed on me had evaporated my clothes were dry the doors hissed open before me i stepped out and the man in blue looked at me quizzically feel okay yeah i think so no itching no good we had a few people who were allergic to the stuff but weve got to do this routine for the clean rooms i nodded it was obviously a procedure to remove dust and other contaminants the dousing fluid was highly volatile evaporating at room temperature drawing off microparticles on my body and clothes the air jets and vacuum completed the scrub the procedure would remove any loose particles on my body and suck them away im vince reynolds the man said but he didnt hold out his hand you call me vince and youre jack i said i was okay jack he said theyre waiting for you so lets get started we got to take precautions because this is an hmf thats high magnetic field environment greater than tesla so he picked up a cardboard box better lose your watch i put the watch in the box and the belt i took my belt off put it in the box any other jewelry bracelet necklace piercings decorative pins or medals medicalert no how about metal inside your body old injury bullets shrapnel no any pins for broken arms or legs hip or knee replacement no artificial valves artificial cartilage vascular pumps or implants i said i didnt have any of those things well youre still young he said now how about in your bag he made me take everything out and spread it on a table so he could rummage through it i had plenty of metal in there another belt with a metal buckle nail clippers a can of shaving cream razor and blades a pocket knife blue jeans with metal rivets he took the knife and the belt but left the rest you can put your stuff back in the bag he said now heres the deal your bag goes to the residence building but no farther okay theres an alarm at the residence door if you try to take any metal past there but do me a favor and dont set it off okay cause it shuts down the magnets as a safety procedure and it takes about two minutes to start em up again pisses the techs off especially if theyre fabbing at the time ruins all their hard work i said i would try to remember the rest of your stuff stays right here he nodded to the wall behind me i saw a dozen small safes each with an electronic keypad you set the combination and lock it up yourself he turned aside so i could do that i wont need a watch he shook his head well get you a watch what about a belt well get you a belt and my laptop i said it goes in the safe he said unless you want to scrub your hard drive with the magnetic field i put the laptop in with the rest of my stuff and locked the door i felt strangely stripped like a man entering prison you dont want my shoelaces too i said making a joke nah you keep those so you can strangle yourself if it turns out you need to why would i need to i really couldnt say vince shrugged but these guys working here let me tell you theyre all fucking crazy theyre making these teenyweeny little things you cant see pushing around molecules and shit sticking em together its real tense and detailed work and it makes them crazy every fucking one of em nutty as loons come this way we passed through another set of glass doors but this time there was no spray we entered the power plant beneath blue halogen lamps i saw huge metal tubs ten feet high and fat ceramic insulators thick as a mans leg everything hummed i felt a distinct vibration in the floor there were signs all around with jagged red lightning bolts saying warning lethal electrical currents you use a lot of power here i said enough for a small town vince said he pointed to one of the signs take those warnings seriously we had problems with fires a while back oh yeah got a nest of rats in the building buggers kept getting fried literally i hate the smell of burning rat fur dont you never had that experience i said smells like what youd think uhhuh i said how did the rats get in up through the toilet bowl i must have looked surprised because vince said oh you dont know that rats do that all the time its just a short swim for them to get in course if it happened while you were sitting itd be a nasty surprise he gave a short laugh problem was the contractor for the building didnt bury the leach field deep enough anyhow rats got in weve had a few accidents like that since ive been here is that right what kind of accidents he shrugged they tried to make these buildings perfect he said because theyre working with such smallsize things but its not a perfect world jack never has been never will be i said again what kind of accidents by then we had come to the far door with a keypad and vince punched in numbers quickly the door clicked open all the doors are keyed the same oh six oh four oh two vince pushed the door wide and we stepped into a covered passageway connecting the power plant to the other buildings it was stifling hot here despite the roar of the air conditioner contractor vince explained never balanced the air handlers right we had em back five times to fix it but this passage is always hot at the end of the corridor was another door and vince had me punch in the code myself the door clicked open i faced another airlock a wall of thick glass with another wall a few feet beyond and behind that second wall i saw ricky morse in jeans and a tshirt grinning and waving cheerfully to me his tshirt said obey me i am root it was an inside joke in the unix operating system it meant the boss over an intercom speaker ricky said ill take it from here vince vince waved no problem you fix that positive pressure setting did it an hour ago why it may not be holding in the main lab ill check it again vince said maybe we got another leak somewhere he slapped me on the back jerked his thumb toward the interior of the building lots of luck in there then he turned and walked back the way he came its great to see you ricky said you know the code to get in i said i did he pointed to a keypad i punched the numbers in the glass wall slid sideways i stepped into another narrow space about four feet wide with metal grills on all four sides the wall closed behind me a fierce blast of air shot up from the floor puffing up my trouser legs ruffling my clothing almost immediately it was followed by blasts of air coming from both sides then from top blowing down hard on my hair and shoulders then a whoosh of vacuum the glass in front of me slid laterally i smoothed down my hair and stepped out sorry about that ricky shook my hand vigorously but at least we dont have to wear bunny suits he said i noticed that he looked strong healthy the muscles in his forearms were defined i said you look good ricky working out oh you know not really youre pretty cut i said i punched him on the shoulder he grinned just tension on the job did vince frighten you not exactly hes a little strange ricky said vince grew up alone out in the desert with his mother she died when he was five body was pretty decomposed when they finally found her poor kid he just didnt know what to do i guess id be strange too ricky gave a shrug but im glad youre here jack i was afraid you wouldnt come despite rickys apparent good health i was noticing now that he seemed nervous edgy he led me briskly down a short hallway so hows julia broke her arm and hit her head pretty badly shes in the hospital for observation but shes going to be all right good thats good he nodded quickly continuing down a corridor whos taking care of the kids i told him that my sister was in town then you can stay awhile a few days i said i guess if you need me that long ordinarily software consultants dont spend a lot of time onsite one day maybe two not more than that ricky glanced over his shoulder at me did julia ah explain to you about this place not really no but you knew she was spending a lot of time here i said oh sure yes the last few weeks she came out almost every day on the helicopter stayed over a couple of nights too i said i didnt know she took such an interest in manufacturing ricky seemed to hesitate a moment then he said well jack this is a whole new thing he frowned she really didnt tell you anything no not really why he didnt answer he opened the far door and waved me through this is our residential module where everybody sleeps and eats the air was cool after the passageway the walls were the same smooth formica material i heard a low continuous whoosh of air handlers a series of doors opened off the hallway one of them had my name on it written in marker on a piece of tape ricky opened the door home sweet home jack the room was monastica small bed a tiny desk just large enough to hold a workstation monitor and keyboard above the bed a shelf for books and clothes all the furniture had been coated with smoothflowing white plastic laminate there were no nooks or crannies to hold stray particles of dirt there was no window in the room either but a liquidcrystal screen showed a view of the desert outside there was a plastic watch and a belt with a plastic buckle on the bed i put them on ricky said dump your gear and ill give you the tour still keeping his brisk pace he led me into a mediumsize lounge with a couch and chairs around a coffee table and a bulletin board on the wall all the furniture here was the same flowing plastic laminate to the right is the kitchen and the rec room with tv video games so forth we entered the small kitchen there were two people there a man and a woman eating sandwiches standing up i think you know these guys ricky said grinning and i did they had been on my team at mediatronics rosie castro was dark thin exoticlooking and sarcastic she wore baggy cargo shorts and a tshirt tight across her large breasts which read you wish independent and rebellious rosie had been a shakespearean scholar at harvard before she decided in her words that shakespeare is fucking dead for fucking centuries there is nothing new to say whats the point she transferred to mit became a protйgйe of robert kim working on natural language programming it turned out she was brilliant at it and these days natural language programs were starting to involve distributed processing because it turned out people evaluate a sentence in several ways simultaneously while it is being spoken they dont wait until it is finished but rather they form expectations of what is coming thats a perfect situation for distributed processing which can work on a problem at several points simultaneously i said still wearing those tshirts rosie at mediatronics wed had some trouble about the way she dressed hey keeps the boys awake she said shrugging actually we ignore them i turned to david brooks stiff formal obsessively neat and almost bald at twentyeight he blinked behind thick glasses theyre not that good anyway he said rosie stuck her tongue out at him david was an engineer and he had an engineers bluntness and lack of social skills he was also full of contradictions although he fussed over every detail of his work and appearance on weekends he raced a dirt bike often coming back covered in mud he shook my hand enthusiastically im very glad youre here jack i said somebodys going to have to tell me why youre all so glad to see me rosie said well its because you know more about the multiagent algorithms that im going to show him around first ricky said interrupting then well talk why rosie said you want it to be a surprise hell of a surprise david said no not at all ricky said giving them a hard look i just want jack to have some background first i want to go over that with him david looked at his watch well how much time do you think that will take because i figure weve got i said let me show him around for christs sake ricky was almost snarling i was surprised id never seen him lose his temper before but apparently they had okay okay ricky hey youre the boss ricky thats right i am ricky said still visibly angry and by the way your break ended ten minutes ago so lets get back to work he looked into the adjoining game room where are the others fixing the perimeter sensors you mean theyre outside no no theyre in the utility room bobby thinks theres a calibration problem with the sensor units great did anybody tell vince no its software bobbys taking care of it it was at that point that my cell phone beeped i was surprised pulled it out of my pocket i turned to the others cell phones work yeah ricky said were wired here he went back to his argument with david and rosie i stepped into the corridor and got my messages there was only one from the hospital about julia we understand you are ms formans husband and if you could call us please as soon as possible then an extension for a dr rana i dialed back at once the switchboard put me through icu i asked for dr rana and waited until he came on i said this is jack forman julia formans husband oh yes mr forman a pleasant melodic voice thank you for calling back i understand you accompanied your wife to the hospital last night yes well then you know the seriousness of her injuries or should i say her potential injuries we really do feel that she needs to have a thorough workup for cervical fracture and for subdural hematoma and she needs a pelvic fracture workup as well yes i said thats what i was told last night is there a problem actually there is your wife is refusing treatment she is last night she allowed us to take xrays and to set the fractures in her wrist weve explained to her that xrays are limited in what we can see and that it is quite important for her to have an mri but she is refusing that i said why she says she doesnt need it of course she needs it i said yes she does mr forman rana said i dont want to alarm you but the concern with pelvic fracture is massive hemorrhaging into the abdomen and well bleeding to death it can happen very quickly and what do you want me to do wed like you to talk to her of course put her on unfortunately shes gone for some additional xrays just now is there a number where you can be reached your cell phone all right one other thing mr forman we werent able to take a psychiatric history from your wife why is that she refuses to talk about it im referring to drugs any history of behavioral disorders that kind of thing can you shed any light in that area ill try i dont want to alarm you but your wife has been well a bit on the irrational side at times almost delusional shes been under a lot of stress lately i said yes i am sure that contributes dr rana said smoothly and she has suffered a severe head injury which we need to investigate further i dont want to alarm you but frankly it was the opinion of the psychiatric consult that your wife was suffering from a bipolar disorder or a drug disorder or both i see and of course such questions naturally arise in the context of a singlecar automobile accident he meant that the accident might be a suicide attempt i didnt think that was likely i have no knowledge of my wife taking drugs i said but i have been concerned about her behavior for oh a few weeks now ricky came over and stood by me impatiently i put my hand over the phone its about julia he nodded and glanced at his watch raised his eyebrows i thought it was pretty odd that he would push me when i was talking to the hospital about my wifeand his immediate superior the doctor rambled on for a while and i did my best to answer his questions but the fact was i didnt have any information that could help him he said he would have julia call when she got back and i said i would wait for the call i flipped the phone closed ricky said okay fine sorry to rush you jack but you know ive got a lot to show you is there a time problem i said i dont know maybe i started to ask what he meant by that but he was already leading me forward walking quickly we left the residential area passing through another glass door and down another passageway this passage i noticed was tightly sealed we walked along a glass walkway suspended above the floor the glass had little perforations and beneath was a series of vacuum ducts for suction by now i was growing accustomed to the constant hiss of the air handlers midway down the corridor was another pair of glass doors we had to go through them one at a time they parted as we went through and closed behind us continuing on i again had the distinct feeling of being in a prison of going through a succession of barred gates going deeper and deeper into something it might be all hightech and shiny glass wallsbut it was still a prison day am we came into a large room marked utility and beneath it molstockfabstockfeedstock the walls and ceiling were covered with the familiar smooth plastic laminate large laminated containers were stacked on the floor off to the right i saw a row of big stainlesssteel kettles sunk below ground with lots of piping and valves surrounding them and coming up to the firstfloor level it looked exactly like a microbrewery and i was about to ask ricky about it when he said so there you are working at a junction box beneath a monitor screen were three more members of my old team they looked slightly guilty as we came up like kids caught with their hands in the cookie jar of course bobby lembeck was their leader at thirtyfive bobby now supervised more code than he wrote but he could still write when he wanted to as always he was wearing faded jeans and a ghost in the shell tshirt his ubiquitous walkman clamped to his waist then there was mae chang beautiful and delicate about as different from rosie castro as any woman could be mae had worked as a field biologist in sichuan studying the golden snubnosed monkey before turning to programming in her midtwenties her time in the field as well as her natural inclination led her to be almost silent mae said very little moved almost soundlessly and never raised her voicebut she never lost an argument either like many field biologists she had developed the uncanny ability to slip into the background to become unnoticed almost to vanish and finally charley davenport grumpy rumpled and already overweight at thirty slow and lumbering he looked as if he had slept in his clothes and in fact he often did after a marathon programming session charley had worked under john holland in chicago and doyne farmer at los alamos he was an expert in genetic algorithms the kind of programming that mimicked natural selection to hone answers but he was an irritating personalityhe hummed he snorted talked to himself and farted with noisy abandon the group only tolerated him because he was so talented does it really take three people to do this ricky said after id shaken hands all around yes bobby said it does take three people el rooto because its complicated why and dont call me el rooto i obey mr root just get on with it well bobby said i started to check the sensors after this mornings episode and it looks to me like theyre miscalibrated but since nobody is going outside the question is whether were reading them wrong or whether the sensors themselves are faulty or just scaled wrong on the equipment in here mae knows these sensors shes used them in china im making code revisions now and charley is here because he wont go away and leave us alone shit i have better things to do charley said but i wrote the algorithm that controls the sensors and we need to optimize the sensor code after theyre done im just waiting until they stop screwing around then ill optimize he looked pointedly at bobby none of these guys can optimize worth a damn mae said bobby can yeah if you give him six months maybe children children ricky said lets not make a scene in front of our guest i smiled blandly the truth was i hadnt been paying attention to what they were saying i was just watching them these were three of my best programmersand when they had worked for me they had been selfassured to the point of arrogance but now i was struck by how nervous the group was they were all on edge bickering jumpy and thinking back i realized that rosie and david had been on edge too charley started humming in that irritating way of his oh christ bobby lembeck said would you tell him to shut up ricky said charley you know weve talked about the humming charley continued to hum charley charley gave a long theatrical sigh he stopped humming thank you bobby said charley rolled his eyes and looked at the ceiling all right ricky said finish up quickly and get back to your stations okay fine i want everybody in place as soon as possible okay bobby said im serious in your places for christs sake ricky okay okay now will you stop talking and let us work leaving the group behind ricky took me across the floor to a small room i said ricky these kids arent the way they were when they worked for me i know everybodys a little uptight right now and why is that because of whats going on here and what is going on here he stopped before a small cubicle on the other side of the room julia couldnt tell you because it was classified he touched the door with a keycard i said classified medical imaging is classified the door latch clicked open and we went inside the door closed behind us i saw a table two chairs a computer monitor and a keyboard ricky sat down and immediately started typing the medical imaging project was just an afterthought he said a minor commercial application of the technology we are already developing uhhuh which is military xymos is doing military work yes under contract he paused two years ago the department of defense realized from their experience in bosnia that there was enormous value to robot aircraft that could fly overhead and transmit battlefield images in real time the pentagon knew that there would be more and more sophisticated uses for these flying cameras in future wars you could use them to spot the locations of enemy troops even when they were hidden in jungle or in buildings you could use them to control laserguided rocket fire or to identify the location of friendly troops and so on commanders on the ground could call up the images they wanted in the spectra they wantedvisible infrared uv whatever realtime imaging was going to be a very powerful tool in future warfare okay but obviously ricky said these robot cameras were vulnerable you could shoot them down like pigeons the pentagon wanted a camera that couldnt be shot down they imagined something very small maybe the size of a dragonflya target too small to hit but there were problems with power supply with small control surfaces and with resolution using such a small lens they needed a bigger lens i nodded and so you thought of a swarm of nanocomponents thats right ricky pointed to the screen where a cluster of black spots wheeled and turned in the air like birds a cloud of components would allow you to make a camera with as large a lens as you wanted and it couldnt be shot down because a bullet would just pass through the cloud furthermore you could disperse the cloud the way a flock of birds disperses with a gunshot then the camera would be invisible until it reformed again so it seemed an ideal solution the pentagon gave us three years of darpa funding and we set out to make the camera it was of course immediately obvious that we had a problem with distributed intelligence i was familiar with the problem the nanoparticles in the cloud had to be endowed with a rudimentary intelligence so that they could interact with each other to form a flock that wheeled in the air such coordinated activity might look pretty intelligent but it occurred even when the individuals making up the flock were rather stupid after all birds and fish could do it and they werent the brightest creatures on the planet most people watching a flock of birds or a school of fish assumed there was a leader and that all the other animals followed the leader that was because human beings like most social mammals had group leaders but birds and fish had no leaders their groups werent organized that way careful study of flocking behaviorframebyframe video analysisshowed that in fact there was no leader birds and fish responded to a few simple stimuli among themselves and the result was coordinated behavior but nobody was controlling it nobody was leading it nobody was directing it nor were individual birds genetically programmed for flocking behavior flocking was not hardwired there was nothing in the bird brain that said when thusandsuch happens start flocking on the contrary flocking simply emerged within the group as a result of much simpler lowlevel rules rules like stay close to the birds nearest you but dont bump into them from those rules the entire group flocked in smooth coordination because flocking arose from lowlevel rules it was called emergent behavior the technical definition of emergent behavior was behavior that occurred in a group but was not programmed into any member of the group emergent behavior could occur in any population including a computer population or a robot population or a nanoswarm i said to ricky your problem was emergent behavior in the swarm exactly it was unpredictable to put it mildly in recent decades this notion of emergent group behavior had caused a minor revolution in computer science what that meant for programmers was that you could lay down rules of behavior for individual agents but not for the agents acting together individual agentswhether programming modules or processors or as in this case actual microrobotscould be programmed to cooperate under certain circumstances and to compete under other circumstances they could be given goals they could be instructed to pursue their goals with singleminded intensity or to be available to help other agents but the result of these interactions could not be programmed it just emerged with often surprising outcomes in a way this was very exciting for the first time a program could produce results that absolutely could not be predicted by the programmer these programs behaved more like living organisms than manmade automatons that excited programmersbut it frustrated them too because the programs emergent behavior was erratic sometimes competing agents fought to a standstill and the program failed to accomplish anything sometimes agents were so influenced by one another that they lost track of their goal and did something else instead in that sense the program was very childlikeunpredictable and easily distracted as one programmer put it trying to program distributed intelligence is like telling a fiveyearold kid to go to his room and change his clothes he may do that but he is equally likely to do something else and never return because these programs behaved in a lifelike way programmers began to draw analogies to the behavior of real organisms in the real world in fact they began to model the behavior of actual organisms as a way to get some control over program outcomes so you had programmers studying ant swarming or termite mounding or bee dancing in order to write programs to control airplane landing schedules or package routing or language translation these programs often worked beautifully but they could still go awry particularly if circumstances changed drastically then they would lose their goals that was why i began five years ago to model predatorprey relationships as a way to keep goals fixed because hungry predators werent distracted circumstances might force them to improvise their methods and they might try many times before they succeededbut they didnt lose track of their goal so i became an expert in predatorprey relationships i knew about packs of hyenas african hunting dogs stalking lionesses and attacking columns of army ants my team had studied the literature from the field biologists and we had generalized those findings into a program module called predprey which could be used to control any system of agents and make its behavior purposeful to make the program seek a goal looking at rickys screen the coordinated units moving smoothly as they turned through the air i said you used predprey to program your individual units right we used those rules well the behavior looks pretty good to me i said watching the screen why is there a problem were not sure what does that mean it means we know theres a problem but were not sure whats causing it whether the problem is programmingor something else something else like what i frowned i dont get it ricky this is just a cluster of microbots you can make it do what you want if the programmings not right you adjust it what dont i understand ricky looked at me uneasily he pushed his chair away from the table and stood let me show you how we manufacture these agents he said then youll understand the situation better having watched julias demo tape i was immensely curious to see what he showed me next because many people i respected thought molecular manufacturing was impossible one of the major theoretical objections was the time it would take to build a working molecule to work at all the nanoassembly line would have to be far more efficient than anything previously known in human manufacturing basically all manmade assembly lines ran at roughly the same speed they could add one part per second an automobile for example had a few thousand parts you could build a car in a matter of hours a commercial aircraft had six million parts and took several months to build but a typical manufactured molecule consisted of parts that was parts as a practical matter this number was unimaginably large the human brain couldnt comprehend it but calculations showed that even if you could assemble at the rate of a million parts per second the time to complete one molecule would still be trillion yearslonger than the known age of the universe and that was a problem it was known as the buildtime problem i said to ricky if youre doing industrial manufacturing we are then you must have solved the buildtime problem we have how just wait most scientists assumed this problem would be solved by building from larger subunits molecular fragments consisting of billions of atoms that would cut the assembly time down to a couple of years then with partial selfassembly you might get the time down to several hours perhaps even one hour but even with further refinements it remained a theoretical challenge to produce commercial quantities of product because the goal was not to manufacture a single molecule in an hour the goal was to manufacture several pounds of molecules in an hour no one had ever figured out how to do that we passed a couple of laboratories including one that looked like a standard microbiology lab or a genetics lab i saw mae standing in that lab puttering around i started to ask ricky why he had a microbiology lab here but he brushed my question aside he was impatient now in a hurry i saw him glance at his watch directly ahead was a final glass airlock stenciled on the glass door was microfabrication ricky waved me in one at a time he said thats all the system allows i stepped in the doors hissed shut behind me the pressure pads again thunking shut another blast of air from below from the sides from above by now i was getting used to it the second door opened and i walked forward down another short corridor opening into a large room beyond i saw bright shining white lightso bright it hurt my eyes ricky came after me talking as we walked but i dont remember what he said i couldnt focus on his words i just stared because by now i was inside the main fab buildinga huge windowless space like a giant hangar three stories high and within this hangar stood a structure of immense complexity that seemed to hang in midair glowing like a jewel day am at first it was hard to understand what i was seeingit looked like an enormous glowing octopus rising above me with glinting faceted arms extending outward in all directions throwing complex reflections and bands of color onto the outer walls except this octopus had multiple layers of arms one layer was low just a foot above the floor a second was at chestlevel the third and fourth layers were higher above my head and they all glowed sparkled brilliantly i blinked dazzled i began to make out the details the octopus was contained within an irregular threestory framework built entirely of modular glass cubes floors walls ceilings staircaseseverything was cubes but the arrangement was haphazard as if someone had dumped a mound of giant transparent sugar cubes in the center of the room within this cluster of cubes the arms of the octopus snaked off in all directions the whole thing was held up by a web of black anodized struts and connectors but they were obscured by the reflections which is why the octopus seemed to hang in midair ricky grinned convergent assembly the architecture is fractal neat huh i nodded slowly i was seeing more details what i had seen as an octopus was actually a branching tree structure a central square conduit ran vertically through the center of the room with smaller pipes branching off on all sides from these branches even smaller pipes branched off in turn and smaller ones still the smallest of the pipes were pencilthin everything gleamed as if it were mirrored why is it so bright the glass has diamondoid coating he said at the molecular level glass is like swiss cheese full of holes and of course its a liquid so atoms just pass right through it so you coat the glass right have to within this shining forest of branching glass david and rosie moved making notes adjusting valves consulting handheld computers i understood that i was looking at a massively parallel assembly line small fragments of molecules were introduced into the smallest pipes and atoms were added to them when that was finished they moved into the next largest pipes where more atoms were added in this way molecules moved progressively toward the center of the structure until assembly was completed and they were discharged into the central pipe exactly right ricky said this is just the same as an automobile assembly line except that its on a molecular scale molecules start at the ends and come down the line to the center we stick on a protein sequence here a methyl group there just the way they stick doors and wheels on a car at the end of the line off rolls a new custommade molecular structure built to our specifications and the different arms make different molecules thats why the arms look different in several places the octopus arm passed through a steel tunnel reinforced with heavy bolts for vacuum ducting in other places a cube was covered with quilted silver insulation and i saw liquid nitrogen tanks nearby extremely low temperatures were generated in that section thosere our cryogenic rooms ricky said we dont go very low maybe centigrade max come on ill show you he led me through the complex following glass walkways that threaded among the arms in some places a short staircase enabled us to step over the lowest arms ricky chatted continuously about technical details vacuumjacketed hoses metal phase separators globe check valves when we reached the insulated cube he opened the heavy door to reveal a small room with a second room adjacent it looked like a pair of meat lockers small glass windows were set in each door at the moment everything was at room temperature you can have two different temps here he said run one from the other if you want but its usually automated ricky led me back outside glancing at his watch as he did so i said are we late for an appointment what no no nothing like that nearby two cubes were actually solid metal rooms with thick electrical cables running inside i said those your magnet rooms thats right ricky said weve got pulsed field magnets generating tesla in the core thats something like a million times the magnetic field of the earth with a grunt he pushed open the steel door to the nearest magnet room i saw a large doughnutshaped object about six feet in diameter with a hole in the center about an inch wide the doughnut was completely encased in tubing and plastic insulation heavy steel bolts running from top to bottom held the jacketing in place lot of cooling for this puppy i can tell you and a lot of power fifteen kilovolts takes a fullminute load time for the capacitors and of course we can only pulse it if we turned it on continuously itd exploderipped apart by the field it generates he pointed to the base of the magnet where there was a round push button at knee level thats the safety cutoff there he said just in case hit it with your knee if your hands are full i said so you use high magnetic fields to do part of your assemb but ricky had already turned and headed out the door again glancing at his watch i hurried after him ricky i have more to show you he said were getting to the end ricky this is all very impressive i said gesturing to the glowing arms but most of your assembly line is running at room temperatureno vacuum no cryo no mag field right no special conditions how is that possible he shrugged the assemblers dont need it the assemblers i said are you telling me youve got molecular assemblers on this line yes of course assemblers are doing your fabrication for you of course i thought you understood that no ricky i said i didnt understand that at all and i dont like to be lied to he got a wounded look on his face im not lying but i was certain that he was one of the first things scientists learned about molecular manufacturing was how phenomenally difficult it was to carry out in some ibm researchers pushed xenon atoms around on a nickel plate until they formed the letters ibm in the shape of the company logo the entire logo was one tenbillionth of an inch long and could only be seen through an electron microscope but it made a striking visual and it got a lot of publicity ibm allowed people to think it was a proof of concept the opening of a door to molecular manufacturing but it was more of a stunt than anything else because pushing individual atoms into a specific arrangement was slow painstaking and expensive work it took the ibm researchers a whole day to move thirtyfive atoms nobody believed you could create a whole new technology in this way instead most people believed that nanoengineers would eventually find a way to build assemblersminiature molecular machines that could turn out specific molecules the way a ballbearing machine turned out ball bearings the new technology would rely on molecular machines to make molecular products it was a nice concept but the practical problems were daunting because assemblers were vastly more complicated than the molecules they made attempts to design and build them had been difficult from the outset to my knowledge no laboratory anywhere in the world had actually done it but now ricky was telling me quite casually that xymos could build molecular assemblers that were now turning out molecules for the company and i didnt believe him i had worked all my life in technology and i had developed a feel for what was possible this kind of giant leap forward just didnt happen it never did technologies were a form of knowledge and like all knowledge technologies grew evolved matured to believe otherwise was to believe that the wright brothers could build a rocket and fly to the moon instead of flying three hundred feet over sand dunes at kitty hawk nanotechnology was still at the kitty hawk stage come on ricky i said how are you really doing this the technical details arent that important jack what fresh bullshit is this of course theyre important jack he said giving me his most winning smile do you really think im lying to you yes ricky i said i do i looked up at the octopus arms all around me surrounded by glass i saw my own reflection dozens of times in the surfaces around me it was confusing disorienting trying to gather my thoughts i looked down at my feet and i noticed that even though we had been walking on glass walkways some sections of the ground floor were glass as well one section was nearby i walked toward it through the glass i could see steel ducting and pipes below ground level one set of pipes caught my eye because they ran from the storage room to a nearby glass cube at which point they emerged from the floor and headed upward branching into the smaller tubes that i assumed was the feedstockthe slush of raw organic material that would be transformed on the assembly line into finished molecules looking back down at the floor i followed the pipes backward to the place where they entered from the adjacent room this junction was glass too i could see the curved steel underbellies of the big kettles id noticed earlier the tanks that i had thought were a microbrewery because thats certainly what it had looked like a small brewery machinery for controlled fermentation for controlled microbial growth and then i realized what it really was i said you son of a bitch ricky smiled again and shrugged hey he said it gets the job done those kettles in the next room were indeed tanks for controlled microbial growth but ricky wasnt making beerhe was making microbes and i had no doubt about the reason why unable to construct genuine nanoassemblers xymos was using bacteria to crank out their molecules this was genetic engineering not nanotechnology well not exactly ricky said when i told him what i thought but i admit were using a hybrid technology not much of a surprise in any case is it that was true for at least ten years observers had been predicting that genetic engineering computer programming and nanotechnology would eventually merge they were all involved with similarand interconnectedactivities there wasnt that much difference between using a computer to decode part of a bacterial genome and using a computer to help you insert new genes into the bacteria to make new proteins and there wasnt much difference between creating a new bacteria to spit out say insulin molecules and creating a manmade micromechanical assembler to spit out new molecules it was all happening at the molecular level it was all the same challenge of imposing human design on extremely complex systems and molecular design was nothing if not complicated you could think of a molecule as a series of atoms snapped together like lego blocks one after another but the image was misleading because unlike a lego set atoms couldnt be snapped together in any arrangement you liked an inserted atom was subject to powerful local forcesmagnetic and chemicalwith frequently undesirable results the atom might be kicked out of its position it might remain but at an awkward angle it might even fold the entire molecule up in knots as a result molecular manufacturing was an exercise in the art of the possible of substituting atoms and groups of atoms to make equivalent structures that would work in the desired way in the face of all this difficulty it was impossible to ignore the fact that there already existed proven molecular factories capable of turning out large numbers of molecules they were called cells unfortunately cellular manufacturing can take us only so far ricky said we harvest the substrate moleculesthe raw materialsand then we build on them with nanoengineering procedures so we do a little of both i pointed down at the tanks what cells are you growing thetad he said which is a strain of e coli e coli was a common bacterium found pretty much everywhere in the natural environment even in the human intestine i said did anyone think it might not be a good idea to use cells that can live inside human beings not really he said frankly that wasnt a consideration we just wanted a wellstudied cell that was fully documented in the literature we chose an industry standard uhhuh anyway ricky continued i dont think its a problem jack it wont thrive in the human gut thetad is optimized for a variety of nutrient sourcesto make it cheap to grow in the laboratory in fact i think it can even grow on garbage so thats how you get your molecules bacteria make them for you yes he said thats how we get the primary molecules we harvest twentyseven primary molecules they fit together in relatively hightemperature settings where the atoms are more active and mix quickly thats why its hot in here yes reaction efficiency has a maxima at one hundred fortyseven degrees fahrenheit so we work there thats where we get the fastest combination rate but these molecules will combine at much lower temperatures even around thirtyfive forty degrees fahrenheit youll get a certain amount of molecular combination and you dont need other conditions i said vacuum pressure high magnetic fields ricky shook his head no jack we maintain those conditions to speed up assembly but its not strictly necessary the design is really elegant the component molecules go together quite easily and these component molecules combine to form your final assembler which then assembles the molecules we want yes it was a clever solution creating his assemblers with bacteria but ricky was telling me the components assembled themselves almost automatically with nothing required but high temperature what then was this complex glass building used for efficiency and process separation ricky said we can build as many as nine assemblers simultaneously in the different arms and where do the assemblers make the final molecules in this same structure but first we reapply them i shook my head i wasnt familiar with the term reapply its a little refinement we developed here were patenting it you see our system worked perfectly right from the startbut our yields were extremely low we were harvesting half a gram of finished molecules an hour at that rate it would take several days to make a single camera we couldnt figure out what the problem was the late assembly in the arms is done in gas phase it turned out that the molecular assemblers were heavy and tended to sink to the bottom the bacteria settled on a layer above them releasing component molecules that were lighter still and floated higher so the assemblers were making very little contact with the molecules they were meant to assemble we tried mixing technologies but they didnt help so you did what we modified the assembler design to provide a lipotrophic base that would attach to the surface of the bacteria that brought the assemblers into better contact with the component molecules and immediately our yields jumped five orders of magnitude and now your assemblers sit on the bacteria correct they attach to the outer cell membrane at a nearby workstation ricky punched up the assembler design on the flat panel display the assembler looked like a sort of pinwheel a series of spiral arms going off in different directions and a dense knot of atoms in the center its fractal as i said he said so it looks sort of the same at smaller orders of magnitude he laughed like the old joke turtles all the way down he pressed more keys anyway heres the attached configuration the screen now showed the assembler adhering to a much larger pillshaped object like a pinwheel attached to a submarine thats the thetad bacterium ricky said with the assembler on it as i watched several more pinwheels attached themselves and these assemblers make the actual camera units correct he typed again i saw a new image this is our target micromachine the final camera youve seen the bloodstream version this is the pentagon version quite a bit larger and designed to be airborne what youre looking at is a molecular helicopter wheres the propeller i said hasnt got one the machine uses those little round protrusions you see there stuck in at angles thosere motors the machines actually maneuver by climbing the viscosity of the air climbing the what viscosity of the air he smiled micromachine level remember its a whole new world jack however innovative the design ricky was still bound by the pentagons engineering specs for the product and the product wasnt performing yes they had built a camera that couldnt be shot down and it transmitted images very well ricky explained it worked perfectly during tests indoors but outside even a modest breeze tended to blow it away like the cloud of dust it was the engineering team at xymos was attempting to modify the units to increase mobility but so far without success meanwhile the department of defense decided the design constraints were unbeatable and had backed away from the whole nano concept the xymos contract had been canceled dod was going to pull funding in another six weeks i said thats why julia was so desperate for venture capital these last few weeks right ricky said frankly this whole company could go belly up before christmas unless you fix the units so they can work in wind right right i said ricky im a programmer i cant help you with your agent mobility problems thats an issue of molecular design its engineering its not my area um i know that he paused frowned but actually we think the program code may be involved in the solution the code involved in the solution to what jack i have to be frank with you weve made a mistake he said but its not our fault i swear to you it wasnt us it was the contractors he started down the stairs come on ill show you walking briskly he led me to the far side of the facility where i saw an open yellow elevator cage mounted on the wall it was a small elevator and i was uncomfortable because it was open i averted my eyes ricky said dont like heights cant stand them well its better than walking he pointed off to one side where an iron ladder ran up the wall to the ceiling when the elevator goes out we have to climb up that i shuddered not me we rode the elevator all the way up to the ceiling three stories above the ground hanging beneath the ceiling was a tangle of ducts and conduits and a network of mesh walkways to enable workers to service them i hated the mesh because i could see through it to the floor far below i tried not to look down we had to duck repeatedly beneath the lowhanging pipes ricky shouted over the roar of the equipment everythings up here he yelled pointing in various directions air handlers over there water tank for the fire sprinkler system there electrical junction boxes there this is really the center of everything ricky continued down the walkway finally stopping beside a big air vent about three feet in diameter that went into the outer wall this is vent three he said leaning close to my ear its one of four main vents that exhausts air to the outside now you see those slots along the vent and the square boxes that sit in the slots those are filter packs we have microfilters arranged in successive layers to prevent any external contamination from the facility i see them you see them now ricky said unfortunately the contractor forgot to install the filters in this particular vent in fact they didnt even cut the slots so the building inspectors never realized anything was missing they signed off on the building we started working here and we vented unfiltered air to the outside environment for how long ricky bit his lip three weeks and you were at full production he nodded we figure we vented approximately twentyfive kilos of contaminants and what were the contaminants a little of everything were not sure of exactly what so you vented e coli assemblers finished molecules everything correct but we dont know what proportions do the proportions matter they might yes ricky was increasingly edgy as he told me all this biting his lip scratching his head avoiding my eyes i didnt get it in the annals of industrial pollution fifty pounds of contamination was trivial fifty pounds of material would fit comfortably in a gym bag unless it was highly toxic or radioactiveand it wasntsuch a small quantity simply didnt matter i said ricky so what those particles were scattered by the wind across hundreds of miles of desert theyll decay from sunlight and cosmic radiation theyll break up decompose in a few hours or days theyre gone right ricky shrugged actually jack thats not what it was at that moment that the alarm went off it was a quiet alarm just a soft insistent pinging but it made ricky jump he ran down the walkway feet clanging on the metal toward a computer workstation mounted on the wall there was a status window in the corner of the monitor it was flashing red pv entry i said what does that mean something set off the perimeter alarms he unclipped his radio and said vince lock us down the radio crackled were locked down ricky raise positive pressure its up five pounds above baseline you want more no leave it there do we have visualization not yet shit ricky stuck the radio back on his belt began typing quickly the workstation screen divided into a halfdozen small images from security cameras mounted all around the facility some showed the surrounding desert from high views looking down from rooftops others were ground views the cameras panned slowly i saw nothing just desert scrub and occasional clumps of cactus false alarm i said ricky shook his head i wish i said i dont see anything itll take a minute to find it find what that he pointed to the monitor and bit his lip i saw what appeared to be a small swirling cloud of dark particles it looked like a dust devil one of those tiny tornadolike clusters that moved over the ground spun by convection currents rising from the hot desert floor except that this cloud was black and it had some definitionit seemed to be pinched in the middle making it look a bit like an oldfashioned coke bottle but it didnt hold that shape consistently the appearance kept shifting transforming ricky i said what are we looking at i was hoping youd tell me it looks like an agent swarm is that your camera swarm no its something else how do you know because we cant control it it doesnt respond to our radio signals youve tried yes weve tried to make contact with it for almost two weeks he said its generating an electrical field that we can measure but for some reason we cant interact with it so you have a runaway swarm yes acting autonomously yes and this has been going on for days about ten days ten days i frowned how is that possible ricky the swarms a collection of microrobotic machines why havent they decayed or run out of power and why exactly cant you control them because if they have the ability to swarm then theres some electrically mediated interaction among them so you should be able to take control of the swarmor at least disrupt it all true ricky said except we cant and weve tried everything we can think of he was focused on the screen watching intently that cloud is independent of us period and so you brought me out here to help us get the fucking thing back ricky said day am it was i thought a problem no one had ever imagined before in all the years that i had been programming agents the focus had been on getting them to interact in a way that produced useful results it never occurred to us that there might be a larger control issue or a question of independence because it simply couldnt happen individual agents were too small to be selfpowered they had to get their energy from some external source such as a supplied electrical or microwave field all you had to do was turn off the field and the agents died the swarm was no more difficult to control than a household appliance like a kitchen blender flip the power off and it went dead but ricky was telling me this cloud had been selfsustaining for days that just didnt make sense where is it getting power he sighed we built the units with a small piezo wafer to generate current from photons its only supplementarywe added it as an afterthoughtbut they seem to be managing with it alone so the units are solarpowered i said right whose idea was that the pentagon asked for it and you built in capacitance yeah they can store charge for three hours okay fine i said now we were getting somewhere so they have enough power for three hours what happens at night at night they presumably lose power after three hours of darkness and then the cloud falls apart yes and the individual units drop to the ground presumably yes cant you take control of them then we could ricky said if we could find them we go out every night looking but we can never find them youve built in markers yes sure every single unit has a fluorescing module in the shell they show up bluegreen under uv light so you go out at night looking for a patch of desert that glows bluegreen right and so far we havent found it that didnt really surprise me if the cloud collapsed tightly it would form a clump about six inches in diameter on the desert floor and it was a big desert out there they could easily miss it night after night but as i thought about it there was another aspect that didnt make sense once the cloud fell to the groundonce the individual units lost powerthen the cloud had no organization it could be scattered by wind like so many dust particles never to reform but evidently that didnt happen the units didnt scatter instead the cloud returned day after day why was that we think ricky said that it may hide at night hide yeah we think it goes to some protected area maybe an overhang or a hole in the ground something like that i pointed to the cloud as it swirled toward us you think that swarm is capable of hiding i think its capable of adapting in fact i know it is he sighed anyway its more than just one swarm jack theres more than one theres at least three maybe more by now i felt a momentary blankness a kind of sleepy gray confusion that washed over me i suddenly couldnt think i couldnt put it together what are you saying im saying it reproduces jack he said the fucking swarm reproduces the camera now showed a groundlevel view of the dust cloud as it swirled toward us but as i watched i realized it wasnt swirling like a dust devil instead the particles were twisting one way then another in a kind of sinuous movement they were definitely swarming swarming was a term for the behavior of certain social insects like ants or bees which swarmed whenever the hive moved to a new site a cloud of bees will fly in one direction and then another forming a dark river in the air the swarm might halt and cling to a tree for perhaps an hour perhaps overnight before continuing onward eventually the bees settled on a new location for their hive and stopped swarming in recent years programmers had written programs that modeled this insect behavior swarmintelligence algorithms had become an important tool in computer programming to programmers a swarm meant a population of computer agents that acted together to solve a problem by distributed intelligence swarming became a popular way to organize agents to work together there were professional organizations and conferences devoted entirely to swarmintelligence programs lately it had become a kind of default solutionif you couldnt code anything more inventive you made your agents swarm but as i watched i could see this cloud was not swarming in any ordinary sense the sinuous backandforth motion seemed to be only part of its movement there was also a rhythmic expansion and contraction a pulse almost like breathing and intermittently the cloud seemed to thin out and rise higher then to collapse down and become more squat these changes occurred continuously but in a repeating rhythmor rather a series of superimposed rhythms shit ricky said i dont see the others and i know its not alone he pressed the radio again vince you see any others no ricky where are the others guys speak to me radios crackled all over the facility bobby lembeck ricky its alone it cant be alone mae chang ricky nothing else is registering out there just one swarm ricky that was david brooks it cant be alone ricky was gripping the radio so tightly his fingers were white he pressed the button vince take the ppi up to seven you sure do it well all right if you really think just skip the fucking commentary and do it ricky was talking about increasing the positive pressure inside the building to seven pounds per square inch all clean facilities maintained a positive pressure so that outside dust particles could not enter from any leak they would be blown outward by the escaping air but one or two pounds was enough to maintain that seven pounds of positive pressure was a lot it was unnecessary to keep out passive particles but of course these particles werent passive watching the cloud swirl and undulate as it came closer i saw that parts of it occasionally caught the sunlight in a way that turned it a shimmering iridescent silver then the color faded and the swarm became black again that had to be the piezo panels catching the sun but it clearly demonstrated that the individual microunits were highly mobile since the entire cloud never turned silver at the same time but only portions or bands i thought you said the pentagon was giving up on you because you couldnt control this swarm in wind right we couldnt but you must have had strong wind in the last few days of course usually comes up in late afternoon we had ten knots yesterday why wasnt the swarm blown away because its figured that one out ricky said gloomily its adapted to it how keep watching youll probably see it whenever the wind gusts the swarm sinks hangs near the ground then it rises up again once the wind dies down this is emergent behavior right nobody programmed it he bit his lip was he lying again so youre telling me its learned right right how can it learn the agents have no memory uh well thats a long story ricky said they have memory yes they have memory limited we built it in ricky pressed the button on his radio anybody hear anything the answers came back crackling in his handset not yet nothing no sounds not yet i said to ricky it makes sounds were not sure sometimes it seems like it weve been trying to record it he flicked keys on the workstation quickly shifting the monitor images making them larger one after another he shook his head i dont like this that thing cant be alone he said i want to know where the others are how do you know there are others because there always are he chewed his lip tensely as he looked at the monitor i wonder what its up to now we didnt have long to wait in a few moments the black swarm had come within a few yards of the building abruptly it divided in two and then divided again now there were three swarms swirling side by side son of a bitch ricky said it was hiding the others inside itself he pushed his button again guys we got all three and theyre close they were in fact too close to be seen by the groundview camera ricky switched to the overhead views i saw three black clouds all moving laterally along the side of the building the behavior seemed distinctly purposeful whatre they trying to do i said get inside ricky said why youd have to ask them but yesterday one of them suddenly from a clump of cactus near the building a cottontail rabbit sprinted away across the desert floor immediately the three swarms turned and pursued it ricky switched the monitor view we now watched at ground level the three clouds converged on the terrified bunny which was moving fast a whitish blur on the screen the clouds swirled after it with surprising speed the behavior was clear they were hunting i felt a moment of irrational pride predprey was working perfectly those swarms might as well be lionesses chasing a gazelle so purposeful was their behavior the swarms turned sharply then split up cutting off the rabbits escape to the left and right the behavior of the three clouds clearly appeared coordinated now they were closing in and suddenly one of the swarms sank down engulfing the rabbit the other two swarms fell on it moments later the resulting particle cloud was so dense it was hard to see the rabbit anymore apparently it had flipped onto its back because i saw its hind legs kicking spasmodically in the air above the cloud itself i said theyre killing it yeah ricky said nodding thats right i thought this was a camera swarm yeah well how are they killing it we dont know jack but its fast i frowned so youve seen this before ricky hesitated bit his lip didnt answer me just stared at the screen i said ricky youve seen this before he gave a long sigh yeah well the first time was yesterday they killed a rattlesnake yesterday i thought they killed a rattlesnake yesterday i said jesus ricky i thought of the men in the helicopter talking about all the dead animals i wondered if ricky was telling me all he knew yeah the rabbit no longer kicked a single protruding foot trembled with small convulsions and then was still the cloud swirled low to the ground around the animal rising and falling slightly this continued for almost a minute i said whatre they doing now ricky shook his head im not sure but they did this before too it almost looks like theyre eating it i know ricky said of course that was absurd predprey was just a biological analogy as i watched the pulsing cloud it occurred to me that this behavior might actually represent a program hang i couldnt remember exactly what rules we had written for individual units after the goal was attained real predators of course would eat their prey but there was no analogous behavior for these microrobots so perhaps the cloud was just swirling in confusion if so it should start moving again soon usually when a distributedintelligence program stalled it was a temporary phenomenon sooner or later random environmental influences would cause enough units to act that they induced all the others to act too then the program would start up again the units would resume goal seeking this behavior was roughly what you saw in a lecture hall after the lecture was over the audience milled around for a while stretching talking to people close to them or greeting friends collecting coats and belongings only a few people left at once and the main crowd ignored them but after a certain percentage of the audience had gone the remaining people would stop milling and begin to leave quickly it was a kind of focus change if i was right then i should see something similar in the behavior of the cloud the swirls should lose their coordinated appearance there should be ragged wisps of particles rising into the air only then would the main cloud move i glanced at the timeclock in the corner of the monitor how long has it been now about two minutes that wasnt particularly long for a stall i thought at one point when we were writing predprey we used the computer to simulate coordinated agent behavior we always restarted after a hang but finally we decided to wait and see if the program was really permanently stalled we found that the program might hang for as long as twelve hours before suddenly kicking off and coming back to life again in fact that behavior interested the neuroscientists becausetheyre starting ricky said and they were the swarms were beginning to rise up from the dead rabbit i saw at once that my theory was wrong there was no raggedness no rising wisps the three clouds rose up together smoothly the behavior seemed entirely nonrandom and controlled the clouds swirled separately for a moment then merged into one sunlight flashed on shimmering silver the rabbit lay motionless on its side and then the swarm moved swiftly away whooshing off into the desert it shrank toward the horizon in moments it was gone ricky was watching me what do you think youve got a breakaway robotic nanoswarm that some idiot made selfpowered and selfsustaining you think we can get it back no i said from what ive seen theres not a chance in hell ricky sighed and shook his head but you can certainly get rid of it i said you can kill it we can absolutely really his face brightened absolutely and i meant it i was convinced that ricky was overstating the problem he faced he hadnt thought it through he hadnt done all he could do i was confident that i could destroy the runaway swarm quickly i expected that id be done with the whole business by dawn tomorrowat the very latest that was how little i understood my adversary day am in retrospect i was right about one thing it was vitally important to know how the rabbit had died of course i know the reason now i also know why the rabbit was attacked but that first day at the laboratory i didnt have the faintest notion of what had happened and i could never have guessed the truth none of us could have at that point not even ricky not even julia it was ten minutes after the swarms had gone and we were all standing in the storage room the whole group had gathered there tense and anxious they watched me as i clipped a radio transmitter to my belt and pulled a headset over my head the headset included a video camera mounted by my left ear it took a while to get the video transmitter working right ricky said youre really going out there i am i said i want to know what happened to that rabbit i turned to the others whos coming with me nobody moved bobby lembeck stared at the floor hands in his pockets david brooks blinked rapidly and looked away ricky was inspecting his fingernails i caught rosie castros eye she shook her head no fucking way jack why not rosie you saw it yourself theyre hunting are they sure as hell looked like it rosie i said i trained you better than this how can the swarms be hunting we all saw it she stuck her chin out stubbornly all three of the swarms hunting coordinated but how i said now she frowned looking confused what are you asking theres no mystery the agents can communicate they can each generate an electrical signal right i said how big a signal well she shrugged how big rosie it cant be much the agent is only a hundredth of the thickness of a human hair cant be generating much of a signal right true and electromagnetic radiation decays according to the square of the radius right every school kid learned that fact in high school physics as you moved away from the electromagnetic source the strength faded fastvery fast and what that meant was the individual agents could only communicate with their immediate neighbors with agents very close to them not to other swarms twenty or thirty yards away rosies frown deepened the whole group was frowning now looking at each other uneasily david brooks coughed then what did we see jack you saw an illusion i said firmly you saw three swarms acting independently and you thought they were coordinated but theyre not and im pretty certain that other things you believe about these swarms arent true either there was a lot i didnt understand about the swarmsand a lot i didnt believe i didnt believe for example that the swarms were reproducing i thought ricky and the others must be pretty unnerved even to imagine it after all the fifty pounds of material theyd exhausted into the environment could easily account for the three swarms i had seenand dozens more besides i was guessing that each swarm consisted of three pounds of nanoparticles that was roughly the weight of a large bee swarm as for the fact that these swarms showed purposeful behavior that was not in the least troubling it was the intended result of lowlevel programming and i didnt believe the swarms were coordinated it simply wasnt possible because the fields were too weak nor did i believe the swarms had the adaptive powers that ricky attributed to them id seen too many demos of robots carrying out some tasklike cooperating to push a box around the roomwhich was interpreted by observers as intelligent behavior when in fact the robots were stupid minimally programmed and cooperating by accident a lot of behavior looked smarter than it was as charley davenport used to say ricky should thank god for that and finally i didnt really believe that the swarms were dangerous i didnt think that a threepound cloud of nanoparticles could represent much of a threat to anything not even a rabbit i wasnt at all sure it had been killed i seemed to recall that rabbits were nervous creatures prone to die of fright or the pursuing particles might have swarmed in through the nose and mouth blocking the respiratory passages and choking the animal to death if so the death was accidental not purposeful accidental death made more sense to me in short i thought that ricky and the others had consistently misinterpreted what they saw theyd spooked themselves on the other hand i had to admit that several unanswered questions nagged at me the first and most obvious was why the swarm had escaped their control the original camera swarm was designed to be controlled by an rf transmitter beaming toward it now apparently the swarm ignored transmitted radio commands and i didnt understand why i suspected an error in manufacturing the particles had probably been made incorrectly second was the question of the swarms longevity the individual particles were extremely small subject to damage from cosmic rays photochemical decay dehydration of their protein chains and other environmental factors in the harsh desert all the swarms should have shriveled up and died of old age many days ago but they hadnt why not third there was the problem of the swarms apparent goal according to ricky the swarms kept coming back to the main building ricky believed they were trying to get inside but that didnt seem to be a reasonable agent goal and i wanted to look at the program code to see what was causing it frankly i suspected a bug in the code and finally i wanted to know why they had pursued the rabbit because predprey didnt program units to become literal predators it merely used a predator model to keep the agents focused and goaloriented somehow that had changed and the swarms now appeared to be actually hunting that too was probably a bug in the code to my mind all these uncertainties came down to a single central questionhow had the rabbit died i didnt think it had been killed i suspected the rabbits death was accidental not purposeful but we needed to find out i adjusted my portable radio headset with the sunglasses and the video camera mounted by the left eye i picked up the plastic bag for the rabbits body and turned to the others anybody coming with me there was an uncomfortable silence ricky said whats the bag for to bring the rabbit back in no fucking way ricky said you want to go out there thats your business but youre not bringing that rabbit back here youve got to be kidding i said im not we run a levelsix clean environment here jack that rabbits filthy cant come in all right then we can store it in maes lab and no way jack sorry its not coming through the first airlock i looked at the others they were all nodding their heads in agreement all right then ill examine it out there youre really going to go out why not i looked at them one after another i have to tell you guys i think youve all got your knickers in a twist the clouds not dangerous and yes im going out i turned to mae do you have a dissection kit of some kind that ill come with you she said quietly okay thanks i was surprised that mae was the first to come around to my way of seeing things but as a field biologist she was probably better than the others at assessing realworld risk in any case her decision seemed to break some tension in the room the others visibly relaxed mae went off to get the dissecting tools and some lab equipment that was when the phone rang vince answered it and turned to me you know somebody named dr ellen forman yes it was my sister shes on the line vince handed me the phone and stepped back i felt suddenly nervous i glanced at my watch it was eleven oclock in the morning time for amandas morning nap she should be asleep in her crib by now then i remembered i had promised my sister i would call her at eleven to check in to see how things were going i said hello ellen is everything all right sure fine a long long sigh its fine i dont know how you do it is all tired about as tired as ive ever felt kids get off to school okay another sigh yes in the car eric hit nicole on the back and she punched him on the ear youve got to interrupt them if they start that ellen so im learning she said wearily and the baby hows her rash better im using the ointment her movements okay sure shes well coordinated for her age is there a problem i should know about no no i said i turned away from the group lowered my voice i meant is she pooping okay behind me i heard charley davenport snicker copiously ellen said shes sleeping now i took her to the park for a while she was ready to go down everythings okay at the house except the pilot for the water heater went out but the guys coming to fix it good good listen ellen im in the middle of something here jack julia called from the hospital a few minutes ago she was looking for you uhhuh when i said youd gone to nevada she got pretty upset is that right she said you didnt understand and you were going to make it worse something like that i think you better call her she sounded agitated okay ill call how are things going out there you be back tonight not tonight i said sometime tomorrow morning ellen i have to go now call the kids at dinnertime if you can theyd like to hear from you auntie ellen is fine but shes not dad you know what i mean okay youll eat at six about i told her id try to call and i hung up mae and i were standing by the double glass walls of the outer airlock just inside the building entrance beyond the glass i could see the solidsteel fire door that led outside ricky was standing beside us gloomy and nervous watching as we made our final preparations you sure this is necessary to go outside its essential why dont you and mae wait until nightfall and go out then because the rabbit wont be there i said by nightfall coyotes or hawks will have come and taken the carcass away i dont know about that ricky said we havent seen any coyotes around here for a while oh hell i said impatiently turning on my radio headset in the time weve spent arguing about this we could have been out and back already see you ricky i went through the glass door and stood in the airlock the door hissed shut behind me the air handlers whooshed briefly in the nowfamiliar pattern and then the far glass slid open i walked toward the steel fire door looking back i saw mae stepping into the airlock i opened the fire door a crack harsh glaring sunlight laid a burning strip on the floor i felt hot air on my face over the intercom ricky said good luck guys i took a breath pushed the door wider and stepped out into the desert the wind had dropped and the midmorning heat was stifling somewhere a bird chittered otherwise it was silent standing by the door i squinted in the glare of the sunlight a shiver ran down my back i took another deep breath i was certain that the swarms were not dangerous but now that i was outside my theoretical inferences seemed to lose force i must have caught rickys tension because i was feeling distinctly uneasy now that i was outside the rabbit carcass looked much farther away than i had imagined it was perhaps fifty yards from the door half the length of a football field the surrounding desert seemed barren and exposed i scanned the shimmering horizon looking for black shapes i saw none the fire door opened behind me and mae said ready when you are jack then lets do it we set off toward the rabbit feet crunching on the desert sand we moved away from the building almost immediately my heart began to pound and i started to sweat i forced myself to breathe deeply and slowly working to stay calm the sun was hot on my face i knew i had let ricky spook me but i couldnt seem to help it i kept glancing toward the horizon mae was a couple of steps behind me i said howre you doing ill be glad when its over we were moving through a field of kneehigh yellow cholla cactus their spines caught the sun here and there a large barrel cactus stuck up from the floor like a bristling green thumb some small silent birds hopped on the ground beneath the cholla as we approached they took to the air wheeling specks against the blue they landed a hundred yards away at last we came to the rabbit surrounded by a buzzing black cloud startled i hesitated a step its just flies mae said she moved forward and crouched down beside the carcass ignoring the flies she pulled on a pair of rubber gloves and handed me a pair to put on she placed a square sheet of plastic on the ground securing it with a rock at each corner she lifted the rabbit and set it down in the center of the plastic she unzipped a little dissection kit and laid it open i saw steel instruments glinting in sunlight forceps scalpel several kinds of scissors she also laid out a syringe and several rubbertopped test tubes in a row her movements were quick practiced she had done this before i crouched down beside her the carcass had no odor externally i could see no sign of what had caused the death the staring eye looked pink and healthy mae said bobby are you recording me over the headset i heard bobby lembeck say move your camera down mae touched the camera mounted on her sunglasses little more little more good thats enough okay mae said she turned the rabbits body over in her hands inspecting it from all sides she dictated swiftly on external examination the animal appears entirely normal there is no sign of congenital anomaly or disease the fur is thick and healthy in appearance the nasal passages appear partially or entirely blocked i note some fecal material excreted at the anus but presume that is normal evacuation at the time of death she flipped the animal onto its back and held the forepaws apart with her hands i need you jack she wanted me to hold the paws for her the carcass was still warm and had not begun to stiffen she took the scalpel and swiftly cut down the exposed midsection a red gash opened blood flowed i saw bones of the rib cage and pinkish coils of intestine mae spoke continuously as she cut noting the tissue color and texture she said to me hold here and i moved my one hand down to hold aside the slick intestine with a single stroke of the scalpel she sliced opened the stomach muddy green liquid spilled out and some pulpy material that seemed to be undigested fiber the inner wall of the stomach appeared roughened but mae said that was normal she ran her finger expertly around the stomach wall then paused umm look there she said what there she pointed in several places the stomach was reddish bleeding slightly as if it had been rubbed raw i saw black patches in the midst of the bleeding thats not normal mae said thats pathology she took a magnifying glass and peered closer then dictated i observe dark areas approximately four to eight millimeters in diameter which i presume to be clusters of nanoparticles present in the stomach lining she said these clusters are found in association with mild bleeding of the villous wall there are nanoparticles in the stomach i said how did they get there did the rabbit eat them swallow them involuntarily i doubt it i would assume they entered actively i frowned you mean they crawled down the esophagus yes at least i think so why would they do that i dont know she never paused in her swift dissection she took scissors and cut upward through the breastbone then pushed the rib cage open with her fingers hold here i moved my hands to hold the ribs open as she had done the edges of bone were sharp with my other hand i held the hind legs open mae worked between my hands the lungs are bright pink and firm normal appearance she cut one lobe with the scalpel then again and again finally she exposed the bronchial tube and cut it open it was dark black on the inside bronchi show heavy infestation with nanoparticles consistent with inhalation of swarm elements she said dictating you getting this bobby getting it all video resolution is good she continued to cut upward following the bronchial tree toward the throat and she continued cutting into the throat and then from the nose back across the cheek then opening the mouth i had to turn away for a moment but she continued calmly to dictate i am observing heavy infiltration of all the nasal passages and pharynx this is suggestive of partial or full airway obstruction which in turn may indicate the cause of death i looked back what the rabbits head was hardly recognizable any longer she had cut the jaw free and was now peering down the throat have a look for yourself she said there seems to be dense particles closing the pharynx and a response that looks something like an allergic reaction or then ricky say are you guys going to stay out much longer as long as it takes i said i turned to mae what kind of allergic reaction well she said you see this area of tissue and how swollen it is and you see how its turned gray which is suggestive you realize ricky said that youve been out there four minutes already were only out here because we cant bring the rabbit back i said thats right you cant mae was shaking her head as she listened to this ricky youre not helping here bobby said dont shake your head mae youre moving the camera back and forth sorry but i saw her raise her head as if she was looking toward the horizon and while she did so she uncorked a test tube and slipped a slice of stomach lining into the glass she put it in her pocket then looked back down no one watching the video would have seen what she did she said all right well take blood samples now bloods all youre bringing in here guys ricky said yes ricky we know mae reached for the syringe stuck the needle into an artery drew a blood sample expelled it into a plastic tube popped the needle off onehanded put on another and drew a second sample from a vein her pace never slowed i said i have the feeling youve done this before this is nothing in sichuan we were always working in heavy snowstorms you cant see what youre doing your hands are freezing the animals frozen solid cant get a needle in she set the tubes of blood aside now we will just take a few cultures and were done she flipped over her case looked oh bad luck whats that i said the culture swabs arent here but you had them inside yes im sure of it i said ricky you see the swabs anywhere yes theyre right here by the airlock you want to bring them out to us oh sure guys he laughed harshly no way im going out there in daylight you want em you come get em mae said to me you want to go no i said i was already holding the animal open my hands were in position ill wait here you go okay she got to her feet try and keep the flies off we dont want any more contamination than necessary ill be back in a moment she moved off at a light jog toward the door i heard her footsteps fade then the clang of the metal door shutting behind her then silence attracted by the slitopen carcass the flies came back in force buzzing around my head trying to land on the exposed guts i released the rabbits hind legs and swatted the flies away with one hand i kept myself busy with the flies so i wouldnt think about the fact that i was alone out here i kept glancing off in the distance but i never saw anything i kept brushing away the flies and occasionally my hand touched against the rabbits fur and that was when i noticed that beneath the fur the skin was bright red bright redexactly like a bad sunburn just seeing it made me shiver i spoke into my headset bobby crackle yes jack can you see the rabbit yes jack you see the redness of the skin are you picking that up uh just a minute i heard a soft whirr by my temple bobby was controlling the camera remotely zooming in the whirring stopped i said can you see this through my camera there was no answer bobby i heard murmurs whispers or maybe it was static bobby are you there silence i heard breathing uh jack now it was the voice of david brooks you better go in mae hasnt come back yet where is she maes inside well i have to wait shes going to do cultures no come in now jack i let go of the rabbit and got to my feet i looked around scanned the horizon i dont see anything theyre on the other side of the building jack his voice was calm but i felt a chill they are come inside now jack i bent over picked up maes samples her dissection kit lying beside the rabbit carcass the black leather of the kit was hot from the sun jack just a minute jack stop fucking around i started toward the steel door my feet crunching on the desert floor i didnt see anything at all but i heard something it was a peculiar low thrumming sound at first i thought i was hearing machinery but the sound rose and fell pulsing like a heartbeat other beats were superimposed along with some kind of hissing creating a strange unworldly qualitylike nothing id ever heard when i look back on it now i think that more than anything else it was the sound that made me afraid i walked faster i said where are they coming where jack you better run what run i still couldnt see anything but the sound was building in intensity i broke into a jog the frequency of the sound was so low i felt it as a vibration in my body but i could hear it too the thumping irregular pulse run jack i thought fuck it and i ran swirling and glinting silver the first swarm came around the corner of the building the hissing vibration was coming from the cloud sliding along the side of the building it moved toward me it would reach the door long before i could i looked back to see a second swarm as it came around the far end of the building it too moved toward me the headset crackled i heard david brooks jack you cant make it i see that i said the first swarm had already reached the door and was standing in front of it blocking my way i stopped uncertain what to do i saw a stick on the ground in front of me a big one four feet long i picked it up swung it in my hand the swarm pulsed but did not move from the door the second swarm was still coming toward me it was time for a diversion i was familiar with the predprey code i knew the swarms were programmed to pursue moving targets if they seemed to be fleeing from them what would make a good target i cocked my arm and threw the black dissection kit high into the air in the general direction of the second swarm the kit landed on edge and tumbled across the ground for a moment immediately the second swarm began to go after it at the same moment the first swarm moved away from the door also pursuing the kit it was just like a dog chasing a ball i felt a moment of elation as i watched it go it was after all just a programmed swarm i thought this is childs play i hurried toward the door that was a mistake because apparently my hasty movement triggered the swarm which immediately stopped and swirled backward to the door again blocking my path there it remained pulsing streaks of silver like a blade glinting in the sun blocking my path it took me a moment to realize the significance of that my movement hadnt triggered the swarm to pursue me the swarm hadnt chased me at all instead it had moved to block my way it was anticipating my movement that wasnt in the code the swarm was inventing new behavior appropriate to the situation instead of pursuing me it had fallen back and trapped me it had gone beyond its programmingway beyond i couldnt see how that had happened i thought it must be some kind of random reinforcement because the individual particles had very little memory the intelligence of the swarm was necessarily limited it shouldnt be that difficult to outsmart it i tried to feint to the left then the right the cloud went with me but only for a moment then it dropped back to the door again as if it knew that my goal was the door and by staying there it would succeed that was far too clever there had to be additional programming they hadnt told me about i said into the headset what the hell have you guys done with these things david its not going to let you get past jack just hearing him say that irritated me you think so well see because my next step was obvious close to the ground like this the swarm was structurally vulnerable it was a cluster of particles no larger than specks of dust if i disrupted the clusterif i broke up its structurethen the particles would have to reorganize themselves just as a scattered flock of birds would reform in the air that would take at least a few seconds and in that time i would be able to get through the door but how to disrupt it i swung the stick in my hand hearing it whoosh through the air but it was clearly unsatisfactory i needed something with a much bigger flat surface like a paddle or a palm frondsomething to create a large disrupting wind my mind was racing i needed something something behind me the second cloud was closing in it moved toward me in an erratic zigzag pattern to cut off any attempt i might make to run past it i watched with a kind of horrified fascination i knew that this too had never been coded in the program this was selforganized emergent behaviorand its purpose was only too clear it was stalking me the pulsing sound grew louder as the swarm came closer and closer i had to disrupt it turning in a circle i looked at the ground all around me i saw nothing i could use the nearest juniper tree was too far away the cholla cactuses were flimsy i thought of course theres nothing out here its the fucking desert i scanned the exterior of the building hoping someone had left out an implement like a rake nothing nothing at all i was out here with nothing but the shirt on my back and there was nobody that could help me toof course the headset crackled jack listen but i didnt hear any more after that as i pulled my shirt over my head the headset came away falling to the ground and then holding the shirt in my hand i swung it in broad whooshing arcs through the air and screaming like a banshee i charged the swarm by the door the swarm vibrated with a deep thrumming sound it flattened slightly as i ran toward it and then i was in the midst of the particles and plunged into an odd semidarkness like being in a dust storm i couldnt see anythingi couldnt see the doori groped blindly for the doorknoband my eyes stung from the particles but i kept swinging my shirt in broad whooshing arcs and in a moment the darkness began to fade i was dispersing the cloud sending particles spinning off in all directions my vision was clearing and my breathing was still okay though my throat felt dry and painful i began to feel thousands of tiny pinpricks all over my body but they hardly hurt now i could see the door in front of me the doorknob was just to my left i kept swinging my shirt and suddenly the cloud seemed to clear entirely away almost as if it was moving out of range of my disruption in that instant i slipped through the door and slammed it shut behind me i blinked in sudden darkness i could hardly see i thought my eyes would adjust from the glare of sunlight and i waited a moment but my vision did not improve instead it seemed to be getting worse i could just make out the glass doors of the airlock directly ahead i still felt the stinging pinpricks all over my skin my throat was dry and my breathing was raspy i coughed my vision was dimming i started to feel dizzy on the other side of the airlock ricky and mae stood watching me i heard ricky shout come on jack hurry my eyes burned painfully my dizziness grew rapidly worse i leaned against the wall to keep from falling over my throat felt thick i was having difficulty breathing gasping i waited for the glass doors to open but they remained closed i stared stupidly at the airlock you have to stand in front of the doors stand i felt like the world was in slow motion all my strength was gone my body felt weak and shaky the stinging was worse the room was getting darker i didnt think i could stand up on my own stand jack somehow i shoved away from the wall and lurched toward the airlock with a hiss the glass doors slid open go jack now i saw spots before my eyes i was dizzy and sick to my stomach i stumbled into the airlock banging against the glass as i stepped inside with every second that passed it was harder to breathe i knew i was suffocating outside the building i heard the low thrumming sound start up again i turned slowly to look back the glass doors hissed shut i looked down at my body but could barely see it my skin appeared black i was covered in dust my body ached my shirt was black with dust too the spray stung me and i closed my eyes then the air handlers started up whooshing loudly i saw the dust sucked off my shirt my vision was clearer but i still couldnt breathe the shirt slipped from my hand flattening against the grate at my feet i bent to reach down for it my body began to shake tremble i heard only the roar of the handlers i felt a wave of nausea my knees buckled i sagged against the wall i looked at mae and ricky through the second glass doors they seemed far away as i watched they receded even farther moving away into the distance soon they were too far away for me to worry any longer i knew i was dying as i closed my eyes i fell to the ground and the roar of the air handlers faded into cold and total silence day am dont move something icycold coursed through my veins i shuddered jack dont move just for a second okay something cold a cold liquid running up my arm i opened my eyes the light was directly overhead glaring greenishbright i winced my whole body ached i felt like id been beaten i was lying on my back on the black counter of maes biology lab squinting in the glare i saw mae standing beside me bent over my left arm she had an intravenous line in my elbow whats going on jack please dont move ive only done this on lab animals thats reassuring i lifted my head to see what she was doing my temples throbbed i groaned and lay back mae said feel bad terrible ill bet i had to inject you three times with what you were in anaphylactic shock jack you had a severe allergic reaction your throat almost closed up allergic reaction i said thats what it was severe one it was from the swarm she hesitated for a moment then of course would nanosized particles cause an allergic reaction like that they certainly could i said but you dont think so no i dont i think the nanoparticles are antigenically inert i think you reacted to a coliform toxin a coliform toxin my throbbing headache came in waves i took a breath let it out slowly i tried to figure out what she was saying my mind was slow my head hurt a coliform toxin right a toxin from e coli bacteria is that what you mean right proteolytic toxin probably and where would a toxin like that come from from the swarm she said that made no sense at all according to ricky the e coli bacteria were only used to manufacture precursor molecules but bacteria wouldnt be present in the swarm itself i said i dont know jack i think they could be why was she so diffident i wondered it wasnt like her ordinarily mae was precise sharp well i said somebody knows the swarms been designed bacterias either been designed in or not i heard her sigh as if i just wasnt getting it but what wasnt i getting i said did you salvage the particles that were blown off in the airlock did you keep the stuff from the airlock no all the airlock particles were incinerated was that a smart its built into the system jack as a safety feature we cant override it okay now it was my turn to sigh so we didnt have any examples of swarm agents to study i started to sit up but she put a gentle hand on my chest restraining me take it slowly jack she was right because sitting up made my headache much worse i swung my feet over the side of the table how long was i out twelve minutes i feel like i was beaten up my ribs ached with every breath you had a lot of trouble breathing i still do i reached for a kleenex and blew my nose a lot of black stuff came out mixed with blood and dust from the desert i had to blow my nose four or five times to clear it i crumpled the kleenex and started to throw it away mae held out her hand ill take that no its okay give it to me jack she took the kleenex and slipped it into a little plastic bag and sealed it that was when i realized how stupidly my mind was working of course that kleenex would contain exactly the particles i wanted to study i closed my eyes breathed deeply and waited for the throbbing in my head to ease up a little when i opened my eyes again the glare in the room was less bright it almost looked normal by the way mae said julia just called she said you cant call her back something about some tests but she wanted to talk to you uhhuh i watched mae take the kleenex bag and put it inside a sealed jar she screwed down the lid tightly mae i said if theres e coli in the swarm we can find out by looking at that right now shouldnt we do that i cant right now i will as soon as i can im having a little trouble with one of the fermentation units and i need the microscopes for that what kind of trouble im not sure yet but yields are falling in one tank she shook her head its probably nothing serious these things happen all the time this whole manufacturing process is incredibly delicate jack keeping it going is like juggling a hundred balls at once i have my hands full i nodded but i was starting to think that the real reason she wasnt looking at the kleenex was that she already knew the swarm contained bacteria she just didnt think it was her place to tell me that and if thats what was going on then she never would tell me mae i said somebody has to tell me whats going on here not ricky i want somebody to really tell me good she said i think thats a very good idea that was how i found myself sitting in front of a computer workstation in one of those small rooms the project engineer david brooks sat beside me as he talked david continuously straightened his clotheshe smoothed his tie shot his cuffs snugged his collar pulled up the creases in his trousers from his thighs then hed cross one ankle over his knee pull up his sock cross the other ankle run his hands over his shoulders brushing away imaginary dust and then start over again it was all unconscious of course and with my headache i might have found it irritating but i didnt focus on it because with every piece of new information david gave me my headache got worse and worse unlike ricky david had a very organized mind and he told me everything starting from the beginning xymos had contracted to make a microrobotic swarm that would function as an aerial camera the particles were successfully manufactured and worked indoors but when they were tested outside they lacked mobility in wind the test swarm was blown away in a strong breeze that was six weeks ago you tested more swarms after that i said yes many over the next four weeks or so none worked right none worked so those original swarms are all goneblown away by the wind yes which means the runaway swarms that we see now have nothing to do with your original test swarms correct they are a result of contamination david blinked rapidly what do you mean contamination the twentyfive kilos of material that was blown by the exhaust fan into the environment because of a missing filter who said it was twentyfive kilos ricky did oh no jack david said we vented stuff for days we must have vented five or six hundred kilos of contaminantsbacteria molecules assemblers so ricky had been understating the situation again but i didnt understand why he bothered to lie about this after all it was just a mistake and as ricky had said it was the contractors mistake okay i said and you saw the first of these desert swarms when two weeks ago david said nodding and smoothing his tie he explained that at first the swarm was so disorganized that when it first appeared they thought it was a cloud of desert insects gnats or something it showed up for a while going here and there around the laboratory building and then it was gone it seemed like a random event a swarm appeared again a couple of days later he said and by then it was much better organized it displayed distinctive swarming behavior that sort of swirling in the cloud that youve seen so it was clear that it was our stuff and what happened then the swarm swirled around the desert near the installation like before it came and went for the next few days we tried to gain control of it by radio but we never could and eventuallyabout a week after thatwe found that none of the cars would start he paused i went out there to have a look and i found that all the onboard computers were dead these days all automobiles have microprocessors built into them they control everything from fuel injection to radios and door locks but now the computers were not functioning yeah actually the processor chips themselves were fine but the memory chips had eroded theyd literally turned to dust i thought oh shit i said could you figure out why sure it wasnt any big mystery jack the erosion had the characteristic signature of gamma assemblers you know about that no well we have nine different assemblers involved in manufacturing each assembler has a different function the gamma assemblers break down carbon material in silicate layers they actually cut at the nano levelslicing out chunks of carbon substrate so these assemblers cut the memory chips in the cars right right but david hesitated he was acting as if i were missing the point he tugged at his cuffs fingered his collar the thing you have to keep in mind jack is that these assemblers can work at room temperature if anything the desert heats even better for them hotter is more efficient for a moment i didnt understand what he was talking about what difference did it make about room temperature or desert heat what did that have to do with memory chips in cars and then suddenly finally the penny dropped holy shit i said he nodded yeah david was saying that a mixture of components had been vented into the desert and that these componentswhich were designed to selfassemble in the fabrication structurewould also selfassemble in the outside world assembly could be carried out autonomously in the desert and obviously thats exactly what was happening i ticked the points off to make sure i had it right basic assembly begins with the bacteria theyve been engineered to eat anything even garbage so they can find something in the desert to live off of right which means the bacteria multiply and begin churning out molecules that selfcombine forming larger molecules pretty soon you have assemblers and the assemblers begin to do the final work and turn out new microagents right right which means that the swarms are reproducing yes they are and the individual agents have memory yes a small amount and they dont need much thats the whole point of distributed intelligence its collective so they have intelligence and since they have memory they can learn from experience yes and the predprey program means they can solve problems and the program generates enough random elements to let them innovate right yes my head throbbed i was seeing all the implications now and they werent good so i said what youre telling me is this swarm reproduces is selfsustaining learns from experience has collective intelligence and can innovate to solve problems yes which means for all practical purposes its alive yes david nodded at least it behaves as if it is alive functionally its alive jack i said this is very fucking bad news brooks said tell me id like to know i said why this thing wasnt destroyed a long time ago david said nothing he just smoothed his tie and looked uncomfortable because you realize i said that youre talking about a mechanical plague thats what youve got here its just like a bacterial plague or a viral plague except its mechanical organisms youve got a fucking manmade plague he nodded yes thats evolving yes and its not limited by biological rates of evolution its probably evolving much faster he nodded it is evolving faster how much faster david brooks sighed pretty damn fast itll be different this afternoon when it comes back will it come back it always does and why does it come back i said its trying to get inside and why is that david shifted uncomfortably we have only theories jack try me one possibility is that its a territorial thing as you know the original predprey code includes a concept of a range of a territory in which the predators will roam and within that core range it defines a sort of home base which the swarm may consider to be the inside of this facility i said you believe that not really no he hesitated actually he said most of us think that it comes back looking for your wife jack its looking for julia day am that was how with a splitting headache i found myself on the phone to the hospital in san jose julia forman please i spelled the name for the operator shes in the icu the operator said yes thats right im sorry but direct calls are not allowed then the nursing station thank you please hold i waited no one was answering the phone i called back went through the operator again and finally got through to the icu nursing station the nurse told me julia was in xray and didnt know when she would be back i said julia was supposed to be back by now the nurse said rather testily that she was looking at julias bed right now and she could assure me julia wasnt in it i said id call back i shut the phone and turned to david what was julia doing in all this helping us jack im sure but how exactly in the beginning she was trying to coax it back he said we needed the swarm close to the building to take control again by radio so julia helped us keep it close how well she entertained it she what i guess youd call it that it was very quickly obvious that the swarm had rudimentary intelligence it was julias idea to treat it like a child she went outside with bright blocks toys things a kid would like and the swarm seemed to be responding to her she was very excited about it the swarm was safe to be around at that time yes completely safe it was just a particle cloud david shrugged anyway after the first day or so she decided to go a step further and formally test it you know test it like a child psychologist you mean teach it i said no her idea was to test it david i said that swarms a distributed intelligence its a goddamn net itll learn from whatever you do testing is teaching what exactly was she doing with it just you know sort of games shed lay out three colored blocks on the ground two blue and one yellow see if it would choose the yellow then with squares and triangles stuff like that but david i said you all knew this was a runaway evolving outside the laboratory didnt anybody think to just go out and destroy it sure we all wanted to julia wouldnt allow it why she wanted it kept alive and nobody argued with her shes a vice president of the company jack she kept saying the swarm was a lucky accident that we had stumbled onto something really big that it could eventually save the company and we mustnt destroy it she was i dont know she was really taken with it i mean she was proud of it like it was her invention all she wanted to do was rein it in her words yeah well how long ago did she say that yesterday jack david shrugged you know she only left here yesterday afternoon it took me a moment to realize that he was right just a single day had passed since julia had been here and then had had her accident and in that time the swarms had already advanced enormously how many swarms were there yesterday three but we only saw two i guess one was hiding he shook his head you know one of the swarms had become like a pet to her it was smaller than the others itd wait for her to come outside and it always stuck close to her sometimes when she came out it swirled around her like it was excited to see her shed talk to it too like it was a dog or something i pressed my throbbing temples she talked to it i repeated jesus christ dont tell me the swarms have auditory sensors too no they dont so talking was a waste of time uh well we think the cloud was close enough that her breath deflected some of the particles in a rhythmic pattern so the whole cloud was one giant eardrum in a way yeah and its a net so it learned yeah i sighed are you going to tell me it talked back no but it started making weird sounds i nodded id heard those weird sounds how does it do that were not sure bobby thinks its the reverse of the auditory deflection that allows it to hear the particles pulse in a coordinated front and generate a sound wave sort of like an audio speaker it would have to be something like that i thought even though it seemed unlikely that it could do it the swarm was basically a dust cloud of miniature particles the particles didnt have either the mass or the energy to generate a sound wave a thought occurred to me david i said was julia out there yesterday with the swarms yes in the morning no problem it was a few hours later after she left that they killed the snake and was anything killed before that uh possibly a coyote a few days ago im not sure so maybe the snake wasnt the first maybe and today they killed a rabbit yeah so its progressing fast now thank you julia i said i was pretty sure the accelerated behavior of the swarms that we were seeing was a function of past learning this was a characteristic of distributed systemsand for that matter a characteristic of evolution which could be considered a kind of learning if you wanted to think of it in those terms in either case it meant that systems experienced a long slow starting period followed by everincreasing speed you could see that exact speedup in the evolution of life on earth the first life shows up four billion years ago as singlecell creatures nothing changes for the next two billion years then nuclei appear in the cells things start to pick up only a few hundred million years later multicellular organisms a few hundred million years after that explosive diversity of life and more diversity by a couple of hundred million years ago there are large plants and animals complex creatures dinosaurs in all this mans a latecomer four million years ago upright apes two million years ago early human ancestors thirtyfive thousand years ago cave paintings the acceleration was dramatic if you compressed the history of life on earth into twentyfour hours then multicellular organisms appeared in the last twelve hours dinosaurs in the last hour the earliest men in the last forty seconds and modern men less than one second ago it had taken two billion years for primitive cells to incorporate a nucleus the first step toward complexity but it had taken only million yearsonetenth of the timeto evolve multicellular animals and it took only four million years to go from smallbrained apes with crude bone tools to modern man and genetic engineering that was how fast the pace had increased this same pattern showed up in the behavior of agentbased systems it took a long time for agents to lay the groundwork and to accomplish the early stuff but once that was completed subsequent progress could be swift there was no way to skip the groundwork just as there was no way for a human being to skip childhood you had to do the preliminary work but at the same time there was no way to avoid the subsequent acceleration it was so to speak built into the system teaching made the progression more efficient and i was sure julias teaching had been an important factor in the behavior of the swarm now simply by interacting with it she had introduced a selection pressure in an organism with emergent behavior that couldnt be predicted it was a very foolish thing to do so the swarmalready developing rapidlywould develop even more rapidly in the future and since it was a manmade organism evolution was not taking place on a biological timescale instead it was happening in a matter of hours destroying the swarms would be more difficult with each passing hour okay i said to david if the swarms are coming back then we better get ready for them i got to my feet wincing at the headache and headed for the door what do you have in mind david said what do you think i have in mind i said weve got to kill these things cold stone dead we have to wipe them off the face of the planet and we have to do it right now david shifted in his chair fine with me he said but i dont think rickys going to like it why not david shrugged hes just not i waited and said nothing david fidgeted in his chair more and more uncomfortable the thing is he and julia are uh in agreement on this theyre in agreement yes they see eye to eye i mean on this i said what are you trying to say to me david nothing just what i said they agree the swarms should be kept alive i think rickys going to oppose you thats all i needed to talk to mae again i found her in the biology lab hunched over a computer monitor looking at images of white bacterial growth on dark red media i said mae listen ive talked to david and i need touh mae have you got a problem she was looking fixedly at the screen i think i do she said a problem with the feedstock what kind of problem the latest thetad stocks arent growing properly she pointed to an image in the upper corner of the monitor which showed bacteria growing in smooth white circles thats normal coliform growth she said thats how its supposed to look but here she brought up another image in the center of the screen the round forms appeared motheaten ragged and misshapen thats not normal growth she said shaking her head im afraid its phage contamination you mean a virus i said a phage was a virus that attacked bacteria yes she said coli are susceptible to a very large number of phages t phage is of course the most common but thetad was engineered to be tresistant so i suspect its a new phage thats doing this a new phage you mean its newly evolved yes probably a mutant of an existing strain that somehow gets around the engineered resistance but its bad news for manufacturing if we have infected bacterial stocks well have to shut down production otherwise well just be spewing viruses out frankly i said shutting down production might be a good idea ill probably have to ill try to isolate it but it looks aggressive i may not be able to get rid of it without scrubbing the kettle starting over with fresh stock rickys not going to like it have you told him about this not yet she shook her head i dont think he needs more bad news right now and besides she stopped as if she had thought better of what she was going to say besides what ricky has a huge stake in the success of this company she turned to face me bobby heard him on the phone the other day talking about his stock options and sounding worried i think ricky sees xymos as his last big chance to score hes been here five years if this doesnt work out hell be too senior to start over at a new company hes got a wife and baby he cant gamble another five years waiting to see if the next company clicks so hes really trying to make this happen really driving himself hes up all night working figuring he isnt sleeping more than three or four hours frankly i worry its affecting his judgment i can imagine i said the pressure must be terrible hes so sleepdeprived it makes him erratic mae said im never sure what hell do or how hell respond sometimes i get the feeling he doesnt want to get rid of the swarms at all or maybe hes scared maybe i said anyway hes erratic so if i were you id be careful she said when you go after the swarms because thats what youre going to do isnt it go after them yes i said thats what im going to do day pm they had all gathered in the lounge with the video games and pinball machines nobody was playing them now they were watching me with anxious eyes as i explained what we had to do the plan was simple enoughthe swarm itself was dictating what we had to do although i was skipping that uncomfortable truth basically i told them we had a runaway swarm we couldnt control and the swarm exhibited selforganizing behavior whenever you have a high so component it means the swarm can reassemble itself after an injury or disruption just as it did with me so this swarm has to be totally physically destroyed that means subjecting the particles to heat cold acid or high magnetic fields and from what ive seen of its behavior id say our best chance to destroy it is at night when the swarm loses energy and sinks to the ground ricky whined but we already told you jack we cant find it at night thats right you cant i said because you didnt tag it look its a big desert out there if you want to trace it back to its hiding place youve got to tag it with something so strong you can follow its trail wherever it goes tag it with what thats my next question i said what kind of tagging agents have we got around here i was greeted with blank looks come on guys this is an industrial facility you must have something that will coat the particles and leave a trail we can follow im talking about a substance that fluoresces intensely or a pheromone with a characteristic chemical signature or something radioactive no more blank looks shaking their heads well mae said of course we have radioisotopes all right fine now we were getting somewhere we use them to check for leaks in the system the helicopter brings them out once a week what isotopes do you have selenium and rhenium sometimes xenon as well im not sure what weve got on hand right now what kind of halflives are we talking about certain isotopes lost radioactivity very rapidly in a matter of hours or minutes if so they wouldnt be useful to me halflife averages about a week mae said seleniums eight days rheniums four days xenon is five days five and a quarter okay any of them should do fine for our purposes i said we only need the radioactivity to last for one night after we tag the swarm mae said we usually put the isotopes in fdg its a liquid glucose base you could spray it that should be fine i said where are the isotopes now mae smiled bleakly in the storage unit she said where is that outside next to the parked cars okay i said then lets go out and get them oh for christs sake ricky said throwing up his hands are you out of your mind you nearly died out there this morning jack you cant go back out there isnt any choice i said sure there is wait until nightfall no i said because that means we cant spray them until tomorrow and we cant trace and destroy them until tomorrow night that means we wait thirtysix hours with an organism that is evolving fast we cant risk it risk it jack if you go out now youll never survive youre fucking crazy even to consider it charley davenport had been staring at the monitor now he turned to the group no jacks not crazy he grinned at me and im going with him charley began to hum born to be wild im going too mae said i know where the isotopes are stored i said its not really necessary mae you can tell me no im coming well need to improvise a spray apparatus of some kind david brooks was rolling up his sleeves carefully presumably remotely controlled thats rosies specialty okay ill come too rosie castro said looking at david youre all going ricky stared from one to another of us shaking his head this is extremely risky he said extremely risky nobody said anything we all just stared at him then ricky said charley will you shut the fuck up he turned to me i dont think i can allow this jack i dont think you have a choice i said im in charge here not now i said i felt a burst of annoyance i felt like telling him hed screwed the pooch by allowing a swarm to evolve in the environment but i didnt know how many critical decisions julia had made in the end ricky was obsequious to management trying to please them like a child pleasing a parent he did it charmingly that was how he had moved ahead in life that was also his greatest weakness but now ricky stuck out his chin stubbornly you just cant do it jack he said you guys cant go out there and survive sure we can ricky charley davenport said he pointed to the monitor look for yourself the monitor showed the desert outside the early afternoon sun was shining on scrubby cactus one stunted juniper in the distance dark against the sun for a moment i didnt understand what charley was talking about then i saw the sand blowing low on the ground and i noticed the juniper was bent to one side thats right folks charley davenport said we got a high wind out there high wind no swarmsremember they have to hug the ground he headed toward the passageway leading to the power station times awasting lets do it guys everybody filed out i was the last to leave to my astonishment ricky pulled me aside blocked the door with his body im sorry jack i didnt want to embarrass you in front of the others but i just cant let you do this would you rather have somebody else do it i said he frowned what do you mean you better face facts ricky this is already a disaster and if we cant get it under control right away then we have to call for help help what do you mean i mean call the pentagon call the army we have to call somebody to get these swarms under control jesus jack we cant do that we have no choice but it would destroy the company wed never get funding again that wouldnt bother me one bit i said i was feeling angry about what had happened in the desert a chain of bad decisions errors and fuckups extending over weeks and months it seemed as if everyone at xymos was doing shortterm solutions patchandfix quick and dirty no one was paying attention to the longterm consequences look i said youve got a runaway swarm thats apparently lethal you cant screw around with this anymore but julia julia isnt here but she said i dont care what she said ricky but the company fuck the company ricky i grabbed him by the shoulders shook him once hard dont you get it you wont go outside youre afraid of this thing ricky we have to kill it and if we cant kill it soon we have to call for help no yes ricky well see about that he snarled his body tensed his eyes flared he grabbed my shirt collar i just stood there staring at him i didnt move ricky glared at me for a moment and then released his grip he patted me on the shoulder and smoothed out my collar ah hell jack he said what am i doing and he gave me his selfdeprecating surfer grin im sorry i think the pressure must be getting to me youre right youre absolutely right fuck the company we have to do this we have to destroy those things right away yes i said still staring at him we do he paused he took his hand away from my collar you think im acting weird dont you mary thinks im acting weird too she said so the other day am i acting weird well you can tell me maybe on edge you getting any sleep not much couple of hours maybe you should take a pill i did doesnt seem to help its the damn pressure ive been here a week now this place gets to you i imagine it must yeah well anyway he turned away as if suddenly embarrassed look ill be on the radio he said ill be with you every step of the way im very grateful to you jack youve brought sanity and order here just just be careful out there okay i will ricky stepped aside i went out the door past him going down the hallway to the power station with the air conditioners roaring full blast mae fell into step beside me i said to her you really dont need to go out there mae you could tell me over the radio how to handle the isotopes its not the isotopes im concerned with she said her voice low so it would be buried in the roar its the rabbit i wasnt sure id heard her the what the rabbit i need to examine the rabbit again why you remember that tissue sample i cut from the stomach well i looked at it under the microscope a few minutes ago and im afraid we have big problems jack day pm i was the first one out the door squinting in the desert sunlight even though it was almost three oclock the sun seemed as bright and hot as ever a hot wind ruffled my trousers and shirt i pulled my headset mouthpiece closer to my lips and said bobby you reading i read you jack got an image yes jack charley davenport came out and laughed he said you know ricky you really are a stupid shmuck you know that over my headset i heard ricky say save it you know i dont like compliments just get on with it mae came through the door next she had a backpack slung over one shoulder she said to me for the isotopes are they heavy the containers are then david brooks came out with rosie close behind him she made a face as she stepped onto the sand jesus its hot she said yeah i think youll find deserts tend to be that way charley said no shit charley i wouldnt shit you rosie he belched i was busy scanning the horizon but i saw nothing the cars were parked under a shed about fifty yards away the shed ended in a square white concrete building with narrow windows that was the storage unit we started toward it rosie said is that place airconditioned yes mae said but its still hot its poorly insulated is it airtight i said not really that means no davenport said laughing he spoke into his headset bobby what wind do we have seventeen knots bobby lembeck said good strong wind and how long until the wind dies sunset probably yeah another three hours i said thatll be plenty of time i noticed that david brooks was not saying anything he just trudged toward the building rosie followed close behind him but you never know davenport said we could all be toast any minute now he laughed again in his irritating way ricky said charley why dont you shut the fuck up why dont you come out and make me big boy charley said whats the matter your veins clogged with chicken shit i said lets stay focused charley hey im focused im focused the wind was blowing sand creating a brownish blur just above the ground mae walked beside me she looked across the desert and said abruptly i want to have a look at the rabbit you all go ahead if you want she headed off to the right toward the carcass i went with her and the others turned in a group and followed us it seemed everybody wanted to stay together the wind was still strong charley said why do you want to see it mae i want to check something she was pulling on gloves as she walked the headset crackled ricky said would somebody please tell me what the hell is going on were going to see the rabbit charley said what for mae wants to see it she saw it before guys youre very exposed out there i wouldnt be waltzing around nobodys waltzing around ricky by now i could see the rabbit in the distance partially obscured by the blowing sand in a few moments we were all standing over the carcass the wind had blown the body over on its side mae crouched down turned it on its back laid open the carcass jeez rosie said i was startled to see that the exposed flesh was no longer smooth and pink instead it was roughened everywhere and in a few places looked as if it had been scraped and it was covered by a milky white coating looks like it was dipped in acid charley said yes it does mae said she sounded grim i glanced at my watch all this had occurred in two hours what happened to it mae had taken out her magnifying glass and was bent close to the animal she looked here and there moving the glass quickly then she said its been partially eaten eaten by what bacteria wait a minute charley davenport said you think this is caused by thetad you think the e coli is eating it well know soon enough she said she reached into a pouch and pulled out several glass tubes containing sterile swabs but its only been dead a short time long enough mae said and high temperatures accelerate growth she daubed the animal with one swab after another replacing each in a glass tube then the thetad must be multiplying very aggressively bacteria will do that if you give them a good nutrient source you shift into log phase growth where theyre doubling every two or three minutes i think thats whats happening here i said but if thats true it means the swarm i dont know what it means jack she said quickly she looked at me and gave a slight shake of the head the meaning was clear not now but the others werent put off mae mae mae charley davenport said youre telling us that the swarms killed the rabbit in order to eat it in order to grow more coli and make more nanoswarms i didnt say that charley her voice was calm almost soothing but thats what you think charley continued you think the swarms consume mammalian tissue in order to reproduce yes thats what i think charley mae put her swabs away carefully and got to her feet but ive taken cultures now well run them in luria and agerose and well see what we see i bet if we come back in another hour this white stuff will be gone and well see black forming all over the body new black nanoparticles and eventually therell be enough for a new swarm she nodded yes i think so too and thats why the wildlife around here has disappeared david brooks said yes she brushed a strand of hair back with her hand this has been going on for a while there was a moment of silence we all stood around the rabbit carcass our backs to the blowing wind the carcass was being consumed so quickly i imagined i could almost see it happening right before my eyes in real time we better get rid of those fucking swarms charley said we all turned and set off for the shed nobody spoke there was nothing to say as we walked ahead some of those small birds that hopped around the desert floor under the cholla cactus suddenly took to the air chittering and wheeling before us i said to mae so theres no wildlife but the birds are here seems to be that way the flock wheeled and came back then settled to the ground a hundred yards away maybe theyre too small for the swarms to bother with mae said not enough flesh on their bodies maybe i was thinking there might be another answer but to be sure i would have to check the code i stepped from the sun into the shade of the corrugated shed and moved along the line of cars toward the door of the storage unit the door was plastered with warning symbolsfor nuclear radiation biohazard microwaves high explosives laser radiation charley said you can see why we keep this shit outside as i came to the door vince said jack you have a call ill patch it my cell phone rang it was probably julia i flipped it open hello dad it was eric with that emphatic tone that he got when he was upset i sighed yes eric when are you coming back im not sure son will you be here for dinner im afraid not why whats the problem she is such an asshole eric just tell me what the problem aunt ellen sticks up for her all the time its not fair im kind of busy now eric so just tell me why what are you doing just tell me whats wrong son never mind he said turning sulky if youre not coming home it doesnt matter where are you anyway are you in the desert yes how did you know that i talked to mom aunt ellen made us go to the hospital to see her its not fair i didnt want to go she made me anyway uhhuh how is mom shes checking out of the hospital shes finished all her tests the doctors wanted her to stay eric said but she wants to get out she has a cast on her arm thats all she says everything else is fine dad why do i always have to do what aunt ellen says its not fair let me talk to ellen she isnt here she took nicole to buy a new dress for her play whos with you at the house maria okay i said have you done your homework not yet well get busy son i want your homework done before dinner it was amazing how these lines just popped out of a parents mouth by now i had reached the storage room door i stared at all the warning signs there were several i didnt know like a diamond made up of four different colored squares inside each with a number mae unlocked the door and went in dad eric started to cry when are you coming home i dont know i said i hope by tomorrow okay promise i promise i could hear him sniffling and then through the phone a long snarff sound as he wiped his nose on his shirt i told him he could call me later if he wanted to he seemed better and said okay and then said goodbye i hung up and entered the storage building the interior was divided into two large storage rooms with shelves on all four walls and freestanding shelves in the middle of the rooms concrete walls concrete floor there was another door in the second room and a corrugated rollup door for truck deliveries hot sunlight came in through woodframe windows the airconditioning rumbled noisily but as mae had said the rooms were still hot i closed the door behind me and looked at the seal it was just ordinary weather stripping the shed was definitely not airtight i walked along the shelves stacked with bins of spare parts for the fabrication machinery and the labs the second room had more mundane items cleaning supplies toilet paper bars of soap boxes of cereal and a couple of refrigerators filled with food i turned to mae where are the isotopes over here she led me around a set of shelves to a steel lid set in the concrete floor the lid was about three feet in diameter it looked like a buried garbage can except for the glowing led and keypad in the center mae dropped to one knee and punched in a code quickly the lid lifted with a hiss i saw a ladder that led down into a circular steel chamber the isotopes were stored in metal containers of different sizes apparently mae could tell which they were just by looking because she said we have selenium shall we use that sure mae started to climb down into the chamber will you fucking cut it out in a corner of the room david brooks jumped back from charley davenport charley was holding a big spray bottle of windex cleaner he was testing the squeeze trigger mechanism and in the process spraying streaks of water on david it didnt look accidental give me that damn thing david said snatching the bottle away i think it might work charley said blandly but wed need a remote mechanism from the first room rosie said would this work she held up a shiny cylinder with wires dangling from it isnt this a solenoid relay yes david said but i doubt it can exert enough force to squeeze this bottle has it got a rating we need something bigger and dont forget you also need a remote controller charley said unless you want to stand there and spray the fucker yourself mae came up from below carrying a heavy metal tube she walked to the sink and reached for a bottle of strawcolored liquid she pulled on heavy rubbercoated gloves and started to mix the isotope into the liquid a radiation counter over the sink was chattering over the headset ricky said arent you guys forgetting something even if you have a remote how are you going to get the cloud to come to it because i dont think the swarm will just come over and stand there while you hose it down well find something to attract them i said like what they were attracted to the rabbit we dont have any rabbits charley said you know ricky you are a very negative person im just telling you the facts thank you for sharing charley said like mae charley was seeing it too ricky had dragged his feet every step of the way it was as if ricky wanted to keep the swarms alive which made no sense at all but thats how he was behaving i would have said something to charley about ricky but over our headsets everybody heard everything the downside of modern communications everybody can listen in hey guys it was bobby lembeck hows it coming were getting there why the winds dropping what is it now i said fifteen knots down from eighteen thats still strong i said were okay i know im just telling you from the next room rosie said whats thermite in her hand she held a plastic tray filled with thumbsized metal tubes careful with that david said it must be left over from construction i guess they did thermite welding but what is it thermite is aluminum and iron oxide david said it burns very hotthree thousand degreesand so bright you cant look directly at it and itll melt steel for welding how much of that have we got i said to rosie because we can use it tonight theres four boxes back there she plucked one tube from the box so how do you set em off be careful rosie thats a magnesium wrapper any decent heat source will ignite it even matches if you want to lose your hand better use road flares something with a fuse ill see she said and she disappeared around the corner the radiation counter was still clicking i turned to the sink mae had capped the isotope tube she was now pouring the strawcolored liquid into a windex bottle hey guys it was bobby lembeck again im picking up some instability winds fluctuating at twelve knots okay i said we dont need to hear every little change bobby im seeing some instability is all i think were okay for the moment bobby mae was going to be another few minutes in any case i went over to a computer workstation and turned it on the screen glowed there was a menu of options aloud i said ricky can i put up the swarm code on this monitor the code ricky said he sounded alarmed what do you want the code for i want to see what you guys have done why ricky for christs sake can i see it or not sure of course you can all the code revisions are in the directory slash code its passworded i was typing i found the directory but i wasnt being allowed to enter it and the password is its langton all lowercase okay i entered the password i was now in the directory looking at a list of program modifications each with file size and date the document sizes were large which meant that these were all programs for other aspects of the swarm mechanism because the code for the particles themselves would be smalljust a few lines maybe eight ten kilobytes no more ricky yes jack wheres the particle code isnt it there god damn it ricky stop screwing around hey jack im not responsible for the archiving ricky these are workfiles not archives i said tell me where a brief pause there should be a subdirectory slash cdn its kept there i scrolled down i see it within this directory i found a list of files all very small the modification dates started about six weeks ago there was nothing new from the last two weeks ricky you havent changed the code for two weeks yeah about that i clicked on the most recent document you got highlevel summaries when these guys had worked for me i always insisted that they write natural language summaries of the program structure it was faster to review than documentation within the code itself and they often solved logic problems when they had to write it out briefly should be there ricky said on the screen i saw initialize for j to l x v do sj set initial demand to end for for il to z do for j to l x v do ij state xyz agent threshold param ш ij intent cjhj agent intention fill response begin agent response zone zi intitial zone unlearned by agent sweep activate agent travel end for end for main for kl to rvd do for tm to nv do for i to j do tracking surrounds ш ij intent cjhj agent intention fill ij state xyz agent is in motion ikl filed xyz track nearest agents i scanned it for a while looking for how they had changed it then i scrolled down into the actual code to see the implementation but the important code wasnt there the entire set of particle behaviors was marked as an object call to a something titled compstatdo ricky i said whats compstatdo where is it should be there its not i dont know maybe its compiled well that isnt going to do me any good is it you couldnt read compiled code ricky i want to see that damn module what is the problem no problem i have to look for it is all okay ill do it when you get back i glanced over at mae have you gone through the code she shook her head her expression seemed to say it was never going to happen that ricky would make up more excuses and keep putting me off i didnt understand why i was there to advise them on the code after all that was my area of expertise in the next room rosie and david were poking through the shelves of supplies looking for radio relays they werent having any success across the room charley davenport farted loudly and cried bingo jesus charley rosie said you shouldnt hold things in charley said it makes you sick you make me sick rosie said oh sorry charley held up his hand showing a shiny metal contraption then i guess you dont want this remotecontrolled compression valve what rosie said turning are you kidding david said going over to look and its got a pressure rating of adc twenty pi that should work fine david said if you dont fuck it up charley said they took the valve and went to the sink where mae was still pouring wearing her heavy gloves she said let me finish will i glow in the dark charley said grinning at her just your farts rosie said hey they already do that specially when you light em jesus charley farts are methane you know burns with a hard blue gemlike flame and he laughed im glad you appreciate yourself rosie said because nobody else does ouch ouch charley said clutching his breast i die i die dont get our hopes up my headset crackled hey guys it was bobby lembeck again winds just dropped to six knots i said okay i turned to the others lets finish up guys david said were waiting for mae then well fit this valve lets fit it back in the lab i said well i just want to make sure back at the lab i said pack it up guys i went to the window and looked out the wind was still ruffling the juniper bushes but there was no longer a layer of sand blowing across the ground ricky came on the headset jack get your fucking team out of there were doing it now i said david brooks said in a formal tone guys theres no point in leaving until we have a valve that we know fits this bottle i think we better go mae said finished or not what good would that do david said pack up i said stop talking and pack it up now over the headset bobby said four knots and falling fast lets go everybody i said i was herding them toward the door then ricky came on no what you cant leave now why not because its too late theyre here day pm everyone went to the window we banged heads trying to look out in all directions as far as i could see the horizon was clear i saw nothing at all where are they i said coming from the south we have them on the monitors how many charley said four four yeah four the main building was south of us there were no windows in the south wall of the shed david said we dont see anything how fast are they coming fast do we have time to run for it i dont think so david frowned he doesnt think so jesus and before i could say anything david had bolted for the far door opened it and stepped out into the sunlight through the rectangle of the open door we saw him look to the south shading his eyes with his hand we all spoke at once david david what the fuck are you doing david you asshole im trying to see get back here you stupid bastard but brooks remained where he was hands over his eyes i dont see anything yet he said and i dont hear anything listen i think maybe we can make a run foruh no we cant he sprinted back inside stumbled on the door frame fell scrambled to his feet and slammed the door shut pulled it tight behind him tugging on the doorknob where are they coming he said theyre coming his voice shook with tension oh jesus theyre coming he pulled back on the doorknob with both hands using his whole body weight he muttered over and over coming theyre coming oh great charley said the fucking guys cracked i went over to david and put my hand on his shoulder he was pulling on the doorknob breathing in ragged gasps david i said quietly lets take it easy now lets take a deep breath i justi have to keephave to keep them he was sweating his whole body tense his shoulder shaking under my hand it was pure panic david i said lets take a deep breath okay i have tohave tohavehavehave big breath david i took one demonstrating that feels better come on now big breath david was nodding trying to hear me he took a short breath then resumed his quick gasps thats good david now another one another breath his breathing slowed slightly he stopped shaking okay david thats good behind me charley said i always knew that guy was fucked up look at him talking to him like a fucking baby i glanced back and shot charley a look he just shrugged hey im fucking right mae said its not helping charley fuck helping rosie said charley just shut up for a while okay i turned back to david i kept my voice even all right david thats good breathe okay now let go of the doorknob david shook his head refusing but he seemed confused now uncertain of what he was doing he blinked his eyes rapidly it was as if he was coming out of a trance i said softly let go of the doorknob its not doing any good finally he let go and sat back on the ground he began to cry head in hands oh jesus charley said thats all we need shut up charley rosie went to the refrigerator and came back with a bottle of water she gave it to david who drank as he cried she helped him to his feet nodded to me that shed take it from here i went back to the center of the room where the others were standing by the workstation screen on the screen the lines of code had been replaced by a monitor view of the north face of the main building four swarms were there glinting silver as they moved up and down the length of the building whatre they doing i said trying to get in i said why do they do that were not sure mae said we watched for a moment in silence once again i was struck by the purposefulness of their behavior they reminded me of bears trying to break into a trailer to get food they paused at every doorway and closed window hovering there moving up and down along the seals until finally moving on to the next opening i said and do they always try the doors like that yes why because it looks like they dont remember that the doors are sealed no charley said they dont remember because they dont have enough memory either that he said or this is another generation you mean these are new swarms since noon yes i looked at my watch theres a new generation every three hours charley shrugged i couldnt say we never found where they reproduce im just guessing the possibility that new generations were coming that fast meant that whatever evolutionary mechanism was built into the code was progressing fast too ordinarily genetic algorithmswhich modeled reproduction to arrive at solutionsordinarily they ran between and generations to arrive at an optimization if these swarms were reproducing every three hours it meant they had turned over something like generations in the last two weeks and with generations the behavior would be much sharper mae watched them on the monitor and said at least theyre staying by the main building it seems like they dont know were here how would they know i said they wouldnt charley said their main sensory modality is vision they may have picked up a little auditory over the generations but its still primarily vision if they dont see it it doesnt exist for them rosie came over with david he said im really sorry guys no problem its okay david i dont know what happened i just couldnt stand it charley said dont worry david we understand youre a psycho and you cracked we get the picture no problem rosie put her arm around david who blew his nose loudly she stared at the monitor whats happening with them now rosie said they dont seem to know were here okay were hoping it stays that way uhhuh and if it doesnt rosie said i had been thinking about that if it doesnt we rely on the holes in the predprey assumptions we exploit the weaknesses in the programming which means we flock i said charley gave a horse laugh yeah right we flockand pray like hell im serious i said over the last thirty years scientists had studied predatorprey interactions in everything from the lion to the hyena to the warrior ant there was now a much better understanding of how prey defended themselves animals like zebras and caribou didnt live in herds because they were sociable herding was a defense against predation large numbers of animals provided increased vigilance and attacking predators were often confused when the herd fled in all directions sometimes they literally stopped cold show a predator too many moving targets and it often chased none the same thing was true of flocking birds and schooling fishthose coordinated group movements made it harder for predators to pick out a single individual predators were drawn to attack an animal that was distinctive in some way that was one reason why they attacked infants so oftennot only because they were easier prey but because they looked different in the same way predators killed more males than females because nondominant males tended to hang on the outskirts of the herd where they were more noticeable in fact thirty years ago when hans kruuk studied hyenas in the serengeti he found that putting paint on an animal guaranteed it would be killed in the next attack that was the power of difference so the message was simple stay together stay the same that was our best chance but i hoped it wouldnt come to that the swarms disappeared for a while they had gone around to the other side of the laboratory building we waited tensely eventually they reappeared they once again moved along the side of the building trying openings one after another we all watched the monitor david brooks was sweating profusely he wiped his forehead with his sleeve how long are they going to keep doing that as long as they fucking want charley said mae said at least until the wind kicks up again and it doesnt look like thats going to happen soon jesus david said i dont know how you guys can stand it he was pale sweat had dripped from his eyebrows onto his glasses he looked like he was going to pass out i said david do you want to sit down maybe i better okay come on david rosie said she took him across the room to the sink and sat him on the floor he hugged his knees put his head down she put cold water on a paper towel and placed it on the back of his neck her gestures were tender that fucking guy charley said shaking his head thats all we need right now charley mae said youre not helping so what were trapped in this fucking shed its not fucking airtight theres nothing we can do no place we can go and hes fucking cracking up makes everything worse yes she said quietly thats all true and youre not helping it charley gave her a look and began to hum the theme from the twilight zone charley i said pay attention i was watching the swarms their behavior had subtly changed they no longer stayed close to the building instead they now moved in a zigzag pattern away from the wall into the desert and then back again they were all doing it in a kind of fluid dance mae saw it too new behavior yes i said their strategy isnt working so theyre trying something else not going to do shit for them charley said they can zigzag all they want it wont open any doors even so i was fascinated to see this emergent behavior the zigzags were becoming more exaggerated the swarms were moving farther and farther away from the buildings their strategy was shifting progressively it was evolving as we watched its really amazing i said little fuckers charley said one of the swarms was now quite close to the rabbit carcass it approached within a few yards and swirled away again heading back to the main building a thought occurred to me how well do the swarms see the headset clicked it was ricky they see fabulously he said its what they were made to do after all eyesights twentyohfive he said fantastic resolution better than any human i said and how do they do the imaging because they were just a series of individual particles like the rods and cones in the eye central processing was required to form a picture from all the inputs how was that processing accomplished ricky coughed uh not sure charley said it showed up in later generations you mean they evolved vision on their own yeah and we dont know how they do it no we just know they just do we watched as the swarm angled away from the wall moved back near the rabbit then returned to the wall once more the other swarms were farther down the building doing the same thing swirling out into the desert then swirling back again over the headset ricky said why do you ask because you think theyll find the rabbit im not worried about the rabbit i said anyway it looks like they already missed it then what uhoh mae said shit charley said and he gave a long sigh we were looking at the nearest swarm the one that had just bypassed the rabbit that swarm had moved out into the desert again perhaps ten yards away from the rabbit but instead of turning back in its usual pattern it had paused in the desert it didnt move but the silvery column rose and fell why is it doing that i said that up and down thing something to do with imaging focusing no i said i mean why did it stop program stall i shook my head i doubt it then what i think it sees something like what charley said i was afraid i knew the answer the swarm represented an extremely highresolution camera combined with a distributed intelligence network and one thing distributed networks did particularly well was detect patterns that was why distributed network programs were used to recognize faces for security systems or to assemble the shattered fragments of archaeological pottery the networks could find patterns in data better than the human eye what patterns charley said when i told him theres nothing out there to detect except sand and cactus thorns mae said and footprints what you mean our footprints from us walking over here shit mae the sands been blowing for the last fifteen minutes theres no footprints left to find we watched the swarm hang there rising and falling like it was breathing the cloud had turned mostly black now with just an occasional glint of silver it had remained at the same spot for ten or fifteen seconds pulsing up and down the other swarms were continuing in their zigzag course but this one stayed where it was charley bit his lip you really think it sees something i dont know i said maybe suddenly the swarm rose up and began to move again but it wasnt coming toward us instead it moved on a diagonal over the desert heading back toward the door in the power building when it came to the door it stopped and swirled in place what the hell charley said i knew what it was so did mae it just tracked us she said backward the swarm had followed the path we had originally taken from the door to the rabbit the question was what would it do next the next five minutes were tense the swarm retraced its path going back to the rabbit it swirled around the rabbit for a while moving in slow semicircles back and forth then once again it retraced the route back to the power station door it stayed at the door for a while then returned to the rabbit the swarm repeated this sequence three times meanwhile the other swarms had continued their zigzagging around the building and were now out of sight the solitary swarm returned to the door then headed back to the rabbit again its stuck in a loop charley said it just does the same thing over and over again lucky for us i said i was waiting to see if the swarm would modify its behavior so far it hadnt and if it had very little memory then it might be like an alzheimers patient unable to remember it had done all this before now it was going around the rabbit moving in semicircles definitely stuck in a loop charley said i waited i hadnt been able to review all the changes theyd made to predprey because the central module was missing but the original program had a randomizing element built into it to handle situations exactly like this whenever predprey failed to attain its goal and there were no specific environmental inputs to provoke new action then its behavior was randomly modified this was a wellknown solution for example psychologists now believed a certain amount of random behavior was necessary for innovation you couldnt be creative without striking out in new directions and those directions were likely to be randomuhoh mae said the behavior had changed the swarm moved in larger circles going around and around the rabbit and almost immediately it came across another path it paused a moment and then suddenly rose up and began to move directly toward us it was following exactly the same path we had taken walking to the shed shit charley said i think were fucked mae and charley rushed across the room to look out the window david and rosie stood and peered out the window above the sink and i started to shout no no get away from the windows what its visual remember get away from the windows there was no good place to hide in the storage room not really rosie and david crawled under the sink charley pushed in beside them ignoring their protests mae slipped into the shadows of one corner of the room easing herself into the space where two shelves didnt quite meet she could only be seen from the west window and then not easily the radio crackled hey guys it was ricky ones heading for you and uh no two others are joining it ricky i said go off air what no more radio contact why off ricky i dropped down on my knees behind a cardboard carton of supplies in the main room the carton wasnt large enough to hide me entirelymy feet stuck outbut like mae i wasnt easily seen someone outside would have to look at an angle through the north window to see me in any case it was the best i could do from my crouched position i could just see the others huddled beneath the sink i couldnt see mae at all unless i really stuck my head around the corner of the carton when i did she looked quiet composed i ducked back and waited i heard nothing but the hum of the air conditioner ten or fifteen seconds passed i could see the sunlight streaming in through the north window above the sink it made a white rectangle on the floor to my left my headset crackled why no contact jesus fucking a charley muttered i put my finger to my lips and shook my head ricky i said dont these things have auditory capacity sure maybe a little but be quiet and stay off but i reached for the transmitter at my belt and clicked it off i signaled the others beneath the sink they each turned their transmitters off charley mouthed something to me i thought he mouthed that fucking guy wants us killed but i couldnt be sure we waited it couldnt have been more than two or three minutes but it seemed forever my knees began to hurt on the hard concrete floor trying to get more comfortable i shifted my position cautiously by now i was sure the first swarm was in our vicinity it hadnt appeared at the windows yet and i wondered what was taking so long perhaps as it followed our path it had paused to inspect the cars i wondered what swarm intelligence would make of an automobile how puzzling it must look to that highresolution eye but maybe because the cars were inanimate the swarm would ignore them as some sort of large brightly colored boulders but still what was taking so long my knees hurt more with every passing second i changed my position putting weight on my hands and raising my knees like a runner at the blocks i had a moment of temporary relief i was so focused on my pain that i didnt notice at first that the glaring white rectangle on the floor was turning darker at the center and spreading out to the sides in a moment the entire rectangle turned dull gray the swarm was here i wasnt certain but i fancied that beneath the hum of the air conditioner was a deep thrumming sound from my position behind the crate i saw the window above the sink grow progressively darker from swirling black particles it was as if there was a dust storm right outside inside the shed it was dark surprisingly dark underneath the sink david brooks began to moan charley clapped his hand over his mouth they looked upward even though the sink blocked their view of the window above them and then the swarm vanished from the window as quickly as it had come sunlight poured in again nobody moved we waited moments later the window in the west wall turned dark in the same way i wondered why the swarm didnt enter the window wasnt airtight the nanoparticles could slide through the cracks without difficulty but they didnt even seem to try perhaps this was an instance where network learning was on our side perhaps the swarms had been trained by their experience at the lab to think doors and windows were impermeable maybe thats why they werent trying the thought gave me a hopeful feeling that helped counteract the pain in my knees the west window was still dark when the north window over the sink turned dark again now two swarms were looking in at the same time ricky had said there were three coming toward the building he hadnt mentioned the fourth i wondered where the third swarm was a moment later i knew like a silent black mist nanoparticles began to come into the room underneath the west door soon more particles entered all around the door frame inside the room the particles appeared to spin and swirl aimlessly but i knew they would selforganize in a few moments then at the north window i saw more particles flooding through the cracks through the airconditioning vents in the ceiling still more particles rushed downward there was no point in waiting any longer i got to my feet and stepped from my hiding place i shouted for everybody to come out of hiding form up in two rows charley grabbed the windex spray bottle and fell into line grumbling what do you think our fucking chances are the best theyll ever get i said reynolds rules form up and stay with me lets gonow if we werent so frightened we might have felt ridiculous shuffling back and forth across the room in a tight cluster trying to coordinate our movementstrying to imitate a flock of birds my heart was pounding in my chest i heard a roaring sound in my ears it was hard to focus on our steps i knew we were awkward but we got better quickly when we came to a wall we wheeled and headed back again moving in unison i started swinging my arms and clapping with each step the others did the same it helped our coordination and we each fought our terror as mae said later it was step aerobics from hell and all the time we watched the black nanoparticles as they came hissing into the room through cracks in doors and windows it seemed to go on for a long time but it was probably only thirty or forty seconds soon a kind of undifferentiated fog filled the room i felt pinpricks all over my body and i was sure the others felt it too david started moaning again but rosie was right beside him encouraging him urging him to keep it together suddenly with shocking speed the fog cleared the particles coalescing into two fully formed columns that now stood directly before us rising and falling in dark ripples seen this close the swarms exuded an unmistakable sense of menace almost malevolence their deep thrumming sound was clearly audible but intermittently i heard an angry hiss like a snake but they did not attack us just as i had hoped the programming deficits worked for us confronted by a cluster of coordinated prey these predators were stymied they did nothing at all at least for now between claps charley said do you believethis fucking shitits working i said yes but maybenot for long i was worried about how long david could control his anxiety and i was worried about the swarms i didnt know how long theyd just stand there before they innovated new behavior i said i suggest wemove toward thatback door behind usand get the hell out as we wheeled away from the wall i angled slightly toward the rear room clapping and stepping in unison our group moved away from the swarms which thrummed deeply and followed and if we get outside then what david whined he was having trouble staying in sync with the rest of us in his panic he kept stumbling he was sweating and blinking rapidly we continue this wayflocking this wayback to the laband get insideare you willing to try oh jeez he moaned its so far i dont know if he stumbled again nearly lost his balance and he wasnt clapping with the rest of us i could almost feel his terror his overwhelming urge to flee david you stay with usif you go on your ownyoull never make itare you listening david moaned i dont know jack i dont know if i can he stumbled again bumped into rosie who fell against charley who caught her and pulled her back to her feet but our flock was knocked into momentary disarray our coordination gone immediately the swarms turned dense black coiled and tightened as if ready to spring i heard charley whisper oh fuck under his breath and indeed for a moment i thought he was right and that it was all over but then we regained our rhythm and immediately the swarms rose up returned to normal their dense blackness faded they resumed their steady pulsing they followed us into the next room but still they did not attack we were now about twenty feet from the back door the same door we had come in i started to feel optimistic for the first time i thought it was possible we really might make it and then in an instant everything went to hell david brooks bolted we were well into the back room and about to work our way around the freestanding shelves in the center of the room when he ran straight between the swarms and past them heading for the far door the swarms instantly spun and chased him rosie was screaming for him to come back but david was focused on the door the swarms pursued him with surprising speed david had almost reached the doorhis hand was reaching for the doorknobwhen one swarm sank low and spread itself across the floor ahead of him turning it black the moment david brooks reached the black surface his feet shot out from under him as if he had stepped on ice he howled in pain as he slammed onto the concrete and immediately tried to scramble to his feet again but he couldnt get up he kept slipping and falling again and again his eyeglasses shattered the frames cut his nose his lips were coated with swirling black residue he started to have trouble breathing rosie was still screaming as the second swarm descended on david and the black spread across his face onto his eyes into his hair his movements became increasingly frantic he moaned pitifully like an animal yet somehow as he slid and tumbled on hands and knees he managed to make his way toward the door at last he lunged upward grabbed the doorknob and managed to pull himself to his knees with a final desperate movement he twisted the knob and kicked the door open as he fell hot sunlight flared into the shedand the third swarm swirled in from outside rosie cried weve got to do something i grabbed her arm as she ran past me toward david she struggled in my grip we have to help him we have to help him theres nothing we can do we have to help him rosie theres nothing we can do david was now rolling on the ground black from head to toe the third swarm had enveloped him it was difficult to see through the dancing particles it looked as though davids mouth was a dark hole his eyeballs completely black i thought he might be blind his breath came in ragged gasps with little choking sounds the swarm was flowing into his mouth like a black river his body began to shudder he clutched at his neck his feet drummed on the floor i was sure he was dying come on jack charley said lets get the fuck out of here you cant leave him rosie shouted you cant you cant david was sliding out the door into the sunlight his movements were less vigorous now his mouth was moving but we heard only gasps rosie struggled to get free charley grabbed her shoulder and said god damn it rosie fuck you she wrenched free from his grip she stamped on my foot and in my moment of surprise i let go and she sprinted across the shed into the next room shouting david david his hand black as a miners stretched toward her she grabbed his wrist and in the same moment she fell slipping on the black floor just as he had done she kept saying his name until she began to cough and a black rim appeared on her lips charley said lets go for christs sake i cant watch i felt unable to move my feet unable to leave i turned to mae tears were running down her cheeks she said go rosie was still calling out davids name as she hugged him pulled his body to her chest but he didnt seem to be moving on his own anymore charley leaned close to me and said its not your fucking fault i nodded slowly i knew what he was saying was true hell this is your first day on the job charley reached down to my belt flicked my headset on lets go i turned toward the door behind me and we went outside day pm beneath the corrugated roof the air was hot and still the line of cars stretched away from us i heard the whirr of a video camera motor up by the roof ricky must have seen us coming out on the monitors static hissed in my headset ricky said what the hells going on nothing good i said beyond the line of shade the afternoon sun was still bright where are the others ricky said is everybody okay no everybody is not well tell me not now in retrospect we were all numb from what had happened we didnt have any reaction except to try and get to safety the lab building stood across the desert a hundred yards to our right we could reach the power station door in thirty or forty seconds we set off toward it at a brisk jog ricky was still talking but we didnt answer him we were all thinking about the same thing in another half a minute we would reach the door and safety but we had forgotten the fourth swarm oh fuck charley said the fourth swarm swirled out from the side of the lab building and started straight toward us we stopped confused what do we do mae said flock no i shook my head theres only three of us we were too small a group to confuse a predator but i couldnt think of any other strategy to try all the predatorprey studies i had ever read began to play back in my head those studies agreed on one thing whether you modeled warrior ants or serengeti lions the studies confirmed one major dynamic left to their own devices predators would kill all the prey until none remainedunless there was a prey refuge in real life the prey refuge might be a nest in a tree or an underground den or a deep pool in a river if the prey had a refuge theyd survive without a refuge the predators would kill them all i think were fucked charley said we needed a refuge the swarm was bearing down on us i could almost feel the pinpricks on my skin and taste the dry ashen taste in my mouth we had to find some kind of shelter before the swarm reached us i turned full circle looking in all directions but there was nothing i could see exceptare the cars locked my headset crackled no they shouldnt be we turned and ran the nearest car was a blue ford sedan i opened the drivers door and mae opened the passenger side the swarm was right behind us i could hear the thrumming sound as i slammed the door shut as mae slammed hers charley still holding the windex spray was trying to open the rear passenger door but it was locked mae twisted in the seat to unlock the door but charley had already turned to the next car a land cruiser and climbed inside and slammed the door yow he said fucking hot i know i said the inside of the car was like an oven mae and i were both sweating the swarm rushed toward us and swirled over the front windshield pulsating shifting back and forth over the headset a panicked ricky said guys where are you guys were in the cars which cars what fucking difference does it make charley said were in two of the fucking cars ricky the black swarm moved away from our sedan over to the toyota we watched as it slid from one window to another trying to get in charley grinned at me through the glass its not like the shed these cars are airtight so fuck em what about the air vents i said i shut mine but they arent airtight are they no he said but youd have to go under the hood to begin to get in or maybe through the trunk and im betting this overbred buzzball cant figure that out inside our car mae was snapping closed the dashboard air ducts one after another she opened the glove compartment glanced inside shut it again i said you find any keys she shook her head no over the headset ricky said guys you got more company i turned to see two additional swarms coming around the shed they immediately swirled over our car front and back i felt like we were in a dust storm i looked at mae she was sitting very still stonyfaced just watching the two new clouds finished circling the car then came to the front one was positioned just outside maes passenger door window it pulsed glinting silver the other was on the hood of the car moving back and forth from mae to me from time to time it would rush the windshield and disperse itself over the glass then it would coalesce again back away down the hood and rush again charley cackled gleefully trying to get in i told you they cant do it i wasnt so sure i noticed that with each charge the swarm would move farther back down the hood taking a longer run soon it would back itself up to the front grill and if it started inspecting the grill it could find the opening to the air vents and then it would be over mae was rummaging in the utility compartment between the seats she came up with a roll of tape and a box of plastic sandwich baggies she said maybe we can tape the vents i shook my head theres no point i said theyre nanoparticles theyre small enough to pass right through a membrane you mean theyd come through the plastic or around through small cracks you cant seal it well enough to keep them out then we just sit here basically yes and hope they dont figure it out i nodded thats right over the headset bobby lembeck said winds starting to pick up again six knots it sounded like he was trying to be encouraging but six knots wasnt anywhere near enough force the swarms outside the windshield moved effortlessly around the car charley said jack i just lost my buzzball where is it i looked over at charleys car and saw that the third swarm had slid down to the front tire well where it was swirling in circles and moving in and out through the holes in the hubcap checking your hubcaps charley i said umm he sounded unhappy and with good reason if the swarm started exploring the car thoroughly it might stumble on a way in he said i guess the question is how big is their so component really thats right i said mae said in english i explained the swarms had no leader and no central intelligence their intelligence was the sum of the individual particles those particles selforganized into a swarm and their selforganizing tendency had unpredictable results you really didnt know what they would do the swarms might continue to be ineffective as they were now they might come upon the solution by chance or they might start searching in an organized way but they hadnt done that so far my clothes were heavy soaked in sweat sweat was dripping from my nose and chin i wiped my forehead with the back of my arm i looked at mae she was sweating too ricky said hey jack what julia called a while ago shes checked out of the hospital and not now ricky shes coming out here tonight well talk later ricky i just thought youd want to know jesus charley said exploding someone tell this asshole to shut up were busy bobby lembeck said eight knots of wind now no sorry seven charley said jesus the suspense is killing me wheres my swarm now jack under the car i cant see what its doing no wait its coming up behind you charley looks like its checking out your taillights some kind of car freak he said well it can check away i was looking over my shoulder at charleys swarm when mae said jack look the swarm outside her window on the passenger side had changed it was almost entirely silver now shimmering but pretty stable and on this silver surface i saw maes head and shoulders reflected back the reflection wasnt perfect because her eyes and mouth were slightly blurred but basically it was accurate i frowned its a mirror no she said its not she turned away from the window to look at me her image on the silver surface did not change the face continued to stare into the car then after a moment or two the image shivered dissolved and reformed to show the back of her head what does that mean mae said ive got a pretty good idea but the swarm on the front hood was doing the same thing except that its silver surface showed the two of us sitting side by side in the car looking very frightened again the image was somewhat blurred and now it was clear to me that the swarm was not a literal mirror the swarm itself was generating the image by the precise positioning of individual particles which meantbad news charley said i know i said theyre innovating what do you figure is it one of the presets basically yes i assume its imitation mae shook her head not understanding the program presets certain strategies to help attain goals the strategies model what real predators do so one preset strategy is to freeze where you are and wait to ambush another is to randomwalk until you stumble on your prey and then pursue a third is to camouflage yourself by taking on some element of the environment so you blend in and a fourth is to mimic the preys behaviorto imitate it she said you think this is imitation i think this is a form of imitation yes its trying to make itself appear like us yes this is emergent behavior its evolved on its own yes i said bad news charley said mournfully bad bad news sitting in the car i started to get angry because what the mirror imaging meant to me was that i didnt know the real structure of the nanoparticles id been told there was a piezo wafer that would reflect light so it wasnt surprising that the swarm occasionally flashed silver in the sun that didnt call for sophisticated orientation of the particles in fact you would expect that sort of silvery ripple as a random effect just the way heavily trafficked highways will clog up and then flow freely again the congestion was caused by random speed changes from one or two motorists but the effect rippled down the entire highway the same would be true of the swarms a chance effect would pass like a wave down the swarm and thats what we had seen but this mirroring behavior was something entirely different the swarms were now producing images in color and holding them fairly stable such complexity wasnt possible from the simple nanoparticle id been shown i doubted you could generate a full spectrum from a silver layer it was theoretically possible that the silver could be precisely tilted to produce prismatic colors but that implied enormous sophistication of movement it was more logical to imagine that the particles had another method to create colors and that meant i hadnt been told the truth about the particles either ricky had lied to me yet again so i was angry i had already concluded something was wrong with ricky and in retrospect the problem lay with me not him even after the debacle in the storage shed i still failed to grasp that the swarms were evolving faster than our ability to keep pace with them i should have realized what i was up against when the swarms demonstrated a new strategymaking the floor slippery to disable their prey and to move them among ants that would be called collective transport the phenomenon was well known but for these swarms it was unprecedented newly evolved behavior yet at the time i was too horrified to recognize its true significance now sitting in the hot car it wasnt useful to blame ricky but i was scared and tired and i wasnt thinking clearly jack mae nudged my shoulder and pointed to charleys car her face was grim the swarm by the taillight of charleys car was now a black stream that curved high in the air and then disappeared in the seam where the red plastic joined the metal over the headset i said hey charley i think its found a way yeah i see it fuck a duck charley was scrambling into the backseat already particles were beginning to fill the inside of the car making a gray fog that rapidly darkened charley coughed i couldnt see what he was doing he was down below the window he coughed again charley he didnt answer but i heard him swearing charley you better get out fuck these guys and then there was an odd sound which at first i couldnt place i turned to mae who was pressing her headset to her ear it was a strange rhythmic rasping she looked at me questioningly charley imspray these little bastards lets see how they do when theyre wet mae said youre spraying the isotope he didnt answer but a moment later he appeared in the window again spraying in all directions with the windex bottle liquid streaked across the glass and dripped down the interior of the car was growing darker as more and more particles entered soon we couldnt see him at all his hand emerged from the black pressed against the glass then disappeared again he was coughing continuously a dry cough charley i said run for it ah fuck whats the point bobby lembeck said winds ten knots go for it ten knots wasnt enough but it was better than nothing charley you hear we heard his voice from the black interior yeah okay im lookingcant findfucking door handle cant feel wheres the goddamn door handle on this he broke into a spasm of coughing over the headset i heard voices inside the lab all speaking rapidly ricky said hes in the toyota wheres the handle in the toyota bobby lembeck i dont know its not my car whose car is it vince vince no no its that guy with the bad eyes who the engineer the guy who blinks all the time david brooks yeah him ricky said guys we think its davids car i said thats not going to do us any and then i broke off because mae was pointing behind her to the backseat of our car from the seam where the seat cushion met the back particles were hissing into the car like black smoke i looked closer and saw a blanket on the floor of the backseat mae saw it too and threw herself bodily into the back diving between the seats she kicked me in the head as she went but she had the blanket and began stuffing it into the crack my headset came off and caught on the steering wheel as i tried to climb back to help her it was cramped in the car i heard a tinny voice from the earpieces come on mae said come on i was bigger than she was there wasnt room for me back there my body jackknifed over the drivers seat as i grabbed the blanket and helped her stuff it i was vaguely aware that the passenger door banged open on the toyota and i saw charleys foot emerge from the black he was going to try his luck outside maybe we should too i thought as i helped her with the blanket the blanket wouldnt do any good it was just a delaying tactic already i sensed the particles were sifting right through the cloth the car was continuing to fill the air was getting darker and darker i felt the pinpricks all over my skin mae lets run she didnt answer she just kept pushing the blanket harder into the cracks probably she knew wed never make it if we went outside the swarms would run us down get in our path make us slip and fall and once we fell they would suffocate us just as they did to the others the air was thicker i started to cough in the semidarkness i kept hearing a tinny voice from the headsets i couldnt tell where it was coming from maes headset had fallen off too and i thought i had seen it on the front seat but now it was becoming too dark to see my eyes burned i coughed continuously mae was coughing too i didnt know if she was still stuffing the blanket she was just a shadow in the fog i squeezed my eyes against the sharp pain my throat was tightening and my cough was dry i felt dizzy again i knew we couldnt survive more than a minute or so perhaps less i looked back at mae but couldnt see her i heard her coughing i waved my hand trying to clear the fog so i could see her it didnt work i waved my hand in front of the windshield and it cleared momentarily despite my fit of coughing i saw the lab in the distance the sun was shining everything looked normal it was infuriating that it should appear so normal and peaceful while we coughed ourselves to death i couldnt see what happened to charley he wasnt in front of me anywhere in facti waved my hand againall i saw wasblowing sand jesus blowing sand the wind was back up mae i coughed mae the door i dont know if she heard me she was coughing hard i reached for the drivers side door fumbling for the handle i felt confused and disoriented i was coughing continuously i touched hot metal jerked it down the door swung open beside me hot desert air rushed in swirling the fog the wind had definitely come up mae she was racked with coughing perhaps she couldnt move i lunged for the passenger door opposite me my ribs banged on the gearshift the fog was thinner now and i saw the handle twisted it and shoved the door open it banged shut in the wind i pushed forward twisted shoved it open again holding it open with my hand wind blew through the car the black cloud vanished in a few seconds the backseat was still dark i crawled forward out the passenger door and opened the back door she reached to me and i hauled her out we were both coughing hard her legs buckled i threw her arm over my shoulder and half carried her out into the open desert even now i dont know how i made it back to the laboratory building the swarms had vanished the wind was blowing hard mae was a dead weight on my shoulders her body limp her feet dragging over the sand i had no energy i was racked with spasms of coughing which often forced me to stop i couldnt get my breath i was dizzy disoriented the glare of the sun had a greenish tinge and i saw spots before my eyes mae was coughing weakly her breaths shallow i had the feeling she wouldnt survive i trudged on putting one foot ahead of the other somehow the door loomed in front of me and i got it open i brought mae into the black outer room on the other side of the glass airlock ricky and bobby lembeck were waiting they were cheering us on but i couldnt hear them my headset was back in the car the airlock doors hissed open and i got mae inside she managed to stand though she was doubled over coughing i stepped away the wind began to blow her clean i leaned against the wall out of breath dizzy i thought havent i done this before i looked at my watch it was just three hours since i had narrowly escaped the last attack i bent over and put my hands on my knees i stared at the floor and waited for the airlock to become free i glanced over at ricky and bobby they were yelling pointing to their ears i shook my head couldnt they see i didnt have a headset i said wheres charley they answered but i couldnt hear them did he make it wheres charley i winced at a harsh electronic squeal and then over the intercom ricky said not much you can do is he here i said did he make it no where is he back at the car ricky said he never got out of the car didnt you know i was busy i said so hes back there yeah is he dead no no hes alive i was still breathing hard still dizzy what its hard to tell on the video monitor but it looks like he is alive then why the fuck dont you guys go get him rickys voice was calm we cant jack we have to take care of mae someone here could go we dont have anyone to spare i cant go i said im in no shape to go of course not ricky said turning on his soothing voice the undertakers voice all this must be a terrible shock to you jack all youve gone through just tell me whos going to get him ricky to be brutally honest ricky said i dont think theres any point he had a convulsion a bad one i dont think he has much left i said nobodys going im afraid theres no point jack inside the airlock bobby was helping mae out and leading her down the corridor ricky was standing there watching me through the glass your turn jack come on in i didnt move i stayed leaning against the wall i said somebody has to go get him not right now the wind isnt stable jack itll fall again any minute but hes alive not for long somebody has to go i said jack you know as well as i do what were up against ricky said he was doing the voice of reason now calm and logical weve had terrible losses we cant risk anybody else by the time somebody gets to charley hell be dead he may be dead already come on and get in the airlock i was taking stock of my body feeling my breathing my chest my deep fatigue i couldnt go back out right now not in the condition i was in so i got into the airlock with a roar the blowers flattened my hair fluttered my clothes and cleaned the black particles from my clothes and skin my vision improved almost immediately i breathed easier now they were blowing upward i held out my hand and saw it turn from black to pale gray then to normal flesh color again now the blowers came from the sides i took a deep breath the pinpricks were no longer so painful on my skin either i was feeling them less or they were being blown off my skin my head cleared a little i took another breath i didnt feel good but i felt better the glass doors opened ricky held out his arms jack thank god youre safe i didnt answer him i just turned around and went back the way i had come jack the glass doors whished shut and locked with a thunk im not leaving him out there i said whatre you going to do you cant carry him hes too big whatre you going to do i dont know but im not leaving him behind ricky and i went back outside of course i was doing exactly what ricky wantedexactly what he expected me to dobut i didnt realize it at the time and even if somebody had told me i wouldnt have credited ricky with that degree of psychological sophistication ricky was pretty obvious in the way he managed people but this time he got me day pm the wind was blowing briskly there was no sign of the swarms and i crossed to the shed without incident i didnt have a headset so i was spared rickys commentary the back passenger door of the toyota was open i found charley lying on his back motionless it took me a moment to see he was still breathing although shallowly with an effort i managed to pull him into a sitting position he stared at me with dull eyes his lips were blue and his skin was chalky gray a tear ran down his cheek his mouth moved dont try to talk i said save your energy grunting i pulled him over to the edge of the seat by the door and swung his legs around so he was facing out charley was a big guy six feet tall and at least twenty pounds heavier than i was i knew i couldnt carry him back but behind the backseat of the toyota i saw the fat tires of a dirt bike that might work charley can you hear me an almost imperceptible nod can you stand up nothing no reaction he wasnt looking at me he was staring into space charley i said do you think you can stand he nodded again then straightened his body so he slid off the seat and landed on the ground he stood shakily for a moment his legs trembling and then he collapsed against me clutching me to hold himself up i sagged under his weight okay charley i eased him back to the car and sat him down on the running board just stay there okay i let go of him and he remained sitting he still stared into space unfocused ill be right back i went around to the back of the land cruiser and popped the trunk there was a dirt bike all rightthe cleanest dirt bike i had ever seen it was encased in a heavy mylar bag and it had been wiped down after it was used that would be davids way i thought he was always so clean so organized i pulled the bike out of the car and set it on the ground there was no key in the ignition i went to the front of the toyota and opened the passenger door the front seats were spotless and carefully ordered david had one of those suction cup notepads on the dashboard a cradle for his cell phone and a telephone headset mounted on a little hook i opened his glove box and saw that the interior was neatly arranged too registration papers in an envelope beneath a small plastic tray divided into compartments containing lip balm kleenex bandaids no keys then i noticed that between the seats there was a storage box for the cd player and beneath it was a locked tray it had the same kind of lock as the ignition it probably opened with the ignition key i banged the tray with the heel of my hand and heard something metallic rattle inside it might have been a small key like a dirt bike key anyway something metal where were davids keys i wondered if vince had taken davids keys away on arrival as he had taken mine if so then the keys were in the lab that wouldnt do me any good i looked toward the lab building wondering if i should go back to get them that was when i noticed that the wind was blowing less strongly there was still a layer of sand blowing along the ground but it was less vigorous great i thought thats all i need now feeling new urgency i decided to give up on the dirt bike and its missing key perhaps there was something in the storage shed that i could use to move charley back to the lab i didnt remember anything but i went into the shed to check anyway i entered cautiously hearing a banging sound it turned out to be the far door banging open and shut in the wind rosies body lay just inside the door alternately light and dark as the door banged she had the same milky coating on her skin that the rabbit had had but i didnt go over to look closely i hastily searched the shelves opened the utility closet looked behind stacked boxes i found a furniture dolly made of wooden slats with small rollers but it would be useless in sand i went back outside under the corrugated shed and hurried to the toyota there was nothing to do but try to carry charley across to the lab building i might be able to manage it if he could support part of his own weight maybe by now he was feeling better i thought maybe he was stronger but one look at his face told me he wasnt if anything he appeared weaker shit charley what am i going to do with you he didnt answer i cant carry you and david didnt leave any keys in his car so were out of luck i stopped what if david were locked out of his car he was an engineer he thought of contingencies like that even if it was unlikely to happen david would never be caught unprepared hed never be flagging down cars asking if they had a wire hanger he could borrow no no david would have hidden a key probably in one of those magnetic key boxes i started to lie down on my back to look underneath the car when it occurred to me that david would never get his clothes dirty just to retrieve a key hed hide it cleverly but within easy reach with that in mind i ran my fingers along the inside of the front bumpers nothing i went to the back bumper did the same nothing i felt under the running boards on both sides of the car nothing no magnetic box no key i couldnt believe it so i got down and looked under the car to see if there was a brace or a strut i had somehow missed with my fingers no there wasnt i felt no key i shook my head puzzled the hiding place needed to be steel for the magnetic box and it needed to be protected from the elements that was why almost everybody hid their keys inside the car bumpers david hadnt done that where else could you hide a key i walked around the car again looking at the smooth lines of the metal i ran my fingers around the front grill opening and under the back license plate indentation no key i started to sweat it wasnt only the tension by now i could definitely feel the drop in the wind i went back to charley who was still sitting on the sideboard how you doing charley he didnt answer just gave a little shrug i took his headset off and put it on i heard static and voices talking softly it sounded like ricky and bobby and it sounded like an argument i pulled the mouthpiece near my lips and said guys speak to me a pause bobby surprised jack thats right jack you cant stay there the winds been falling steadily for the last few minutes its only ten knots now okay jack youve got to come back in i cant just yet below seven knots the swarms can move okay ricky what do you mean okay jesus jack are you coming in or not i cant carry charley you knew that when you went out uhhuh jack what the hell are you doing i heard the whirr of the video monitor in the corner of the shed i looked over the roof of the car and saw the lens rotate as they zoomed in on me the toyota was such a big car it almost blocked my view of the camera and the ski rack on top made it even higher i vaguely wondered why david had a ski rack because he didnt ski he always hated cold the rack must have come with the car as standard equipment andi swore it was so obvious there was only one place i hadnt checked i jumped up on the running board and looked at the roof of the car i ran my fingers over the ski rack and along the parallel tracks bolted to the roof my fingers touched black tape against the black rack i pulled the tape away and saw a silver key jack nine knots okay i dropped back down to the ground and climbed in the drivers seat i put the key in the lock box and twisted it the box opened inside i found a small yellow key jack whatre you doing i hurried around to the back of the car i fitted the yellow key in the ignition i straddled the bike and started it up the motor rumbled loudly under the corrugated shed jack i walked the bike around the side of the car to where charley was sitting that was going to be the tricky part the bike didnt have a kickstand i moved as close to charley as i could and then tried to support him enough that he could climb onto the backseat while i still sat on the bike and kept it upright fortunately he seemed to understand what i was doing i got him in place and told him to hold on to me bobby lembeck jack theyre here where south side coming toward you okay i gunned the motor and pulled the passenger door shut and i stayed exactly where i was jack ricky whats the matter with him he knows what the danger is bobby i know hes just sitting there charley had his hands around my waist his head was on my shoulder i could hear his raspy breathing i said hold tight charley he nodded ricky jack whatre you doing then at my ear in a voice just above a whisper charley said fucking idiot yes i nodded i waited i could see the swarms now coming around the building this time there were nine swarms and they headed straight for me in a v formation their own flocking behavior nine swarms i thought soon there would be thirty swarms and then two hundred bobby jack do you see them i see them of course i saw them and of course they were different from before they were denser now the columns thicker and more substantial those swarms didnt weigh three pounds anymore i sensed they were closer to ten or twenty pounds maybe even more than that maybe thirty pounds they would have real weight now and real substance i waited i stayed where i was some detached part of my brain was wondering what the formation would do when it reached me would they circle me would some of the swarms hang back and wait what did they make of the noisy bike nothingthey came right for me flattening the v into a line then into a kind of inverted v i could hear the deep vibrating hum with so many swarms it was much louder the swirling columns were twenty yards away from me then ten were they able to move faster now or was it my imagination i waited until they were almost upon me before i twisted the throttle and raced forward i passed straight through the lead swarm into the blackness and out again and then i was gunning for the power station door bouncing over the desert not daring to look back over my shoulder it was a wild ride and it only lasted a few seconds as we reached the power station i dropped the bike put my shoulder under charleys arm and staggered the final step or two to the door the swarms were still fifty yards away from the door when i managed to turn the knob pull get one foot in the crack and kick the door open the rest of the way when i did that i lost my balance and charley and i more or less fell through the door onto the concrete the door came swinging shut and whanged into our legs which hung outside i felt a sharp pain in my anklesbut worse the door was still open kept ajar by our legs through the opening i could see the swarms approaching i scrambled to my feet and dragged charleys inert body into the room the door shut but i knew it was a fire door and it wasnt airtight nanoparticles could come right in i had to get both of us into the airlock we wouldnt be safe until the first set of glass doors had hissed shut grunting and sweating i hauled charley into the airlock i got him into a sitting position propped up against the side blowers that cleared his feet of the glass doors and because only one person could be in the airlock at a time i stepped back outside and i waited for the doors to close but they didnt close i looked on the side wall for some sort of button but i didnt see anything the lights were on inside the airlock so it was getting power but the doors didnt close and i knew the swarms were fast approaching bobby lembeck and mae came running into the far room i saw them through the second set of glass doors they were waving their arms making big gestures apparently indicating for me to come back into the airlock but that didnt make sense into my headset i said i thought you had to go one at a time they didnt have headsets and couldnt hear me they were waving frantically come in come in i held up two fingers questioningly they shook their heads they seemed to be indicating i was missing the point at my feet i saw the nanoparticles begin to come into the room like black steam they were coming through the edges of the fire door i had only five or ten seconds now i stepped back in the airlock bobby and mae were nodding approving but the doors did not close now they were making other gestures lifting you want me to lift charley they did i shook my head charley was slumped there in a sitting position a dead weight on the ground i looked back at the anteroom and saw it was filling with black particles starting to form a grayish mist in the air the grayish mist was coming into the airlock as well i felt the first tiny pinpricks on my skin i looked at bobby and mae on the other side of the glass they could see what was happening they knew only seconds remained they were again making gestures lift charley up i bent over him got my hands under his armpits i tried to haul him to his feet but he didnt budge charley for gods sake help groaning i tried again charley kicked his legs and pushed with his arms and i got him a couple of feet off the ground then he slid back down charley come on once more i pulled up as hard as i could and this time he helped a lot and we got his legs back under him and with a final heave got him standing i kept my hands under his armpits we were in a kind of crazy lovers clench charley was wheezing i looked back to the glass doors the doors didnt close the air was getting blacker all the time i looked to mae and bobby and they were frantic holding up two fingers shaking them at me i didnt get it yes theres two of us what was wrong with the damned doors finally mae bent over and very deliberately pointed with one finger of each hand to her two shoes i saw her mouth two shoes and point to charley yeah so we have two shoes hes standing on two shoes mae shook her head she held up four fingers four shoes the pinpricks were irritating making it difficult to think i felt the old confusion begin to seep over me my brain felt sluggish what did she mean four shoes it was beginning to get dark in the airlock it was becoming harder to see mae and bobby they were pantomiming something else but i didnt get it they began to feel distant to me distant and trivial i was without energy and without care two shoes four shoes and then i got it i turned my back to charley leaned against him and said put your hands around my neck he did and i grabbed his legs and lifted his feet off the floor instantly the door hissed shut that was it i thought the blowers began to blast down on us the air rapidly cleared i strained to hold charley up and i managed until i saw the second set of doors unlock and slide open mae and bobby hurried into the airlock and i just fell down charley landed on top of me i think it was bobby who dragged him off me im not sure from that point on i dont remember much at all nest day pm i woke up in my bed in the residential module the air handlers were roaring so loudly the room sounded like an airport blearyeyed i staggered over to the door the door was locked i pounded on it for a while but nobody answered even when i yelled i went to the little workstation on the desk and clicked it on a menu came up and i searched for some kind of intercom i didnt see anything like that although i poked around the interface for a while i must have set something off because a window opened and ricky appeared smiling at me he said so youre awake how do you feel unlock the goddamn door is your door locked unlock it damn it it was only for your own protection ricky i said open the damn door i already did its open jack i walked to the door he was right it opened immediately i looked at the latch there was an extra bolt some kind of remote locking mechanism id have to remember to tape over that on the monitor ricky said you might want to take a shower yeah i would why is the air so loud we turned on full venting in your room ricky said in case there were any extra particles i rummaged in my bag for clothes wheres the shower do you want some help no i do not want some help just tell me where the goddamn shower is you sound angry fuck you ricky the shower helped i stood under it for about twenty minutes letting the steaming hot water run over my aching body i seemed to have a lot of bruiseson my chest my thighbut i couldnt remember how i had gotten them when i came out i found ricky there sitting on a bench jack im very concerned hows charley he seems to be okay hes sleeping did you lock his room too jack i know youve been through an ordeal and i want you to know were all very grateful for what youve donei mean the company is grateful and fuck the company jack i understand how you might be angry cut the crap ricky i got no goddamn help at all not from you and not from anybody else in this place im sure it must feel that way it is that way ricky no help is no help jack jack please im trying to tell you that im sorry for everything that happened i feel terrible about it i really do if there were any way to go back and change it believe me i would i looked at him i dont believe you ricky he gave a winning little smile i hope in time that will change it wont you know that i always valued our friendship jack it was always the most important thing to me i just stared at him ricky wasnt listening at all he just had that silly smileandeverythingwillbefine look on his face i thought is he on drugs he was certainly acting bizarrely well anyway he took a breath changed the subject julias coming out thats good news she should be here sometime this evening uhhuh why is she coming out well im sure because shes worried about these runaway swarms how worried is she i said because these swarms could have been killed off weeks ago when the evolutionary patterns first appeared but that didnt happen yes well the thing is back then nobody really understood i think they did well no he managed to appear unjustly accused and slightly offended but i was getting tired of his game ricky i said i came out here on the helicopter with a bunch of pr guys who notified them theres a pr problem here i dont know about any pr guys theyd been told not to get out of the helicopter that it was dangerous here he shook his head i have no idea i dont know what youre talking about i threw up my hands and walked out of the bathroom i dont ricky called after me protesting i swear i dont know a thing about it half an hour later as a kind of peace offering ricky brought me the missing code i had been asking for it was brief just a sheet of paper sorry about that he said took me a while to find it rosie took a whole subdirectory offline a few days ago to work on one section i guess she forgot to put it back thats why it wasnt in the main directory uhhuh i scanned the sheet what was she working on ricky shrugged beats me one of the other files mod compstatdo exec moveш ij cx cy czinit ij x y z state ikl xyz xyz track push zi store react advan ref state я dxi j k placecjhj я fxaq place zq store intent advan ref intent яijk dxi j k placecjhj яx fxaq load zi store exec moveш ij cx cy cz exec preш ij hx hy hz exec postш ij hx hy hz push ij x y z ikl xyz move xyz track ricky i said this code looks almost the same as the original yeah i think so the changes are all minor i dont know why its such an issue he shrugged i mean as soon as we lost control of the swarm the precise code seemed a little beside the point to me you couldnt change it anyway and how did you lose control theres no evolutionary algorithm in this code here he spread his hands jack he said if we knew that wed know everything we wouldnt be in this mess but i was asked to come here and check problems with the code my team had written ricky i was told the agents were losing track of their goals id say breaking free of radio control is losing track of goals but the codes not changed yeah well nobody really cared about the code itself jack its the implications of the code its the behavior that emerges from the code thats what we wanted you to help us with because i mean it is your code right yeah and its your swarm true enough jack he shrugged in his selfdeprecating way and left the room i stared at the paper for a while and then wondered why hed printed it out for me it meant i couldnt check the electronic document maybe ricky was glossing over yet another problem maybe the code really had been changed but he wasnt showing me or maybethe hell with it i thought i crumpled up the sheet of paper and tossed it in the wastebasket however this problem got solved it wasnt going to be with computer code that much was clear mae was in the biology lab peering at her monitor hand cupped under her chin i said you feel okay yes she smiled how about you just tired and my headaches back i have one too but i think mines from this phage she pointed to the monitor screen there was a scanning electron microscope image of a virus in black and white the phage looked like a mortar shellbulbous pointed head attached to a narrower tail i said thats the new mutant you were talking about before yes ive already taken one fermentation tank offline production is now at only sixty percent capacity not that it matters i suppose and whatre you doing with that offline tank im testing antiviral reagents she said i have a limited number of them here were not really set up to analyze contaminants protocol is just to go offline and scrub any tank that goes bad why havent you done that i probably will eventually but since this is a new mutant i thought i better try and find a counteragent because theyll need it for future production i mean the virus will be back you mean it will reappear again reevolve yes perhaps more or less virulent but essentially the same i nodded i knew about this from work with genetic algorithmsprograms that were specifically designed to mimic evolution most people imagined evolution to be a onetimeonly process a confluence of chance events if plants hadnt started making oxygen animal life would never have evolved if an asteroid hadnt wiped out the dinosaurs mammals would never have taken over if some fish hadnt come onto land wed all still be in the water and so on all that was true enough but there was another side of evolution too certain forms and certain ways of life kept appearing again and again for example parasitismone animal living off anotherhad evolved independently many times in the course of evolution parasitism was a reliable way for lifeforms to interact and it kept reemerging a similar phenomenon occurred with genetic programs they tended to move toward certain triedandtrue solutions the programmers talked about it in terms of peaks on a fitness landscape they could model it as threedimensional falsecolor mountain range but the fact was that evolution had its stable side too and one thing you could count on was that any big hot broth of bacteria was likely to get contaminated by a virus and if that virus couldnt infect the bacteria it would mutate to a form that could you could count on that the way you could count on finding ants in your sugar bowl if you left it out on the counter too long considering that evolution has been studied for a hundred and fifty years it was surprising how little we knew about it the old ideas about survival of the fittest had gone out of fashion long ago those views were too simpleminded nineteenthcentury thinkers saw evolution as nature red in tooth and claw envisioning a world where strong animals killed weaker ones they didnt take into account that the weaker ones would inevitably get stronger or fight back in some other way which of course they always do the new ideas emphasized interactions among continuously evolving forms some people talked of evolution as an arms race by which they meant an everescalating interaction a plant attacked by a pest evolves a pesticide in its leaves the pest evolves to tolerate the pesticide so the plant evolves a stronger pesticide and so on others talked about this pattern as coevolution in which two or more lifeforms evolved simultaneously to tolerate each other thus a plant attacked by ants evolves to tolerate the ants and even begins to make special food for them on the surface of its leaves in return the resident ants protect the plant stinging any animal that tries to eat the leaves pretty soon neither the plant nor the ant species can survive without the other this pattern was so fundamental that many people thought it was the real core of evolution parasitism and symbiosis were the true basis for evolutionary change these processes lay at the heart of all evolution and had been present from the very beginning lynn margulies was famous for demonstrating that bacteria had originally developed nuclei by swallowing other bacteria by the twentyfirst century it was clear that coevolution wasnt limited to paired creatures in some isolated spinning dance there were coevolutionary patterns with three ten or n lifeforms where n could be any number at all a cornfield contained many kinds of plants was attacked by many pests and evolved many defenses the plants competed with weeds the pests competed with other pests larger animals ate both the plants and the pests the outcome of this complex interaction was always changing always evolving and it was inherently unpredictable that was in the end why i was so angry with ricky he should have known the dangers when he found he couldnt control the swarms it was insanity to sit back and allow them to evolve on their own ricky was bright he knew about genetic algorithms he knew the biological background for current trends in programming he knew that selforganization was inevitable he knew that emergent forms were unpredictable he knew that evolution involved interaction with n forms he knew all that and he did it anyway he did or julia did i checked on charley he was still asleep in his room sprawled out on the bed bobby lembeck walked by how long has he been asleep since you got back three hours or so do you think we should wake him up check on him nah let him sleep well check him after dinner when is that half an hour bobby lembeck laughed im cooking that reminded me i was supposed to call home around dinnertime so i went into my room and dialed ellen answered the phone hello what is it she sounded harried i heard amanda crying and eric yelling at nicole in the background ellen said nicole do not do that to your brother i said hi ellen oh thank god she said you have to speak to your daughter whats going on just a minute nicole its your father i could tell she was holding out the phone to her a pause then hi dad whats going on nic nothing eric is being a brat matteroffactly nic i want to know what you did to your brother dad she lowered her voice to a whisper i knew she was cupping her hand over the phone aunt ellen is not very nice i heard that ellen said in the background but at least the baby had stopped crying shed been picked up nicole i said youre the oldest child im counting on you to help keep things together while im gone im trying dad but he is a majorly turkey butt from the background i am not up yours weasel poop dad you see what im up against eric up your hole with a tenfoot pole i looked at the monitor in front of me it showed views of the desert outside rotating images from all the security cameras one camera showed my dirt bike lying on its side near the door to the power station another camera showed the outside of the storage shed with the door swinging open and shut revealing the outline of rosies body inside two people had died today i had almost died and now my family which yesterday had been the most important thing in my life seemed distant and petty its very simple dad nicole was saying in her most reasonable grownup voice i came home with aunt ellen from the store i got a very nice blouse for the show and then eric came into my room and knocked all my books on the floor so i told him to pick them up he said no and called me the bword so i kicked him in the butt not very hard and took his gi joe and hid it thats all i said you took his gi joe gi joe was erics most important possession he talked to gi joe he slept with gi joe on the pillow beside him he can have it back she said as soon as he cleans up my books nic dad he called me the bword give him his gi joe the images on the screen were rotating through the various cameras each image only stayed on screen for a second or two i waited for the image of the shed to come back up i had a nagging feeling about it something bothered me dad this is humiliating nic youre not the mother oh yeah and she was here for maybe five seconds she was at the house mom was there but then big surprise she had to go she had a plane to catch uhhuh nicole you need to listen to ellen dad i told you shes being because shes in charge until i get back so if she says to do something you do it dad i feel this is unreasonable her membersofthejury voice well honey thats how it is but my problem nicole thats how it is until i get back when are you coming home probably tomorrow okay so we understand each other yes dad ill probably have a nervous breakdown here then i promise ill visit you in the mental hospital as soon as i get back very funny let me speak to eric i had a short conversation with eric who told me several times that it was not fair i told him to put nicoles books back he said he didnt knock them down it was an accident i said to put them back anyway then i talked to ellen briefly i encouraged her as best i could sometime during this conversation the security camera showing the outside of the shed came up again and i again saw the swinging door and the outside of the shed in this elevation the shed was slightly above grade there were four wooden steps leading from the door down to ground level but it all looked the way it should i did not know what had bothered me then i realized davids body wasnt there it wasnt in the frame earlier in the day i had seen his body slide out the door and disappear from view so it should be lying outside given the slight grade it might have rolled a few yards from the door but not more than that no body but perhaps i was mistaken or perhaps there were coyotes in any case the camera image had now changed id have to sit through another cycle to see it again i decided not to wait if davids body was gone there was nothing i could do about it now it was about seven oclock when we sat down to eat dinner in the little kitchen of the residential module bobby brought out plates of ravioli with tomato sauce and mixed vegetables i had been a stayathome dad long enough to recognize the brands of frozen food he was using i really think that contadina is better ravioli bobby shrugged i go to the fridge i find whats there i was surprisingly hungry i ate everything on my plate couldnt have been that bad bobby said mae was silent as she ate as usual beside her vince ate noisily ricky was at the far end of the table away from me looking down at his food and not meeting my eyes it was all right with me nobody wanted to talk about rosie and david but the empty stools around the table were pretty obvious bobby said to me so youre going to go out tonight yes i said when is it dark sunset should be around seventwenty bobby said he flicked on a monitor on the wall ill get you the exact time i said so we can go out three hours after that sometime after ten bobby said and you think you can track the swarm we should charley sprayed one swarm pretty thoroughly as a result of which i glow in the dark charley said laughing he came into the room and sat down everyone greeted him enthusiastically if nothing else it felt better to have another body at the table i asked him how he felt okay a little weak and i have a fucking headache from hell i know me too and me mae said its worse than the headache ricky gives me charley said looking down the table lasts longer too ricky said nothing just continued eating do you suppose these things get into your brain charley said i mean theyre nanoparticles they can get inhaled cross the bloodbrain barrier and go into the brain bobby pushed a plate of pasta in front of charley he immediately ground pepper all over it dont you want to taste it no offense but im sure it needs it he started to eat i mean he continued thats what everybodys worried about nanotechnology polluting the environment right nanoparticles are small enough to get places nobodys ever had to worry about before they can get into the synapses between neurons they can get into the cytoplasm of cardiac cells they can get into cell nuclei theyre small enough to go anywhere inside the body so maybe were infected jack you dont seem that worried about it ricky said hey what can i do about it now hope i give it to you is about all hey this spaghettis not bad ravioli bobby said whatever just needs a little pepper he ground some more over the top sundown is seventwentyseven bobby said reading the time off the monitor he went back to eating and it does not need pepper fucking does i already put in pepper needs more i said guys are we missing anybody i dont think so why i pointed to the monitor whos that standing out in the desert day pm oh shit bobby said he jumped up from the table and ran out of the room everyone else did too i followed the others ricky was holding his radio as he went vince lock us down vince were locked down vince said pressure is five plus why didnt the alarm go off cant say maybe theyve learned to get past that too i followed everybody into the utility room where there were large wallmounted liquid crystal displays showing the outside video cameras views of the desert from all angles the sun was already below the horizon but the sky was a bright orange fading into purple and then dark blue silhouetted against this sky was a young man with short hair he was wearing jeans and a white tshirt and looked like a surfer i couldnt see his face clearly in the failing light but even so watching the way he moved i thought there was something familiar about him we got any floodlights out there charley said he was walking around holding his bowl of pasta still eating lights coming up bobby said and a moment later the young man stood in glaring light now i could see him clearlyand then it hit me it looked like the same kid who had been in julias car last night after dinner when she drove away just before her accident the same blond surfer kid who now that i saw him again looked likejesus ricky bobby said he looks like you youre right mae said its ricky even the tshirt ricky was getting a soft drink out of the dispensing machine he turned toward the display screen whatre you guys talking about he looks like you mae said he even has your tshirt with i am root on the front ricky looked at his own tshirt then back at the screen he was silent for a moment ill be damned i said youve never been out of the building ricky how come its you fucking beats me ricky said he shrugged casually too casually mae said i cant make out the face very well i mean the features charley moved closer to the largest of the screens and squinted at the image the reason you cant see features he said is because there arent any oh come on charley its a resolution artifact thats all its not charley said therere no fucking features zoom it in and see for yourself bobby zoomed the image of the blond head enlarged the figure was moving back and forth in and out of the frame but it was immediately clear that charley was right there were no features there was an oval patch of pale skin beneath the blond hairline and there was the suggestion of a nose and brow ridges and a sort of mound where the lips should be but there were no actual features it was as if a sculptor had started to carve a face and had stopped before he was finished it was an unfinished face except that the eyebrows moved from time to time a sort of wiggle or flutter or perhaps that was an artifact you know what were looking at here dont you charley said he sounded worried pan down lets see the rest of him bobby panned down and we saw white sneakers moving over the desert dirt except the sneakers didnt seem to be touching the ground but rather hovering just above it and the sneakers themselves were sort of blurry there was a hint of shoelaces and a streak where a nike logo would be but it was like a sketch rather than an actual sneaker this is very weird mae said not weird at all charley said its a calculated approximation for density the swarm doesnt have enough agents to make highresolution shoes so its approximating or else i said its the best it can do with the materials at hand it must be generating all these colors by tilting its photovoltaic surface at slight angles catching the light its like those flash cards the crowd holds up in football stadiums to make a picture in which case charley said its behavior is quite sophisticated more sophisticated than what we saw earlier i said oh for christs sake ricky said irritably youre acting like this swarm is einstein obviously not charley said cause if its modeling you its certainly no einstein give it a rest charley i would ricky but youre such an asshole i get provoked over and over bobby said why dont you both give it a rest mae turned to me and said why is the swarm doing this imitating the prey basically yes i said i hate to think of us as prey ricky said mae said you mean its been coded to literally physically imitate the prey no i said the program instruction is more generalized than that it simply directs the agents to attain the goal so we are seeing one possible emergent solution which is more advanced than the previous version before it had trouble making a stable d image now its modeling in three dimensions i glanced at the programmers they had stricken looks on their faces they knew exactly how big an advance they were witnessing the transition to three dimensions meant that not only was the swarm now imitating our external appearance it was also imitating our behavior our walks our gestures which implied a far more complicated internal model mae said and the swarm decided this on its own yes i said although im not sure decided is the right term the emergent behavior is the sum of individual agent behaviors there isnt anybody there to decide anything theres no brain no higher control in that swarm group mind mae said hive mind in a way i said the point is there is no central control but it looks so controlled she said it looks like a defined purposeful organism yeah well so do we charley said with a harsh laugh nobody else laughed with him if you want to think of it that way a human being is actually a giant swarm or more precisely its a swarm of swarms because each organblood liver kidneysis a separate swarm what we refer to as a body is really the combination of all these organ swarms we think our bodies are solid but thats only because we cant see what is going on at the cellular level if you could enlarge the human body blow it up to a vast size you would see that it was literally nothing but a swirling mass of cells and atoms clustered together into smaller swirls of cells and atoms who cares well it turns out a lot of processing occurs at the level of the organs human behavior is determined in many places the control of our behavior is not located in our brains its all over our bodies so you could argue that swarm intelligence rules human beings too balance is controlled by the cerebellar swarm and rarely comes to consciousness other processing occurs in the spinal cord the stomach the intestine a lot of vision takes place in the eyeballs long before the brain is involved and for that matter a lot of sophisticated brain processing occurs beneath awareness too an easy proof is object avoidance a mobile robot has to devote a tremendous amount of processing time simply to avoid obstacles in the environment human beings do too but theyre never aware of ituntil the lights go out then they learn painfully just how much processing is really required so theres an argument that the whole structure of consciousness and the human sense of selfcontrol and purposefulness is a user illusion we dont have conscious control over ourselves at all we just think we do just because human beings went around thinking of themselves as i didnt mean that it was true and for all we knew this damned swarm had some sort of rudimentary sense of itself as an entity or if it didnt it might very soon start to watching the faceless man on the monitor we saw that the image was now becoming unstable the swarm had trouble keeping the appearance solid instead it fluctuated at moments the face and shoulders seemed to dissolve into dust then reemerge as solid again it was strange to watch it losing its grip bobby said no i think its getting tired charley said you mean its running out of power yeah probably itd take a lot of extra juice to tilt all those particles into exact orientations indeed the swarm was reverting back to a cloud appearance again so this is a lowpower mode i said yeah im sure they were optimized for power management or they are now i said it was getting darker quickly now the orange was gone from the sky the monitor was starting to lose definition the swarm turned and swirled away ill be goddamned charley said i watched the swarm disappear into the horizon three hours i said and theyre history day pm charley went back to bed right after dinner he was still asleep at ten that night when mae and i were preparing to go out again we were wearing down vests and jackets because it was going to be cold we needed a third person to go with us ricky said he had to wait for julia who was flying in any minute now that was fine with me i didnt want him anyway vince was off somewhere watching tv and drinking beer that left bobby bobby didnt want to go but mae shamed him into coming there was a question about how the three of us would get around since it was possible the swarm hiding place might be some distance away perhaps even several miles we still had davids dirt bike but that could only sit two it turned out vince had an atv in the shed i went to see him in the power unit to ask him for the key dont need a key he said he was sitting on a couch watching who wants to be a millionaire i heard regis say final answer i said what do you mean keys in it vince said always there wait a minute i said you mean there was a vehicle in the shed with keys in it all the time sure on the tv i heard for four thousand dollars what is the name of the smallest state in europe why didnt anybody tell me i said starting to get mad vince shrugged couldnt say nobody asked me i stalked back to the main unit where the hell is ricky hes on the phone bobby said talking to the brass back in the valley mae said take it easy im taking it easy i said which phone in the main unit jack she put her hands on my shoulders stopped me its after ten oclock forget it forget it he could have gotten us killed and right now we have work to do i looked at her calm face her steady expression i thought of the swift way she had eviscerated the rabbit youre right i said good she said turning away now i think as soon as we get some backpacks well be ready to go there was a reason i thought why mae never lost an argument i went to the storage cupboard and got out three packs i threw one to bobby lets hit the road i said it was a clear night filled with stars we walked in darkness toward the storage shed a dark outline against the dark sky i pushed the dirt bike along none of us talked for a while finally bobby said were going to need lights were going to need a lot of things mae said i made a list we came to the storage shed and pushed open the door i saw bobby hang back in the darkness i went in and fumbled for the lights i flicked them on the interior of the storage shed appeared just as we had left it mae unzipped her backpack and began walking down the row of shelves we need portable lights ignition fuses flares oxygen bobby said oxygen really if this site is underground yes we may and we need thermite i said rosie had it maybe she set it down when she ill look i went into the next room the box of thermite tubes lay overturned on the floor the tubes nearby rosie must have dropped it when she ran i wondered if she had had any in her hand i looked over at her body by the door rosies body was gone jesus bobby came running in what is it whats wrong i pointed to the door rosies gone what do you mean gone i looked at him gone bobby the body was here before and now its gone how can that be an animal i dont know i went over and crouched down at the spot where her body had been when i had last seen her five or six hours ago her body had been covered with a milky secretion some of that secretion covered the floor too it looked exactly like thick dried milk up where her head had been the secretion was smooth and undisturbed but closer to the door it appeared to have been scraped there were streaks in the coating it looks like she was dragged out bobby said yes i peered closely at the secretion looking for footprints a coyote alone couldnt have dragged her a pack of animals would be needed to pull her out the door they would surely leave marks i saw none i got up and walked to the door bobby stood beside me looking out into the darkness you see anything he said no i returned to mae she had found everything she had coiled magnesium fuse she had flare guns she had portable halogen flashlights she had headmounted lamps with big elastic bands she had small binoculars and nightvision goggles she had a field radio and she had oxygen bottles and clearplastic gas masks i was uneasy when i recognized that these were the same plastic masks i had seen on the men in the ssvt van back in california last night except they werent silvered and then i thought was it only last night it was hardly twentyfour hours had passed it felt to me like a month mae was dividing everything into the three backpacks watching her i realized that she was the only one of us with actual field experience in comparison we were all stayathomes theoreticians i was surprised how dependent on her i felt tonight bobby hefted the nearest pack and grunted you really think we need all this stuff mae its not like you have to carry it were driving and yes better safe than sorry okay fine but i meana field radio you never know who you gonna call the thing is bobby she said if it turns out you need any of this stuff you really need it yeah but its mae picked up the second backpack and slung it over her shoulder she handled the weight easily she looked at bobby you were saying never mind i picked up the third backpack it wasnt bad bobby was complaining because he was scared it was true that the oxygen bottle was a little larger and heavier than i would have liked and it fitted awkwardly into the backpack but mae insisted we have extra oxygen bobby said nervously extra oxygen how big do you guys think this hiding place is i have no idea mae said but the most recent swarms are much larger she went to the sink and picked up the radiation counter but when she unplugged it from the wall she saw the battery was dead we had to hunt for a new battery unscrew the case replace the battery i was worried the replacement would be dead too if it was we were finished mae said we better be careful with the nightvision goggles too i dont know how good any of the batteries are for the stuff we have but the counter clicked loudly the battery indicator glowed full power she said itll last four hours lets get started i said it was pm the radiation counter went crazy when we came to the toyota clicking so rapidly the sound was continuous holding the wand in front of her mae left the car walked into the desert she turned west and the clicks diminished she went east and they picked up again but as she continued east the clicks slowed she turned north and they increased north she said i got on the bike gunned the engine bobby rumbled out of the shed on the allterrain vehicle with its fat rear tires and bicycle handlebars the atv looked ungainly but i knew it was probably better suited to night travel in the desert mae got on the back of my bike leaned over to hold the wand near the ground and said okay lets go we started off into the desert under a cloudless night sky the headlight on the bike bounced up and down jerking the shadows on the terrain ahead making it difficult to see what was coming the desert that had looked so flat and featureless in daylight was now revealed to have sandy dips rockfilled beds and deep arroyos that came up without warning it took all my attention to keep the bike uprightparticularly since mae was continuously calling to me go left now right now right okay too much left sometimes we had to make a full circle until she could be certain of the right path if anybody followed our track in daylight theyd think the driver must be drunk it twisted and turned so much the bike jumped and swerved on rough ground we were now several miles from the lab and i was starting to worry i could hear the counter clicks and they were becoming less frequent it was getting hard to distinguish the swarm trail from the background radiation i didnt understand why that should happen but there was no question it was if we didnt locate the swarm hiding place soon wed lose the trail entirely mae was worried too she kept bending over closer and closer to the ground with one hand on the wand and one hand around my waist and i had to go slower because the trail was becoming so faint we lost the trail found it went off it again under the black canopy of stars we backtracked turned in circles i caught myself holding my breath and at last i was going around and around in the same spot trying not to feel desperate i made the circle three times then four but to no avail the counter in maes hand just clicked randomly and suddenly it was clear to us that the trail was truly lost we were out here in the middle of nowhere driving in circles we had lost the trail exhaustion hit me suddenly and hard i had been running on adrenaline all day and now that i was finally defeated a deep weariness came over my body my eyes drooped i felt as if i could go to sleep standing on the bike behind me mae sat up and said dont worry okay what do you mean i said wearily my plan has totally failed mae maybe not yet she said bobby pulled up close to us you guys look behind you he said why look back he said look how far weve come i turned and looked over my shoulder to the south i saw the bright lights of the fabrication building surprisingly close we couldnt be more than a mile or two away we must have traveled in a big semicircle eventually turning back toward our starting point thats weird mae had got off the bike and stepped in front of the headlamp she was looking at the lcd readout on the counter she said hmmm bobby said hopefully so what do you say mae time to go back no mae said its not time to go back take a look at this bobby leaned over and we both looked at the lcd readout it showed a graph of radiation intensity stepping progressively downward and finally dropping quickly bobby frowned and this is time course of tonights readings she said the machines showing us that ever since we started the intensity of the radiation has declined arithmeticallyits a straightline decrease a staircase see there and its stayed arithmetic until the last minute or so when the decrease suddenly became exponential it just fell to zero so bobby looked puzzled that means what i dont get it i do she turned to me climbed back on the bike i think i know what happened go forwardslowly i let out the clutch and rumbled forward my bouncing headlight showed a slight rise in the desert scrubby cactus ahead no slower jack i slowed now we were practically going at a walk i yawned there was no point in questioning her she was intense focused i was just tired and defeated we continued up the desert rise until it flattened and then the bike began to tilt downwardstop i stopped directly ahead the desert floor abruptly ended i saw blackness beyond is that a cliff no just a high ridge i edged the bike forward the land definitely fell away soon we were at the edge and i could get my bearings we were at the crest of a ridge fifteen feet high which formed one side of a very wide streambed directly beneath me i saw smooth river rocks with occasional boulders and clumps of scraggly brush that stretched about fifty yards away to the far side of the riverbed beyond the distant bank the desert was flat again i understand now i said the swarm jumped yes she said it became airborne and we lost the trail but then it must have landed somewhere down there bobby said pointing to the streambed maybe i said and maybe not i was thinking it would take us many minutes to find a safe route down then we would spend a long time searching among the bushes and rocks of the streambed before picking up the trail again it might take hours we might not find it at all from our position up here on top of the ridge we saw the daunting expanse of desert stretching out before us i said the swarm could have touched down in the streambed or it could have come down just beyond the bed or it could have gone quarter mile beyond mae was not discouraged bobby you stay here she said youll mark the position where it jumped jack and i will find a path down go out into that plain and run in a straight line eastwest until we pick up the trail again sooner or later well find it okay bobby said got you okay i said we might as well do it we had nothing to lose but i had very little confidence we would succeed bobby leaned forward over his atv whats that what an animal i saw glowing eyes where in that brush over there he pointed to the center of the streambed i frowned we both had our headlights trained down the ridge we were lighting a fairly large arc of desert i didnt see any animals there mae said i dont see anything she pointed it just went behind that juniper bush see the bush that looks like a pyramid that has the dead branches on one side i see it i said but i didnt see an animal its moving left to right wait a minute and itll come out again we waited and then i saw a pair of bright green glowing spots close to the ground moving right i saw a flash of pale white and almost immediately i knew that something was wrong so did bobby he twisted his handlebars moving his headlamp to point directly to the spot he reached for binoculars thats not an animal he said moving among the low bushes we saw more whiteflesh white but we saw only glimpses and then i saw a flat white surface that i realized with a shock was a human hand dragging along the ground a hand with outstretched fingers jesus bobby said staring through the binoculars what what is it its a body being dragged he said and then in a funny voice he said its rosie day pm gunning the bike i took off with mae running along the edge of the ridge until it sloped down toward the streambed floor bobby stayed where he was watching rosies body in a few minutes i had crossed the streambed to the other bank and was moving back toward his light on the hill mae said lets slow down jack so i slowed down leaning forward over my handlebars trying to see the ground far ahead suddenly the radiation counter began to chatter again good sign i said we moved ahead now we were directly across from bobby on the ridge above his headlamp cast a faint light on the ground all around us sort of like moonlight i waved for him to come down he turned his vehicle and headed west without his light the ground was suddenly darker more mysterious and then we saw rosie castro rosie lay on her back her head tilted so she appeared to be looking backward directly at me her eyes wide her arm outstretched toward me her pale hand open there was an expression of pleadingor terroron her face rigor mortis had set in and her body jerked stiffly as it moved over low shrubs and desert cactus she was being dragged awaybut no animal was dragging her i think you should turn your light off mae said but i dont see whats doing it theres like a shadow underneath her thats not a shadow mae said its them theyre dragging her she nodded turn your light off i flicked off the headlamp we stood in darkness i said i thought swarms couldnt maintain power more than three hours thats what ricky said hes lying again or theyve overcome that limitation in the wild the implications were unsettling if the swarms could now sustain power through the night then they might be active when we reached their hiding place i was counting on finding them collapsed the particles spread on the ground i intended to kill them in their sleep so to speak now it seemed they werent sleeping we stood there in the cool dark air thinking things over finally mae said arent these swarms modeled on insect behavior not really i said the programming model was predatorprey but because the swarm is a population of interacting particles to some degree it will behave like any population of interacting particles such as insects why insects can execute plans that take longer than the lifespan of a single generation they can build nests that require many generations isnt that true i think so so maybe one swarm carried the body for a while and then another took over maybe there have been three or four swarms so far that way none of them has to go three hours at night i didnt like the implications of that idea any better that would mean the swarms are working together i said it would mean theyre coordinated they clearly are by now except thats not possible i said to her because they dont have the signaling capability it wasnt possible a few generations ago mae said now it is remember the v formation that came toward you they were coordinated that was true i just hadnt realized it at the time standing there in the desert night i wondered what else i hadnt realized i squinted into the darkness trying to see ahead where are they taking her i said mae unzipped my backpack and pulled out a set of night goggles try these i was about to help her get hers but shed deftly taken her pack off opened it and pulled out her own goggles her movements were quick sure i slipped on the headset adjusted the strap and flipped the lenses down over my eyes these were the new gen goggles that showed images in muted color almost immediately i saw rosie in the desert her body was disappearing behind the scrub as she moved farther and farther away okay so where are they taking her i said again even as i spoke i raised the goggles higher and at once i saw where they were taking her from a distance it looked like a natural formationa mound of dark earth about fifteen feet wide and six feet high erosion had carved deep vertical clefts so that the mound looked a little like a huge gear turned on edge it would be easy to overlook this formation as natural but it wasnt natural and erosion hadnt produced its sculpted look on the contrary i was seeing an artificial construction similar to the nests made by african termites and other social insects wearing the second pair of goggles mae looked for a while in silence then said are you going to tell me that is the product of selforganized behavior that the behavior to make it just emerged all by itself actually yes i said thats exactly what happened hard to believe i know mae was a good biologist but she was a primate biologist she was accustomed to studying small populations of highly intelligent animals that had dominance hierarchies and group leaders she understood complex behavior to be the result of complex intelligence and she had trouble grasping the sheer power of selforganized behavior within a very large population of dumb animals in any case this was a deep human prejudice human beings expected to find a central command in any organization states had governments corporations had ceos schools had principals armies had generals human beings tended to believe that without central command chaos would overwhelm the organization and nothing significant could be accomplished from this standpoint it was difficult to believe that extremely stupid creatures with brains smaller than pinheads were capable of construction projects more complicated than any human project but in fact they were african termites were a classic example these insects made earthen castlelike mounds a hundred feet in diameter and thrusting spires twenty feet into the air to appreciate their accomplishment you had to imagine that if termites were the size of people these mounds would be skyscrapers one mile high and five miles in diameter and like a skyscraper the termite mound had an intricate internal architecture to provide fresh air remove excess co and heat and so on inside the structure were gardens to grow food residences for royalty and living space for as many as two million termites no two mounds were exactly the same each was individually constructed to suit the requirements and advantages of a particular site all this was accomplished with no architect no foreman no central authority nor was a blueprint for construction encoded in the termite genes instead these huge creations were the result of relatively simple rules that the individual termites followed in relation to one another rules like if you smell that another termite has been here put a dirt pellet on this spot yet the outcome was arguably more complex than any human creation now we were seeing a new construction made by a new creature and it was again difficult to conceive how it might have been made how could a swarm make a mound anyway but i was beginning to realize that out here in the desert asking how something happened was a fools errand the swarms were changing fast almost minute to minute the natural human impulse to figure it out was a waste of time by the time you figured it out things would have changed bobby rumbled up in his atv and cut his light we all stood there under the stars bobby said what do we do now follow rosie i said looks like rosie is going into that mound he said you mean we follow her there yes i said at maes suggestion we walked the rest of the way lugging our backpacks it took us the better part of ten minutes to reach the vicinity of the mound we paused about fifty feet away there was a nauseating smell in the air a putrid odor of rotting and decay it was so strong it made my stomach turn then too a faint green glow seemed to be emanating from inside the mound bobby whispered you really want to go in there not yet mae whispered she pointed off to one side rosies body was moving up the slope of the mound as she came to the rim her rigid legs pointed into the air for a moment then her body toppled over and she fell into the interior but she stopped before she disappeared entirely for several seconds her head remained above the rim her arm outstretched as if she were reaching for air then slowly she slid the rest of the way down and vanished bobby shivered mae whispered okay lets go she started forward in her usual noiseless way following her i tried to be as quiet as i could bobby crunched and crackled his way along the ground mae paused and gave him a hard look bobby held up his hands as if to say what can i do she whispered watch where you put your feet he whispered i am youre not its dark i cant see you can if you try i couldnt recall ever seeing mae show irritation before but we were all under pressure now and the stench was terrible mae turned and once again moved forward silently bobby followed making just as much noise as before we had only gone a few steps before mae turned held up her hand and signaled for him to stay where he was he shook his head no he clearly didnt want to be left alone she gripped his shoulder pointed firmly to the ground and whispered you stay here no she whispered youll get us all killed he whispered i promise she shook her head pointed to the ground sit finally bobby sat down mae looked at me i nodded we set out again by now we were twenty feet from the mound itself the smell was almost overpowering my stomach churned i was afraid i might be sick and this close we began to hear the deep thrumming sound more than anything it was that sound that made me want to run away but mae kept going we crouched down as we climbed the mound and then lay flat along the rim i could see maes face in the green glow coming from inside for some reason the stench didnt bother me anymore probably because i was too frightened mae reached into the side pouch of her pack and withdrew a small thumbsized camera on a thin telescoping stick she brought out a tiny lcd screen and set it on the ground between us then she slid the stick over the rim on the screen we saw a green interior of smooth undulating walls nothing seemed to be moving she turned the camera this way and that all we saw were green walls there was no sign of rosie mae looked at me pointed to her eyes want to take a look now i nodded we inched forward slowly until we could look over the rim it wasnt what i expected at all the mound simply narrowed an existing opening that was hugetwenty feet wide or more revealing a rock slide that sloped downward from the rim and ended at a gaping hole in the rock to our right the green light was coming from somewhere inside this gaping hole what i was seeing was the entrance to a very large cave from our position on the rim we couldnt see into the cave itself but the thrumming sound suggested activity within mae opened the telescoping stick to its full length and gently lowered the camera into the hole soon we could see farther into the cave it was undoubtedly natural and large perhaps eight feet high ten feet wide the rock walls were pale white and appeared to be covered with the milky substance wed seen on rosie and rosies body was only a short distance inside we could see her hand sticking out around a bend in the rock wall but we could see nothing beyond the bend mae signaled me want to go down i nodded slowly i didnt like how this felt i didnt like that i had no idea what was beyond the bend but we really had no choice she pointed back toward bobby get him i shook my head no he wouldnt help us here she nodded and started very slowly to slide out of her backpack making no sound at all when she suddenly froze literally froze she didnt move a muscle i looked at the screen and i froze too a figure had walked from behind the bend and now stood alertly at the entrance of the cave looking around it was ricky he was behaving as if he had heard a sound or had been alerted for some other reason the video camera still dangled down the rim of the mound it was pretty small i didnt know if he would see it i watched the screen tensely the camera didnt have good resolution and the screen was the size of my palm but it was still clear that the figure was ricky i didnt understand what he was doing hereor even how he had gotten here then another man came around the bend he was also ricky i glanced at mae but she remained utterly still a statue only her eyes moved i squinted at the screen within the limits of video resolution the two figures appeared to be identical in every respect same clothes same movements same gestures and shrugs i couldnt see the faces well but i had the impression they were more detailed than before they didnt seem to notice the camera they looked up at the sky and then at the rock slide for a while and then they turned their backs on us and returned to the interior of the cave still mae did not move she had been motionless for almost a minute already and in that time she hadnt even blinked now the men were gone andanother figure came around the corner it was david brooks he moved awkwardly stiffly at first but he quickly became more fluid i had the feeling i was watching a puppeteer perfect his moves animating the figure in a more lifelike way then david became ricky and then david again and the david figure turned and went away still mae waited she waited fully two more minutes and then finally withdrew the camera she jerked her thumb indicating we should go back together we crept away from the rim back down the mound and moved away silently into the desert night we gathered a hundred yards to the west near our vehicles mae was rummaging in her backpack she pulled out a clipboard with a felt marker she flicked on her penlight and began to draw this is what youre up against she said the cave has an opening like this which you saw past the bend theres a big hole in the floor and the cave spirals downward for maybe a hundred yards that brings you into one large chamber that is maybe a hundred feet high and a couple of hundred feet wide single big room thats all there are no passages leading off at least none that i saw that you saw ive been in there she said nodding when a couple of weeks ago back when we first started looking for the swarms hiding place i found that cave and went in there in daylight i didnt find any indication of a swarm then she explained that the cave was filled with bats the whole ceiling covered with them packed together in a pink squirming mass all the way out to the entrance ugh bobby said i hate bats i didnt see any bats there tonight you think theyve been driven away eaten probably jesus guys bobby said shaking his head im just a programmer i dont think i can do this i dont think i can go in there mae ignored him she said to me if we go in she said well have to set off thermite and keep doing it all the way down to the chamber im not sure we have enough thermite to do that maybe not i said i had a different concern were wasting our time unless we destroy all the swarms and all the assemblers that are making them right they both nodded im not sure thatll be possible i said i thought the swarms would be powered down at night i thought we could destroy them on the ground but theyre not powered downat least not all of them and if just one of them gets past us if it escapes from the cave i shrugged then this has all been a waste of time right bobby said nodding thats right itd be a waste of time mae said we need some way to trap them in the cave there isnt any way bobby said i mean they can just fly out whenever they want mae said there might be a way she started rummaging in her backpack again looking for something meanwhile the three of us better spread out why bobby said alarmed just do it mae said now get moving i tightened my backpack and adjusted the straps so it wouldnt rattle i locked the nightvision goggles up on my forehead and i started forward i had gotten about halfway to the mound when i saw a dark figure climb out into the night i dropped down as quietly as i could i was in a thick patch of sagebrush three feet high so i was reasonably well concealed i looked over my shoulder but i didnt see either mae or bobby theyd dropped to the ground too i didnt know if theyd separated yet cautiously i pushed aside a plant in front of me and looked toward the mound the legs of the figure were silhouetted against the faint green glow the upper body was black against the night stars i flipped down the goggles and waited a moment while they flared blue and then saw the image resolve this time it was rosie walking around in the night looking in all directions her body vigilant and alert except that she didnt move like rosie she moved more like a man then after a moment the silhouette changed into ricky and it moved like ricky the figure crouched down and appeared to be looking over the tops of the sage i wondered what had brought it out of the mound i didnt have to wait long to find out behind the figure a white light appeared on the western horizon it grew rapidly in brilliance and soon i heard the thumping of helicopter blades that would be julia coming from the valley i thought i wondered what was so urgent that she had had to leave the hospital against orders and fly out here in the middle of the night as the helicopter approached it switched on its searchlight i watched the circle of bluewhite light as it rippled over the ground toward us the ricky figure watched too then slid down out of sight and then the helicopter roared over me blinding me for a moment in the halogen light almost immediately it banked sharply and circled back what the hell was going on the helicopter made a slow arc passing over the mound but not stopping then coming to a stop right above where i was hiding i was caught in the blue glow i rolled onto my back and waved to the helicopter pointing repeatedly toward the lab i mouthed go and pointed away the helicopter descended and for a moment i thought it was going to land right beside me then it abruptly banked again and moved away low to the ground heading south toward the concrete pad the sound faded i decided i had better change my position fast i got to my knees and in a crouch moved crabwise thirty yards to the left then i dropped down again when i looked back at the mound i saw threeno four figures coming out of the interior they moved apart each heading to a different area of the mound they all looked like ricky i watched as they went down the slope of the mound and moved out into the bush my heart began to pound in my chest one of the figures was coming in my direction as it approached i saw it veer off to the right it was going to the place where i had been before when it reached my last hiding place it stopped and turned in all directions it was not far from me at all i could see through the goggles that this new ricky figure now had a complete face and the clothing was much more detailed in addition this figure moved with the sensation of real body weight it might be an illusion of course but i guessed that the swarm had increased mass and now weighed fifty pounds maybe more maybe twice that if so then the swarm now had enough mass to jolt you with a physical impact even knock you off your feet through the goggles i saw the figures eyes move and blink the surface of the face now had the texture of skin the hair appeared to be composed of individual strands the lips moved the tongue licked nervously all in all this face looked very much like rickydisturbingly like ricky when the head turned in my direction i felt that ricky was staring right at me and i suppose it was because the figure began to move directly toward me i was trapped my heart was thumping in my chest i hadnt planned for this i had no protection no sort of defense i could get up and run of course but there was nowhere to go i was surrounded by miles of desert and the swarms would hunt me down in a few moments i would bewith a roar the helicopter came back the ricky figure looked toward it as it came and then turned and fled literally flying over the ground not bothering any longer to animate the legs and feet it was creepy to see this human replica suddenly floating over the desert but the other three ricky figures were running too running hard conveying a distinct sense of panic did the swarms fear the helicopter it seemed they did and as i watched i understood why even though the swarms were now heavier and more substantial they were still vulnerable to strong winds the helicopter was a hundred feet in the air but the downdraft was powerful enough to deform the running figures flattening them partially as they fled it was as if they were being hammered down the figures vanished into the mound i looked back at mae she was standing up in the streambed now talking on her radio to the helicopter shed needed that radio all right she yelled to me lets go and began running toward me i was dimly aware of bobby running away from the mound back to his atv but there was no time to worry about him the helicopter hung poised right above the mound itself dust whipped up stinging my eyes then mae was beside me removing our goggles we pulled on our oxygen masks she turned me twisted the tank valve behind me i did the same for her then we put the night goggles back on it seemed like a lot of contraptions jiggling and rattling around my face she clipped a halogen flashlight to my belt and another to her own she leaned close shouted ready im ready okay lets go there was no time to think it was better that way the helicopter downdraft roared in my ears together we clawed our way up the slope of the mound our clothes whipping around us we arrived at the edge barely visible in the thick swirling dust we couldnt see anything beyond the rim we couldnt see what was below mae took my hand and we jumped day pm i landed on loose stones and half stumbled half slid down the slope toward the cave entrance the thumping of the helicopter blades above us was loud mae was right beside me but i could hardly see her in the thick dust there were no ricky figures anywhere in sight we came to the cave entrance and stopped mae pulled out the thermite capsules she gave me the magnesium fuses she tossed me a plastic cigarette lighter i thought thats what were using her face was already partly clouded behind the mask her eyes were hidden behind the nightvision goggles she pointed to the interior of the cave i nodded she tapped me on the shoulder pointed to my goggles i didnt understand so she reached forward by my cheek and flicked a switch me now she said yes i hear okay then lets go we started into the cave the green glow had vanished in the thick dust we had only the infrared light mounted on top of our nightvision goggles we saw no figures we heard nothing but the thumping of the helicopter but as we went deeper into the cave the sound began to fade and as the sound faded so did the wind mae was focused she said bobby do you hear me yes i hear you get your ass in here im trying to dont try get in here bobby i shook my head if i knew bobby lembeck he was never coming into this pit we rounded the bend and saw nothing but suspended dust the vague outlines of cave walls the walls seemed smooth here with no place to hide then from the gloom directly ahead i saw a ricky figure emerge he was expressionless just walking toward us then another figure from the left and another the three formed a line they marched toward us at a steady pace their faces identical and expressionless first lesson mae said holding out the thermite cap lets hope they dont learn it i said and i lit the fuse it sputtered whitehot sparks she tossed the cap forward it landed a few feet in front of the advancing group they ignored it staring forward at us mae said its a three count two one and turn away i twisted away ducking my head under my arm just as a sphere of blinding white filled the tunnel even though my eyes were closed the glare was so strong that i saw spots when i opened my eyes again i turned back mae was already moving forward the dust in the air had a slightly darker tint i saw no sign of the three figures did they run no vaporized she said she sounded pleased new situations i said i was feeling encouraged if the programming assumptions still held the swarms would be weak when reacting to genuinely new situations in time they would learn in time they would evolve strategies to deal with the new conditions but initially their response would be disorganized chaotic that was a weakness of distributed intelligence it was powerful and it was flexible but it was slow to respond to unprecedented events we hope mae said we came to the gaping hole in the cave floor she had described in the night goggles i saw a sort of sloping ramp four or five figures were coming up toward us and there seemed to be more behind they all looked like ricky but many of them were not so well formed and those in the rear were just swirling clouds the thrumming sound was loud second lesson mae held out a cap it sizzled white when i lit it she rolled it gently down the ramp the figures hesitated when they saw it damn i said but then it was time to duck away and shield my eyes from the explosive flash inside the confined space there was a roar of expanding gas i felt a burst of intense heat on my back when i looked again most of the swarms beneath us had vanished but a few hung back apparently undamaged they were learning fast next lesson mae said holding two caps this time i lit both and she rolled one and threw the second one deeper down the ramp the explosions roared simultaneously and a huge gust of hot air rolled upward past us my shirt caught fire mae pounded it out with the flat of her hand smacking me with rapid strokes when we looked again there were no figures in sight and no dark swarms we went down the ramp heading deeper into the cave we had started with twenty thermite caps we had sixteen left and we had gone only a short distance down the ramp toward the large room at the bottom mae moved quickly nowi had to hurry to catch up with herbut her instincts were good the few swarms that materialized before us all quickly backed away at our approach we were herding them into the lower room mae said bobby where are you the headset crackled tryingget bobby come on damn it but all the while we were moving deeper into the cave and soon we heard only static down here dust hung suspended in the air diffusing the infrared beams we could see clearly the walls and ground directly ahead of us but beyond that there was total blackness the sense of darkness and isolation was frightening i couldnt tell what was on either side of me unless i turned my head sweeping my beam back and forth i began to smell that rotten odor again sharp and nauseating we were coming to level ground mae stayed calm when a halfdozen swarms buzzed before us she held out another cap for me to light before i could light the fuse the swarms backed off she advanced at once sort of like lion taming she said so far i said i didnt know how long we could keep this up the cave was large much larger than i had imagined sixteen caps didnt seem like enough to get us through it i wondered if mae was worried too she didnt seem to be but probably she wouldnt show it something was crunching underfoot i looked down and saw the floor was carpeted with thousands of tiny delicate yellow bones like bird bones except these were the bones of bats mae was right theyd all been eaten in the upper corner of my nightvision image a red light began to blink it was some kind of warning probably the battery mae i began then the red light went out as abruptly as it had begun what she said what is it never mind and then at last we came to the large central chamberexcept there was no central chamber at least not anymore now the huge space was filled from floor to ceiling with an array of dark spheres about two feet in diameter and bristling with spiky protrusions they looked like enormous sea urchins they were stacked in large clusters the arrangement was orderly mae said is this what i think it is her voice was calm detached almost scholarly yeah i think so i said unless i was wrong these spiked clusters were an organic version of the fabrication plant that xymos had built on the surface this is how they reproduce i moved forward i dont know if we should go in she said we have to mae look at it its ordered you think theres a center maybe and if there was i wanted to drop thermite on it i continued onward moving among the clusters was an eerie sensation thick mucuslike liquid dripped from the tips of the spikes and the spheres seemed to be coated with a kind of thick gel that quivered making the whole cluster seem to be moving alive i paused to look more closely then i saw that the surface of the spheres really was alive crawling within the gel were masses of twisting black worms jesus they were here before she said calmly what the worms they were living in the layer of guano on the cave floor when i came here before they eat organic material and excrete highcontent phosphorus compounds and now theyre involved in swarm synthesis i said that didnt take long just a few days coevolution in action the spheres probably provide food and collect their excretions in some way or collect them mae said dryly yeah maybe it wasnt inconceivable ants raised aphids the way we raised cows other insects grew fungus in gardens for food we moved deeper into the room the swarms swirled on all sides of us but they kept their distance probably another unprecedented event i thought intruders in the nest they hadnt decided what to do i moved carefully the floor was now increasingly slippery in spots there was a kind of thick muck on the ground in a few places it glowed streaky green the streaks seemed to go inward toward the center i had the sense that the floor sloped gently downward how much farther mae said she still sounded calm but i didnt think she was i wasnt either when i looked back i could no longer see the entrance to the chamber hidden behind the clusters and then suddenly we reached the center of the room because the clusters ended in an open space and directly ahead i saw what looked like a miniature version of the mound outside it was a mound about four feet high perfectly circular with flat vanes extending outward on all sides it too was streaked with green pale smoke was coming off the vanes we moved closer its hot she said and it was the heat was intense thats why it was smoking she said what do you think is in there i looked at the floor i could see now that the streaks of green were running from the clusters down to this central mound i said assemblers the spiky urchins generated raw organic material it flowed to the center where the assemblers churned out the final molecules this is where the final assembly occurred then this is the heart mae said yeah you could say the swarms were all around us hanging back by the clusters apparently they wouldnt come into the center but they were everywhere around us waiting for us how many you want she said quietly taking the thermite from her pack i looked around at all the swarms five here i said well need the rest to get out we cant light five at once its all right i held out my hand give them to me but jack come on mae she gave me five capsules i moved closer and tossed them unlit into the central mound the surrounding swarms buzzed but still did not approach us okay she said she understood immediately what i was doing she was already taking out more capsules now four i said looking back at the swarms they were restless moving back and forth i didnt know how long they would stay there three for you one for me you do the swarms right she gave me one capsule i lit the others for her she threw them back in the direction we had come the swarms danced away she counted three two one now we crouched ducked away from the harsh blast of light i heard a cracking sound when i looked again some of the clusters were breaking up falling apart spikes were rolling on the ground without hesitating i lit the next capsule and as it spit white sparks i tossed it into the central mound lets go we ran for the entrance the clusters were crumbling in front of us mae leapt easily over the falling spikes and kept going i followed her counting in my mind three two one now there was a kind of highpitched shriek and then a terrific blast of hot gas a booming detonation and stabbing pain in my ears the shock wave knocked me flat on the ground sent me skidding forward in the sludge i felt the spikes sticking in my skin all over my body my goggles were knocked away and i was surrounded by blackness blackness i could see nothing at all i wiped the sludge from my face i tried to get to my feet slipped and fell mae i said mae there was an explosion she said in a surprised voice mae where are you i cant see everything was pitch black i could see nothing at all i was deep in some damn cave full of spiky things and i couldnt see i fought panic its all right mae said in the darkness i felt her hand gripping my arm apparently she could see me she said the flashlights on your belt she guided my hand i fumbled in the darkness feeling for the clip i found it but i couldnt get it open it was a spring clip and my fingers kept slipping off i began to hear a thrumming sound low at first but starting to build my hands were sweating finally the clip opened and i flicked the flashlight on with a sigh of relief i saw mae in the cold halogen beam she still had her goggles and looked away i swung the beam around the cave it had been transformed by the explosion many of the clusters had broken apart and the spikes were all over the floor some substance on the floor was beginning to burn acrid foul smoke was billowing up the air was thick and dark i stepped backward and felt something squishy i looked down and saw david brookss shirt then i realized i was standing on what was left of davids torso which had turned into a kind of whitish jelly my foot was right in his abdomen his rib cage scraped against my shin leaving a white streak on my pants i looked back and saw davids face ghostly white and eroded his features eaten away until he looked as featureless as the faces on the swarms i felt instant nausea and tasted bile come on mae said grabbing my arm squeezing it hard come on jack with a sucking sound my foot pulled free of the body i tried to scrape my shoe on the floor to get clean of the white muck i was not thinking anymore i was just fighting nausea and an overpowering sense of horror i wanted to run mae was talking to me but i didnt hear her i saw only glimpses of the room around me and was only dimly aware that the swarms were emerging all around us swarm after swarm after swarm they were buzzing everywhere i need you jack mae said holding out four caps and somehow fumbling with the flashlight i managed to light them and she flung them in all directions i threw my hands over my eyes as the hot spheres exploded around me when i looked again the swarms were gone but in only a few moments they began to reemerge first one swarm then three then six then tenand then too many to count they were converging with an angry buzz toward us how many caps have we got left i said eight i knew then that we were not going to make it we were too deep in the cave we would never get out i had no idea how many swarms were around usmy halogen beam swung back and forth across what seemed like an army jack mae said holding out her hand she never seemed to lose confidence i lit three more caps and mae threw them retracing her steps toward the entrance as she did so i stayed close to her but i knew our situation was hopeless each blast scattered the swarms for just a moment then they quickly regrouped there were far too many swarms jack more thermite in her hands now i could see the entrance to the chamber just a few yards ahead my eyes were watering from all the acrid smoke my halogen light was just a narrow beam cutting through the dust the air was getting thicker and thicker a final series of whitehot blasts and we came to the entrance i saw the ramp leading back toward the surface i never thought wed get this far but i wasnt thinking anymore everything was impressions how many left i said mae didnt answer me i heard the rumble of an engine from somewhere above us looking up i saw a wobbling white light in the cave higher up the rumble became very loudi heard an engine gunnedand then i saw the atv poised on the ramp above bobby was up there shouting get outttttt mae turned and ran up the ramp and i scrambled to follow her i was vaguely aware of bobby lighting something that burst into orange flame and then mae pushed me against the wall as the riderless atv roared down the ramp toward the chamber below with a flaming cloth hanging from its gas tank it was a motorized molotov cocktail as soon as it passed mae shoved me hard in the back run i sprinted the last few yards up the ramp bobby was reaching down for us hauling us up over the lip to the level above i fell and scraped my knee but hardly felt it as he dragged me onto my feet again then i was running hard toward the cave entrance and had almost reached the opening when a fiery blast knocked us off our feet and i went tumbling through the air and smashed against one of the cave walls i got to my feet head ringing my flashlight was gone i heard a kind of strange screaming sound from somewhere behind me or thought i did i looked at mae and bobby they were getting to their feet with the helicopter still thumping above us we clambered up the incline and collapsed over the lip of the mound and tumbled down the slopes out into the cool black desert night the last thing i saw was mae waving the helicopter away gesturing for it to go go goand then the cave exploded the ground jumped beneath my feet knocking me over i fell to the ground just as the shock wave caused sharp pain in my ears i heard the deep rumble of the explosion from the mouth of the cave an enormous angry fireball billowed upward orange laced in black i felt a wave of heat rolling down toward me and then it was gone and everything was suddenly quiet and the world around me was black how long i lay there beneath the stars i am not sure i must have lost consciousness because the next thing i remember was bobby pushing me up into the backseat of the helicopter mae was already inside and she leaned over to buckle me in they were both looking at me with expressions of concern i wondered dully if i had been injured i didnt feel any pain the door slammed beside me and bobby got in the front next to the pilot we had done it we had succeeded i could hardly believe it was over the helicopter rose into the air and i saw the lights of the lab in the distance prey day am jack julia rushed toward me as i came down the corridor in the overhead light her face looked beautiful in a lean elegant way she was in truth more beautiful than i remembered her ankle was bandaged and she had a cast on her wrist she threw her arms around me and buried her head in my shoulder her hair smelled of lavender oh jack jack thank god youre all right yeah i said hoarsely im okay im so glad so glad i just stood there feeling her hug me then i hugged her back i didnt know how to react she was so energized but i was exhausted flat are you all right jack she said still hugging me yeah julia i said just above a whisper i am whats wrong with your voice she said pulling back to look at me she scanned my face whats wrong he probably burned his vocal cords mae said she was hoarse too her face was blackened with soot she had a cut on her cheek and another on her forehead julia embraced me again her fingers touched my shirt darling youre hurt just my shirt jack are you sure youre not hurt i think youre hurt no im okay i stepped away from her awkwardly i cant tell you she said how grateful i am for what you did tonight jack what all of you did she added turning to the others you mae and bobby too im only sorry i wasnt here to help i know this is all my fault but were very grateful the company is grateful i thought the company but all i said was yeah well it had to be done it did yes it certainly did quickly and decisively and you did it jack thank god ricky was standing in the background head bobbing up and down he was like one of those mechanical birds that drinks from a water glass bobbing up and down i felt unreal as if i was in a play i think we should all have a drink to celebrate julia was saying as we went down the corridor there must be some champagne around here ricky is there yes i want to celebrate what you guys have done i just want to sleep i said oh come on just one glass it was typical julia i thought involved in her own world not noticing how anyone around her was feeling the last thing any of us wanted to do right now was drink champagne thanks anyway mae said shaking her head are you sure really itd be fun how about you bobby maybe tomorrow bobby said oh well okay after all youre the conquering heroes well do it tomorrow then i noticed how fast she was talking how quick her body movements were i remembered ellens comment about her taking drugs it certainly seemed like she was on something but i was so tired i just didnt give a damn ive told the news to larry handler the head of the company she said and hes very grateful to you all thats nice i said is he going to notify the army notify the army about what about the runaway experiment well jack thats all taken care of now youve taken care of it im not sure we have i said some of the swarms might have escaped or there might be another nest out there to be safe i think we should call in the army i didnt really think we had missed anything but i wanted to get outsiders in here i was tired i wanted somebody else to take over the army julias eyes flicked to ricky then back to me jack youre absolutely right she said firmly this is an extremely serious situation if there is the slightest chance something was missed we must notify them at once i mean tonight yes i agree jack tonight in fact ill do it right now i glanced back at ricky he was walking along still nodding in that mechanical way i didnt get it what about rickys earlier panic his fear that the experiment would be made public now it seemed he didnt care julia said you three can get some sleep and ill call my contacts at the pentagon ill go with you i said its really not necessary i want to i said she glanced at me and smiled you dont trust me its not that i said but they might have questions i could answer for them okay fine good idea excellent idea i felt sure that something was wrong i felt as if i were in a play and everyone was acting a part except i didnt know what the play was i glanced over at mae she was frowning slightly she must have sensed it too we passed through the airlocks into the residential unit here the air felt uncomfortably cold to me i shivered we went into the kitchen and julia reached for the phone lets make that call jack she said i went to the refrigerator and got a ginger ale mae had an iced tea bobby had a beer we were all thirsty i noticed a bottle of champagne sitting in the fridge waiting i touched it it was cold there were six glasses in there too being chilled shed already planned the party julia pushed the speakerphone button we heard a dial tone she punched in a number but the call didnt go through the line just went dead huh she said lets try that again she dialed a second time again the call failed to go through thats funny ricky im not getting an outside line try one more time ricky said i sipped my ginger ale and watched them there was no question that this was all an act a performance for our benefit julia dutifully dialed a third time i wondered what number she was calling or did she know the number for the pentagon by heart huh she said nothing ricky picked up the phone looked at the base put it down again should be okay he said acting puzzled oh for christs sake i said let me guess something has happened and we cant dial out no no we can ricky said i was just calling a few minutes ago julia said just before you got back ricky pushed away from the table ill check the comm lines you do that i said glowering julia was staring at me jack she said im worried about you uhhuh youre angry im being fucked with i promise you she said quietly meeting my eyes youre not mae got up from the table saying she was going to take a shower bobby wandered into the lounge to play a video game his usual way to unwind soon i heard the sound of machinegun fire and the cries of dead bad guys julia and i were alone in the kitchen she leaned over the table toward me she spoke in a low earnest voice jack she said i think i owe you an explanation no i said you dont i mean for my behavior my decisions these past days it doesnt matter it does to me maybe later julia i need to tell you now you see the thing is i just wanted to save the company jack thats all the camera failed and we couldnt fix it we lost our contract and the company was falling apart ive never lost a company before i never had one shot out from underneath me and i didnt want xymos to be the first i was invested i had a stake and i guess i had my pride i wanted to save it i know i didnt use good judgment i was desperate its nobody elses fault they all wanted to stop it i pushed them to go on it was it was my crusade she shrugged and it was all for nothing the companys going to fold in a matter of days ive lost it she leaned closer but i dont want to lose you too i dont want to lose my family i dont want to lose us she dropped her voice lower and stretched her hand across the table to cover mine i want to make amends jack i want to make things right and get us back on track again she paused i hope you do too i said im not sure how i feel youre tired yes but im not sure anymore you mean about us i said i hate this fucking conversation and i did i hated that she would start this when i was exhausted when i had just gone through an ordeal that nearly got me killed and that was ultimately all her doing i hated that she dismissed her involvement as bad judgment when it was considerably worse than that oh jack lets go back to the way we were she said and suddenly she leaned the rest of the way across the table and tried to kiss me on the lips i pulled back turned my head away she stared at me eyes pleading jack please this is not the time or the place julia i said a pause she didnt know what to say finally the kids miss you im sure they do i miss them too she burst into tears and they dont miss me she sobbed they dont even care about me about their mother she reached for my hand again i let her hold it i tried to take stock of my feelings i just felt tired and very uncomfortable i wanted her to stop crying julia the intercom clicked i heard rickys voice amplified hey guys we have a problem with the comm lines you better come here right away the comm room consisted of a large closet in one corner of the maintenance room it was sealed with a heavy security door with a small tempered glass window set in the upper half through this window i could see all the wiring panels and switch racks for the telecommunications in the lab i also saw that great chunks of wiring had been yanked out and slumped in a corner of the closet i saw charley davenport he appeared to be dead his mouth hung open his eyes stared into space his skin was purplegray a black buzzing swarm swirled around his head i cant imagine how this happened ricky was saying he was fast asleep when i checked on him when was that i said maybe half an hour ago and the swarm howd it get there i cant imagine ricky said he must have carried it with him from outside how i said he went through all the airlocks i know but but what ricky hows it possible maybe i dont know maybe it was in his throat or something in his throat i said you mean just hanging out between his tonsils these things kill you you know yeah i know of course i know he shrugged beats me i stared at ricky trying to understand his demeanor he had just discovered that his lab was invaded by a lethal nanoswarm and he didnt appear to be upset at all he was taking it all very casually mae came hurrying into the room she took in the situation with a glance did anyone check the video playback we cant ricky said he pointed to the closet the controls are disabledin there so you dont know how he got in there no but he evidently didnt want us calling out at least thats how it looks mae said why would charley go in there i shook my head i had no idea julia said its airtight maybe he knew he was infected and wanted to seal himself off i mean he locked the door from the inside i said he did how do you know that julia said um i just assumed uh she peered through the glass and uh you can see the lock reflected in that chrome fitting see that one there i didnt bother to look but mae did and i heard her say oh yes julia youre right good observation i missed that myself it sounded very phony but julia didnt seem to react so everybody was playacting now everything was staged and i didnt understand why but as i watched mae with julia i noticed that she was being extremely careful with my wife almost as if she was afraid of her or at least afraid of offending her that was odd and a little alarming i said to ricky is there a way to unlock the door i think so vince probably has a skeleton key but nobodys unlocking that door now jack not as long as that swarm is in there so we cant call anywhere i said were stuck here incommunicado until tomorrow yes helicopter will be back tomorrow morning on its regular run ricky peered in through the glass at the destruction jeez charley really did a job on those switching panels i said why do you think he would do that ricky shook his head charley was a little crazy you know i mean he was colorful but all that farting and humming he was a few fries short of a happy meal jack i never thought so just my opinion he said i stood beside ricky and looked through the glass the swarm was buzzing around charleys head and i was starting to see the milky coating form on his body the usual pattern i said what about pumping liquid nitrogen in there freezing the swarm we could probably do that ricky said but im afraid wed damage the equipment can you turn the air handlers up enough to suck the particles out handlers are going fullbore now and you wouldnt want to use a fire extinguisher he shook his head extinguishers are halon wont affect the particles so were effectively kept out of that room far as i can tell yes cell phones he shook his head antennas route through that room every form of communication we havecells internet highspeed data trunkseverything goes through that room julia said charley knew that room was airtight i bet he went there to protect the rest of us it was a selfless act a courageous act she was developing her theory about charley fleshing it out adding details it was a little distracting considering the main problem was still unansweredhow to unlock the door and disable the swarm i said is there another window in that closet no this window in the door is the only one yes okay then i said lets black out the window and turn the lights out in there and wait a few hours until the swarm loses power jeez i dont know ricky said doubtfully what do you mean ricky julia said i think its a great idea its certainly worth a try lets do it right now okay fine ricky said immediately deferring to her but youre going to have to wait six hours i said i thought it was three hours it is but i want extra hours before i open that door if that swarm gets loose in here weve all had it in the end that was what we decided to do we got black cloth and taped it over the window and put black cardboard over that we turned out the lights and taped the light switch in the off position at the end of that time exhaustion hit me again i looked at my watch it was one oclock in the morning i said i have to go to bed we should all get some sleep julia said we can revisit this in the morning we all headed off toward the residence module mae sidled up alongside me how are you feeling she said okay my backs starting to hurt a little she nodded you better let me take a look at it why just let me take a look before you go to bed oh jack darling julia cried you poor baby what is it i was sitting on the kitchen table with my shirt off julia and mae were behind me clucking what is it i said again theres some blistering mae said blistering julia said his whole back is covered i think we have dressings mae said interrupting her reaching for the firstaid kit beneath the sink yes i hope so julia smiled at me jack i cant tell you how sorry i am that you had to go through this this may sting a little mae said i knew that mae wanted to talk to me alone but there was no opportunity julia was not going to leave us alone for a minute she had always been jealous of mae even years ago when i first hired mae in my company and now she was competing with her for my attention i wasnt flattered the dressings were cool at first as mae applied them but within moments they stung bitterly i winced i dont know what painkillers we have mae said youve got a good area of seconddegree burns julia rummaged frantically through the firstaid kit tossing contents out right and left tubes and canisters clattered to the floor theres morphine she said at last holding up a bottle she smiled at me brightly that should do it i dont want morphine i said what i really wanted to say was that i wanted her to go to bed julia was annoying me her frantic edge was getting on my nerves and i wanted to talk to mae alone theres nothing else julia said except aspirin aspirin is fine im worried it wont be aspirin is fine you dont have to bite my head off im sorry i dont feel well well im only trying to help julia stepped back i mean if you two want to be alone you should just say so no i said we do not want to be alone well im only trying to help she turned back to the medicine kit maybe there is something else containers of tape and plastic bottles of antibiotics fell to the floor julia i said please stop what am i doing what am i doing that is so awful just stop im only trying to help i know that behind me mae said okay all finished now that should hold you until tomorrow she yawned and now if you dont mind im going to bed i thanked her and watched her leave the room when i turned back julia was holding a glass of water and two aspirins for me thank you i said i never liked that woman she said lets get some sleep i said theres only single beds here i know she moved closer id like to be with you jack im really tired ill see you in the morning julia i went back to my room and looked at the bed i didnt bother taking off my clothes i dont remember my head touching the pillow day am i slept restlessly with constant and terrible dreams i dreamed that i was back in monterey marrying julia again and i was standing in front of the minister when she came up alongside me in her bridal gown and when she lifted the veil i was shocked by how beautiful and young and slender she was she smiled at me and i smiled back trying to conceal my uneasiness because now i saw she was more than slender her face was thin almost emaciated almost a skull then i turned to the minister in front of us but it was mae and she was pouring colored liquids back and forth in test tubes when i looked back at julia she was very angry and said she never liked that woman somehow it was my fault i was to blame i woke up briefly sweating the pillow was soaked i turned it over and went back to sleep i saw myself sleeping on the bed and i looked up and saw that the door to my room was open light came in from the hallway outside a shadow fell across my bed ricky came into the room and looked down at me his face was backlit and dark i couldnt see his expression but he said i always loved you jack he leaned over to whisper something in my ear and i realized as his head came down that he was going to kiss me instead he was going to kiss me on the lips passionately his mouth was open his tongue licked his lips i was very upset i didnt know what to do but at that moment julia came in and said whats going on and ricky hastily pulled away and made some kind of evasive comment julia was very angry and said not now you fool and ricky made another evasive comment and then julia said this is completely unnecessary it will take care of itself and ricky said there are constriction coefficients for deterministic algorithms if you do interval global optimization and she said it wont hurt you if you dont fight it she turned on the light in the room and walked out then i was suddenly back in my monterey wedding julia was standing beside me in white and i turned to look back at the audience and i saw my three kids sitting in the first row smiling and happy and as i watched a black line appeared around their mouths and swept down their bodies until they were cloaked in black they continued to smile but i was horrified i ran to them but i couldnt rub the black cloak off and nicole said calmly dont forget the sprinklers dad i woke up tangled up in the sheets drenched in sweat the door to my room was open a rectangle of light fell across my bed from the hallway outside i looked over at the workstation monitor it said am i closed my eyes and lay there for a while but i couldnt go back to sleep i was wet and uncomfortable i decided to take a shower shortly before five in the morning i got out of bed the hallway was silent i walked down the corridor to the bathrooms the doors to all the bedrooms were open which seemed strange i could see everybody sleeping as i walked past and the lights were on in all the bedrooms i saw ricky asleep and i saw bobby and i saw julia and vince maes bed was empty and of course charleys bed was empty i stopped in the kitchen to get a ginger ale from the refrigerator i was very thirsty my throat painful and parched and my stomach felt a little queasy i looked at the champagne bottle i suddenly had a funny feeling about it as if it might have been tampered with i took it out and looked closely at the cap at the metal foil that covered the cork it looked entirely normal no tampering no needle marks no nothing just a bottle of champagne i put it back and closed the refrigerator door i began to wonder if i had been unfair to julia maybe she really did believe shed made a mistake and wanted to put things right maybe she just wanted to show her gratitude maybe i was being too tough on her too unforgiving because when you thought about it what had she done that was suspicious or wrong shed been glad to see me even if she was over the top shed accepted responsibility for the experiment and shed apologized for it shed immediately agreed to make the call to the army shed agreed with my plan to kill the swarm in the comm room shed done everything she could do to show she supported me and was on my side but i still was uneasy and of course there was the matter of charley and his swarm rickys idea that charley had somehow been carrying the swarm inside his body in his mouth or under his armpit or something didnt make a lot of sense to me those swarms killed within seconds so it left a questionhow did the swarm get into the comm room with charley did it get in from outside why hadnt it attacked julia and ricky and vince i forgot about my shower i decided to go down to the utility room and look around outside the comm room door maybe there was something i had missed julia had been talking a lot interrupting my train of thought almost as if she hadnt wanted me to figure something out there i was again being hard on julia i went through the airlock down the corridor through another airlock when you were tired it was annoying to have that wind blowing on you i came out into the utility area and went toward the comm room door i didnt notice anything i heard the sound of a clicking keyboard and looked into the biology lab mae was there at her workstation i said what are you doing checking the video playback i thought we couldnt do that because charley pulled the wires thats what ricky said but it isnt true i started to come around the lab bench to look over her shoulder she held up her hand jack she said maybe you dont want to look at this what why not its uh maybe you dont want to deal with this not right now maybe tomorrow but of course after that i practically ran around the table to see what was on her monitor and i stopped what i saw on her screen was an image of an empty corridor with a time code at the bottom of the picture is this it i said is this what i shouldnt deal with no she turned in her chair look jack you have to go through all the security cameras in sequence and each one only records ten frames a minute so its very difficult to be sure of what were just show me mae i have to go back a bit she pressed the back button in the corner of the keyboard repeatedly like many new control systems the xymos system was modeled on internet browser technology you could go backward in work retracing your steps the frames jumped backward until she came to the place she wanted then she ran it forward the security images jumping from one camera to the next in rapid succession a corridor the main plant another angle on the plant an airlock another corridor the utility room a corridor the kitchen the lounge the residence hallway an exterior view looking down at the floodlit desert corridor the power room the outside ground level another corridor i blinked how long have you been doing this about an hour jesus next i saw a corridor ricky moving down it power station outside looking down on julia stepping into the floodlight a corridor julia and ricky together embracing and then a corridor andwait i said mae hit a button she looked at me said nothing she pressed another key flicked the images forward slowly she stopped on the camera that showed ricky and julia ten frames the movement was blurred and jerky ricky and julia moved toward each other they embraced there was a clear sense of ease of familiarity between them and then they kissed passionately aw shit i said turning away from the screen shit shit shit im sorry jack mae said i dont know what to say i felt a wave of dizziness almost as if i might collapse i sat down on the table i kept my body turned away from the screen i just couldnt look i took a deep breath mae was saying something more but i didnt hear her words i took another breath i ran my hand through my hair i said did you know about this no not until a few minutes ago did anybody no we used to joke about it sometimes that they had a relationship but none of us believed it jesus i ran my hand through my hair again tell me the truth mae i need to hear the truth did you know about this or not no jack i didnt silence i took a breath i tried to take stock of my feelings you know whats funny i said whats funny is that ive suspected this for a while now i mean i was pretty sure it was happening i just didnt know who i mean even though i expected it its still kind of a shock im sure i never would have figured ricky i said hes such a i dont know smarmy kind of guy and hes not a big power guy somehow i would have thought shed pick someone more important i guess as i said it i remembered my conversation with ellen after dinner are you so sure about julias style that was after id seen the guy in the car the guy whose face i couldnt really make out ellen its called denial jack jesus i said shaking my head i felt angry embarrassed confused furious it kept changing every second mae waited she didnt move or speak she was completely still finally she said do you want to see any more is there more yes i dont know if i uh no i dont want to see any more maybe you better no i mean it might make you feel better i dont think so i said i dont think i can take it she said it may not be what you think jack at least it may not be exactly what you think its called denial jack sorry mae i said but i dont want to pretend anymore i saw it i know what it is i thought id be with julia forever i thought we loved the kids together we had a family a house a life together and ricky had a new baby of his own it just was weird it didnt make sense to me but then things never turn out the way you think they will i heard mae typing quickly on the keyboard i turned so i could see her but not the screen whatre you doing trying to find charley see if i can track what happened to him over the last few hours she continued typing i took a breath she was right whatever was going on in my personal life was already well advanced there was nothing i could do about it at least not right now i turned all the way around and faced the screen okay i said lets look for charley it was disorienting to watch the camera images flash by repeating in sequence people popped in and out of images i saw julia in the kitchen the next time i saw her and ricky in the kitchen the refrigerator door was open then shut i saw vince in the main plant room then he popped out i saw him in a corridor then gone i dont see charley maybe hes still asleep mae said can you see in the bedrooms yes there are cameras there but id have to change security cycle ordinary cycle doesnt go into the bedrooms how big a deal is it to change the security cycle im not sure this is really rickys area the system here is pretty complicated rickys the only one who really knows how to work it lets see if we find charley in the regular cycle so thats what we did waiting to see if he appeared in any of the standard camera images we searched for about ten minutes more from time to time i had to look away from the images though it never seemed to bother mae but sure enough we saw him in the residential hallway walking down the corridor rubbing his face hed just woken up okay mae said we got him whats the time she froze the image so we could read it it was am i said thats only about half an hour before we got back yes she ran the images forward charley disappeared from the hallway but we saw him briefly heading into the bathroom then we saw ricky and julia in the kitchen i felt my body tense but they were just talking then julia put the champagne in the refrigerator and ricky started handing her glasses to put in beside the bottle it was difficult to be sure what happened next because of the frame rate ten frames a second of video meant that you only got an image every six seconds so events appeared blurred and jumpy when things moved fast because too much happened between the frames but this is what i thought happened charley showed up and began talking to the two of them he was smiling cheerful he pointed to the glasses julia and ricky put the glasses away while they talked to him then he held up his hand to stop he pointed to a glass that julia was holding in her hand before she put it in the refrigerator he said something julia shook her head and put the glass in the refrigerator charley seemed puzzled he pointed again to another glass julia shook her head then charley hunched his shoulders and thrust out his chin as if he were getting angry he poked the table repeatedly with his finger making a point ricky stepped forward between julia and charley he acted like someone interrupting an argument he held his hands up soothingly to charley take it easy charley wasnt taking it easy he was pointing to the sink heaped with unwashed dishes ricky shook his head and put his hand on charleys shoulder charley brushed it off the two men began to argue meanwhile julia calmly put the rest of the glasses into the refrigerator she seemed indifferent to the argument a few feet from her almost as if she didnt hear it charley was trying to get around ricky to the refrigerator but ricky kept moving to block him and held his hands up each time rickys whole demeanor suggested that he did not regard charley as rational he was treating charley in that careful way you do when someones out of control mae said is charley being affected by the swarm is that why hes acting that way i cant tell i looked closer at the screen i dont see any swarm no she said but hes pretty angry what does he want them to do i said mae shook her head put the glasses back wash them use different glasses i cant tell i said charley doesnt care about that stuff hed eat out of a dirty plate somebody else had used i smiled ive seen him do it suddenly charley stepped several paces back for a moment he was completely still as if he had discovered something that stunned him ricky said something to him charley began pointing and shouting at both of them ricky tried to approach him charley kept backing away and then he turned to the phone mounted on the wall he lifted the receiver ricky came forward very quickly his body a blur and slammed the phone down he shoved charley backhard rickys strength was surprising charley was a big guy but he went down to the floor and skidded backward a few feet charley got to his feet continued to yell then he turned and ran out of the room julia and ricky exchanged a glance julia said something to him immediately ricky ran after charley julia ran after ricky where are they going i said mae released the hold button and the screen flashed updating time and then we started seeing images from all the cameras again in sequence we saw charley running down a corridor and we saw ricky start after him we waited impatiently for the next cycle but nobody was visible there another cycle then we saw charley in the utility room dialing the phone he glanced over his shoulder a moment later ricky came in and charley hung up the phone they argued circling around each other charley picked up a shovel and swung it at ricky the first time ricky dodged away the second time it caught him on the shoulder and knocked him to the floor charley swung the shovel over his head and slammed it down on rickys head the gesture was brutal the intention clearly murderous ricky managed to duck back just as the shovel smashed onto the concrete my god mae said ricky was getting to his feet when charley turned and saw julia enter the room julia held out her hand pleading with charley to put down the shovel charley looked from one of them to the other and then vince entered the room too now that they were all in the room he seemed to lose his urge to fight they were circling him closing in suddenly charley dashed for the comm room stepped inside and tried to shut the door behind him ricky was on him in a flash he had his foot in the door and charley couldnt get it closed charleys face looked angry through the glass vince came right alongside ricky with both of them at the door i couldnt see what was happening julia seemed to be giving orders i thought i saw her reach her hand through the crack in the door but it was difficult to be sure in any case the door opened and both vince and ricky entered the room the action that came next was swift blurred on the video but apparently the three men were fighting and ricky managed to get behind charley and get him in a hammerlock vince pulled charleys arm behind his back and together the two men subdued charley he stopped fighting the image was less blurred whats happening mae said they never told us any of this ricky and vince were holding charley from behind charley was panting his chest heaving but he no longer struggled julia came into the room she looked at charley and had some conversation with him and then julia walked up to charley and kissed him full and long on the lips charley struggled tried to wrench away vince grabbed a fistful of charleys hair and tried to hold his head steady julia continued to kiss him then she stepped away and as she did i saw a river of black between her mouth and charleys it was only there for a moment and then it faded oh my god mae said julia wiped her lips and smiled charley sagged dropped to the ground he appeared dazed a black cloud came out of his mouth and swirled around his head vince patted him on the head and left the room ricky went over to the panelsand pulled out wiring by the handful he literally ripped the panels apart then he turned back to charley said something else and walked out of the comm room at once charley sprang to his feet closed the door and locked it but ricky and julia just laughed as if this was a futile gesture charley sagged again and from then on he was out of sight ricky threw his arm around julias shoulder and they walked out of the room together well you two are certainly up bright and early i turned julia was standing in the doorway day am she came forward into the room smiling you know jack she said if i didnt trust you so completely id think there was something going on between the two of you really i said i stepped away from mae a little while she typed quickly i felt tremendously uneasy why would you think that well you had your heads together about something she said as she came toward us you looked quite fascinated by what you were seeing on the screen whatre you looking at anyway its ah technical may i see im interested in technical things didnt ricky tell you i had a new technical interest i do im fascinated by this technology its a new world isnt it the twentyfirst century has arrived dont get up mae ill just look over your shoulder by now she had walked around the bench and could see the screen she frowned at the image which showed bacterial cultures on a red growth medium white circles within red circles whats this mae said bacterial colonies weve got some contamination of the coli stock i had to take one tank offline were trying to figure out whats wrong probably phage dont you think julia said isnt that what it usually is with bacterial stocksa virus she sighed everything about molecular manufacturing is so delicate things go wrong so easily and so often you have to keep alert for trouble she glanced at me and at mae but surely this isnt what youve been looking at all this time actually it is i said what pictures of mold bacteria yes bacteria youve been looking at this the whole time mae she shrugged nodded yes julia its my job and i dont question your dedication for a moment julia said but do you mind her hand darted forward and hit the back key in the corner of the keyboard the previous screen showed more pictures of bacterial growth the next screen showed a virus electron micrograph and then a table of growth data over the last twelve hours julia continued to hit the back key half a dozen times more but all she saw were images of bacteria and viruses graphs and data tables she took her hand away from the keyboard you seem to be devoting a lot of time to this is it really so important well its a contaminant mae said if we dont control it well have to shut down the entire system then by all means keep at it she turned to me want to have breakfast id imagine you must be starving sounds great i said come with me julia said well make it together okay i said i glanced at mae ill see you later let me know if i can do anything to help i left with julia we started down the corridor to the residences i dont know why julia said but that woman bothers me i dont know why either shes very good very thoughtful very conscientious and very pretty julia is that why you wont kiss me because youre involved with her julia for christs sake she stared at me waiting look i said its been a rough couple of weeks for everybody frankly youve been difficult to live with im sure i have and frankly ive been pretty angry with you with good reason i know im sorry for what i put you through she leaned over kissed me on the cheek but it feels so distant now i dont like the tension between us what do you say we kiss and make up maybe later i said we have a lot to do now she got playful puckering her lips kissing air oooh come on sweetie just a little smooch come on it wont kill you later i said she sighed and gave up we continued down the corridor in silence for a while then she said in a serious voice youre avoiding me jack and i want to know why i didnt answer her i just gave a longsuffering sigh and kept walking acting like what shed said was beneath response in fact i was badly worried i couldnt keep refusing to kiss her forever sooner or later shed figure out what i knew maybe she already had because even when julia was acting girlish she seemed sharper more alert than shed ever been before i had the feeling she didnt miss anything and i had the same feeling about ricky it was as if they were tuned up ultraaware and i was worried about what id seen on maes monitor the black cloud that seemed to come from julias mouth had it really been there on the video because as far as i knew swarms killed their prey on contact they were merciless now julia seemed to be harboring a swarm how could that be did she have some sort of immunity or was the swarm tolerating her not killing her for some reason and what about ricky and vince did they have immunity too one thing was clear julia and ricky did not want us to call anybody they had deliberately isolated us in the desert knowing that they would have only a few hours until the helicopter arrived so apparently thats all the time they needed to do what kill us or just infect us what walking down the corridor next to my wife i felt as if i was walking with a stranger with somebody i didnt know anymore somebody who was immensely dangerous i glanced at my watch the helicopter would be here in less than two hours now julia smiled got an appointment no just thinking its time for breakfast jack she said why wont you be honest with me im being honest no you were wondering how long until the helicopter comes i shrugged two hours she said and she added ill bet youll be glad to get out of here wont you yes i said but im not leaving until everything is done why whats left to be done by now we had reached the residential unit i could smell bacon and eggs cooking ricky came around the corner he smiled heartily when he saw me hey jack howd you sleep i slept okay really cause you look a little tired i had bad dreams i said oh yes bad dreams bummer it happens sometimes i said we all went into the kitchen bobby was making breakfast scrambled eggs with chives and cream cheese he said cheerfully what kind of toast do you guys want julia wanted wheat toast ricky wanted english muffin i said i didnt want anything i was looking at ricky noticing again how strong he appeared beneath his tshirt the muscles were well defined cut he caught me staring at him something wrong no just admiring your butch look i tried to be light but the truth was that i felt incredibly uncomfortable in the kitchen with all of them around me i kept thinking of charley and how swiftly they had attacked him i wasnt hungry i just wanted to get out of there but i couldnt see how to do it without arousing suspicion julia went to the refrigerator opened the door the champagne was in there you guys ready to celebrate now sure bobby said sounds great a little mimosa in the morning absolutely not i said julia im going to insist you take this situation seriously were not out of the woods yet we have to get the army in here and we havent been able to call its not time to break out the champagne she pouted oh youre such a spoilsport spoilsport hell youre being ridiculous oooh baby dont get mad just kiss me kiss me she puckered her lips again and leaned across the table but it seemed like getting angry was the only move i had god damn it julia i said raising my voice the only reason we are in this mess is because you didnt take it seriously in the first place you had a runaway swarm out there in the desert for whattwo weeks and instead of eradicating it you played with it you fooled around until it got out of control and as a result three people are dead this is not a goddamn celebration julia its a disaster and i am not drinking any fucking champagne while i am here and neither is anyone else i took the bottle to the sink and smashed it i turned back to her got it stonyfaced she said that was completely unnecessary i saw ricky looking at me thoughtfully as if he was trying to decide something bobby turned his back while he cooked as if he was embarrassed by a marital spat had they gotten to bobby i thought i saw a thin black line at his neck but i couldnt be sure and i didnt dare stare unnecessary i said full of outrage those people were my friends and they were your friends ricky and yours bobby and i dont want to hear this celebration shit anymore i turned and stomped out of the room as i left vince was coming in better take it easy pal vince said youll give yourself a stroke fuck off i said vince raised his eyebrows i brushed past him youre not fooling anybody jack julia called after me i know what youre really up to my stomach flipped but i kept walking i can see right through you jack i know youre going back to her damn right i said was that what julia really thought i didnt believe it for a moment she was just trying to mislead me to keep me off guard until what what were they going to do there were four of them and only two of usat least there were two if they hadnt already gotten to mae mae wasnt in the biology laboratory i looked around and saw that a side door was ajar leading downstairs to the underground level where the fermentation chambers were installed up close they were much larger than i had realized giant stainless spheres about six feet across they were surrounded by a maze of pipes and valves and temperature control units it was warm here and very noisy mae was standing by the third unit making notes on a clipboard and shutting a valve she had a rack of test tubes at her feet i went down and stood beside her she looked at me then shot a glance toward the ceiling where a security camera was mounted she walked around to the other side of the tank and i followed her over here the tank blocked the camera she said they slept with the lights on i nodded i knew what it meant now theyre all infected she said yes and its not killing them yes i said but i dont understand why it must have evolved she said to tolerate them that fast evolution can happen fast she said you know the ewald studies i did paul ewald had studied cholera what he found was that the cholera organism would quickly change to sustain an epidemic in places where there were no sanitary water supplies but perhaps a ditch running through a village the cholera was virulent prostrating the victim and killing him where he fell from massive overwhelming diarrhea the diarrhea contained millions of cholera organisms it would run into the water supply and infect others in the village in this way the cholera reproduced and the epidemic continued but when there was sanitary water supply the virulent strain could not reproduce the victim would die where he fell but his diarrhea would not enter the water supply others would not be infected and the epidemic would fade under those circumstances the epidemic evolved to a milder form enabling the victim to walk around and spread the milder organisms by contact dirty linens and so on mae was suggesting that the same thing had happened to the swarms they had evolved to a milder form which could be transmitted from one person to another its creepy i said she nodded but what can we do about it and then she began to cry silently tears running down her cheeks mae was always so strong seeing her upset unnerved me now she was shaking her head jack theres nothing we can do theres four of them theyre stronger than we are theyre going to kill us the way they killed charley she pressed her head against my shoulder i put my arm around her but i couldnt comfort her because i knew she was right there was no way out winston churchill once said that being shot at focused the mind wonderfully my mind was going very fast now i was thinking that i had made a mistake and i had to fix it even though it was a typically human mistake considering that we live in an era of evolutionary everythingevolutionary biology evolutionary medicine evolutionary ecology evolutionary psychology evolutionary economics evolutionary computingit was surprising how rarely people thought in evolutionary terms it was a human blind spot we looked at the world around us as a snapshot when it was really a movie constantly changing of course we knew it was changing but we behaved as if it wasnt we denied the reality of change so change always surprised us parents were even surprised by the maturing of their own children they treated them as younger than they really were and i had been surprised by the change in the evolution of the swarms there was no reason why the swarms shouldnt evolve in two directions at the same time or three or four or ten directions for that matter i should have anticipated that i should have looked for it expected it if i had i might be better prepared to deal with the situation now but instead i had treated the swarm as one problema problem out there in the desertand i had ignored other possibilities its called denial jack i started to wonder what else i was denying now what else i had failed to see where did i go wrong what was the first clue i had missed probably the fact that my initial contact with a swarm had produced an allergic reactiona reaction that almost killed me mae had called it a coliform reaction caused by a toxin from the bacteria in the swarm that toxin was obviously the result of an evolutionary change in the e coli that made up the swarm well for that matter the very presence of phage in the tank was an evolutionary change a viral response to the bacteria thatmae i said wait a minute what i said there might be something we can do to stop them she was skeptical i could see it in her face but she wiped her eyes and listened i said the swarm consists of particles and bacteria is that right yes the bacteria provide the raw ingredients for the particles to reproduce themselves right okay so if the bacteria die the swarm dies too probably she frowned are you thinking of an antibiotic giving everyone an antibiotic because you need a lot of antibiotics to clear an e coli infection theyd have to take drugs for several days and i dont no im not thinking of antibiotics i tapped the tank in front of me im thinking of this phage why not i dont know if it will work she said she frowned it might except howre you going to get the phage into them they wont just drink it down you know then well fill the atmosphere with it i said theyll breathe it in and theyll never know uhhuh how do we fill the atmosphere easy dont shut down this tank feed the bacteria into the system i want the assembly line to start making virusa lot of virus then we release into the air mae sighed it wont work jack she said why not because the assembly line wont make a lot of virus why not because of the way the virus reproduces you knowthe virus floats around attaches to a cell wall and injects itself into the cell then it takes over the cells own rna and converts it to making more viruses the cell ceases all its normal metabolic functions and just cranks out viruses pretty soon the cell is packed with viruses and it bursts like a balloon all the viruses are released they float to other cells and the process starts all over yes so if i introduce phage into the assembly lines the virus will reproduce rapidlyfor a while but it will rupture a lot of cell membranes leaving behind all those membranes as a lipid crud the crud will clog the intermediate filters after about an hour or two the assembly lines will start to overheat the safety systems will kick in and shut everything down the whole production line will just stop no virus can the safety systems be turned off yes but i dont know how who does only ricky i shook my head that wont do us any good are you sure you cant figure out theres a code she said rickys the only one who knows it oh anyway jack itd be too dangerous to turn off the safeties parts of that system operate at high temperature and high voltages and theres a lot of ketones and methane produced in the arms its continuously monitored and drawn off to keep the levels below a certain concentration but if it isnt drawn off and you start high voltage sparking she paused shrugged whatre you saying it could explode no jack im saying it will explode in a matter of minutes after the safeties are shut off six maybe eight minutes at most and you wouldnt want to be there when that happens so you cant use the system to produce a lot of virus safeties on or safeties off it just wont work silence frustration i looked around the room i looked at the steel tank curving upward over my head i looked at the rack of test tubes at maes feet i looked in the corner where i saw a mop a bucket and a onegallon plastic bottle of water and i looked at mae frightened still on the verge of tears but somehow holding it together and i had a plan okay do it anyway release the virus into the system whats the point of that just do it jack she said why are we doing this im afraid they know that we know we cant fool them theyre too clever if we try to do this theyll be onto us in a minute yes i said they probably will and it wont work anyway the system wont make viruses so why jack what good will it do mae had been a good friend through all this and now i had a plan and i wasnt going to tell her i hated to do it this way but i had to make a distraction for the others i had to fool them and she had to help me do itwhich meant she had to believe in a different plan i said mae we have to distract them to fool them i want you to release the virus into the assembly line let them focus on that let them worry about that meanwhile ill take some virus up to the maintenance area beneath the roof and dump it into the sprinkler reservoir and then set the sprinklers off yes she nodded and theyll be soaked in virus everybody in this facility drenched right she said it just might work jack i cant think of anything better i said now open one of those valves and lets draw off some test tubes of virus and i want you to put some virus into that gallon jug over there she hesitated the valve is on the other side of the tank the security camera will see us thats okay i said it cant be helped now you just have to buy me a little time and how do i do that i told her she made a face youre kidding theyll never do that of course not i just need a little time we went around the tank she filled the test tubes the liquid that came out was a thick brown slop it smelled fecal it looked fecal mae said to me are you sure about this got to do it i said theres no choice you first i picked up the test tube took a breath and swallowed it whole it was disgusting my stomach heaved i thought i would vomit but i didnt i took another breath swallowed some water from the gallon jug and looked at mae awful huh she said awful she picked up a test tube held her nose and swallowed i waited through her coughing fit she managed not to vomit i gave her the gallon jug she drank and poured the rest out onto the floor then she filled it with brown slop the last thing she did was twist the handle of a big flow valve there she said its going into the system now okay i said i took two test tubes and stuck them in my shirt pocket i took the gallon jug it said arrowhead pure water on the label see you later and i hurried off as i went down the hallway i figured there was one chance in a hundred that i would succeed maybe only one chance in a thousand but i had a chance later on i watched the entire scene on the security camera so i knew what happened to mae she walked into the kitchen carrying her rack of brown test tubes the others were all there eating julia gave her a frosty look vince ignored her ricky said whatve you got there mae phage she said what for now julia looked over mae said its from the fermentation tank ew no wonder it stinks jack just drank one he made me drink one ricky snorted whatd you do that for jeez im surprised you didnt puke i almost did jack wants all of you to drink one too bobby laughed yeah what for to make sure none of you is infected ricky frowned infected what do you mean infected jack says that charley was harboring the swarm inside his body so maybe the rest of us are too or some of us so you drink this virus and itll kill the bacteria inside you and kill the swarm bobby said are you serious drink that crap no way mae she turned to vince smells like shit to me vince said let someone else try it first mae said ricky you want to be the first ricky shook his head im not drinking that why should i well for one thing youd be assured you werent infected and for another we would be assured too what do you mean its a test mae shrugged thats what jack thinks julia frowned she turned to mae where is jack now she said i dont know the last time i saw him was by the fermentation chambers i dont know where he is now yes you do julia said coldly you know exactly where he is i dont he didnt tell me he did tell you he tells you everything julia said in fact you and he planned this little interlude didnt you you couldnt seriously expect us to drink that stuff where is jack mae i told you i dont know julia said to bobby check the monitors find him she came around the table now then mae her voice was calm but full of menace i want you to answer me and i want you to tell me the truth mae backed away from her ricky and vince were closing in on either side of her mae backed against the wall julia advanced slowly tell me now mae she said it will be much better for you if you cooperate from the other side of the room bobby said i found him hes going through the fab room hes carrying a jug of the crap looks like tell me mae julia said leaning close to mae she was so close their lips were almost touching mae squeezed her eyes and her lips tightly shut her body was beginning to shake with fear julia caressed her hair dont be afraid theres nothing to be afraid of just tell me what he is doing with that jug julia said mae began to sob hysterically i knew it wouldnt work i told him you would find out of course we would julia said quietly of course we would find out just tell now he took the jug of virus mae said and hes putting it in the water sprinklers is he julia said thats really very clever of him thank you sweetie and she kissed mae on the mouth mae squirmed but her back was against the wall and julia held her head when julia finally stepped back she said try and stay calm just remember it wont hurt you if you dont fight against it and she walked out of the room day am things happened faster than i expected i could hear them running toward me down the corridor i hastily hid the jug then ran back and continued crossing the fabrication room that was when they all came after me i started to run vince tackled me and i hit the concrete floor hard ricky threw himself on top of me after i was down he knocked the wind out of me then vince kicked me in the ribs a couple of times and together they dragged me to my feet to face julia hi jack she said smiling hows it going its been better weve had a nice talk with mae julia said so theres no point in beating around the bush she looked around the floor nearby where is the jug what jug jack she shook her head sadly why do you bother where is the jug of phage you were going to put in the sprinkler system i dont have any jug she stepped close to me i could feel her breath on my face jack i know that look on your face jack you have a plan dont you now tell me where the jug is what jug her lips brushed mine i just stood there still as a statue jack darling she whispered you know better than to play with dangerous things i want the jug i stood there jack just one kiss she was close seductive ricky said forget it julia hes not afraid of you he drank the virus and he thinks itll protect him will it julia said stepping back maybe ricky said but i bet hes afraid to die and then he and vince began dragging me across the fabrication room they were taking me to the high mag field room i began to struggle thats right ricky said you know whats coming dont you this was not in my plan i hadnt expected it i didnt know what i could do now i struggled harder kicking and twisting but they were both immensely strong they just dragged me forward julia opened the heavy steel door to the mag room inside i saw the circular drum of the magnet six feet in diameter they shoved me in roughly i sprawled on the ground in the room my head banged against the steel shielding i heard the door click and lock i got to my feet i heard the rumble of the cooling pumps as they started up the intercom clicked i heard rickys voice ever wonder why these walls are made out of steel jack pulsed magnets are dangerous run them continuously and they blow apart get ripped apart by the field they generate we got a oneminute load time so youve got one minute to think it over i had been in this room before when ricky showed me around i remembered there was a knee plate a safety cutoff i hit it with my knee wont work jack ricky said laconically i inverted the switching now it turns the magnet on instead of off thought youd like to know the rumbling was louder the room began to vibrate slightly the air grew swiftly colder in a moment i could see my breath sorry if youre uncomfortable but thats only temporary ricky said once the pulses get going the roomll heat up fast uh lets see fortyseven seconds the sound was a rapid chunkchunkchunk like a muffled jackhammer it was loud and getting louder i could hardly hear ricky over the intercom now jack he said you have a family a family that needs you so think about your choices very carefully i said let me speak to julia no jack she doesnt want to talk to you right now shes very disappointed in you jack let me speak to her jack arent you listening to me she says no not until you tell her where the virus is chunkchunkchunk the room was starting to get warmer i could hear the gurgle of the coolant as it went through the piping i kicked the safety plate with my knee i told you jack itll only turn the magnet on are you having trouble hearing me yes i yelled i am well thats too bad ricky said im sorry to hear that at least i thought thats what he was saying the chunkchunkchunk seemed to fill the room to make the very air vibrate it sounded like an enormous mri those giant pumps my head hurt i stared at the magnet at the heavy bolts that held the plates together those bolts would soon become missiles were not fucking around jack ricky said wed hate to lose you twenty seconds the load time was the time it took to charge the magnet capacitors so that millisecond pulses of electricity could be delivered i wondered how long after loading it would take for the pulses to blow the magnet apart probably a few seconds at most so time was running out for me i didnt know what to do everything had gone horribly wrong and the worst part was that i had lost the only advantage i ever had because they now recognized the importance of the virus earlier they hadnt focused on it as a threat but now they understood and were demanding i hand it over soon they would think to destroy the fermentation tank they would eradicate the virus very thoroughly i felt sure and there was nothing i could do about it not now i wondered how mae was and whether they had hurt her i wondered if she was still alive i felt detached indifferent i was sitting in an oversized mri that was all this big terrifying sound it must have been how amanda felt when she was in the mri my mind drifted uncaring ten seconds ricky said come on jack dont be a hero its not your style tell us where it is six seconds five jack come on the chunkchunkchunk stopped and there was a whang and a scream of rending metal the magnet had switched on for a few milliseconds first pulse ricky said dont be an asshole jack another whang whang whang the pulses were coming faster and faster i saw the jacketing on the coolant beginning to indent with each pulse they were coming too fast whang whang i couldnt take it anymore i shouted okay ricky ill tell you whang go ahead jack whang im waiting no turn it off first and i only tell julia whang whang very unreasonable of you jack youre in no position to bargain whang you want the virus or you want it to be a surprise whang whang whang and then abruptly silence nothing but the low swoosh of the coolant flowing through the jacketing the magnet was hot to the touch but at least the mri sound had stopped the mri i stood in the room and waited for julia to come in and then thinking it over i sat down i heard the door unlock julia walked in jack youre not hurt are you no i said just my nerves are shot i dont know why you put yourself through it she said it was totally unnecessary but guess what i have good news the helicopter just arrived it did yes its early today just think wouldnt it be nice to be on it now going home back to your house back to your family wouldnt that feel great i sat there with my back against the wall looking up at her are you saying i can go of course jack theres no reason for you to stay here just give me the bottle of virus and go home i didnt believe her for a second i was seeing the friendly julia the seductive julia but i didnt believe her where is mae shes resting youve hurt her no no no no why would i do that she shook her head you really dont understand do you i dont want to hurt anybody jack not you not mae not anybody i especially dont want to hurt you try telling that to ricky jack please lets put emotion aside and be logical for a moment youre doing all this to yourself why cant you accept the new situation she held out her hand to me i took it and she pulled me up she was strong stronger than i ever remembered her being after all she said youre an integral part of this you killed the wild type for us jack so the benign type could flourish exactly jack so the benign type could flourish and create a new synergy with human beings the synergy that you have now for example thats right jack she smiled it was a creepy smile you are what coexisting coevolving symbiotic she was still smiling julia this is all bullshit i said this is a disease well of course you would say that because you dont know any better yet you havent experienced it she came forward and hugged me i let her do it you have no idea whats ahead of you story of my life i said stop being so stubborn for once just go along with it you look tired jack i sighed i am tired i said and i was i was feeling distinctly weak in her arms i was sure she could sense it then why dont you just relax embrace me jack i dont know maybe youre right yes i am she smiled again ruffled my hair with her hand oh jack i really have missed you me too i said i missed you i gave her a hug squeezed her held her close our faces were close she looked beautiful her lips parted her eyes staring up at me soft inviting i felt her relax then i said just tell me one thing julia its been bothering me sure jack why did you refuse to have an mri in the hospital she frowned leaned back to look at me what what do you mean are you like amanda amanda our baby daughter you remember her she was cured by the mri instantly what are you talking about julia does the swarm have some problem with magnetic fields her eyes widened she began to struggle in my grip let go of me ricky ricky sorry hon i said i kicked the plate with my knee and there was a loud whang as the magnet pulsed julia screamed her mouth was open as she screamed a steady continuous sound her face rigid with tension i held her hard the skin of her face began to shiver vibrating rapidly and then her features seemed to grow to swell as she screamed i thought her eyes looked frightened the swelling continued and began to break up into rivulets and streams and then in a sudden rush julia literally disintegrated before my eyes the skin of her swollen face and body blew away from her in streams of particles like sand blown off a sand dune the particles curved away in the arc of the magnetic field toward the sides of the room i felt her body growing lighter and lighter in my arms still the particles continued to flow away with a kind of whooshing sound to all corners of the room and when it was finished what was left behindwhat i still held in my armswas a pale and cadaverous form julias eyes were sunk deep in her cheeks her mouth was thin and cracked her skin translucent her hair was colorless brittle her collarbones protruded from her bony neck she looked like she was dying of cancer her mouth worked i heard faint words hardly more than breathing i leaned in turned my ear to her mouth to hear jack she whispered its eating me i said i know her voice was just a whisper you have to do something i know jack the children okay she whispered i kissed them i said nothing i just closed my eyes jack save my babies jack okay i said i glanced up at the walls and saw all around me julias face and body stretched and fitted to the room the particles retained her appearance but were now flattened onto the walls and they were still moving coordinating with the movement of her lips the blink of her eyes as i watched they began to drift back from the walls toward her in a fleshcolored haze outside the room i heard ricky shouting julia julia he kicked the door a couple of times but he didnt come in i knew he wouldnt dare i had waited a full minute so the capacitors were charged he couldnt stop me from pulsing the magnet now i could do it at willat least until the charge ran out i didnt know how long that would be jack i looked at her her eyes were sad pleading jack she said i didnt know its all right i said the particles were drifting back reassembling her face before my eyes julia was becoming solid and beautiful again i kicked the knee plate whang the particles shot away flying back to the walls though not so swiftly this time and i had the cadaverous julia in my arms again her deepset eyes pleading with me i reached into my pocket and pulled out one of the vials of phage i want you to drink this i said no no she was agitated too late for try i said i held the vial to her lips come on darling i want you to try no please not important ricky was yelling julia julia he pounded on the door julia are you all right the cadaver eyes rolled toward the door her mouth worked her skeleton fingers plucked at my shirt scratching the cloth she wanted to tell me something i turned my head again so i could hear she breathed shallowly weakly i couldnt catch the words and then suddenly they were clear she said they have to kill you now i know i said dont let them children i wont her bony hand touched my cheek she whispered you know i always loved you jack i would never hurt you i know julia i know the particles on the walls were drifting free once more now they seemed to telescope back returning to her face and body i kicked the knee plate once again hoping for more time with her but there was only a dull mechanical thunk the capacitor was drained and suddenly in a whoosh all the particles returned and julia was full and beautiful and strong as before and she pushed me away from her with a contemptuous look and said in a loud firm voice im sorry you had to see that jack so am i i said but it cant be helped were wasting time i want the bottle of virus jack and i want it right now in a way it made everything easier because i understood i wasnt dealing with julia anymore i didnt have to worry about what might happen to her i just had to worry about maeassuming she was still aliveand me and assuming i could stay alive for the next few minutes day am okay i said to her okay ill get you the virus she frowned youve got that look on your face again no i said im done ill take you good well start with those vials in your pocket what these here i said i reached into my pocket for them as i went through the door outside ricky and vince were waiting for me very fucking funny ricky said you know you could have killed her you could have killed your own wife how about that i said i was still fumbling in my pocket as if the test tubes were stuck in the cloth they didnt know what i was doing so they grabbed me again vince on one side and ricky on the other guys i said i cant do this if you let him go julia said coming out of the room like hell vince said hell pull something i was still struggling trying to bring the tubes out finally i had them in my hand while we struggled i threw one onto the ground it smashed on the concrete floor and brown sludge spattered up jesus they all jumped away releasing me they stared at the floor and bent over to look at their feet making sure none of it had touched them and in that moment i ran i grabbed the jug from its hiding place and kept going across the fabrication room i had to get all the way across the room to the elevator and ride it up to the ceiling level where all the basic system equipment was located up there where the air handlers were and the electrical junction boxesand the tank for the sprinkler system if i could reach the elevator and ride it just seven or eight feet in the air then they couldnt touch me if i could do that then my plan would work the elevator was a hundred and fifty feet away i ran hard vaulting over the lowest arms of the octopus ducking beneath the chesthigh sections i glanced back and couldnt see them through the maze of arms and machinery but i heard the three of them shouting and i heard running feet i heard julia say hes going for the sprinklers ahead i saw the yellow open cage of the elevator i was going to make it after all at that moment i stumbled over one of the arms and went sprawling the jug skidded across the floor came to rest against a support beam i scrambled quickly to my feet again and retrieved the jug i knew they were right behind me i didnt dare look back now i ran for the elevator ducking beneath one final pipe but when i looked again vince was already there he must have known a shortcut through the octopus arms somehow he had beaten me now he stood in the open cage grinning i looked back and saw ricky just a few yards behind me closing fast julia called give it up jack its no good she was right about that it was no good at all i couldnt get past vince and i couldnt outrun ricky now he was much too close i jumped over a pipe stepped around a standing electrical box and ducked down as ricky jumped the pipe i slammed my elbow upward between his legs he howled and went down rolling on the floor in agony i stopped and kicked him in the head as hard as i could that was for charley i ran at the elevator vince stood in a halfcrouch fists bunched he was relishing a fight i ran straight toward him and he grinned broadly in anticipation and at the last moment i swerved left i jumped and started climbing the ladder on the wall julia screamed stop him stop him it was difficult climbing because i had my thumb hooked through the jug the bottle kept banging painfully against the back of my right hand as i went up i focused on the pain i panic at heights and i didnt want to look down and so i couldnt see what was dragging at my legs pulling me back toward the floor i kicked but whatever it was held on to me finally i turned to look i was ten feet above the ground and two rungs beneath me ricky had his free arm locked around my legs his hand clutching my ankle he jerked at my feet and yanked them off the rung i slid for an instant and then felt a burst of searing pain in my hands but i held on ricky was smiling grimly i kicked my legs backward trying to hit his face but to no avail he had both legs locked tight against his chest he was immensely strong i kept trying until i realized that i could pull one leg up and free i did and stomped down on his hand that was holding on to the rung he yelled and released my legs to hold on to the ladder with his other hand i stomped againand kicked straight back catching him right under the chin he slid down five rungs then caught himself he hung there near the bottom of the ladder i climbed again julia was running across the floor stop him i heard the elevator grind as vince rode up past me heading toward the top he would wait for me there i climbed i was fifteen feet above the floor then twenty i looked down to see ricky pursuing me but he was far behind i didnt think he could catch me and then julia came swirling up through the air toward me spiraling like a corkscrewand grabbed the ladder right alongside me except she wasnt julia she was the swarm and for a moment the swarm was disorganized enough that i could see right through her in places i could see the swirling particles that composed her i looked down and saw the real julia deathly pale standing and looking up at me her face a skull by now the swarm alongside me became solidappearing as i had seen it become solid before it looked like julia the mouth moved and i heard a strange voice say sorry jack and the swarm shrank becoming denser still collapsing into a small julia about four feet tall i turned to climb again the small julia swung back and slammed hard against my body i felt like i was hit by a sack of cement the wind knocked out of me my grip loosened from the ladder and i barely managed to hang on as the julia swarm smashed against me again i ducked and dodged grunting in pain and kept going despite the impacts the swarm had enough mass to hurt me but not enough to knock me off the ladder the swarm must have realized it too because now the small julia swarm compressed itself into a sphere and slid smoothly forward to envelop my head in a buzzing cloud i was totally blind i could see nothing at all it was as if i was in a dust storm i groped for the next rung on the ladder and the next after that pinpricks stung my face and hands the pain becoming more intense sharper apparently the swarm was learning how to focus pain but at least it hadnt learned to suffocate the swarm did nothing to interfere with my breathing i kept on i climbed in darkness and then i felt ricky pulling at my legs again and in that moment finally i didnt see how i could go on i was twentyfive feet in the air hanging on to a ladder for dear life dragging a jug of brown sludge up with me with vince above waiting and ricky below dragging and a swarm buzzing around my head blinding me and stinging me like hell i was exhausted and defeated and i could feel my energy draining away my fingers felt shaky on the rungs i couldnt hold my grip much longer i knew that all i had to do was release my grip and fall and it would be over in an instant i was finished anyway i felt for the next rung gripped it and hauled my body up but my shoulders burned ricky was pulling down fiercely i knew he would win they would all win they were always going to win and then i thought of julia pale as a ghost and brittle thin saying in a whisper save my babies i thought of the kids waiting for me to come back i saw them sitting around the table waiting for dinner and i knew i had to go on no matter what so i did its not clear to me now what happened to ricky somehow he pulled my legs off the rungs and i hung in the air from my arms kicking wildly and i must have kicked him in the face and broken his nose because in an instant ricky let go of me and i heard a thumpthumpthumping as his body went down the ladder and he desperately tried to grab the rungs as he fell i heard ricky no and the cloud vanished from my head i was completely free again i looked down and saw the julia swarm alongside ricky who had caught himself about twelve feet above the floor he looked up angrily his mouth and nose were gushing blood he started toward me but the julia swarm said no ricky no you cant let vince and then ricky half climbed half fell the rest of the way down the ladder to the ground and the swarm reinhabited julias pale body and the two of them stood there and watched me i turned away from them and looked up the ladder vince was standing there five feet above me his feet were on the top rungs and he was leaning over blocking my way there was no possible way i could get past him i paused to take stock shifted my weight on the ladder got one leg up to the next rung hooked my free arm around the rung nearest my face but as i raised my leg i felt the lump in my pocket i paused i had one more vial of phage i reached into my pocket and drew it out to show him i pulled out the cork with my teeth hey vince i said how about a shit shower he didnt move but his eyes narrowed i moved up another rung better get back vince i said i was panting so hard i couldnt manage the proper menace get on back before you get wet one more rung i was only three rungs below him its your call vince i held the vial in my other hand i cant hit your face from down here but ill sure as hell hit your legs and shoes do you care one more rung vince stayed where he was maybe not i said you like to live dangerously i paused if i advanced another rung he could kick me in the head if i stayed where i was he would have to come down to me and i could get him so i stayed what do you say vince going to stay or go he frowned his eyes flicked back and forth from my face to the vial and back again and then he stepped away from the ladder good boy vince i came up one rung he had stepped back so far that now i couldnt see where he was i thought he was probably planning to rush me at the top so i got ready to duck down and swing laterally last rung and now i saw him he wasnt planning anything vince was shaking with panic a cornered animal huddled back in the dark recess of the walkway i couldnt read his eyes but i saw his body tremble okay vince i said im coming up i stepped onto the mesh platform i was right at the top of the stairs surrounded by roaring machinery not twenty paces away i saw the paired steel tanks for the sprinkler system i glanced down and saw ricky and julia staring up at me i wondered if they realized how close i was to my goal i looked back at vince just in time to see him pull a translucent white plastic tarp off a corner box he wrapped himself in the tarp like a shield and then with a guttural yell he charged i was right at the edge of the ladder i had no time to get out of the way i just turned sideways and braced myself against a big threefoot pipe against the coming impact vince slammed into me the vial went flying out of my hand shattering on the mesh the jug was knocked from my other hand and tumbled along the walkway coming to rest at the lip of the mesh path another few inches and it would go over i moved toward it still hiding behind the tarp vince smashed into me again i was slammed back against the pipe my head clanged on steel i slipped on the brown sludge that dripped through holes in the mesh barely kept my balance vince slammed me again in his panic he never realized i had lost my weapons or perhaps he couldnt see through the tarp he just kept pounding me with his full body and i finally slipped on the sludge and went down on my knees i immediately scrambled toward the jug which was about ten feet away that odd behavior made vince stop for a moment he pulled down the tarp saw the jug and lunged for it vaulting his whole body forward in the air but he was too late i had my hand on the jug and yanked it away just as vince landed tarp and all right where the jug had been his head banged hard on the walkway lip he was momentarily stunned shaking his head to clear it and i grabbed the edge of the tarp and yanked upward vince yelled and went over the side i watched as he hit the floor his body didnt move then the swarm came off him sliding into the air like his ghost the ghost joined ricky and julia who were looking up at me then they turned away and hurried across the floor of the fabrication room jumping over the octopus arms as they went their movements conveyed a clear sense of urgency you might even think they were frightened good i thought i got to my feet and headed for the sprinkler tanks the instructions were stenciled on the lower tank it was easy to figure out the valves i twisted the inflow unscrewed the filler cap waited for the pressurized nitrogen to hiss out and then dumped in the jug of phage i listened as it gurgled into the tank then i screwed the cap back on twisted the valve repressurized with nitrogen and i was done i took a deep breath i was going to win this thing after all i rode the elevator down feeling good for the first time all day day am they were all clustered together on the other side of the roomjulia ricky and now bobby as well vince was there too hovering in the background but i could sometimes see through him his swarm was slightly transparent i wondered which of the others were only swarms now i couldnt be sure but it didnt matter now anyway they were standing beside a bank of computer monitors that showed every parameter of the manufacturing process graphs of temperature output god knows what else but they had turned their backs to the monitors they were watching me i walked calmly toward them in measured steps i was in no rush far from it i must have taken a full two minutes to cross the fabrication room to where they were standing they regarded me with puzzlement and then with increasingly open amusement well jack julia said finally hows your day going not bad i said things are looking up you seem very confident i shrugged youve got everything under control julia said i shrugged again by the way where is mae i dont know why bobbys been looking for her he cant find her anywhere i have no idea i said why were you looking for her we thought we should all be together julia said when we finish our business here oh i said is that what happens now we finish she nodded slowly yes jack it is i couldnt risk looking at my watch i had to try and gauge how much time had passed i was guessing three or four minutes i said so what do you have in mind julia began to pace well jack im very disappointed in how things have gone with you i really am you know how much i care about you i would never want anything to happen to you but youre fighting us jack and you wont stop fighting and we cant have that i see i said we just cant jack i reached in my pocket and brought out a plastic cigarette lighter if julia or the others noticed they gave no sign she kept pacing jack you put me in a difficult position hows that youve been privileged to witness the birth of something truly new here something new and miraculous but you are not sympathetic jack no im not birth is painful so is death i said she continued to pace yes she said so is death she frowned at me something the matter where is mae she said again i dont know i dont have the faintest idea she continued to frown we have to find her jack im sure you will yes we will so you dont need me i said just do it on your own i mean youre the future if i remember right superior and unstoppable im just a guy julia started walking around me looking at me from all sides i could see she was puzzled by my behavior or appraising maybe i had overdone it gone too far she was picking up something she suspected something and that made me very nervous i turned the cigarette lighter over in my hands nervously jack she said you disappoint me you said that already yes she said but i am still not sure as if on some unspoken cue the men all began to walk in circles they were moving in concentric circles around me was this some kind of scanning procedure or did it mean something else i was trying to guess the time i figured five minutes had elapsed come jack i want to look more closely she put her arm on my shoulder and led me over to one of the big octopus arms it was easily six feet across and mirrored on its surface i could see julia standing next to me her arm over my shoulder dont we make a handsome couple its a shame we could have such a future i said yeah well and the moment i spoke a river of pale particles streamed off julia curved in the air and came down like a shower all over my body and into my mouth i clamped my mouth shut but it didnt matter because in the mirror my body seemed to dissolve away to be replaced by julias body it was as if her skin had left her flowed into the air and slid down over me now there were two julias standing side by side in front of the mirror i said cut it out julia she laughed why i think its fun stop it i said i sounded like myself even though i looked like julia stop it dont you like it i think its amusing you get to be me for a while i said stop it jack youre just no fun anymore i pulled at the juliaimage on my face trying to tear it away like a mask but i felt only my own skin beneath my fingertips when i scratched at my cheek the juliacheek showed scratches in the mirror i reached back and touched my own hair in my panic i dropped the cigarette lighter it clattered on the concrete floor get it off me i said get it off i heard a whoosh in my ears and the juliaskin was gone sweeping into the air then descending onto julia except that she now looked like me now there were two jacks side by side in the mirror is this better she said i dont know what you are trying to prove i took a breath i bent over and picked up the lighter im not trying to prove anything she said im just feeling you out jack and you know what i found youve got a secret jack and you thought i wouldnt find it out yes but i did she said i didnt know how to take her words i wasnt sure where i was anymore and the changes in appearance had so unnerved me that i had lost track of the time youre worried about the time arent you jack she said you neednt be we have plenty of time everything is under control here are you going to tell us your secret or do we have to make you tell behind her i could see the stacked monitor screens of the control station the corner ones had a flashing bar along the top with lettering that i couldnt read i could see that some of the graphs were rising steeply their lines turning from blue to yellow to red as they climbed i did nothing julia turned to the men okay she said make him tell the three men converged toward me it was time to show them it was time to spring my trap no problem i said i raised my lighter flicked the flame and held it under the nearest sprinkler head the men stopped in their tracks they watched me i held the lighter steady the sprinkler head blackened with the smoke and nothing happened the flame was melting the soft metal tab beneath the sprinkler head splotches of silver were dripping on the ground at my feet and still nothing happened the sprinklers didnt come on oh shit i said julia was watching me thoughtfully it was a nice try very inventive jack good thinking but you forgot one thing whats that theres a safety system for the plant and when we saw you going for the sprinklers ricky turned the system off safeties off sprinklers off she shrugged guess youre out of luck jack i flicked the lighter off there was nothing for me to do i just stood there feeling foolish i thought i smelled a faint odor in the room a kind of sweetish nauseating odor but i couldnt be sure it was a nice try though julia said but enough is enough she turned to the men and jerked her head the three of them walked toward me i said hey guys come on they didnt react their faces were impassive they grabbed me and i started to struggle hey come on now i pulled free of them hey ricky said dont make it any harder for us jack and i said fuck you ricky and i spit in his face just as they threw me to the floor i was hoping the virus would get in his mouth i was hoping i would delay him that we would have a fight anything for a delay but they threw me to the floor and then they all fell on me and began to strangle me i could feel their hands on my neck bobby had his hands over my mouth and nose i tried to bite him he just kept his hands firmly in place and stared at me ricky smiled distantly at me it was as if he didnt know me had no feeling for me they were all strangers killing me efficiently and quickly i pounded on them with my fists until ricky got his knee on one of my arms pinning it down and bobby got the other arm now i couldnt move at all i tried to kick my legs but julia was sitting on my legs helping them out i saw the world start to turn misty before my eyes a faint and misty gray then there was a faint popping sound almost like popcorn or glass cracking and then julia screamed what is that the three men released me and got to their feet they walked away from me i lay on the ground coughing i didnt even try to get up what is that julia yelled the first of the octopus tubes burst open high above us brown liquid steam hissed out another tube popped open and another the sound of hissing filled the room the air was turning dark foggy brown billowing brown julia screamed what is that its the assembly line ricky said its overheated and its blowing how how can that happen i sat up still coughing and got to my feet i said no safety systems remember you turned them off now its blowing virus all through this room not for long julia said well have the safeties back in two seconds ricky was already standing at the control board frantically hitting keys good thinking julia i said i lit my cigarette lighter and held it under the sprinkler head julia screamed stop ricky stop ricky stopped i said damned if you do damned if you dont julia turned in fury and hissed i hate you already her body was turning shades of gray fading to a kind of monochrome so was ricky the color washing out of him it was the virus in the air already affecting their swarms there was a brief crackle of sparks from high in the octopus arms then another short lightning arc ricky saw it and yelled forget it julia we take our chances he hit the keys and turned the safety system back on alarms started to sound the screens flashed red with the excess concentrations of methane and other gases the main screen showed safety systems on and the sprinklers burst into cones of brown spray they screamed as the water touched them they were writhing and beginning to shrink to shrivel right before my eyes julias face was contorted she stared at me with pure hatred but already she was starting to dissolve she fell to her knees and then onto her back the others were all rolling on the floor screaming in pain come on jack someone was tugging at my sleeve it was mae come on she said this room is full of methane you have to go i hesitated still looking at julia then we turned and ran day am the helicopter pilot pushed the doors open as we ran across the pad we jumped in mae said go he said ill have to insist you get your harnesses on before fly this fucking thing i yelled sorry its a regulation and its not safe black smoke started to pour out of the power station door we had just come out of it billowed into the blue desert sky the pilot saw it and said hang on we lifted off and headed north swinging wide of the building now there was smoke coming from all the exhaust vents near the roof a black haze was rising into the air mae said fire burns the nanoparticles and the bacteria too dont worry the pilot said where are we going home he headed west and within minutes we had left the building behind it disappeared below the horizon mae was sitting back in her seat eyes closed i said to her i thought it was going to blow up but they turned the safety system back on again so i guess it wont she said nothing i said so what was the big rush to get out of there and where were you anyway nobody could find you she said i was outside in the storage shed doing what looking for more thermite find any there was no sound just a flash of yellow light that spread across the desert horizon for an instant and then faded you could almost believe it never happened but the helicopter rocked and jolted as the shock wave passed us the pilot said holy mother of god what was that industrial accident i said very unfortunate he reached for his radio i better report it yes i said you better do that we flew west and i saw the green line of the forest and the rolling foothills of the sierras as we crossed into california day pm its late almost midnight the house is silent around me i am not sure how this will turn out the kids are all desperately sick throwing up after i gave them the virus i can hear my son and daughter retching in separate bathrooms i went in to check on them a few minutes ago to see what was coming up their faces were deathly pale i can see theyre afraid because they know im afraid i havent told them about julia yet they havent asked theyre too sick to ask right now im worried most about the baby because i had to give her the virus too it was her only hope ellens with her now but ellen is vomiting too the baby has yet to throw up i dont know whether thats good or bad young kids react differently i think im okay at least for the moment im dead tired i think ive been dozing off from time to time all night right now im sitting here looking out the back window waiting for mae she hopped the fence at the end of my backyard and is probably scrambling around in the brush on the slope that goes down behind the property where the sprinklers are she thought there was a faint green light coming from somewhere down the slope i told her not to go down there alone but im too tired to go get her if she waits until tomorrow the army can come here with flame throwers and blast the hell out of whatever it is the army is acting dumb about this whole thing but i have julias computer here at home and i have an email trail on her hard drive i removed the hard drive just to be safe i duped it and put the original in a safe deposit box in town im not really worried about the army im worried about larry handler and the others at xymos they know they have horrific lawsuits on their hands the company will declare bankruptcy sometime this week but theyre still liable for criminal charges larry especially i wouldnt cry if he went to jail mae and i have managed to put together most of the events of the past few days my daughters rash was caused by gamma assemblersthe micromachines that assembled finished molecules from component fragments the gammas must have been on julias clothing when she came home from the lab julia worried about that possibility that was why she took a shower as soon as she got home the lab itself had good decontamination procedures but julia was interacting with the swarms outside the lab she knew there was a danger anyway that night she accidentally let the gammas loose in the nursery the gamma assemblers are designed to cut microfragments of silicon but faced with a pliable substance like skin they only pinch it its painful and causes microtrauma of a sort that nobody had ever seen before or would ever have suspected no wonder amanda didnt have a fever she didnt have an infection she had a coating of biting particles on her skin the magnetic field of the mri cured her in an instant all the assemblers were yanked away from her in the first pulse apparently that is also what happened to the guy in the desert he somehow came in contact with a batch of assemblers he had been camping within a mile of the xymos desert facility julia knew what was wrong with amanda but she didnt tell anybody instead she called the xymos cleanup crew which showed up in the middle of the night while i was at the hospital only eric saw them and now i know what he saw because the same crew arrived here a few hours ago to sweep my house they were the same men id seen in the van on the road that night the lead man wears a silver bunny suit thats antimagnetic and he does look ghostly his silvered mask makes him appear faceless he goes into the environment first to check it out then four other men in coveralls follow to vacuum and clean up i had told eric hed dreamed it but he hadnt the crew left behind one of their sensor cubes under amandas bed that was intentional to check for residual gammas in case theyd missed any it wasnt a surge suppressor it was just constructed to look like one when i finally figured all this out i was furious with julia for not telling me what was going on for making me worry but of course she was diseased and theres no point in being angry with her now erics mp player was cut by gamma assemblers the same way the cars in the desert were and just as the mri was for some reason the gamma assemblers cut memory chips and leave central processors alone i havent heard an explanation why there was a swarm in the convertible with julia that night it had come back with her from the desert i dont know whether she brought it intentionally or not the swarm could collapse into nothing which is why eric didnt see anything when he went out to the car to look and i wasnt sure of what i saw when she pulled away which was reasonable enough the swarm was probably catching the light in odd ways in my memory it looked a little like ricky but it was probably too soon for the swarm to be taking on appearances it hadnt evolved that much yet or maybe i just saw an indistinct shape and in my jealousy i imagined it to be a person i dont think i made it up but maybe i did ellen thinks i might have after her car crashed julia called for the cleanup crews thats why they were there on the road late that night they were waiting to go down the hill and clean up the site i dont know what caused the crash itself whether it was something to do with the swarm or whether it was just an accident theres no one to ask about it now the facility in the desert was entirely destroyed there was enough methane in the main laboratory to produce a fireball in excess of two thousand degrees fahrenheit any biological materials would have been incinerated but i still worry they never found any bodies in the ruins not even skeletons mae took the bacteriophage to her old lab in palo alto i hope she made them understand how desperate the situation is shes being very quiet about their reaction i think they should put the phage into the water supply but mae says the chlorine will take it out maybe there should be a vaccine program as far as we know the phage works to kill the swarms sometimes i have ringing in my ears which is a worrisome sign and i feel a vibrating in my chest and abdomen i cant tell if i am just paranoid or if something is really happening to me i try to keep a brave face for the kids but of course you cant fool kids they know im frightened the last mystery to be cleared up was why the swarms always returned to the laboratory it never made any sense to me i kept worrying about it because it was such an unreasonable goal it didnt fit the predprey formulations why would a predator keep returning to a particular location of course in retrospect there was only one possible answer the swarms were intentionally programmed to return the goal was explicitly defined by the programmers themselves but why would anybody program in a goal like that i didnt know until a few hours ago the code that ricky showed me wasnt the code they had actually used on the particles he couldnt show me the real code because i would have known immediately what had been done ricky didnt ever tell me nobody ever told me what bothers me most is an email i found on julias hard drive earlier today it was from her to ricky morse with a cc to larry handler the head of xymos outlining the procedure to follow to get the camera swarm to work in high wind the plan was to intentionally release a swarm into the environment and thats exactly what they did they pretended it was an accidental release caused by missing air filters thats why ricky gave me that long guided tour and the song and dance about the contractor and ventilation system but none of what he told me was true the release was planned it was intentional from the beginning when they couldnt make the swarm work in high wind they tried to engineer a solution they failed the particles were just too small and lightand arguably too stupid too they had design flaws from the beginning and now they couldnt solve them their whole multimilliondollar defense project was going down the drain and they couldnt solve it so they decided to make the swarm solve it for them they reconfigured the nanoparticles to add solar power and memory they rewrote the particle program to include a genetic algorithm and they released the particles to reproduce and evolve and see if the swarm could learn to survive on its own and they succeeded it was so dumb it was breathtaking i didnt understand how they could have embarked on this plan without recognizing the consequences like everything else id seen at xymos it was jerrybuilt halfbaked concocted in a hurry to solve present problems and never a thought to the future that might be typical corporate thinking when you were under the gun but with technologies like these it was dangerous as hell but of course the real truth was more complicated the technology itself invited the behavior distributed agent systems ran by themselves that was how they functioned that was the whole point you set them up and let them go you got in the habit of doing that you got in the habit of treating agent networks that way autonomy was the point of it all but it was one thing to release a population of virtual agents inside a computers memory to solve a problem it was another thing to set real agents free in the real world they just didnt see the difference or they didnt care to see it and they set the swarm free the technical term for this is selfoptimization the swarm evolves on its own the less successful agents die off and the more successful agents reproduce the next generation after ten or a hundred generations the swarm evolves toward a best solution an optimum solution this kind of thing is done all the time inside the computer its even used to generate new computer algorithms danny hillis did one of the first of those runs years back to optimize a sorting algorithm to see if the computer could figure out how to make itself work better the program found a new method other people quickly followed his lead but it hasnt been done with autonomous robots in the real world as far as i know this was the first time maybe its already happened and we just didnt hear about it anyway im sure itll happen again probably soon its two in the morning the kids finally stopped vomiting theyve gone to sleep they seem to be peaceful the baby is asleep ellen is still pretty sick i must have dozed off again i dont know what woke me i see mae coming up the hill from behind my house shes with the guy in the silver suit and the rest of the ssvt team shes walking toward me i can see that shes smiling i hope her news is good i could use some good news right now julias original email says we have nothing to lose but in the end they lost everythingtheir company their lives everything and the ironic thing is the procedure worked the swarm actually solved the problem they had set for it but then it kept going kept evolving and they let it they didnt understand what they were doing im afraid that will be on the tombstone of the human race i hope its not we might get lucky bibliography this novel is entirely fictitious but the
