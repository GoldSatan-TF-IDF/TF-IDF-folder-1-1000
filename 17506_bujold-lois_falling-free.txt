lois mcmaster bujold falling free chapter the shining rim of the planet rodeo wheeled dizzily past the observation port of the orbital transfer station a woman whom leo graf recognized as one of his fellow disembarking passengers from the jump ship stared eagerly out for a few minutes then turned away blinking and swallowing to sit rather abruptly on one of the bright cushioned lounge chairs her eyes closed opened caught leos she shrugged in embarrassment leo smiled sympathetically immune himself to the assorted nauseas of space travel he moved to take her place at the crystal viewport scanty cloud cover swirled in the thin atmosphere far below barely veiling what seemed excessive quantities of red desert sand rodeo was a marginal world home only to galactech mining and drilling operations and their support facilities but what was he doing here leo wondered anew underground operations were hardly his field of expertise the planet slid from view with the rotation of the station leo moved to another port for a view back toward the hub of the stations wheel noting the stress points and wondering when theyd last been xrayed for secretly propagating flaws centrifugal gforces here at the rim where this passenger lounge was situated seemed to be running at about half earthstandard a little light perhaps deliberately stressreduced trouble anticipated in the structure but he was here for training theyd said at galactech headquarters on earth to teach quality control procedures in free fall welding and construction to whom why here at the end of nowhere the cay project was a singularly uninformative title for his assignment leo graf leo turned yes the speaker was tall and darkhaired perhaps thirty perhaps forty he wore conservativefashionable civilian clothes but a quiet lapel pin marked him as a company man best sedentary executive type leo decided the hand he held out for leo to shake was evenly tanned but soft im bruce van atta leos thick hand was pale but flecked with brown spots crowding forty sandy and square leo wore comfortable red company coveralls by long habit partly to blend with the workers he supervised mostly that he need never waste time and thought deciding what to put on in the morning graf read the label printed over his left breast pocket eliminating all mystery welcome to rodeo the armpit of the universe grinned van atta thank you leo smiled back automatically im head of the cay project now ill be your boss van atta amplified i requested you personally yknow youre going to help me get this division moving at last jack it up and light a fire under it youre like me i know got no patience with deadheads it was a hell of a job to have dumped on me trying to make this division profitablebut if i succeed ill be the golden boy requested me cheering to think that his reputation preceded him but why couldnt one ever be requested by somebody at a garden spot ah well they told me at hq that i was being sent out here to give an expanded version of my short course in nondestructive testing is that all they told you van atta asked in astonishment at leos affirmative shrug he threw back his head and laughed security i suppose van atta went on when hed stopped chuckling are you in for a surprise well well i wont spoil it van attas sly grin was as irritating as a familiar poke in the ribs too familiaroh hell leo thought this guy knows me from somewhere and he thinks i know him leos polite smile became fixed in mild panic he had met thousands of galactech personnel in his eighteenyear career perhaps van atta would say something soon to narrow the possibilities my instructions listed a dr cay as titular head of the cay project leo probed will i be meeting him old data said van atta dr cay died last yearseveral years past the date he should have been forcibly retired in my opinion but he was a vicepresident and major stockholder and thoroughly entrenchedbut thats blood over the damned dam eh i replaced him van atta shook his head but i cant wait to see the look on your face when you seecome along i have a private shuttle waiting they had the sixman personnel shuttle to themselves but for the pilot the passenger seat molded itself to leos body during the brief periods of acceleration quite brief periods clearly they were not braking for planetary reentry rodeo turned beneath them falling farther away where are we going leo asked van atta seated beside him ah said van atta see that speck about thirty degrees above the horizon watch it its home base for the cay project the speck grew rapidly into a farflung chaotic structure all angles and projections with confetticolored lights spangling its sharp shadows leos practiced eye picked out the clues to its function the tanks the ports the greenhouse filters winking in the sunlight the size of the solar panels versus the estimated volume of the structure an orbital habitat you got it said van atta its huge indeed how many personnel would you guess it could handle ohfifteen hundred van attas eyebrows rose in slight disappointment perhaps at not being able to offer a correction almost exactly four hundredninetyfour rotating galactech personnel and a thousand permanent inhabitants leos lips echoed the word permanent speaking of rotationhow are you handling nullgee deconditioning in your people i dont his eyes inventoried the enormous structure i dont even see an exercise wheel no spinning gym theres a nullgee gym the rotating personnel get a month downside after every threemonth shift expensive but we put the habitat up there for less than a quarter of the cost of the same volume of living quarters in onegee spinners but surely youll lose what youve saved in construction costs over time in personnel transportation and medical expenses argued leo the extra shuttle trips the long leavesevery retiree who breaks an arm or a leg until the day he dies will be suing galactech for the cost of it plus mental anguish whether he had significant bone demineralization or not weve solved that problem too said van atta whether the solution is costeffectivewell thats what you and i are here to try and prove the shuttle sidled delicately into alignment with a hatch on the side of the habitat and seated itself with a reassuringly authoritative click the pilot shut down his systems and unbuckled himself to float past leo and van atta and check the hatch seals ready for disembarking mr van atta thank you grant leo released his seat restraints and stretched and relaxed in the pleasureable familiarity of weightlessness not for him the unfortunate nauseas of nullgee that sapped the efficiency of so many employees leos body was ordinary enough downside here where control and practice and wit counted more than strength he was at last an athlete smiling a little to himself he followed van atta from handgrip to handgrip and through the shuttle hatch a pinkfaced tech manned a control panel just inside the shuttle hatch corridor he wore a red tshirt with the galactech logo over his left breast tight blond curls cut close to his head reminded leo of a lambs pelt perhaps it was an effect of his obvious youth hello there tony van atta greeted him with cheerful familiarity good afternoon mr van atta the youth replied deferentially he smiled at leo and cocked his head at van atta in a pantomime plea for an introduction is this the new teacher you were telling us about indeed he is leo graf this is tonyhell be among your first trainees hes one of the habitats permanent residents van atta added with peculiar emphasis tony is a welder and joiner second gradeworking on first eh tony shake hands with mr graf van atta was smirking leo had the impression that if he hadnt been in free fall he would have been bouncing on his heels tony pulled himself obediently over the control panel he wore red shorts leo blinked and caught his breath in shock the boy had no legs emerging from his shorts were a second set of arms functional arms he was even now using hishis lower left hand leo supposed hed have to call itto anchor himself as he reached out to leo his smile was perfectly unselfconscious leo had lost his own hand grip and had to fumble to retrieve it and stretch awkwardly to meet the proffered handshake how do you do leo managed to croak it was almost impossible not to stare leo forced his gaze to focus on the young mans bright blue eyes hello sir ive been looking forward to meeting you tonys handshake was shy but sincere his hand dry and strong um leo stumbled um whats your last name uh tony oh tonys just my nickname sir my full designation is tyxg i uhguess ill call you tony then leo murmured increasingly stunned van atta most unhelpfully seemed to be thoroughly enjoying leos discomforture everybody does said tony agreeably fetch mr grafs bag will you tony said van atta come on leo ill show you your quarters and then we can do the grand tour leo followed his floating guide into the indicated crosscorridor glancing back over his shoulder in renewed amazement as tony launched himself accurately across the chamber and swung through the shuttle hatch thats leo swallowed thats the most extraordinary birth defect ive ever seen somebody had a stroke of genius to find him a job in free fall hed be a cripple downside birth defect van attas grin had grown twisted yeah thats one way of describing it i wish you could have seen the look on your face when he popped up like that i congratulate you on your selfcontrol i about puked when i first saw one and i was prepared you get used to the little chimps pretty quick though theres more than one van atta opened and closed his hands in a counting gesture an even onethousand the first generation of galactechs new superworkers the name of the game leo is bioengineering and i intend to win tony with leos valise clutched in his lower right hand swooped between leo and van atta in the cylindrical corridor and braked to a halt in front of them with three deft touches on the passing handgrips mr van atta can i introduce mr graf to somebody on the way to visitors wing it wont be much out of the wayhydroponics van attas lips pursed then arranged themselves in a kindly smile why not hydroponics is on the itinerary for this afternoon anyway thank you sir cried tony and darted off with enthusiasm to open the air safety seal before them at the end of the corridor and linger to close it again behind them on the other side leo fastened his attention on his surroundings as a lessrude alternative to surreptitiously studying the boy the habitat was indeed inexpensively constructed mostly prefab units variously combined not the most aesthetically elegant designa certain higgledypiggledy randomness indicated an organic growth pattern since the habitats inception units stuck on here and there to accommodate new needs but its very dullness incorporated safety advantages leo approved the interchangeability of airseal systems for example they passed dormitory wings food preparation and dining areas a workshop for small repairsleo paused to gaze down its length and had to hurry to catch up with his guide unlike most freefall living spaces leo had worked in there was no effort here to maintain an arbitrary upanddown to ease the visual psychology of the inhabitants most chambers were cylindrical in design with work spaces and storage efficiently packing the walls and the center left free of obstruction for the passage ofwell one could hardly call them pedestrians en route they passed a couple of dozen of thethe fourhanded people the new model workers tonys folk whatever they were calleddid they have an official designation leo wondered he stared covertly breaking off his gaze whenever one looked back which was often they stared openly at him and whispered among themselves he could see why van atta dubbed them chimps they were thinhipped lacking the powerful gluteal locomotor muscles of people with legs the lower set of arms tended to be more muscular than the uppers in both males and females powergrippers and thus appeared falsely short by comparison to the uppers bowlegged if he squinted them to a blur they were dressed mostly in the sort of comfortable practical tshirt and shorts that tony wore evidently colorcoded for leo passed a cluster of them all in yellow hovering intently around a normal human in galactech coveralls who had a pump unit halfapart lecturing on its function and repair leo thought of a flock of canaries of flying squirrels of monkeys of spiders of swift bright lizards of the sort that run straight up walls they made him want to scream almost to weep and yet it wasnt the arms or the quick toomany hands he had almost reached hydroponics before he was able to analyze his intense unease it was their faces that bothered him so leo realized they were the faces of children a door marked hydroponics d slid aside to reveal an antechamber and a large airy end chamber extending some fifteen meters beyond filtered windows on the sun side and an array of mirrors on the dark side filled the volume with brilliant light softened by green plants that grew from a carefullyarranged set of grow tubes the air was pungent with chemicals and vegetation a pair of the fourarmed young women both in blue were at work in the antechamber a plexiplastic grow tube three meters long was braced in place and they floated along its length carefully transplanting tiny seedlings from a germination box into a spiral series of holes along the tube one plant per hole fixing them in place with flexible sealant around each tender stalk the roots would grow inward becoming a tangled mat to absorb the nutritive hydroponic mist pumped through the tube and the leaves and stems would bush out in the sunlight and eventually bear whatever fruit was their genetic destiny in this place probably apples with antlers thought leo in mild hysteria or potatoes with eyes that really winked at you the darkhaired girl paused to adjust a bundle under her arm leos mind ground to a complete halt the bundle was a baby a live babyof course it was alive what did he expect leo gibbered inwardly it peered around itsmotherstorso to glower suspiciously at leothestranger and tightened its fourhanded clutch on home base taking a squishy defensive grip on one of the girls breasts as if in fear of competition ackle it remarked aggressively ow the darkhaired girl laughed and spared a lower hand to pry the little fat fingers loose without missing a beat of her upper hands parting sealant in place around a stem she finished with a quick squirt of fixative from a tube floating conveniently beside her just out of the infants reach the girl was slim and elvish and wonderfully weird to leos unaccustomed eyes her short fine hair clung close to her head framing her face shaped to a point at the nape of her neck it was so thick it reminded leo of cat fur one might stroke it and be soothed the other girl was blonde and babyless she looked up first and smiled company claire the darkhaired girls face lit with pleasure leo flushed in the heat of it tony she cried happily and leo realized he had merely received an accidental dose as it were of that beam of delight as it swept over him to its true target the baby released three hands and waved them urgently ah ah the girl turned in air to face the visitors ah ah ah the baby repeated oh all right she laughed you want to fly to daddy hm she unhooked a short tether from a sort of soft harness on the babys torso to a belt around her own waist and held the infant out fly to daddy andy fly to daddy the baby indicated enthusiasm for the proposal by waving all four hands vigorously about and squealing eagerly she launched him toward tony with considerably more velocity than leo would have dared to impart tony grinning cheerfully caught himhandily leo thought in blitzed inanity fly to mommy tony inquired in turn ah ah the baby agreed and tony hung him in air gently pulling his arms outlike straightening out a starfish leo thoughtand imparting a spin rolled him through the air for all the world like a wheel the baby pulled his hands in clenching his face in sympathetic effort and spun faster and gurgled with laughter at the success of his effort conservation of angular momentum thought leo naturally claire tossed the infant back one more time to his fathermindboggling to think of that blond boy as a father of anythingand followed herself to brake to a halt handtohand against tony who proffered an automatic helping grasp for that purpose that they continued to hold hands was clearly more than a courteous anchoring claire this is mr graf tony did not so much introduce as display him like a prize hes going to be my advanced welding techniques teacher mr graf this is claire and this is our son andy andy had clambered headward on his father and was wrapping one hand in tonys blond hair and another around one ear blinking owlishly at leo tony gently rescued the ear and redirected the clutch to the fabric of his red tshirt claire was picked to be the very first natural mother of us tony went on proudly me and four other girls claire corrected modestly claire used to be in welding and joining too but she cant do outside work any more tony explained shes been in housekeeping nutrition technology and hydroponics since andy was born dr yei said i was a very important experiment to see which sorts of productivity were least compromised by my taking care of andy at the same time explained claire i sort of miss going outsideit was excitingbut i like this too more variety galactech reinvents womens work thought leo bemusedly are we about to put an rd group to work on the applications of fire too but oh you are certainly an experiment his thought was unreflected in his bland closed face happy to meet you claire he said gravely claire nudged tony and nodded toward her blonde coworker who had drifted over to join the group ohand this is silver tony went on obediently she works in hydroponics most of the time silver nodded her mediumshort hair drifted in soft platinum waves and leo wondered if it was the source of her nickname she had the sort of strong facial bones that are sharp and unhappily awkward at thirteen arrestingly elegant at thirtyfive now not quite halfway through their transition her blue gaze was cooler and less shy than the busy claires who was already distracted by some new demand from andy claire retrieved the baby and reattached his safety line good afternoon mr van atta silver added particularly she pirouetted in air with eyes that cried silently notice me leo noticed that all twenty of her manicured fingernails were lacquered pink van attas answering smile was secretive and smug afternoon silver hows it going we have one more tube to plant after this one well be finished ahead of shift change silver offered fine fine said van atta jovially ahdo try to remember to arrange yourself rightside up when youre talking to a downsider sugarplum silver inverted herself hastily to match van attas orientation since the room was radially arranged rightsideup was a purely van attacentric direction leo noted dryly where had he met the man before well carry on girls van atta led out leo following tony bringing up the rear regretfully looking back over his shoulder andy had returned his attention to his mother his determined little hands foraging up her shirt on which dark stains were spreading in autonomic response apparently that was one bit of ancient biology the company had not altered the milk dispensers were certainly ideally preadapted to life in free fall after all and even diapers had a heroic history in the dawn of space travel leo had heard his brief amusement drained away and he pushed off after van atta silent and reflective he held his judgment suspended he reassured himself not paralyzed in the meantime a closed mouth could not impede the inflow of data they paused at van attas habitat office van atta switched on the lights and air circulation as they entered from the stale smell leo guessed the office was not often used the executive probably spent most of his time more comfortably downside a large viewport framed a spectacular view of rodeo ive come up in the world a bit since we last met said van atta matching his gaze the upper atmosphere along rodeos rim was producing some gorgeous prismatic light effects at this angle of view in several senses i dont mind returning the favor the man at the top owes it to remember how he got there i think noblesse oblige and all that the tilt of van attas eyebrow invited leo to join him in selfcongratulatory satisfaction remember quite leos blank memory was getting excruciatingly uncomfortable he smiled and seized the pause while van atta activated his desk comconsole to turn away and make a slow politelywaitingtype orbit of the room as if idly examining its contents a little wall plaque bearing a humorous motto caught his eye on the sixth day god saw he couldnt do it all it read so he created engineers leo snorted mildly amused i like that too commented van atta looking up to check the cause of his chuckle my exwife gave it to me it was about the only thing the greedy bitch didnt take back when we split were you an leo began and swallowed the words engineer then as he finally remembered and then wondered how he could ever have forgotten leo had known van atta as an engineering subordinate at that time though not as an executive superior was this sleek gogetter the same idiot he had kicked impatiently upstairs to administration just to get him out from underfoot on the morita station projectten twelve years ago now bruciebaby oh yes oh hell van attas comconsole disgorged a couple of data disks which he plucked off you put me on the fast track ive always thought it must give you a sense of satisfaction since you spend so much of your time training to see one of your old students make good van atta was no more than five years younger than leo leo suppressed profound irritationhe wasnt this papershufflers ninetyyearold retired sunday school teacher damn it he was a working engineer handson and not afraid to get them dirty either his technical work was as close to perfection as his relentless conscientiousness could push it his safety record spoke for itself he let his anger go with a sigh wasnt it always so hed seen dozens of subordinates forge ahead often men hed trained himself yeah and trust van atta to make it seem a weakness and not a point of pride van atta spun the data disks across the room at him theres your roster and your syllabus come on and ill show you some of the equipment youll be working with galactechs got two projects in the wind theyre thinking of finally turning these cay project quaddies loose on quaddies the official nickname its not um pejorative van atta stared then snorted no what you do not call them out loud however is mutants genetic paranoia being what it is after that nuovo brasilian military cloning fiasco this whole project could have been carried out much more conveniently in earth orbit but for the assorted legal hysterias about human gene manipulation anyway the projects one to assemble jump ships in orbit around orient iv and another building a deep space transfer facility at some nexus away the hellandgone beyond tau ceti called kline stationcold work no habitable planets in the system and its sun is a cinder but the local space harbors no less than six wormhole exits potentially very profitable lots of welding under the most difficult freefall conditions leos brief angst was swallowed in interest it had always been the work itself not the pay and perks that held him in thrall screw executive privilegedidnt it mostly mean being stuck downside he followed van atta out of the office back into the corridor where tony still waited patiently with his luggage i suppose it was the development of the uterine replicators that made it all possible van atta opined while leo stowed his gear in his new quarters more than a mere sleep cubicle the chamber included private sanitary facilities and a comconsole as well as comfortablelooking sleep restraintsno morning backache on this job leo thought with minor satisfaction headache was another problem id heard something about those things said leo another invention from beta colony wasnt it van atta nodded the outer worlds are getting too damn clever these days earths going to lose its edge if it doesnt shape up too true leo thought yet the history of innovation suggested this was an inevitable pattern management who had made huge capital investments in one system were naturally loathe to scrap it and so the latecomers forged aheadto the frustration of loyal engineers id thought the use of uterine replicators was limited to obstetrical emergencies actually the only limitation on their use is the feet that theyre hideously expensive said van atta its probably only a matter of time before rich women everywhere start ducking their biological duties and cooking up their kids in em but for galactech it meant that human bioengineering experiments could at last be carried out without involving a lot of flaky fostermothers to carry the implanted embryos a neat clean controlled engineering approach better still these quaddies are total constructsthat is their genes are taken from so many sources its impossible to identify their genetic parents either saves quantities of legal grief ill bet said leo faintly this whole thing was dr cays obsession i gather i never met him but he must have been one of those you know charismatic types to push through a project with this enormous lead time before any possible payoff the first batch is just turning twenty the extra arms are the wildest part ive often wished i had four hands in free fall leo murmured trying not to sound too dubious out loud but most of the changes were this bunch of metabolic stuff they never get motionsicksomething about rewiring the vestibular systemand their muscles maintain tone with an exercise regimen of barely fifteen minutes a day maxnothing like the hours you and i would have to put in during a long stint in nullgee their bones dont deteriorate at all theyre even more radiationresistant than us bone marrow and gonads can take four and five times the rems we can absorb before galactech grounds usalthough the medical types are pushing for them to do their reproducing early in life while all those expensive genes are still pristine after that its all gravy for us workers who never require downside leave so healthy theyll go on and on cutting highcost turnover theyre even van atta snickered selfreplicating leo secured the last of his scanty personal possessions where will they go when they uh retire he asked slowly van atta shrugged i suppose the company will have to work something out when the time comes not my problem fortunately ill be retired before then what happens if theyquit go elsewhere suppose somebody offers them higher pay galactech will be outofpocket for all the rd ah i dont think youve quite grasped the beauty of this setup they dont quit they arent employees theyre capital equipment they arent paid in moneythough i wish my salary was equal to what galactech is spending yearly to maintain em but that will get better as the last replicator cohort gets older and more selfsufficient they stopped producing new ones about five years ago see in anticipation of turning that job over to the quaddies themselves van atta licked his lips and raised his eyebrows as if in enjoyment of a salacious joke leo could not regret missing its point leo turned curling in air and crossing his arms spacers union is going to call it slave labor you know he said at last the unions going to call it worse names than that their productivity is going to look sick growled van atta loaded language bullshit these little chimps have cradle to grave security galactech couldnt be treating them better if they were made of solid platinum you and i should have so good a deal leo ah said leo and no more chapter the observation bubble on the side of the cay habitat had a televiewer leo discovered to his delight and furthermore it was unoccupied at the moment his own quarters lacked a viewport he slipped within his schedule allowed this one free day to recover from trip fatigue and jump lag before his course was to begin a good nights sleep in free fall had already improved his tone of mind vastly over yesterday after van attasleo could only dub it disorientation tour the curve of rodeos horizon bisected the view from the bubble and beyond it the vast sweep of stars just now one of rodeos little mice moons crept across the panorama a glint above the horizon caught leos eye he adjusted the televiewer for a closeup a galactech shuttle was bringing up one of the giant cargo pods refined petrochemicals or bulk plastics bound for petroleumdepleted earth perhaps a collection of similar pods floated in orbit leo counted one two three six and the one arriving made seven two or three little manned pushers were already starting to bundle the pods to be locked together and attached to one of the big orbitbreaking thruster units once grouped and attached to their thruster the pods would be aimed toward the distant wormhole exit point that gave access to rodeo local space velocity and direction imparted the thruster would detach and return to rodeo orbit for the next load the unmanned pod bundle would continue on its slow cheap way to its target one of a long train stretching from rodeo to the anomaly in space that was the jump point once there the cargo pods would be captured and decelerated by a similar thruster and positioned for the jump then the superjumpers would take over cargo carriers as specially designed as the thrusters for their task the monster cargo jumpers were hardly more than a pair of necklin field generator rods in their protective housings so positioned as to be fitted around a constellation of pod bundles a bracketing pair of normal space thruster arms and a small control chamber for the jump pilot and his neurological headset without their balancing pod bundles attached the superjumpers reminded leo of some exceptionally weird and attenuated longlegged insects each jump pilot neurologically wired to his ship to navigate the wavering realities of wormhole space made two hops a day inbound to rodeo with empty pod bundles and back out again with cargo followed by a day off two months on duty followed by a months unpaid but compulsory gravity leave usually financially augmented with shuttle duties jumps were more wearing on pilots than nullgee was the pilots of the fast passenger ships like the one leo had ridden in on yesterday called the superjumper pilots puddlejumpers and merrygoround riders the cargo pilots just called the passenger pilots snobs leo grinned and considered that train of wealth gliding through space no doubt about it the cay habitat fascinating as it was was just the tail of the dog to the whole of galactechs rodeo operation that single thrusterload of pods being bundled now could maintain a whole town full of stockholding widows and orphans in style for a year and it was just one of an apparently endless string base production was like an inverted pyramid those at the bottom apex supporting a broadening mountain of tenpercenters a fact which usually gave leo more secret pride than irritation mr graf an alto voice interrupted his thoughts im dr sondra yei i head up the psychology and training department for the cay habitat the woman hovering in the door wore pale green company coveralls pleasantly ugly pushing middleaged she had the bright mongolian eyes broad nose and lips and coffeeandcream skin of her mixed racial heritage she pushed herself through the aperture with the concise relaxed movements of one accustomed to free fall ah yes they told me youd be wanting to talk to me leo courteously waited for her to anchor herself before attempting to shake hands leo gestured at the televiewer got a nice view of the orbital cargo marshalling here seems to me that might be another job for your quaddies indeed theyve been doing it for almost a year now yei smiled satisfaction so you dont find adjusting to the quaddies too difficult so your psyche profile suggested good oh the quaddies are all right leo stopped short of expanding on his unease he was not sure he could put it into words anyway i was just surprised at first understandable you dont think youll have trouble teaching them then leo smiled they cant possibly be worse than the crew of roustabouts i trained at jupiter orbital i didnt mean trouble from them yei smiled again you will find they are very intelligent and attentive students quick quite literally good children and thats what i want to talk about she paused as if marshalling her thoughts like the distant cargo pushers the galactech teachers and trainers occupy a parental role here for the habitat family although parentless the quaddies themselves must somedayindeed are already becoming parents from the beginning weve been at pains to assure they were provided with role models of stable adult responsibility but they are still children they will be watching you closely i want you to be aware and take care theyll be learning more than welding from you theyll also be picking up your other patterns of behavior in short if you have any bad habitsand we all have somethey must be parked downside for the duration of your stay in other words yei went on watch yourself watch your language an involuntary grin crinkled her eyes for example one of our creche personnel once used the cliche spit in your eye in some context or other not only did the quaddies think it was hilarious but it started an epidemic of spitting among the fiveyearolds that took weeks to suppress now youll be working with much older children but the principle remains for instanceahdid you bring any personal reading or viewing matter with you vid dramas newsdiscs whatever im not much of a reader said leo i brought my course material technical information doesnt concern me what weve been having a problem with lately is um fiction leo raised an eyebrow and grinned pornography im not sure id worry about that when i was a kid we passed around no no not pornography im not sure the quaddies would understand about pornography anyway sexuality is an open topic here part of their social training biology im far more concerned about fiction that clothes false or dangerous values in attractive colors or biased histories leo wrinkled his forehead increasingly dismayed havent you taught these kids any history or let them have stories of course we have the quaddies are wellsupplied with both its simply a matter of correct emphasis for examplea typical downsider history of say the settlement of orient iv usually gives about fifteen pages to the year of the brothers war a temporary if bizarre social aberrationand about two to the actual hundred or so years of settlement and buildingup of the planet our text gives one paragraph to the war but the building of the witgow transtrench monorail tunnel with its subsequent beneficial economic effects to both sides gets five pages in short we emphasize the common instead of the rare building rather than destruction the normal at the expense of the abnormal so that the quaddies may never get the idea that the abnormal is somehow expected of them if youd like to read the texts i think youll get the idea very quickly iyeah i think id better leo murmured the degree of censorship imposed upon the quaddies implied by yeis brief description made his skin crawland yet the idea of a text that devoted whole sections to great engineering works made him want to stand up and cheer he contained his confusion in a bland smile i really didnt bring anything on board he offered placatingly she led him off for a tour of the dormitories and the supervised creches of the younger quaddies the little ones amazed leo there seemed to be so manymaybe it was just because they moved so fast thirty or so fiveyearolds bounced around the free fall gym like a barrage of demented ping pong balls when their creche mother a plump pleasant downsider woman they called mama nilla assisted by a couple of quaddie teenage girls first let them out of their reading class but then she clapped her hands and put on some music and they fell to and demonstrated a game or a dance leo was not sure which with many sidelong looks at him and much giggling it involved creating a sort of duodecahedron in midair like a human pyramid only more complex hand to hand to hand changing its formation in time to music cries of dismay went up when an individual slipped up and spoiled the groups formation when perfection was achieved everybody won leo couldnt help liking that game dr yei watching leo laugh when the young quaddies swarmed around him afterwards seemed to purr with contentment but at the end of the tour she studied him with a little smile quirking her mouth mr graf youre still disturbed you sure youre not harboring just a little of the old frankenstein complex about all this its all right to admit it to mein fact i want you to talk about it its not that said leo slowly its just well i cant really object to your trying to make them as groupcentered as possible given that theyll be living all their lives on crowded space stations theyre disciplined to a high degree for their ages also good vital to their survival rather in a space environment yes but what aboutabout their selfdefense youll have to define that term for me mr graf defense from what well it seems to me youve succeeded in raising about a thousand technicalwhizdoormats nice kids but arent they a littlefeminized he was getting in deeper and deeper her smile had quirked to a frown i meanthey just seem ripe for exploitation byby somebody was this whole social experiment your idea it seems like a womans dream of a perfect society everybodys so well behaved he was uncomfortably conscious of having expressed his thought badly but surely she must see the validity she took a deep breath and lowered her voice her smile had become fixed let me set you straight mr graf i did not invent the quaddies i was assigned here six years ago its the galactech specs that call for maximum socialization but i did inherit them and i care about them its not your jobor your businessto understand about their legal status but it concerns me greatly their safety lies in their socialization you seem to be free of the common prejudices against the products of genetic engineering but there are many who are not there are planetary jurisdictions where this degree of genetic manipulation of humans would even be illegal let those peoplejust onceperceive the quaddies as a threat and she clamped her lips on further confidences and retreated onto her authority let me put it this way mr graf the power to approveor disapprovetraining personnel for the cay project is mine mr van atta may have called you in but i can have you removed and i will do so without hesitation if you fail in speech or behavior to abide by psych department guidelines i dont think i can put it any more clearly than that no yourequite clear leo said im sorry she said sincerely but until youve been on the habitat a while you really must refrain from making snap judgments im a testing engineer lady thought leo its my job to make judgments all day long but he did not speak the thought aloud they managed to part on a note of only slightly strained cordiality the entertainment vid was titled animals animals animals silver set the rerun for the cats sequence for the third time again claire sharing the vid viewing chamber with her said faintly just one more time silver pleaded her lips parted in fascination as the black persian appeared over the vid plate but out of deference to claire she turned down the music and narration the creature was crouched lapping milk from a bowl stuck to its floor by downside gravity the little white droplets flying off its pink tongue arced back into the dish as though magnetized i wish i could have a cat they look so soft silvers left lower hand reached out to pantomimepat the lifesized image no tactile reward only the colored light of the holovid licking without sensation over her skin she let her hand fall through the cat and sighed look you can pick it up just like a baby the vid shrank to show the cats downsider owner carting it off in her arms both looked smug well maybe theyll let you have a baby soon offered claire its not the same thing said silver she could not help glancing a little enviously at andy though curled up asleep in midair near his mother i wonder if ill ever get a chance to go downside ugh said claire whod want to it looks so uncomfortable dangerous too downsiders manage besides everything interesting seems toto come from planets everyone interesting too her thought added she considered mr van attas former teacher mr graf met on her last working shift yesterday in hydroponics yet another legged somebody who got to go places and make things happen hed actually been born on old earth mr van atta said there came a muffled tap on the door of the soundproof bubble and silver keyed her remote control to open the door siggy in the yellow shirt and shorts of airsystems maintenance stuck his head through all clear silver all right come on siggy slipped inside she keyed the door shut again and siggy turned over reached into the tool pouch on his belt jimmied open a wall plate and jammed the doors mechanism he left the wall plate open in case of urgent need for reaccess such as dr yei knocking on the door to inquire brightly what were they doing silver by this time had the back cover off the holovid siggy reached delicately past her to clip his homemade electronic scrambler across the power lead cable anyone monitoring their viewing through it would get static this is a great idea said siggy enthusiastically claire looked more doubtful are you sure we wont get into a whole lot of trouble if were caught i dont see why said silver mr van atta disconnects the smoke alarm in his quarters whenever he has a jubajoint i thought downsiders werent allowed to smoke on board said siggy startled mr van atta says its a privilege of rank said silver i wish i had rank has he ever given you one of his jubas asked claire in a tone of gruesome fascination once said silver wow said siggy grinning in admiration what was it like silver made a face not much it tasted kind of nasty made my eyes red i really couldnt see the point to it maybe downsiders have some biochemical reaction we dont get i asked mr van atta but he just laughed at me oh said siggy and switched his interest to the holovid display all three quaddies settled around it an anticipatory silence fell in the chamber as the music swelled and the bold red title letters rotated before their eyesthe prisoner of zenda the scene opened on an authenticallydetailed street scene from the dawn of civilization before space travel or even electricity a quartet of glossy horses harness jingling drew an elaborate box on wheels across the ground cant you get any more of the ninja of the twin stars series complained siggy this is more of your darned dirtball stuff i want something realistic like that chase scene through the asteroid belt his hands pursued each other as he made nasal sound effects indicating machinery undergoing high acceleration shut up and look at all the animals said silver so manyand its not even a zoo the place is littered with them littered is right giggled claire theyre not wearing diapers you know think about that siggy sniffed earth must have been a really disgusting place to live back in the old days no wonder people grew legs anything to prop them up in the air away from silver switched the vid off with a snap if you cant think of anything else to talk about she said dangerously ill go back to my dorm with my vid and you all can go back to watching cleaning and maintenance techniques for food service areas sorry siggy curled his four arms around himself in a submissive ball and tried to look contrite claire refrained from further comment huh silver switched the vid back on and continued watching in rapt and uninterrupted silence when the railway scenes began even siggy stopped squirming leo was well launched into his first class lecture now here is a typical length of electron beam weld he fiddled with the controls of his holovid display a ghost image in bright blue light the computergenerated xray inspection record of the original object sprang into being in the center of the room spread out kids so you can all get a good look at it the quaddies arranged themselves around the display in a spherical shell of attentiveness automatically extending helping hands to neighbors to absorb and trade momentum so that all achieved a tolerable hover dr yei sitting inif you could call it thatfloated unobtrusively in the background monitoring him for his political purity leo supposed not that it mattered he did not propose to alter his lecture one jot for her presence leo rotated the image so that each student could see it from every angle now lets magnify this part you see the deepv cross section from the highenergydensity beam familiar from your basic welding courses right note the small round porosities here the magnification jumped again would you say this weld is defective or not he almost added raise your hand before realizing what a particularly unintelligible directive that was here several of the redclad students solved the dilemma for him by crossing their upper arms formally across their chests instead looking properly hesitant leo nodded toward tony those are gas bubbles arent they sir it must be defective leo smiled thanks for the desired straight line they are indeed gas porosities oddly enough though when we crunch the numbers through they do not appear to be defects let us run the computer scan down this length with an eye to the digital readout as you see the numbers flickered at a corner of the display as the crosssection moved dizzyingly at no point do more than two porosities appear in a crosssection and at all points the voids occupy less than five percent of the section also spherical cavities like these are the least damaging of all potential shapes of discontinuities the least likely to propagate cracks in service a noncritical defect is called a discontinuity leo paused politely while two dozen heads bent in unison to highlight this pleasingly unambiguous fact on the autotranscription of their light boards braced between lower hands for a portable recording surface when i add that this weld was in a fairly lowpressure liquid storage tank and not for example in a thruster propulsion chamber with its massively greater stresses the slipperiness of this definition becomes clearer for in a thruster the particular degree of defect that shows up here would have been critical now he switched the holovid display to one in red light this is a holovid of the same weld from data bits mapped by an ultrasonic pulse reflective scan looks quite different doesnt it can anyone identify this discontinuity he zoomed in on a bright area several sets of arms crossed again leo nodded toward another student a striking boy with aquiline nose brilliant black eyes wiry muscles and dark mahogany skin contrasting elegantly with his red tshirt and shorts yes pramod its an unbonded lamination right leo tapped his holovid controls but check down this scanwhere have all our little bubbles gone anybody think they magically closed between tests thank you he said to their knowing grins im glad you dont think that now lets put both maps together red and blue melded to purple at overlapping points as the computer integrated the two displays and now we see the little bugger said leo zooming in again these two porosities plus this lamination all in the same plane you can see the fatal crack starting to propagate already on this rotation the holovid turned and leo emphasized the crack with a bright pink light that children is a defect they oohed in gratifying fascination leo grinned and plunged on now heres the point both these test scans were valid picturesas far as they went but neither one was complete neither alone sufficient the maps were not the territories you have to know that xradiography is excellent for revealing voids and inclusions but poor at finding cracks except at certain chance alignments and ultrasound is optimum for just those laminar discontinuities xrays are most likely to miss both maps intelligently integrated yielded a judgment now leo smiled a bit grimly and replaced the gaudy image with another monochrome green this time look at this what do you see he nodded at tony again a laser weld sir so it would appear your identification is quite understandableand quite wrong i want you all to memorize this piece of work look well because it may be the most evil object you ever encounter they looked wildly impressed but totally bewildered he commanded their absolute silence and utmost attention that he pointed for emphasis his voice growing heavy with scorn is a falsified inspection record worse its one of a series a certain subcontractor of galactech supplying thruster propulsion chambers for jump ships found its profit margin endangered by a high volume of its work being rejectedafter it had been placed in the systems so instead of tearing the work apart and doing it over right they chose to lean on the quality control inspectors we will never know for certain if the chief inspector refused a bribe or not because he wasnt around to tell us he was found accidentally very dead due to an apparent power suit malfunction attributed to his own errors made when attempting to don it while drunk the autopsy found a high percentage of alcohol in his bloodstream it was only much later that it was pointed out that the percentage was so high he oughtnt to have been able to walk let alone suit up the assistant inspector did accept the bribe the welds passed the computer certification all rightbecause it was the same damn good weld replicated over and over and inserted into the data bank in place of real inspections which for the most part were never even made twenty propulsion chambers were put online twenty timebombs it wasnt until the second one blew up eighteen months later that the whole story was finally uncovered this isnt hearsay i was on the probablecause investigating team it was i who found it by the oldest test in the world eyeandbrain inspection when i sat there in that station chair running those hundreds of holovid records through one by one and first recognized the piece when i saw it againand againand againfor the computer only recognized that the series was free of defectsand i realized what those bastards had done his hands were shaking as they always did at this point of the lecture as the old memories flickered back leo clenched them by his sides the judgment of the map was falsified in these electronic dream images but the universal laws of physics yielded a judgment of blood that was absolutely real eightysix people died altogether that leo pointed again was not merely fraud it was coldest cruelest murder he gathered his breath this is the most important thing i will ever say to you the human mind is the ultimate testing device you can take all the notes you want on the technical data anything you forget you can look up again but this must be engraved on your hearts in letters of fire there is nothing nothing nothing more important to me in the men and women i train than their absolute personal integrity whether you function as welders or inspectors the laws of physics are implacable liedetectors you may fool men you will never fool the metal thats all he let his breath out and regained his good humor looking around the quaddie students were taking it with proper seriousness good no class cutups making sick jokes in the back row in fact they were looking rather shocked staring at him with terrified awe so he clapped his hands together and rubbed them cheerfully to break the spell now lets go over to the shop and take a beam welder apart and see if we can find everything that can possibly go wrong with it they filed out obediently ahead of him chattering among themselves again yei was waiting by the door aperture as leo followed his class she gave him a brief smile an impressive presentation mr graf you become quite articulate when you talk about your work yesterday i thought you must be the strong silent type leo flushed faintly and shrugged its not so hard when you have something interesting to talk about i would not have guessed welding engineering to be so entertaining a subject you are a gifted enthusiast i hope your quaddies were equally impressed its a great thing when i can get somebody fired up its the greatest work in the world i begin to think so your story she hesitated your fraud story had great impact theyve never heard anything like it indeed i never heard about that one it was years ago really quite disturbing all the same her face bore a look of introspection i hope not overly so well i hope its very disturbing its a true story i was there he eyed her someday they may be there criminally negligent if i fail to prepare them ah she smiled shortly the last of his students had vanished up the corridor well i better catch up with them will you be sitting in on my whole course come on along ill make a welder of you yet she shook her head ruefully you actually make it sound attractive but im afraid i have a fulltime job i have to turn you loose she gave him a short nod youll do all right mr graf chapter andy stuck out his tongue extruding the blob of creamed rice claire had just spooned into his mouth beh he remarked the blob spurned as food apparently exerted new fascination as a plaything for he caught it between his upper right and lower left hands as it slowly rotated off eh he protested as his new satellite was reduced to a mere smear oh andy claire muttered in frustration and removed the smear from his hands with a vigorous swipe from a rather soiled highcapillarity towel come on baby youve got to try this dr yei says its good for you maybe hes full tony offered helpfully the nutritional experiment was taking place in claires private quarters awarded her upon the birth of andy and shared with the baby she often missed her old dormitory mates but reflected ruefully that the company had been right her popularity and andys fascination would probably not have survived too many night feedings diaper changes gas attacks mysterious diarrheas and fevers or other infant nocturnal miseries of late shed missed tony too in the last six i weeks shed hardly seen him his new welding instructor was keeping him so busy the pace of life seemed to be picking up all over the habitat there were days when there scarcely seemed to be time to draw breath maybe he doesnt like it suggested tony have you tried mixing it with that other goo everybodys an expert sighed claire except me he ate some yesterday anyway how does it taste i dont know i never tried it hm tony plucked the spoon from her hand and twirled it in the opened sealacup picked up a blob and popped it in his mouth hey began claire indignantly ben tony choked give me that towel he rid himself of his sample no wonder he spits it out its gag station claire grabbed the spoon back muttered huh and floated over to her kitchenette to push it through the handholes to the water dispenser and give it a steaming rinse germs she snapped accusingly at tony you try it she sniffed the food cup in renewed doubt ill take your word for it andy in the meantime had captured his lower right hand with his uppers and was gnawing on it youre not supposed to have meat yet claire sighed straightening him back out andy inhaled preparing for complaint but let it go in a mere aah as the door slid open revealing a new object of interest hows it going claire asked dr yei her thick useless downsider legs trailed relaxed from her hips as she pulled herself into the cabin claire brightened she liked dr yei things always seemed to calm down a bit when she was around andy wont eat the creamed rice he liked the strained banana well enough well next feeding try introducing the oatmeal instead said dr yei she floated over to andy held out her hand he captured it with his uppers she peeled off his hands held her hand down farther he grasped at it with his lowers and giggled his lower body coordination is coming along nicely bet it will nearly match the upper by his first birthday and that fourth tooth broke through day before yesterday said claire pointing it out natures way of telling you its time to eat creamed rice dr yei lectured the baby with mock seriousness he clamped to her arm beady eyes intent upon her gold loop earrings nutrition quite forgotten dont fret too much claire theres always this tendency to push things with the first child just to reassure yourself it can all be done it will be more relaxed with the second i guarantee all babies master creamed rice before theyre twenty no matter what you do claire laughed secretly relieved its just that mr van atta was asking about his progress ah dr yeis lips twitched in a rather compressed smile i see she defended her earring from a determined assault by placing andy in air just beyond reach a frustrated paroxysm of swimmingmotions gave him only an unwanted spin he opened his mouth to howl protest dr yei surrendered instantly but bought time by holding out just her fingertips andy again headed earringward hand over hand over hand yeah go for it baby tony cheered him on well dr yei turned her attention to claire i actually stopped by to pass on some good news the company is so pleased with the way things have turned out with andy theyve decided to move up the date for you to start your second pregnancy tonys face split in a delighted grin beyond dr yeis shoulder his upper hands clasped in a gesture of victory claire made embarrassedsuppression motions at him but couldnt help grinning back wow said claire warm with pleasure so the company thought she was doing that well there had been down days when shed thought no one noticed how hard shed been trying how much up your monthly cycles are still being suppressed by the breast feeding right you have an appointment at the infirmary tomorrow morning dr minchenko will give you some medicine to start them up again you can start trying on the second cycle oh my goodness that soon claire paused watching the wriggling andy and remembering how the first pregnancy had drained her energy i guess i can handle it but whatever happened to that twoandaquarteryear ideal spacing you were talking about dr yei bit her words off carefully there is a projectwide push to increase productivity in all areas dr yei always straightforward in claires experience smiled falsely she glanced at tony hovering happily and pursed her lips im glad youre here tony because i have some good news for you too your welding instructor mr graf has rated you tops in his class so youve been picked as gang foreman to go out on the first cay project contract galactech has landed you and your coworkers will be shipping out in about a month to a place called kline station its on the far end of the wormhole nexus beyond earth and its a long ride so mr graf will be going along to complete your training en route and double as engineering supervisor tony surged across the room in excitement at last real work but he paused stricken claire one thought ahead of him felt her face becoming masklike but hows claire supposed to start a baby next month if im on my way to where dr minchenko will freeze a couple of sperm samples before you go suggested claire wont he ahhm said dr yei well actually that wasnt in the plans your next baby is scheduled to be fathered by rudy in microsystems installation oh no gasped claire dr yei studied both their faces and arranged her mouth in a severe frown rudy is a very nice boy he would be very hurt by that reaction im sure this cant be a surprise claire after all our talks yes buti was hoping since tony and i did so well theyd let usi was going to ask dr cay who is no longer with us dr yei sighed and so youve gone and let yourselves become pairbonded i warned you not to do that didnt i claire hung her head tonys face was masklike now claire tony i know this seems hard but you in be first generations have a special burden you are first step in a very detailed longrange plan for galactech spanning literally generations your actions have a multiplier effect all out of proportionak this isnt by any means the end of the world or you two claire has a long reproductive career scheduled its quite probable youll be getting back together again someday and you tonyyoure tops galactechs not going to waste you either there will be other girls i dont want other girls said tony stonily only claire dr yei paused went on i shouldnt be telling you this yet but sinda in nutrition is next for you ive always thought she was an extraordinarily pretty girl she has a laugh like a hacksaw dr yei blew out her breath impatiently well discuss it later at length right now i have to talk with claire she thrust him firmly out the door and keyed it shut on his frown and muffled objections dr yei turned back to claire and fixed her with a stern gaze clairedid you and tony continue to have sexual relations after you became pregnant dr minchenko said it wouldnt hurt the baby dr minchenko knew i dont know i just asked him like in a general way claire studied her hands guiltily did you expect us to stop well yes you didnt tell us to you didnt ask in fact you were quite careful not to bring up the subject now that i think backoh how could i have been so blindsided but downsiders do it all the time claire defended herself how do you know what downsiders do silver says mr van atta claire stopped abruptly dr yeis attention sharpened knifelike and uncomfortable what do you know about silver and mr van atta welleverything i guess i mean we all wanted to know how downsiders did it claire paused downsiders are strange she added after a paralyzed moment dr yei buried her suffused face in her hands and sniggered helplessly and so silvers been supplying you with detailed information well yes claire regarded the psychologist with wary fascination dr yei stifled her chortles a strange light growing in her eyes part humor part irritation i supposei suppose youd better pass the word to tony not to let on im afraid mr van atta would become a little upset if he realized his personal activities had a secondhand audience all right claire agreed doubtfully butyou always wanted to know all about me and tony thats different we were trying to help you well we and silver are trying to help each other youre not supposed to help yourselves the sting of dr yeis criticism was blunted by her suppressed smile youre supposed to wait until youre served yei paused just how many of you are privy to this ah silvermine of information anyway just you and tony i trust well and my dormitory mates i take andy over there in my off hours and we all play with him i used to have my sleep restraints opposite silvers until i moved out shes my best friend silvers soso brave i guessshell try things id never dare claire sighed envy eight girls yei muttered oh lord krishna i trust none of them have been inspired to emulation yet claire not wishing to lie said nothing she didnt need to the psychologist watching her face winced yei turned indecisively in air ive got to have a talk with silver i should have done it when i first suspectedbut i thought the man had the wit not to contaminate the experimentasleep on my feet look claire i want to talk with you more about your new assignment im here to try and make it as easy and pleasant as possibleyou know ill help right ill get back to you as soon as i can yei peeled andy off her neck where he was now attempting to taste her earring and handed him back to claire and exited the airseal door muttering something about containing the damage claire alone held her baby close her troubled uncertainty turned like a lump of metal under her heart she had tried so hard to be good leo squinted approvingly against the harsh light and dense shadows of the vacuum as a pair of his spacesuited students horsed the locking ring accurately into place on the end of its flex tube between the two of them their eight gloved hands made short work of the task now pramod bobbi bring up the beam welder and the recorder and put them in their starting position julian you run the optical laser alignment program and lock them on a dozen of the fourarmed figures their names and numbers printed in large clear figures on the front of each helmet and across the backs of their silvery work suits bobbed about their suit jets puffed as they jockeyed for a better view now in these highenergydensity partial penetration welds leo lectured into his spacesuitss audio pickup the electron beam must not be allowed to achieve a penetrating steadystate this beam can punch through half a meter of steel even one spiking event and your say nuclear pressure vessel or your propulsion chamber can lose its structural integrity now the pulser that pramod is checking right now leo made his voice heavy with hint pramod jerked and hastily began punching up the system readout on his machine utilizes the natural oscillation of the point of beam impingement within the weld cavity to set up a pulsing schedule that maintains its frequency eliminating the spiking problem always double check its function before you start the locking ring was firmly welded to its flex tube and duly examined for flaws by eye hologram scan eddy current the examination and comparison of the simultaneous xray emission recording and the classic kickandjerk test leo prepared to move his students on to the next task tony you bring the beam welder overturn it off first feedback squeal lanced through everyones earphones and leo modulated his voice from his first urgent panicked bellow the beam had in fact been off but the controls live one accidental bump as tony swung the machine around andleos eye traced the hypothetical slice through the nearby wing of the habitat and he shuddered get your head out of your ass tony i saw a man cut in half by one of his friends once by just that careless trick sorry thought it would save time sorry tony mumbled you know better leo calmed as his heart stopped palpitating in this hard vacuum that beam wont stop till it hits the third moon or whatever it might encounter in between he almost continued stopped himself no not over the public comm channel later later as his students unsuited in the equipment locker laughing and joking as they cleaned and stored their work suits leo drifted over to the silent and pale tony surely i didnt bark at him that hard leo thought to himself figured he was more resilient stop and see me when youre finished here said leo quietly tony flinched guiltily yes sir after his fellows had all swooped out eager for their endofshift meal tony hung in air both sets of arms crossed protectively across his torso leo floated near and spoke in a grave tone where were you out there today sorry sir it wont happen again its been happening all week you got something on your mind boy tony shook his head nothingnothing to do with you sir meaning nothing to do with work leo interpreted that all right so if its taking your mind off your work it does have something to do with me want to talk about it you got girl trouble little andy all right you have a fight with somebody tonys blue eyes searched leos face in sudden uncertainty then he grew closed and inward once again no sir you worried about going out on that contract i guess it will be the first time away from home for you lads at that its not that denied tony he paused watching leo again sirare there a great many other companies out there besides ours not a great many for deep interstellar work leo replied a little baffled by this new turn in the conversation were the biggest of course though theres maybe a half dozen others that can give us some real competition in the heavily populated systems like tau ceti or escobar or orient or of course earth theres always a lot of little companies operating on a smaller scale superspecialists or entrepreneurial mavericks this and that the outer worlds are coming on strong lately soso if you ever quit galactech you could get another job in space oh sure ive even had offersbut our company does the most of the sort of work i want to do so theres no reason to go elsewhere and ive got a lot of seniority accumulated by now and all that goes with it ill probably be with galactech till i retire if i dont die in harness probably from a heart attack brought on by watching one of my students try to accidentally kill himself leo did not speak the thought aloud tony seemed chastized enough but still abstracted sir tell me about money money leo raised his brows whats to tell the stuff of life ive never seen anyid understood it was sort of coded valuemarkers to to facilitate trade and keep count thats right how do you get it wellmost people work for it they ah trade their labor for it or if they own or manufacture or grow something they can sell it i work and galactech gives you money uh yes if i asked would the company give me money ah leo became conscious of skating on very thin ice his private opinion of the cay project had perhaps better remain just that while he ate the companys bread his job was to teach safe quality welding procedures notfoment union demands or whatever this conversation was sliding toward whatever would you spend it on up here galactech gives you everything you need now when im downside or not on a company installation i have to buy my own food clothing travel and whatnot besides leo reached for a less queasily specious argument up till now you havent actually done any work for galactech although its done plenty for you wait till youve actually been out on a contract and done some real producing then maybe it might be time to talk about money leo smiled feeling hypocritical but at least loyal oh tony seemed to fold inward on some secret disappointment his blue eyes flicked up probing leo again when one of the company jump ships leaves rodeowhere does it go first depends on where its wanted i guess some run straight all the way to earth if theres cargo or people to divide up for other destinations the first stop is usually orient station galactech doesnt own orient station does it no its owned by the government of orient iv although galactech leases a good quarter of it how long does it take to get to orient station from rodeo oh usually about a week youll probably be stopping there yourself quite soon if only to pick up extra equipment and supplies when youre sent out on your first construction contract the boy was looking more outerdirected now perhaps thinking about his first interstellar trip that was better leo relaxed slightly ill be looking forward to that sir right if you dont cut your foot er hand off meanwhile eh tony ducked his head and grinned ill try not to sir and what was that all about leo wondered watching tony sail out the door surely the boy could not be thinking of trying to strike out on his own tony had not the least conception of what a freak he would seem beyond his familiar habitat if he would only open up a little more leo shrank from the thought of confronting him every downsider staff member in the habitat seemed to feel they had a right to the quaddies personal thoughts there wasnt a lockable door anywhere in the quaddies living quarters they had all the privacy of ants under glass he shook off the critical thought but could not shake off his queasiness all his life he had placed his faith in his own technical integrityif he followed that star his feet would not stumble it was ingrained habit by now he had brought that technical integrity to the teaching of tonys work gang almost automatically and yet this time it did not seem to be quite enough as if he had memorized the answer only to discover the question had been changed yet what more could be demanded of him what more could he be expected to give what after all could one man do a spasm of vague fear made him blink the hardedged stars in the viewport smeared as the looming shadow of the dilemma clouded on the horizon of his conscience more he shivered and turned his back to the vastness it could swallow a man surely ti the freight shuttle copilot had his eyes closed perhaps that was natural at times like this silver thought studying his face from a distance of ten centimeters at this range her eyes could no longer superimpose their stereoscopic images so his twinned face overlapped itself if she squinted just right she could make him appear to have three eyes men really were rather alien yet the metal contact implanted in his forehead echoed at both temples did not have that effect seeming more a decoration or a mark of rank she blinked one eye closed then the other causing his face to shift back and forth in her vision ti opened his eyes a moment and silver quickly flinched into action she smiled halfclosed her own eyes picked up the rhythm of her flexing hips oooh she murmured as van atta had taught her lets hear some feedback honey van atta had demanded so shed hit on a collection of noises that seemed to please him they worked on the pilot too when she remembered to make them tis eyes squeezed shut his lips parting as his breath came faster and silvers face relaxed into pensive stillness once again grateful for the privacy anyway tis gaze didnt make her as uncomfortable as mr van attas that always seemed to suggest that she ought to be doing something else or more or differently the pilots forehead was damp with sweat plastering down one curl of brown hair around the shiny plug mechanical mutant biological mutant equally touched by differing technologies perhaps that was why ti had first seen her as approachable being an odd man out himself both freaks together on the other hand maybe the jump pilot just wasnt very fussy he shivered gasped convulsively clutched her tightly to his body actually he lookedrather vulnerable mr van atta never looked vulnerable at this moment silver was not sure just what it was he did look like whats he getting out of this that im not silver wondered whats wrong with me maybe she really was as van atta had once accused frigidan unpleasant word it reminded her of machinery and the trash dumps locked outside the habitatso she had learned to make noises for him and twitch pleasingly and he had commended her for loosening up silver reminded herself that she had another reason for keeping her eyes open she glanced again past the pilots head the observation window of the darkened control booth where they trysted overlooked the freight loading bay the staging area between the bays control booth and the entrance to the freight shuttles hatch remained dimly lit and empty of movement hurry up tony claire silver thought worriedly i cant keep this guy occupied all shift wow breathed ti coming out of his trance and opening his eyes and grinning when they designed you folks for free fall they thought of everything he released his own clutch on the wings of silvers shoulderblades to slide his hands down her back around her hips and along her lower arms ending with an approving pat on her hands locked around his muscular downsider flanks truly functional how do downsiders keep from um bouncing apart silver inquired curiously taking practical advantage of having cornered an apparent expert on the subject his grin widened gravity keeps us together how strange i always thought of gravity as something you had to fight all the time no only half the time the other half it works for you he assured her he undocked from her body rather gracefullyperhaps it was all that piloting experience showing throughand planted a kiss in the hollow of her throat pretty lady silver blushed a little grateful for the dim lighting ti turned his attention momentarily to a necessary cleanup chore a quick whistle of air and the spermicidepermeated condom was gone down the waste chute silver suppressed a faint twinge of regret it was just too bad ti wasnt one of them too bad she was such a long way down the roster of those scheduled for motherhood too bad did you find out from your doctor fellow if we really need those ti asked her i couldnt exactly ask dr minchenko directly silver replied but i gather he thinks any conceptus between a downsider and one of us would abort spontaneously pretty early onbut nobody knows for sure could be a baby might make it to birth with lower limbs that were neither arms nor legs but just some mess in between and they probably wouldnt let me keep if anyway it saves chasing body fluids around the room with a hand vac too true well im certainly not ready to be a daddy how incomprehensible thought silver for a man that old ti must be at least twentyfive much older than tony who was nearly the eldest of them all she was careful to float facing the window so that the pilot had his back to it come on tony do it if youre going to a cool draft from the ventilators raised goose bumps on all her arms and silver shivered chilly ti asked solicitously and rubbed his hands up and down her arms rapidly to warm them by friction then retrieved her blue shirt and shorts from the side of the room where they had drifted silver shrugged into them gratefully the pilot dressed too and silver watched with covert fascination as he fastened his shoes such inflexible heavy coverings but then feet were inflexible heavy things in their own right she hoped hed be careful how he swung them around shod his feet reminded her of mallets ti smiling unhooked his flight bag from a wall rack where he had stowed it when theyd retreated to the control booth half an hour earlier gotcha something silver perked up and her four hands clasped each other hopefully oh were you able to find any more bookdiscs by the same lady yes here you go ti produced some thin squares of plastic from the inner reaches of his flight bag three titles all new silver pounced on them and read their labels eagerly rainbow illustrated romances sir randans folly love in the gazebo sir randan and the bartered bride all by valeria virga oh wonderful she wrapped her upper right arm around tis neck and gave him a quite spontaneous and vigorous kiss he shook his head in mock despair i dont know how you can read that dreck i think the author is a committee anyway its great silver defended her beloved literature indignantly its so so full of color and strange places and timesa lot of them are set on old earth way back when everybody was still downsidetheyre amazing people kept animals all around themthese enormous creatures called horses actually used to carry them around on their backs i suppose the gravity tired people out and these rich people likelike company executives i guesscalled lords and nobles lived in the most fantastic habitats stuck to the surface of the planetand there was nothing about all this in the history we were taught her indignation peaked that stuffs not history though he objected its fiction its nothing like the fiction they give us either oh its all right for the little kidsi used to love the little compressor that could we made our crechemother read it over and over and the bobby bx series was all right bobby bx solves the excess humidity mystery bobby bx and the plant virus it was then i asked to specialize in hydroponics but downsiders are ever so much more interesting to read about its sosowhen im reading this she clutched the little plastic squares tightly its like theyre real and im not silver sighed hugely although perhaps mr van atta was a bit like sir randan high of status commanding shorttempered silver wondered briefly why short temper in sir randan always seemed so exciting and attractive full of fascinating consequences when mr van atta became angry it merely made her sick to her stomach perhaps downsider women had more courage ti shrugged baffled amusement whatever turns you on i guess cant see the harm in it but i brought something better for you this trip he rummaged in his flight bag again and shook out a froth of ivory fabric intricate lace and ribbony satin i figured you could wear a regular womans blouse all right its got flowers in the pattern thought youd like that being in hydroponics and all oh one of valeria virgas heroines might have been at home in such a garment silver reached for it drew her hand back butbut i cant take it why not you take the bookdiscs it wasnt that expensive silver who felt she was beginning to have a fairly clear idea of how money worked from her reading shook her head its not that its wellyou know i dont think dr yei would approve of our meeting like this neither wouldwould a lot of other people actually silver was fairly sure that disapprove would barely begin to cover the consequences should her secret transactions with ti be found out prudes scoffed ti youre not going to let them start telling you what to do now are you but his scorn was tinged with anxiety im not going to start telling them what i am doing either said silver pointedly are you god no he waved his hands in horrified negation so we are in agreement unfortunately that she pointed regretfully at the blouse is something i cant hide i couldnt wear it without someone demanding that i explain where i got it oh he said in the blunted tone of one struck by incontrovertable fact yeah iguess i should have thought of that do you suppose you could put it away for a time ive only been taking my gravity leaves on the rodeo side because all the shuttle bonus berths at orient iv get nailed by the senior guys well and you can log a lot more hours here i faster with all the freight hauling but ill have my shuttle commanders rating and be back to permanent jump status in just a few more cycles it cant be shared either said silver you see the thing about the books and the vid dramas and lings besides being small and easy to hide is that they can be passed all around the group without being used up nobody gets left out so i can get um a lot of cooperation when i want to sayget away for a little time by myself a toss of her head indicated the privacy they were presently enjoying ah gulped ti he paused ihadnt realized you were passing the stuff around not share said silver that would be really wrong she stared at him in mild offense and pushed the blouse back toward him on the surge of the emotion quickly before she weakened she almost explained further then thought better of it best ti didnt know about the uproar when one of the bookdiscs accidently left in a viewer had been found by one of the habitats downsider staff and turned over to dr yei the searchbarely alerted they had scrambled successfully to hide the rest of the contraband library but the fierce intensity of the search had been warning enough to silver of how serious was her offense in the eyes of her authorities there had been two more surprise inspections since even though no more discs had been found she could take a hint mr van atta himself had taken her asideherand urged her to spy out the leak for him among her comrades she had started to confess stopped just in time as his rising rage tightened her throat with fear im going to crucify the little sneak when i get my hands on him van atta had snarled maybe ti would not find mr van atta and dr yei and all their staffs ranked together so intimidatingbut she dared not risk losing her one sure source of downsider delights ti at least was willing to barter for what was in effect a bit of silvers labor the one invisible commodity not accounted for in any inventory who knew another pilot might want things of some kind far more difficult to smuggle out of the habitat unnoticed a longawaited movement in the loading area caught her eye and you thought you were risking trouble for a few books silver thought to herself waitll this shit gets on the loose thank you anyway said silver hastily and grabbed ti around the neck for a prolonged thankyou kiss he closed his eyeswonderful reflex thatand silver rolled hers toward the view out the control booth window tony claire and andy were just disappearing into the shuttle hatch flex tube there thought silver thats it ive done what i canthe rest is up to you good luck doubleluck and more sharply i wish i was going with you oof look at the time ti broke off their embrace ive got to get this checklist completed before captain durrance gets back guess youre right about the shirt he stuffed it unceremoniously back into his flight bag what do you want me to bring you next time siggy in airsystems maintenance asked me if there were any more holovids in the ninja of the twin stars series silver said promptly hes up to number but hes missing and ah said ti now that was decent entertainment did you watch them yourself yes silver wrinkled her nose but im not surethe people in them did such horrible things to one anotherthey are fiction you say well yes thats a relief yes but what would you like for yourself he persisted im not risking reprimand to gratify siggy whoever he is siggy doesnt have your he sighed in remembered pleasure dear doublejointed hips silver fanned out the three new book cards in her lower right hand more please sir if its dreck you want he captured each of her hands in turn and kissed their palms its dreck you shall have uh oh here comes my fearless captain ti hastily straightened his shuttle pilots uniform turned up the light level and picked up his report panel as an airseal door at the far end of the loading bay swished open he hates being saddled with junior jumpers tadpoles he calls us i think hes uncomfortable because on my jumpship id outrank him still better not give the old guy something to pick on silver made the book cards disappear into her work bag and took up the pose of an idle bystander as captain durrance the shuttle commander floated into the control booth snap it up ti weve had a change of itinerary said captain durrance yes sir whats up were wanted downside hell ti swore mildly what a pain i had a hot date lineder his eye fell on silver was supposed to meet a friend for dinner tonight at the transfer station fine said captain durrance ironically unsympathetic file a complaint with employee relations your work schedule is interfering with your love life maybe they can arrange that you not have a work schedule ti took the hint and moved hastily out to continue his duties as a habitat technician arrived to take over the loading bay control booth silver made herself small in a corner frozen in horror and confusion at the transfer station tony and claire had planned to stow away on a jump ship for orient iv get beyond the reach of galactech find work when they got there a horribly risky plan in silvers estimation a measure of their desperation claire had been terrified but at last persuaded by tonys plan of carefully thoughtout stages at least the first stages had been carefully thoughtout they had seemed to get vaguer farther away from rodeo and home they had not planned on a downside detour in any version tony and claire had surely hidden themselves by now in the shuttles cargo bay there was no way for silver to warn themshould she betray them to save them the ensuing uproar was guaranteed to be ghastlyher dismay wrapped like a steel band around her chest constricting breathing constricting speech she watched on the control booths vid display in miserable paralysis as the shuttle kicked away from the habitat and began to drop toward rodeos swirling atmosphere chapter the dim cargo bay seemed to groan all around claire as deceleration strained its structure buffeting accompanied by a hissing whistle vibrated through the shuttles metal skin whats wrong gasped claire she released an anchoring hand upon the plastic crate behind which they had hidden to double her grasp of andy and hold him closer are we sideswiping something whats that funny noise tony hurriedly licked a ringer and held it out no draft to speak of he swallowed testing his eustachican tubes were not depressurizing yet the whistle was rising two mechanical kachunks one after the other that were nothing at all like the familiar thump and click of a hatch seal seating itself properly shot terror through claire the deceleration went on and on much too long confused by a strange new vector of thrust that seemed to emanate from the shuttles ventral side the side of the cargo bay to which the crates were anchored seemed to push against her she nervously put her back to it and cushioned andy upon her belly the babys eyes were round his mouth an echoing o of bewilderment no please dont start crying she dared not release the cry locked in her own throat it would set him off like a siren patty cake patty cake bakers man claire choked microwave a cake as fast as you can she tickled his cheek flicking her eyes at tony in mute appeal tonys face was white clairei think this shuttles going downside i bet those bangs were the airfoils deploying oh no cant be silver checked the schedule it looks like silver made a big mistake i checked it too this shuttle was supposed to be picking up a load of stuff at the transfer station then going downside then you both made a big mistake tonys voice was harsh and shaking anger masking fear oh help dont yell at meif i dont stay calm neither will andythis wasnt my idea tony rolled over on his stomach and levered his body away from the thrusting surface of thethe floor downsiders called the direction from which the vector of gravitational force cameand crept to the nearest window pulling himself alongside it the light that poured through it was taking on a strange diffuse quality diminishing its all whiteclaire i think we must be entering a cloud claire had watched clouds from orbit above forl hours as they slowly billowed in the convection of rodeos atmosphere they had always seemed massive as moons she longed to go look andy was clutching her blue tshirt she rolled over as tony had palms to the surface and pushed up andy turning his head toward his father reached out with his upper hands and tried to shove off from claire with his lowers the floor leaped up and smacked him for a moment he was too stunned to howl then his little mouth went from round to square and poured out the vibrating scream of true pain the sound knifed through every nerve in claires body tony too jerked at the noise and scrambled down from the window and back toward them why did you drop him what do you think youre doing oh make him be quiet quick claire rolled onto her back again pulling andy onto the elastic softness of her abdomen and patted and kissed him frantically the timbre of his screams began to change from the frightening highpitched cry of pain to the less piercing bellows of indignation but the volume was just as loud theyll hear him all the way up in the pilots compartment tony hissed in anguish do something im trying claire hissed back her hands shook she tried to push andys head toward her breast standard comfort but he turned his head away and screamed louder fortunately the sound of the atmosphere rushing over the shuttles skin had risen to a deafening thunder by the time the noise peaked and faded andys cries had become whimpering hiccups he rubbed his face slimy with tears and mucous mournfully against claires tshirt his weight on claires stomach and diaphragm half stopped her breath but she dared not lay him down another set of clunks reverberated through the shuttle the engines vibrations changed their pitch and claire was plucked this way and that by changing acceleration vectors none as strong as the one emanating from the floor she spared two hands from comforting andy to brace herself against the plastic crates tony lay beside them biting his lips in helpless anxiety we must be coming down to land on the surface claire nodded at one of the shuttleports therell be people theredownsidersmaybe we can tell them we got trapped aboard this shuttle by accident maybe she added hopefully theyll send us right back up home tonys right upper hand clenched no we cant give up now wed never get another chance but what else can we do well sneak off this ship and hide until we can get on another one one thats going to the transfer station his voice turned earnest with urgent pleading as a puff of dismay escaped claires parted lips j we did it once we can do it again she shook her head doubtfully further argument i was interrupted by a startling series of thumps that i shook the whole ship and then blended into a low continuous rumble the light falling through the window shifted its beam around the cargo bay as the shuttle landed taxied and turned then it winked out the cargo bay dimmed and the engines whined to an equally startling silence claire cautiously unbraced herself of all the acceleration vectors only one remained isolated it became overwhelming gravity silent implacable it pressed against her backshe struggled with a nasty illusion that it might suddenly cease and the thrust it imparted slam her into the ceiling above smashing andy between in an accompanying optical illusion the whole cargo bay seemed to be chugging in a slow circle around her she closed her eyes in selfdefense tonys hand tightened warningly on her left lower wrist she looked up and froze as the outside cargo bay door at the forward end of the compartment slid open a pair of downsiders wearing company maintenance coveralls entered the access door in the center of the shuttles fuselage dilated and ti the shuttle copilot stuck his head through hi guys whats the big rushrush were supposed to have this bird turned around and reloaded in an hour thats what replied the maintenance man you have just time to pee and eat lunch whats the cargo i havent seen this much hopping around since the last medical emergency equipment and supplies for some sort of show theyre supposed to be putting on up at your habitat for the vice president of operations thats not till next week the maintenance man snickered thats what everybody thought the vp just flew in a week early on her private courier with a whole commando squad of accountants seems she likes surprise inspections management naturally is overjoyed dont laugh too soon ti warned management has ways of sharing their joy with the rest of us dont i know it the maintenance man groaned cmon cmon youre blocking the door the three of them clattered forward now whispered tony with a nod at the open cargo bay door claire rolled to her side and laid andy gently on the deck his face crumpled working up to a cry claire quickly rolled onto her palms tested her balance her right lower arm seemed to be the one she could most easily spare she scooped andy back up onehanded and held him under her torso plastered against the planetward side of the cargo bay by the dreadful gravity she began a threehanded crawl toward the door andys weight pulled at her arm as though a strong spring were drawing him to the floor and his head bobbed backwards at an alarming angle claire inched her palm up under his head to support it painfully awkward for her arm beside her tony too achieved a threehanded stance with his free hand he jerked the cord to their pack of supplies the pack stuck to the downside surface as if by suction didnt budge shit tony swore under his breath he swarmed over the pack gripped and lifted it but it was too bulky to carry under his belly doubleshit can we give up yet claire asked in a tiny voice knowing the answer no he grabbed the pack backwards over both shoulders with his upper hands and rocked forward violently it came up and balanced precariously on his back he kept his left upper hand on it to steady it and hopped forward on his right his lower palms shuffling along under his hips i got it go go the shuttle was parked in a cavernous hangar a vast dim gulf of space roofed by girders the girders behind the overhead lights would have been an excellent hiding place if only one could swoop up there but everything not rigidly fastened was doomed to fly to the one side of the room only and stick there until forcibly removed there was a lopsided fascination to it oh claire hesitated leading from the hatch to the hangar floor was a kind of corrugated ramp clearly it was designed to break down the dangerous fight with the omnipresent gravity into little manageable increments stairs claire paused head down her blood seemed to pool dizzyingly in her face she gulped dont stop tony gasped pleadingly behind her then gulped himself uh uh in a moment of inspiration claire turned around and began to back down her free lower palm slapping the metal treads with each hop it was still uncomfortable but at least possible tony followed where now claire panted when they reached the bottom tony pointed with his chin hide in that jumble of equipment over there for now we darent get too far from the shuttles they scuttled along over the downside surface of the hangar claires hands quickly became smudged with oil and dirt a psychological irritation as fierce as an unscratchable itch she felt she might gladly risk death for a chance to wash them claire remembered watching beads of condensed humidity creeping by capillarity across surfaces in the habitat until shed smeared them to oblivion with her dryrag just as she and tony crept now as they reached the area where some pieces of heavy equipment were parked a loader rolled into the hangar and a dozen coveralled men and women jumped off it and began swarming over the shuttle organized confusion claire was glad for their noise for andy was still emitting an occasional whimper fearfully she watched the maintenance crew through the metal arms of the machinery how late was too late to surrender leo half suitedup in the equipment locker glanced up anxiously as pramod swooped across the room to fetch up gracefully beside him did you find tony leo asked as gang foreman hes supposed to be leading this parade im only supposed to be watching pramod shook his head hes not in any of the usual places sir leo hissed under his breath not quite swearing he shouldve answered his page by now he drifted to the plexiport outside in the vacuum a small pusher was just depositing the last of the sections for the shell of the new hydroponics bay in their carefully arranged constellation it was to be built before the operations vice presidents eyes by the quaddies so much for leos faint hope that screwups and delays in other departments might cover those in his own it was time for his welding crew to make its debut all right pramod get suited up youll take over tonys position and bobbi from gang b will take yours leo hurried on before the startlement in pramods eyes could turn to stage fright its nothing you havent practiced a dozen times and if you have the least doubts about the quality or safety of any procedure ill be right there reality firstyou people are going to be living in the structure you build today long after vice president apmad and her travelling circus are gone i guarantee shell have more respect for a job done right however slowly than for a piece of slapdash fakery for gods sake make it look smooth van atta had instructed leo urgently earlier keep to the schedule no matter whatwell fix the problems later after shes gone were supposed to be making these chimps seem costeffective you dont have to try and seem to be anything but what you are leo told pramod you are efficientand you are good instructing you all has been one of the great unexpected pleasures of my career be off now ill catch up with you shortly pramod sped away to find bobbi leo frowned briefly to himself and floated up the length of the locker room to the comconsole terminal at the end he keyed in his id page he instructed it dr sondra yei at the same moment a message square in the corner of the vid began to blink with his own name and a number cancel that instruction he punched up the number and raised his brows in surprise as dr yeis face appeared on his vid sondra i was just about to call you do you know where claire is how odd i was calling to ask you if you knew where i could reach tony oh said leo in a voice suddenly drained to neutrality why because i cant find her anywhere and i thought tony might know where she is shes supposed to be giving a demonstration of child care techniques in free fall to vice president apmad after lunch is um leo swallowed andy at the creche or with claire do you know with claire of course ah leo dr yeis attention sharpened her lips pursed do you know something i dont ah he eyed her i know tony has been unusually inattentive at work for the last week i might even saydepressed except thats supposed to be your department eh not his usual cheerful self anyway a knot of unease tightening in leos stomach gave his tongue an unaccustomed edge you ah got any concerns that you may have forgotten to share with me lady her lips thinned but she ignored the bait schedules have been moved up in all departments you know claire received her new reproduction assignment it didnt include tony reproduction assignment you mean having a baby leo could feel his face flushing somewhere within him a longcontrolled steam pressure began to build do you hide what youre really doing from yourselves with those weaselwords too and here i thought the propaganda was just for us peons yei started to speak but leo overrode her bursting out good god were you born inhuman or did you grow so by degreesms md phd yeis face darkened her accent grew clipped an engineer with romance in his soul now ive seen everything dont get carried away with your scenario mr graf tony and claire were assigned to each other in the first place by the exact same system and if certain people had been willing to abide by my original timetable this problem could have been avoided i fail to see the point of paying for an expert and then blithely ignoring her advice really i do engineers ah hell shes suffering from as bad a case of van atta as i am leo realized the insight blunted his momentum without bleeding off internal pressure i didnt invent the cay project and if i were running it id do it differently but i have to play the hand im dealt mr graf blast she controlled herself almost visibly wrenching the conversation back on its original track ive got to find her soon or ill have no choice but to let van atta start the show assbackwards leo its absolutely essential that vice president apmad get the creche tour first before she has time to start forming anydo you have any idea at all where those kids may be leo shook his head an inspiration turned the truthful gesture to a lie even before hed finished it but will you give me a call if you find them before i do he pleaded his humble tone offering truce yeis stiffness wilted a bit yes certainly she shrugged wryly a silent apology and broke off leo swung back to his locker peeled out of his work suit donned coveralls and hastened off to track down his inspiration before dr yei duplicated it independently he was certain she would and shortly too silver checked the work schedule on her vid display bell peppers she floated across the hydroponics bay to the seed locker found the correct labeled drawer and withdrew a precounted paper packet she gave the packet an absent shake and the dried seeds made a pleasing rattle she collected a plastic germination box tore open the packet and coaxed the little pale seeds into the container where they bounced about cheerfully to the hydration spigot next she thrust the water tube through the rubber doughnut seal on the side of the germination box and administered a measured squirt and gave the box an extra shake to break up the shimmering globule of liquid that formed shoving the germination box into its slot in the incubation rack she set it for the optimum temperature for peppers bell hybrid phototropic nongravitational axial differentiating clone xp and sighed the light from the filtered windows plucked insistently at her attention and she paused for the fourth or fifth time this shift to weave among the grow tubes and stare out at the portion of rodeo this bays angle of view allowed her to see somewhere down there at the bottom of that well of air claire and tony were crawling nowif they had not already surrenderedor managed to make it to another shuttleor met some horrible catastrophe silvers imagination unbidden supplied her with a string of sample catastrophes she tried to crowd them out with a firm mental picture of tony and claire and andy successfully sneaking onto a shuttle bound for the transfer station but the picture wavered into a scenario of claire attempting to jump some gap to the shuttles hatchway what gap from where for pitys sake forgetting that all such tangents were bent to parabolas by the gravitational force and missing the target silver thought of the peculiar ways things moved in dense gravitational fields the scream chopped off by the splat on the concrete belowno surely claire would be holding andythe double splat on the concrete below silver kneaded her forehead with the heels of her upper hands as if she might physically press the grisly vision back out of her brain claire had seen the same vids of life downside surely shed remember the hiss of the airseal doors twitched silver back to present reality better look busywhat was she supposed to be doing next oh yes cleaning used grow tubes in preparation for their placement day after tomorrow in the new bay they were building to show off everybodys skills to the ops vp damn the ops vp but for her thered be a chance tony and claire might go unmissed for two shifts even three now her heart shrank as she saw who had entered the hydroponics bay now indeed ordinarily silver would have been glad to see leo he seemed a big clean manno not large but solid somehow full of a prosaic calmness that spilled over in the very scent of him reminiscent of downsider things silver had chanced to handle wood and leather and certain dried herbs in the light of his slow smile ghastly scenarios thinned to mist she might yet be glad to talk to leo he was not smiling now silver you in here for a wild moment silver considered trying to hide among the grow tubes but the foliage rustled as she turned giving away her position she peeked over the leaves uh hi leo have you seen tony or claire lately trust leo to be direct call me leo hed told her the first time shed mr grafd him its shorter he drifted over to the grow tubes they regarded each other across a barrier of bush beans i havent seen anybody but my supervisor all shift said silver momentarily relieved to be able to give a perfectly honest answer when did you last see either one of them ohlast shift i guess silver tossed her head airily where uh around she giggled vacuously mr van atta might have flung up his hands in disgust at this point and abandoned any attempt to wring sense from so empty a head as hers leo frowned at her thoughtfully you know one of the charms of you kids is the literal precision with which you answer any question the comment hung in air expectantly as leo did the picture of tony claire and andy scooting across the shuttle loading bay flashed in silvers mind with hallucinatory clarity she groped in memory for their prior meeting where the final plans had been laid to offer up as a halftruth we had the midshift meal together last shift at nutrition station seven leos lips quirked i see he tilted his head studying her as if she were some puzzle such as two metallurgically incompatible surfaces he had to figure out how to join you know i just heard about claires new ah reproduction assignment id wondered what was bothering tony the last few weeks he was pretty broken up about it eh pretty distraught theyd had plans silver began caught herself shrugged casually i dont know id be glad to get any reproduction assignment theres no pleasing some people leos face grew stern silverjust how distraught were they kids often mistake a temporary problem for the end of the world they have no sense of the fullness of time makes em excitable think they might have been upset enough to do something desperate desperate silver smiled rather desperately herself like a suicide pact or something oh no said silver shocked oh theyd never do anything like that did relief flash for a moment in leos brown eyes no his face puckered in intensified concern thats just what im afraid they might have done tony didnt show up for his work shift and thats unheard of andys gone too they cant be found if they felt so desperatetrappedwhat could be easier than slipping out an airlock a flash of cold a moments pain and thenescape forever his single pair of hands clasped earnestly and its all my fault i should have been more perceptivesaid something he paused looking at her hopefully oh no it was nothing like that silver horrified hastened to dissuade him how awful for you to think that look she glanced around the hydroponics bay lowered her voice look i shouldnt tell you this but i cant let you go around thinkingthinking those fearful things she had his entire attention grave and intent how much dare she tell him some suitably edited reassurance tony and claire silver dr yeis voice rang out as the airseal doors slid open echoed by van attas bellow silver what do you know about all this aw shit leo snarled under his breath his piously clasped hands clenched to fists of frustration silver drew back in understanding and indignation you and yet she almost laughed leo so subtle and tricksy shed underestimated him did they both wear masks before the world then if so what unknown territories did his bland face conceal please silver before they get herei cant help you if it was too late van atta and yei tumbled into the room silver do you know where tony and claire have gone dr yei demanded breathlessly leo drew back into reserved silence appearing to take an interest in the fine structure of the white bean blossoms of course she knows van atta snapped before silver could reply those girls are in each others pockets i tell you oh i know yei muttered van atta turned sternly to silver cough it up silver if you know whats good for you silvers lips closed firmed into a line her chin lifted dr yei rolled her eyes at her superiors back now silver she began placatingly this isnt a good time for games if as we suspect tony and claire have tried to leave the habitat they could be in very serious trouble by now even physical danger im pleased that you feel you should be loyal to your friends but i beg you make it a responsible loyaltyfriends dont let friends get hurt silvers eyes puddled in doubt her lips parted inhaling for speech damn it cried van atta i dont have time to stand around sweettalking this little cunt that snakeeyed bitch that runs ops is waiting up there right now for the show to go on shes starting to ask questions and if she doesnt get the answers pronto shell come looking for em herself that one plays hardball of all the times to pick for this outbreak of idiocy this has gotta be the worst possible its got to be deliberate nothing this fouled up could be by chance his redfaced rage was having its usual effect on silver her belly trembled her vision blurred with unshed tears she had once felt she would give him anything do anything at all if only he would calm down and smile and joke again but not this time her initial awed infatuation with him had been emptied out of her bit by bit and it startled her to realize how little was left a hollowed shell could be rigid and strong you she whispered cant make me say anything just as i thought snarled van atta wheres your total socialization now dr yei if you would said dr yei through her teeth kindly refrain from teaching my subjects antisocial behavior you wouldnt have to deal with its consequences i dont know what youre whining about im an executive its my job to be hardassed thats why galactech put me in charge of this orbiting moneysink behavior control is your departments responsibility yei or so you claimed so do your job behavior shaping dr yei corrected frostily what the hells the use of that if it breaks down the minute the going gets tough i want something that works all the time if you were an engineer youd never get past the reliability specs isnt that right leo leo snapped off a bean leaf stem smiled blandly his eyes glittered he must have been chewing on his reply at any rate he swallowed something silver grasped at a simple plan so simple surely she could carry it out all she had to do was nothing do nothing say nothing eventually the crisis must pass they could not physically damage her after all she was valuable galactech property the rest was only noise she shrank into the safety of thingness and stony silence the silence grew thick as cold oil she nearly choked on it so hissed van atta to her thats the way you want to play it very well your choice he turned to yei you got something in the infirmary like fastpenta doctor yeis lips rippled fastpenta is only legal for police departments mr van atta dont they need a court order to use it too inquired leo not looking up from the bean leaf he twirled between his fingers on citizens leo that van atta pointed at silver is not a citizen what about it doctor to answer your question mr van atta no our infirmary does not stock illegal drugs i didnt say fastpenta i said something like it said van atta irritably some sort of anesthetic or something to do in a pinch are we in a pinch asked leo in a mild tone still twirling his leaf it was getting frayed pramod is substituting for tony surely one of the other girls with babies can take over for claire why should the ops vp know the difference if we end up having to scrape two of our workers off the pavement downside silver winced at this echo of her own ghastly scenario or find them floating freezedried outside somewhere up here itll be damned hard to conceal from her you havent met the woman leo she has a nose for trouble like a weasels mm said leo van atta turned back to yei what about it doctor or would you rather wait until someone calls us up asking what to do with the bodies iv thalizine is a bit like fastpenta muttered dr yei reluctantly in certain doses it will make her sick for a day though thats her choice he wheeled on silver your last chance silver ive had it i despise disloyalty where did they go tell me or its the needle for you right now she was driven from thingness at last to a more painful active human courage if you do that to me silver whispered in desperate dignity were through van atta recoiled in sputtering outrage through you and your little friends conspire to sabotage my career in front of the company brass and you tell me were through youre damn right were through company security shuttleport three captain bannerji speaking george bannerji recited into his comconsole may i help you you in charge here the welldressed man in his vid began abruptly he was clearly laboring under strong emotion breathing rapidly a muscle jumped in his clamped jaw bannerji took his feet off his desk and leaned forward yes sir im bruce van atta head of project at the habitat check my voiceprint or whatever it is you do bannerji sat up straight tapped out the checkcode the word cleared flashed for a moment across van attas face bannerji sat up straighter still yes sir go ahead van atta paused as if groping for words speaking slowly despite the jostling urgency of thought apparent in his tense face we have a little problem here captain red lights and sirens went off in bannerjis head he could recognize an asscovering understatement when he heard one oh three of ourexperimental subjects have escaped the habitat we interrogated their coconspirator and we believe they stowed away on shuttle flight b and are now loose somewhere in shuttleport three it is of the utmost urgency that they be captured and returned to us as quickly as possible bannerjis eyes widened information about the habitat was under a tight company security lid but no one could work on rodeo for long without learning that some kind of genetic experiments on humans were taking place up there in careful isolation it usually took a little longer for new employees to figure out that the more exotic monster stories told by the old hands were a form of hazing practiced upon their credulity bannerji had transferred in to rodeo about a month ago the project chiefs words rang through bannerjis head escaped captured criminals escaped dangerous zoo animals escaped when their keepers screwed up then some poor shmuck of a cop got the job of capturing them occasionally horrifying biological weapons escaped what the hell was he dealing with how will we recognize them sir do they bannerji swallowed look like human beings no van atta evidently read the dismay in bannerjis face for he snorted ironically youll have no trouble recognizing them i assure you captain and when you do find them call me at once on my private code i dont want this going out over broadcast channels for gods sake keep it quiet understand bannerji envisioned public panic yes sir i understand completely his own panic was a private matter he wouldnt be collecting the fat salary he did if security was expected to be all extended coffee breaks and pleasant evening strolls around perfectly deserted property hed always known the day would come when hed have to earn his pay van atta broke off with a grim nod bannerji put in a call on the comconsole for his subordinate and placed pages for both his offduty men as well something that had the executive hierarchy pouring sweat was nothing for a newlypromoted security grunt to take chances with he unlocked the weapons cabinet and signed out stunners and holsters for himself and his team he weighed a stunner thoughtfully in his palm it was such a light little diddly thing almost a toy galactech risked no lawsuits over stray shots from weapons like these bannerji stood a moment then turned to his own desk and keyed open the drawer with his personal palmlock the unregistered pistol nestled in its own locked box its shoulder holster coiled around it like a sleeping snake by the time bannerji had buckled it on and shrugged his uniform jacket back over it he was feeling much better he turned decisively to greet his patrolmen reporting for duty chapter leo paused outside the airseal doors to the habitats infirmary to gather his nerve he had been secretly relieved when a frantic call from pramod had pulled him shaking inside away from the excruciating interrogation of silver as secretly ashamed of his relief pramods problemfluctuating power levels in his beam welder traced at last to poisoning of the electronemitting cathode by gas contaminationhad occupied leo for a time but with the welding show over shame had driven him back here so what are you going to do for her at this late hour his conscience mocked him assure her of your continued moral support as long as it doesnt involve you in anything inconvenient or unpleasant what a comfort he shook his head tapped the door control leo drifted silently past the medtechs station without signing in silver was in a private cubicle a quarterwedge of the infirmarys circumference at the very end of the module the distance had helped muffle the yelling and crying leo peered through the observation window silver was alone floating limply in the locked sleep restraints against the wall in the light from the fluoros her face was greenish pale and damp her eyes seemed drained of their sparkling blue color blurred leaden smudges a yetunused spacesick sack was clutched hot and wrinkled in an upper hand sickened himself leo glanced up the corridor to be sure he was still unobserved swallowed the clot of impotent rage growing in his throat and slipped inside uh hi silver leo began with a weak smile how you doing he cursed himself silently for the inanity of his own words her smeary eyes found and focused on him uncomprehendingly then oh leo i think i was asleep for for a while funny dreams i still feel sick the drug must be wearing off her voice had lost the slurred dreamy quality it had had during the interrogation earlier now it was small and tight and selfaware she added with a quaver of indignation that stuff made me throw up and ive never thrown up before not ever it made me there were leo had learned the most intense social inhibitions against vomiting in free fall in silvers little world she would probably have been far less embarrassed at being stripped naked in public it wasnt your fault he hastened to reassure her she shook her head her hair waving in lank strands unlike its usual bright aureole her mouth pinched i should havei thought i could the red ninja never told his enemies his secrets and they drugged and tortured him both who asked leo startled oh silvers voice flattened to a wail they found out about our books too this time theyll find them all her lashes clotted with tears that could not fall but only accumulate until blotted away when her eyes widened to stare at leo in a horrified realization two or three droplets flew off in shimmering tangents and now mr van atta thinks ti must have known tony and claire were on his shuttlecollusionhe says hes going to get ti fired and hell find tony and claire down therei dont know what hell do to them ive never seen mr van atta so angry leos set jaw had ground his smile to a grimace still he tried to speak reasonably but you told themunder drugsthat ti didnt know surely he didnt believe it said i was lying but that would be logically inconsistent leo began cut himself short no youre right that wouldnt faze him god what an asshole silvers mouth opened in shock you meanmr van atta i mean bruciebaby you cant tell me youve been around the man for what eleven months and not figured that out i thought it was mesomething wrong with me silvers voice was still small and teary but her eyes began to brighten with a sort of predawn light she overcame her inner miseries enough to regard leo with increased attention bruciebaby huh the memory of one of dr yeis lectures about maintaining unified and consistent authority gave leo pause it had seemed to make great sense at the time never mind but theres nothing wrong with you silver her regard was sharpening to something almost scientific youre not afraid of him her tone of wonder suggested she found this an unexpected and remarkable discovery me afraid of brace van atta leo snorted not likely when he first came and took over dr cays position i thoughtthought he would be like dr cay look ah there is a very ancient rule of thumb that states people tend to get promoted to the level of their incompetence so far i think ive managed to avoid that unenviable plateau so i gather did your dr cayscrew yeis scruples leo thought and added bluntly van atta hasnt tony and claire would never have tried to run away if dr cay were still here a straggling species of hope began in her eyes are you saying you think this mess could be mr van attas fault leo stirred uneasily pronged by secret convictions he had not yet voiced even to himself your s s slavery situation seems intrinsically intrinsically wrong his mind supplied while his mouth fishtailed susceptible to abuse mishandling of all sorts because dr cay was so passionately dedicated to your welfare like a father to us silver confirmed sadly this er susceptibility remained latent but sooner or later its inevitable that someone begin to exploit it and you if not van atta someone else down the line someoneworse leo had read enough history yes much worse silver looked as if she were struggling to imagine something worse than van atta and failing she shook her head dolefully she raised her face to leo eyes like morning glories targeting the sun the target struck jerked out an involuntary smile whats going to happen now to tony and claire i tried not to give them away but that stuff made me so woozyit was dangerous for them before and now its worse leo attempted a tone of bluff and hearty reassurance nothings going to happen to them silver dont let bruces snit spook you theres not really much he can do to them theyre much too valuable to galactech hell yell at them no doubt and you cant blame him for that im ready to yell at them myself security will pick them up downsidethey cant have gone fartheyll get the lecture of their young lives and in a few weeks itll all blow over lessons learned leo faltered just what lessons would they learn from this fiasco all around you act likelike getting yelled atwas nothing it comes with age he offered someday youll feel that way too or was it power that this particular immunity came with leo was suddenly unsure but he had no power to speak of except the ability to build things knowledge as power yet who had power over him the line of logic trailed off in confusion he turned his thoughts impatiently from it mental wheelspinning as unproductive as philosophy class in college i dont feel that way now said silver practically look uh tell you what if itll make you feel better ill go along downside when they locate those kids maybe i can kind of keep things under control oh would you could you silver asked with relief like you were trying to help me leo felt like biting his tongue off uh yeah something like that youre not afraid of mr van atta you can stand up to him her eyebrows quirked selfdeprecatingly and she waved her lower arms as you can see im not equipped to stand up to anybody thank you leo there was even a little color in her face now uh right i better hustle along now if im to catch the shuttle going down to port three well have em back safe and sound by breakfast think of it this way at least galactech cant dock their pay for the extra shuttle trip this even won a brief smile from her leo her voice sobered and he paused on his way out the door what are we going to do if if theres ever anyone worse than mr van atta cross that bridge when you come to it he wanted to say evading the question but one more platitude and hed gag he smiled and shook his head and fled the warehouse made claire think of a crystal lattice it was all right angles stretching away at ninety degrees in each dimension huge slotted shelves reaching to the ceilings endless rows cross corridors blocking vision blocking flight but there was no flight here she felt like a stray molecule caught in the interstices of a doped crystal wafer out of place but trapped in retrospect the cozy curves of the habitat seemed like enclosing arms they huddled now in one empty cell of a shelf stack one of the few they had not found occupied by supplies measuring some two meters on a side tony had insisted on climbing to the third tier to be above the eye level of any chance downsider walking along the corridor upright on his long legs the ladders set at intervals along the shelves had actually proved easier to manage then creeping along the floor but getting the pack up had been a dreadful struggle as its cord was too short to climb up and draw it up after themselves claire was secretly unnerved andy was already finding an ability to push and grunt and wriggle against the gravity still only a few centimeters at a time but she had a nasty vision of him falling over the edge claire was developing a distaste for edges a robotic forklift whirred past claire froze cowering in the back of their recess clutching andy to her grabbing one of tonys hands the whirring trailed off into the distance she breathed again relax tony squeaked relax he breathed deeply in an apparent effort to follow his own advice claire peered doubtfully out of the cubicle at the forklift which had stopped farther down the corridor and was engaged in retrieving a plastic carton from its coded cell can we eat now she had been nursing andy on and off for the last three hours in an effort to keep him quiet and was drained in every sense her stomach growled and her throat was dry i guess said tony and dug a couple of ration bars out of their hoard in the pack and then wed better try and work our way back to the hangar cant we rest here a little longer tony shook his head the longer we wait the more chance theyll be looking for us if we dont get on a shuttle for the transfer station soon they may start searching the outbound jump ships and there goes our chance of stowing away undiscovered until after they boost past the point of no return andy squeaked and gurgled a familiar aroma wafted from his vicinity oh dear would you please get out a diaper claire asked tony again thats the fourth time since we left the habitat i dont think i brought near enough diapers claire worried smoothing out the laminated paper and plastic form tony handed her half our pack is filled with diapers cant youmake it last a little longer im afraid he may be getting diarrhea if you leave that stuff on his bottom too long it eats right through his skingets all redeven bleedsgets infectedand then he screams and cries every time you touch it to try and clean it real loud she emphasized the fingers of tonys lower right hand drummed on the shelf floor and he sighed biting back frustration claire wrapped the used diaper tightly in itself and prepared to stash it back in their pack do we have to cart those along tony asked suddenly everything in the pack is going to reek after a while besides its heavy enough already i havent seen a disposal unit anywhere said claire what else can we do with them tonys face screwed up with inner struggle just leave it he blurted on the floor its not like its going to float off down the corridor and get into the air recirculation here leave them all claire gasped at this horrific revolutionary idea tony following up his own suggestion before his nerve failed collected the four little wads and stuffed them into the far corner of the storage cubicle he smiled shakily in mixed guilt and elation claire eyed him in worry yes the situation was extraordinary but what if tony was developing a habit of criminal behavior would he return to normal when they gotwherever they were going if they got wherever they were going claire pictured their pursuers following the dirty diapers like a trail of flower petals dropped by that heroine in one of silvers books across half the galaxy if youve got him back together said tony with a nod at his son maybe we better start back toward the hangar that mob of downsiders may be cleared out by now how are we going to pick a shuttle this time asked claire how will we know that its not just going right back up to the habitator taking up a cargo to be unloaded in the vacuum if they vent the cargo bay into space while were in it tony shook his head lips tight i dont know but leo saysto solve a big problem or complete a big project the secret is to break it down into little parts and tackle them one at a time in order letsjust get back to the hangar first and see if theres any shuttles there at all claire nodded paused andy was not the only one of them plagued by biology she reflected grimly tony do you think we can find a toilet on the way back i need to go yeah me too tony admitted did you see any on the way here no locating the facilities had not been uppermost on her mind then on that nightmare journey creeping over the floors dodging hurrying downsiders squeezing andy tightly to her for fear that he might cry out claire wasnt even sure she could reconstruct the route theyd taken when theyd been driven out of their first hiding place by the busy work crew descending upon their machines and powering them up theres got to be something tony reasoned optimistically people work here not in this section claire noted gazing out at the wall of storage cells across the aisle its all robots back toward the hangar then sayhis voice faltered uh do you happen to know what a gravityfield toilet chamber looks like how do they manage air suction couldnt possibly fight the gee forces one of silvers smuggled historical vid dramas had involved a scene with an outhouse but claire was certain that was obsolete technology i think they use water somehow tony wrinkled his nose shrugged away his bafflement well figure it out his eye fell rather wistfully on the little wad of diapers in the corner its too bad no said claire repelled or at leastat least lets try to find a toilet first all right a distant rhythmic tapping was growing louder tony about to swing out on the ladder muttered oops and recoiled back into the cubicle he held a finger to his lips panic in his face and they all scuttled to the back of the cell aaah said andy claire snatched him up and stuffed the tip on one breast into his mouth full and bored he declined to nurse turning his head away claire let her tshirt fall back down and tried to distract him by silently counting all his busy fingers he too had become smudged with dirt as she had no big surprise planets were made of dirt dirt looked better from a distance say a couple of hundred kilometers the tapping grew louder passed under their cell faded company security man tony whispered in claires ear she nodded hardly daring to breathe the tapping was from those hard downsider foot coverings striking the cement floor a few minutes passed and the tapping did not return andy made only small cooing noises tony stuck his head cautiously out the chamber looked right and left up and down all right get ready to help me lower the pack as soon as this next forklift goes by itll have to fall the last meter but maybe the sound of the forklift will cover that some together they shoved the pack toward the edge of the cell and waited the whirring robolift was approaching down the corridor an enormous plastic storage crate almost as large as a cubicle positioned on its lift the forklift stopped below them beeped to itself and turned ninety degrees with a whine its lift began to rise at this point claire recalled that theirs was the only empty cell in this stack its coming here were going to get squashed get out get out on the ladder tony yelped instead she scuttled back to grab andy whom shed laid at the rear of the chamber as far as possible from the frightening edge while shed helped tony shove the pack forward the chamber darkened as the rising crate eclipsed the opening tony barely squeezed past it onto the ladder as it began to grind inward claire tony screamed he pounded uselessly on the side of the huge plastic crate claire no no stupid robot stop stop but the forklift clearly was not voiceactivated it kept coming bulldozing their pack before it there were only a few centimeters clearance on the sides and top of the crate claire retreated so terrified her screams clotted in her throat like cotton and she emitted only a smeary squeak back back the cold metal wall behind froze her she flattened against it as best she could standing on her lower hands holding andy with her uppers he was howling now infected by her terror earsplitting shrieks claire tony cried from the ladder a horrified bellow laced with tears andy the pack beside them compressed little crunching noises came from it at the last moment claire transferred andy to her lower arms below her torso bracing against the crate against gravity with her uppers perhaps her crushed body would hold the crate off just far enough to save himthe robolifts servos skreeled with overload and began to withdraw claire sent a silent apology to their oversized pack for all the curses she and tony had heaped upon it in the past hours nothing in it would ever be the same but it had saved them the robolift hiccoughed gears grinding bewilderedly the crate shifted on its pallet out of sync now as the lift withdrew the crate skidded with it dragged by friction and gravity skewing farther and farther from true claire watched openmouthed as it tilted and fell from the opening she rushed forward the crash shook the warehouse as the crate hit the concrete followed by a booming shattered echo the loudest sound claire had ever heard the crate took the forklift with it its wheels whirring helplessly in air as it banged onto its side the power of gravity was stunning the crate split its contents spilling hundreds of round metal wheelcovers of some kind burst forth ringing like a stampede of cymbals a dozen or so rolled down the aisle in either direction as if bent on escape wobbling into the corridor walls and falling onto their sides still spinning in everdiminishing whanging pulses of sound the echoes rang on in claires ears for a moment in the stupendous silence that followed oh claire tony swarmed back into the cell and wrapped all his arms around her andy between them as if he might never let go again oh claire his voice cracked as he rubbed his face against her soft short hair claire looked over his shoulder at the carnage they had created below the overturned robolift was beeping again like an animal in pain tony i think we better get out of here she suggested in a small voice i thought you were coming behind me onto the ladder right behind me i had to get andy of course you saved him while isaved myself oh claire i didnt mean to leave you in there i didnt think you did but i jumped it would have been plain stupid not to look can we talk about it later i really think we ought to get out of here yes oh yes uh the pack tony peered into the dimness of the recess claire didnt think they were going to have time for the pack eitheryet how far could they get without it she helped tony drag it back to the edge with frantic haste if you brace yourself back there while i hang onto the ladder we can lower it tony began claire pushed it ruthlessly over the edge it landed on the mess below tumbled to the concrete i dont think theres any more point in worrying about the breakables now lets go she urged tony gulped nodded moved quickly onto the ladder sparing one upper arm to help support andy whom claire held in her lowers her upper hands slapping down the rungs then they were back to the floor and their slow frustrating crabwise locomotion along it claire was beginning to hate the cold dusty smell of concrete they were only a few meters down the corridor when claire heard the pounding of downsider footcoverings again moving fast with uncertain pauses as if for direction a row or two over the steps must shortly thread the lattice to them then an echo of the stepsno another set what happened next seemed all in a moment suspended between one breath and the next ahead of them a greyuniformed downsider leaped from a crosscorridor into their own with an unintelligible shout his legs were braced apart to support his halfcrouch and he clutched a strange piece of equipment in both hands held up half a meter in front of his face his face was as white with terror as claires own ahead of her tony dropped the pack and reared up on his lower arms his upper hands flung wide crying no the downsider recoiled spasmodically his eyes wide mouth gaping in shock two or three bright flashes burst from his piece of equipment accompanied by sharp cracking bangs that echoed splintered all through the great warehouse then the downsiders hands jerked up the object flung away had it malfunctioned or shortcircuited burning or shocking him his face drained further from white to green then tony was screaming flopping on the floor all his arms curling in on himself in a tight ball of agony tony tony claire scrambled toward him andy clamped tightly to her torso and crying and screaming in fear his racket mingling with tonys in a terrifying cacophony tony whats wrong she didnt see the blood on his red tshirt until some drops spattered on the concrete the bicep of his left lower arm as he rolled toward her was a scrambled pulsing scarlet and purple mess tony the company security guard had rushed forward his face was harrowed with horror his hands empty now and rumbling with a portable comm link hooked to his belt it took him three tries to detach it nelson nelson he called into it nelson for gods sake call the medical squad quick its just kids i just shot a kid his voice shook its just some crippled kids leos stomach sank at the sight of the yellow pulses of light reflecting off the warehouse wall company medical squad yes there was their electric truck blinkers flashing parked in the wide central aisle the breathless words of the clerk whod met their shuttle tumbled through his brain found in the warehouse theres been an accident injury leos steps quickened slow down leo im getting dizzy van atta behind him complained irritably not everybody can bounce back and forth between nullgee and onegee like you do with no effects you know they said one of the kids was hurt so what are you going to do that the medics cant i personally am going to crucify that idiot security team for this ill meet you there leo snarled over his shoulder and ran aisle looked like a war zone smashed equipment stuff scattered everywhereleo half tripped over a couple of round metal cover plates kicked them impatiently out of his way a pair of medics and a security guard were huddled over a stretcher on the floor an iv bag hoisted on a pole like a flag above them red shirt tony it was tony whod been hurt claire was crouched on the floor a little farther down the aisle clutching andy tears streaming silently down her ragged white mask of a face on the stretcher tony writhed and cried out with a hoarse sob cant you at least give him something for pain the security guard urged the medtech i dont know the medtech was clearly flustered i dont know what all theyve done to their metabolisms shock is shock im safe with the iv and the warmers and the synergine but as for the rest of it patch in an emergency comm link to dr warren minchenko leo advised kneeling beside them hes chief medical officer for the cay habitat and hes on his months downside leave right now ask him to meet you at your infirmary hell take over the case there the security guard eagerly unhooked his comm link and began punching in codes oh thank god said the medtech turning to leo at last somebody who knows what the hell theyre doing do you know what i can give him for pain sir uh leo did a quick mental review of his first aid synthamorph should be all right until you get in touch with dr minchenko but adjust the dosethese kids weigh less than they look like they ought toi think tony masses about um kilos the peculiar nature of tonys injuries dawned on leo at last he had been picturing a fall broken bones maybe spinal cord or cranial damage what happened here gunshot wound reported the medtech shortly left lower abdomen and and um not femurleft lower limb thats just a flesh wound but the abdominal one is serious gunshot leo stared aghast at the guard who reddened did youi thought you guys carried stunnerswhy in the name of god when that damned hysteric called down from the habitat yammering about his escaped monsters i thoughti thoughti dont know what i thought the guard glowered at his boots didnt you look before you fired i damn near shot the girl with the baby the guard shuddered i hit this kid by accident jerking my aim away van atta panted up holy shit what a mess his eye fell on the security guard i thought i told you to keep this quiet bannerji what did you do set off a bomb he shot tony said leo through his teeth you idiot i told you to capture them not murder them how the hell am i supposed to sweep this he waved his arm down aisle under the rug and what the hell were you doing with a pistol anyway you saidi thought the guard began i swear ill have you canned for this of all the assbackwardsdid you think this was some kind of feeliedream drama i dont know whose judgment is worse yours or the jerks who hired you the guards face had gone from red to white why you stupid sonofabitch you set me up for this somebody had better keep a level head leo thought wretchedly bannerji had retrieved and bolstered his unauthorized weapon a fact van atta seemed to be unconscious ofthe temptation to shoot the project chief shouldnt be allowed to get too overwhelmingleo intervened gentlemen may i suggest that charges and defenses would be better saved for a formal investigation where everyone will be cooler and er more reasoned meantime we have some hurt and frightened kids to take care of bannerji fell silent simmering with injustice van atta growled assent contenting himself with a black look toward bannerji that boded ill for the guards future career the two medtechs snapped down the wheels of tonys stretcher and began rolling him down the aisle toward their waiting truck one of claires hands reached out after him fell back hopelessly the gesture caught van attas attention full of suppressed rage he discovered he had an object on which to vent it after all you he turned on claire she flinched into a tighter huddle do you have any idea what this escapade of yours is going to cost the cay project first to last of all the irresponsibledid you con tony into this she shook her head eyes widening of course you did isnt it always the way the male sticks his neck out the female gets it chopped off for him oh no and the timingwere you deliberately trying to smear me how did you find out about the ops vpdid you figure id cover up for you just because she was here clever cleverbut not clever enough leos head eyes ears throbbed with the beating of his blood lay off bruce shes had enough for one day the little bitch nearly gets your best student killed and you want to stand up for her get serious leo shes already scared out of her wits lay off she damn well better be when i get her back to the habitat van atta strode past leo grabbed claire by an upper arm yanked her cruelly and painfully up she cried out nearly dropping andy van atta overrode her you wanted to come downside you can bloody well just try walkingback to the shuttle then leo could not afterwards recall running forward or swinging van atta around to face him but only van attas surprised openmouthed expression bruce he sang through a red haze you smarmy creeplay off the uppercut to van attas jaw that punctuated this command was surprisingly effective considering it was the first time leo had struck a man in anger in his life van atta sprawled backwards on the concrete leo surged forward in a kind of dizzy joy he would rearrange van attas anatomy in ways that even dr cay had never dreamed of uh mr graf the security guard began touching him hesitantly on the shoulder its all right ive been waiting to do this for weeks leo assured him going for a grip on van attas collar its not that sir a cold new voice cut in fascinating executive technique i must take notes vice president apmad flanked by her flying wedge of accountants and assistants stood behind leo in aisle chapter well it wasnt my fault snapped shuttleport administrator chalopin i wasnt even told this was going on she glowered pointedly at van atta how am i supposed to control my jursidiction when other administrators hopscotch my properly established channels of command blithely hand out orders to my people without even informing me violate protocol the situation was extraordinary time was of the essence muttered van atta truculently leo secretly sympathized with chalopins testiness her smooth routine disrupted her office abruptly appropriated for the ops vps inquestapmad did not believe in wasting time the official company investigation of the incident had commenced by her fiat a bare hour ago in aisle hed be surprised if it took her more than another hour to finish sifting the case the windows of shuttleport threes adminstrative offices sealed against the internal pressure of the building framed a panorama of the complexthe runways loading zones warehouses offices hangars workers dormitories the monorail running off to the refinery glittering on the horizon and the eerily rugged mountains beyond and the vital power plant rodeos atmosphere had oxygen nitrogen and carbon dioxide but in the wrong proportions and at too low a pressure to suit human metabolism the air conditioning labored constantly to adjust the gas mix and filter out the contaminants a human might live for fifteen minutes outside without a breath mask leo was uncertain whether to think of it as a safety margin or just a slow death definitely not a garden spot bannerji had sidled around behind the shuttleport administrator hiding behind her leo thought it might be the best strategy for the security guard at that from her smart shoes through her trim galactech uniform to her sweptback coiffure not a hair out of place and her set clean jawline chalopin radiated both the will and the ability to defend her turf apmad refereeing the scrimmage was another type altogether dumpy on the high end of middle age frizzy grey hair cut short she might have been somebodys grandmother but for her eyes she made no attempt to dress for success as if she already possessed so much power she was beyond that game so far from regulating tempers her laconic comments had served to stir the pot as if she was curious what might float to the top definitely not a grandmothers eyes leo was still close to a boil himself the project is twentyfive years old time cant be that much of the essence god almighty cried van atta am i the only man here conscious of what the bottom line means bottom line said leo galactech is closer to its payoff from the cay project than ever before to screw things up now with an impatient premature attempt to wring profits is practically criminal youre on the verge of the first real results not really observed apmad coolly your first group of fifty workers is merely a token it will take another ten years to bring the whole thousand online cool yes but leo read a fierce concealed tension in her the source of which he could not yet identify so call it a tax loss you cant tell me this leo waved a hand toward the window indicating rodeo cant use a tax loss or two apmad rolled her eyes at the man who stood silently at her shoulder tell this young man the facts of hie gavin gavin was a big rumpled goon with a broken nose whom leo had taken at first for some kind of bodyguard he was in fact the ops vps chief accountant and when he spoke it was with startlingly precise and elegant elocution in impressive rounded paragraphs galactech had been offsetting the cay projects very considerable losses with rodeos paper profits since its inception id better recapitulate a little history for you mr graf gavin scratched his nose thoughtfully galactech holds rodeo on a ninetynineyear lease with the government of orient iv the original terms of the lease were extremely favorable to us since rodeos unique mineral and petrochemical resources were at that time still undiscovered and so they remained for the first thirty years of the lease the next thirty years saw an enormous investment of materials and labor on the part of galactech to develop rodeos resources of course he prodded the air with a didactic finger as soon as orient iv began to see our profit passing through their wormhole nexus they began to regret the terms of the lease and to seek a larger cut of the action rodeo was chosen as the site for the cay project in the first place in part besides certain unique legal advantages precisely so that its projected expenses could be charged against rodeos profits generally and reduce the er unhealthy excitement said profits were generating on orient iv galactechs lease of rodeo now has some fourteen years left to run and the government of orient iv is getting ah how shall i put this infected with anticipatory greed theyve just changed their tax laws and from the end of this fiscal year they propose to tax the companys rodeo operation upon gross not net profit we lobbied against it but we failed damn provincials he added reflectively so after the end of this fiscal year the cay project losses can no longer be offset against orient iv tax savings they will be real and passed through to us the terms of the new lease at the end of the next fourteen years are not expected to be favorable in fact we project orient iv is preparing to drive galactech out and take over its rodeo operations at a fraction of their real worth expropriation by any other name doth smell the same the economic blockade is already beginning the time to start limiting further investment and maximizing profit is now in other words said apmad a hard angry glitter in her eyes let them take over a hollow shell could be hard on the last guys out leo thought chilled didnt those jerks on orient iv realize that cooperation and compromise would increase everybodys profit in the end the galactech negotiators were probably not without fault either he reflected grimly hed seen other versions of the hostile takeover scenario before he glanced out the window at the large lively working facilities laid out below hardwon results of two generations of sincere labor and groaned inwardly at the thought of the waste to come from the horrified look on chalopins face she had a similar vision and leos heart went out to her how much of her blood had gone into the buildingup of this place how many peoples sweat and dedication cancelled at the stroke of a pen that was always your problem leo said van atta rather venomously you always get your head balled up in the little details and miss the big picture leo shook his head to clear it grasped for the lost thread of his original argument nevertheless the cay projects viability he paused abruptly seized by a breathtaking inspiration as delicate as a soap bubble the stroke of a pen could freedom be won with the stroke of a pen as simply as that he gazed at apmad with a new intensity two orders of magnitude more at least tell me maam he said carefully what happens if the cay projects viability is disproved we shut it down she said simply oh the tales out of school he might telland sink bruciebaby forever as an added bonusleos nerves thrilled he opened his mouth to pour out destruction and closed it sucked on his tongue regarded his fingernails and asked instead casually and what happens to the quaddies then the ops vp frowned as if shed bitten into something nasty that hidden tension again the most expression leo had yet seen upon her face that presents the most difficult problem of all difficult why difficult just let them go in feet leo strove to conceal his rising excitement behind a bland face if galactech would let them go immediately before the end of this fiscal year it could still take whatever it chooses to calculate as its investment in them as a tax loss against rodeos profits one last fling as it were one last bite out of orient iv leo smiled attractively let them go where you seem to forget mr graf that the bulk of them are still mere children leo faltered the older ones could help take care of the younger ones they already do some perhaps they could be moved for a few years to some other sector that could absorb the loss from their upkeepit couldnt cost galactech that much more than a like number of workers on pensions and only for a few years the company retirement pension fund is selfsupporting gavin the accountant observed elliptically rollover a moral obligation leo offered desperately surely galactech must admit some moral obligation to themwe created them after all the ground was shifting under his feet he could see it in her unsympathetic face but he could not yet discern in what direction the tilt was going moral obligation indeed agreed apmad her hands clenching and have you overlooked the fact that dr cay created these creatures fertile they are a new species you know he dubbed them homo quadrimanus not homo sapiens race quadrimanus he was the geneticist we may presume he knew what he was talking about what about galactechs moral obligation to society at large how do you imagine it will react to having these creatures and all their problems just dumped into its systems if you think they overreact to chemical pollution just imagine the flap over genetic pollution genetic pollution leo muttered trying to attach some rational meaning to the term it sounded impressive no if the cay project is proved to be galactechs most expensive mistake we will containerize it properly the cay workers will be sterilized and placed in some suitable institution there to live out their lives otherwise unmolested not an ideal solution but the best available compromise stst leo stuttered what crime have they committed to be sentenced to life in prison and where if rodeo is to be closed down will you find or build another suitable orbital habitat if youre worried about expense lady thatll be expensive they will be placed planetside of course at a fraction of the cost a vision of silver creeping uncomfortably across the floor like a bird with both wings broken burst in leos brain thats obscene theyll be no better than cripples the obscenity snapped apmad was in creating them in the first place until dr cays death brought his department under mine i had no idea that his rdbiologicals was concealing such enormously invasive manipulations of human genes my home world embraced the most painfully draconian measures to ensure our gene pool not be overrun with accidental mutationsto go out and deliberately introduce mutations seems the most vile she caught her breath contained her emotions again except what escaped her nervously drumming fingers the right thing to do is euthanasia terrible as it seems at first glance it might actually be less cruel in the long run gavin the accountant squirming twitched an uncertain smile at his boss his eyebrows had gone up in surprise down in dismay and at last settled on up againnot taking her seriously perhaps leo didnt think shed been joking but gavin added in a facetiously detached professional tone it would be more cost effective if it were done before the end of this fiscal year we could indeed take them as a losstotalagainst orient taxes leo felt suspended in glass you cant do that he whispered theyre peoplechildrenit would be murder no it would not denied apmad repugnant certainly but not murder that was the other half of the reason for locating the cay project in orbit around rodeo besides physical isolation rodeo exists in legal isolation its in the ninetynineyear lease the only legal writ in rodeo local space is galactech regulation i fear this has less to do with foresight than with dr cays successful blocking of any interference with his schemes but if galactech chooses not to define the cay workers as human beings company regulations regarding crimes do not apply oh really bannerji brightened slightly how does galactech define them asked leo glassily curious legally postfetal experimental tissue cultures said apmad and what do you call murdering them retroactive abortion apmads nostrils grew pinched simple disposal or gavin glanced sardonically at bannerji vandalism perhaps our one legal requirement is that experimental tissue be cremated upon disposal igs standard biolab rules launch them into the sun leo suggested tightly thatd be cheap van atta stroked his chin gently and regarded leo uneasily calm down leo were just talking contingency scenarios here military staffs do it all the time quite agreed the ops vp she paused to frown at gavin whose flippancy apparently did not please her there are some hard decisions to be made here which i am not anxious to face but it seems they have been dealt to me better me than someone blind to the longterm consequences to society at large like dr cay but perhaps mr graf you will wish to join mr van atta in showing how dr cays original vision might still be carried out at a profit so we can all avoid having to make the hardest choices van atta smiled at leo smarmily triumphant vindicated vindictive calculating to return to the matter at hand van atta said ive already requested that captain bannerji be summarily terminated for his poor judgment and he glanced at gavin and vandalism i might also suggest that the cost of tyxgs hospitalization be charged to his department bannerji wilted administrator chalopin stiffened but its increasingly apparent to me van atta went on fixing his most unpleasant smile on leo that theres another matter to be pursued here ah shit thought leo hes going to get me on an assault chargean eighteenyear career up in smokeand i did it to myselfand i didnt even get to finish the job subversion huh said leo the quaddies have been growing increasingly restive in the past few months coincidentally with your arrival leo van attas gaze narrowed after todays events i wonder if it was a coincidence i rather think not isnt it so that he wheeled and pointed dramatically at leo you put tony and claire up to this escapade me leo sputtered in outrage paused true tony did come to me once with some very odd questions but i thought he was just curious about his upcoming work assignment i wish now id you admit it van atta crowed you have encouraged defiant attitudes toward company authority among the hydroponics workers and among your own students entrusted to youignored the psych departments carefully developed guidelines for speech and behavior while aboard the habitatinfected the workers with your own bad attitudes leo realized suddenly that van atta was not going to let him get a word of defense in edgewise if he could possibly help it van atta was onto something infinitely more valuable than mere vengeance for a punch in the jawa scapegoat a perfect scapegoat upon whom he could pin every glitch in the project for the past two monthsor longer depending on his ingenuityand sacrifice qualmlessly to the company gods himself emerging squeakyclean and sinless no by god leo roared if i were running a revolution id do a damn sight better job of it thanthat he waved in the general direction of the warehouse his muscles bunched to launch himself at van atta again if he was to be fired anyway hed at least get some satisfaction out of it gentlemen apmads voice sluiced down like a bucket of ice water mr van atta may i remind you that terminations from outlying facilities like rodeo are discouraged not only is galactech contractually obligated to provide transportation home to the terminees but there is also the expense and large time delay of importing their replacements no we shall finish it this way captain bannerji shall be suspended for two weeks without pay and an official reprimand added to his permanent record for carrying an unauthorized weapon on official company duty the weapon shall be confiscated mr graf shall be officially reprimanded also but return immediately to his duties as there is no one to replace him in them but i was screwed complained bannerji but im totally innocent cried leo its a fabricationa paranoid fantasy you cant send graf back to the habitat now yelped van atta next thing you know hell be trying to unionize em considering the consequences of the cay projects failure said the ops vp coldly i think not eh mr graf leo shivered eh she sighed without satisfaction thank you this investigation is now complete further complaints or appeals by any party may be addressed to galactech headquarters on earth if you dare her quirked eyebrow added even van atta had the sense to keep his mouth shut the mood in the shuttle for the return trip to the habitat was to say the least constrained claire accompanied by one of the habitats infirmary nurses pulled off her downside leave three days early for the duty huddled in the back clutching andy leo and van atta sat as far from each other as the limited space allowed van atta spoke once to leo i told you so you were right leo replied woodenly van atta nearly purred at the stroke smug leo would rather have stroked him with a pipe wrench could van atta be all right as well was his disruptive pressure for instant results a sign of concern for the quaddies welfare even survival no leo decided with a sigh the only welfare that truly concerned bruce was his own leo let his head rest on the padded support and stared out his window as the acceleration of takeoff thrust him back in his seat a shuttle ride was still a bit of a thrill to something deep in him even after the countless trips hed made there were peoplebillions the vast majoritywho never set foot off their home planets in their lives he was one of the lucky few lucky to have his job lucky in the results hed achieved over the years the vast morita deep space transfer station had probably been the crown of his career the largest project he was ever likely to work on hed first viewed the site when it was empty icy vacuum as nothing as nothing could possibly be hed passed through it again just last year making a changeover from a ship from ylla to a ship for earth morita had looked good really good alive even undergoing expansion of its facilities several years sooner than anyone had expected smooth expansion plans for it had been incorporated into the original designs overambitious theyd called it then farsighted they called it now and there had been other projects too every day from one end of the wormhole nexus to the other countless accidents of structural failure did not occur because he and people hed trained had done their jobs well the work of a harried week the early detection of the propagating microcracks in the reactor coolant lines at the great beni ra orbital factory alone had saved perhaps three thousand lives how many surgeons could claim to save three thousand lives in ten years of their careers on that memorable inspection tour hed done it once a month for a year invisibly unsung disasters that never happen dont normally make headlines but he knew and the men and women who worked alongside him knew and that was enough he regretted slugging bruce the moments red joy had certainly not been worth risking his job for the eighteen years of accumulating pension benefits the stock options the seniority yes maybe with no family to support they were all leos to piss into the wind if he chose but who would take care of the next beni ra when they returned to the habitat he would cooperate apologize handsomely to bruce redouble his training efforts increase his care bite his tongue speak only when spoken to be polite to dr yei hell even do what she told him anything else was impossibly risky there were a thousand kids up there so many so variedso young a hundred fiveyearolds a hundred and twenty sixyearolds alone cramming the creche modules playing games in their freefall gym no one individual could possibly take responsibility for risking all those lives on something chancy it would be endless allconsuming impossible criminal insane revoltwhere could it lead no one could possibly forsee all the consequences leo couldnt even see around the next corner no one could no one they docked at the habitat van atta shooed claire and andy and the nurse ahead of him through the hatchway as leo slowly unfastened his seat harness oh no leo heard van atta say the nurse will take andy to the creche you will return to your old dormitory taking that baby downside was criminally irresponsible its clear you are totally unfit to have charge of him i can guarantee youll be struck from the reproduction roster too claires weeping was so muffled as to be nearly inaudible leo closed his eyes in pain god he asked why me releasing his last restraint he fell blindly into his future chapter leo silver anchored one hand and pounded softly and frantically with the other three on the door to the engineers sleeping quarters leo quick wake up help she laid her cheek against the cold plastic muffling her bursting howl to a small sliding leo she dared not cry louder lest she attract more than leos ear his door slid open at last he wore red tshirt and shorts barefoot his sleep sack against the far wall hung open like an empty cocoon and his thinning sandy hair stuck out in odd directions what the hell silver his face was rumpled with sleep eyes darkringed but focusing fast come quick come quick silver hissed grabbing his hand its claire she tried to go out an airlock i jammed the controls she cant get the outer door open but i cant get the inner door open either and shes trapped in there our supervisor will be back soon and then i dont know what theyll do to us sonofa he allowed her to draw him into the corridor then lurched back into his cabin to grab a tool belt all right go go lead on they sped through the maze of the habitat offering strained bland smiles to those quaddies and downsiders they flew past in the corridors at last the familiar door to hydroponics d closed behind them what happened how did this happen leo asked her as they brushed through the growtubes to the far end of the module they wouldnt let me go see claire day before yesterday when you brought her back on the shuttle even though we were both in the infirmary yesterday we were on different work teams i think it was on purpose today i made teddie trade with me silvers voice smeared with her distress claire said they wont even let her into the creche to see andy on her offshift i went to get fertilizer from stores to charge the growtubes we were working on and when i came back the lock was just starting to cycle if only she hadnt left claire aloneif only she had not let the shuttle take them downside in the first placeif only she had not betrayed them to dr yeis drugsif only theyd been born downsidersor not been born at all the airlock at the end of the hydroponics module was almost never used merely waiting to become the airseal door to the next module that future growth might demand silver pressed her face to the observation window to her immense relief claire was still within but she was ramming herself back and forth between door and door her face smeared with tears and blood fingers reddened whether she gulped for air or only screamed silver could not tell for all sound was silenced by the barrier door like a turneddown holovid silvers own chest seemed so tight she could scarcely breathe leo glanced in his lips drew back in a fierce scowl in his whitened face and he turned to hiss at the lock mechanism scrabbling at his tool belt you fixed it but good silver i had to do something quick shorting it that way blocked the alarm from going off in central systems oh leos hands hesitated briefly not so random a stab as it looks then random in an airlock control box she stared at him in surprise and some indignation im not a fiveyearold indeed not a crooked grin lightened his tense face for a moment any quaddie of six would know better my apologies silver so the problem then is not how to open the door but how to do so without tripping the alarm yes right she hovered anxiously he looked the mechanism over glanced up rather more hesitantly at the airlock door which vibrated to the thumping from within you sure claire doesnt needmore help anyway she may need help snapped silver but what shell get is dr yei ah right his grin thinned out altogether he clipped a couple of tiny wires and rerouted them with one last doubtful look at the lock door he tapped a pressure plate within the mechanism the inner door slid open and claire tumbled out gasping rawly let me go let me go oh why didnt you let me goi cant stand this she curled up in a huddled ball in midair face hidden silver darted to her wrapped her arms around her oh claire dont do things like that thinkthink how tony would feel stuck in that hospital downship when they told him what does it matter demanded claire muffled against silvers blue tshirt theyll never let me see him again i might as well be dead theyll never let me see andy yes leo chimed in think of andy who will protect him if youre not around not just today but next week next year claire unwound and fairly screamed at him they wont even let me see him they threw me out of the creche leo seized her upper hands who who threw you out mr van atta right i might have known claire listen to me the proper response to bruce isnt suicide its murder really said silver her interest sparking even claire was drawn out of her tight wad of misery enough to meet leos eyes directly for the first time well perhaps not literally but you cant let the bastard grind you down look were all smart here right you kids are smartive been known to knock down a problem or two in my timeweve got to be able to think our way out of this mess if we try youre not alone claire well help ill help but youre a company mana downsiderwhy should you galactechs not god claire you shouldnt have to sacrifice your firstborn to it galactechany companyis just a way one way for people to organize themselves to do a job thats too big for one person to do alone its not god its not even a being for pitys sake it doesnt have a free will to answer for its just a collection of people working bruce is only bruce theres got to be some way to get around him you mean go over his head asked silver thoughtfully maybe to that vice president who was here last week leo paused well maybe not to apmad but ive been thinkingfor three days ive been thinking of nothing else but how to blow up this whole rotten setup but youve got to hang on for me to have time to workclaire can you hang on can you his hands tightened on hers urgently she shook her head doubtfully it hurts so much you have to look listen theres nothing i can do here at rodeo its in this peculiar legal bubble if it were a regular planetary government i swear id go into debt to my eyebrows and buy each and every one of you a ticket out of here but then if it were a regular planet i wouldnt need to anyway galactech has a monopoly on jump ship seats here you travel on a company ship or not at all so we have to wait and bide our time but in a little timejust a few monthsthe first quaddies will leave rodeo on the first real work assignments working in and passing through real planetary jurisdictions governments too big and powerful even for galactech to mess with im surepretty sure if i pick the right venuenot apmads planet of course but say earthearths by far the best bet im a citizen therei can bring a classaction suit declaring you legal persons ill probably lose my job and the costs will eat me but it can be done not exactly the lifes work i had in mind but eventually you can be cracked loose from galactech so long a time sighed claire no no delay is our friend the little ones grow older every day by the time the legal case goes through youll all be ready go as a grouphire outfind workeven galactech wouldnt be so bad as an employer if you were citizens and regular employees with all the legal protections maybe even the spacers union would take you in though that might constrainwell im not sure if they dont perceive you as a threat anyway something can be worked out but youve got to hang on promise me silver breathed again when claire nodded slowly she drew claire away to the first aid kit on the wall to apply antisepts and plastic bandages to her torn fingernails and wipe the blood from her bruised face there there better leo meanwhile restored the airlock control to its original working order then drifted over to them all right now he turned his face to silver is she going to be all right silver could not help glowering as all right as any of us its not fair she burst out this is my home but its beginning to feel like an overpressurized oxy bottle everybodys upset all the quaddies about tony and claire there hasnt been anything like this since jamie was killed in that awful pusher accident but thisthis was on purpose if theyd do that to tony who was so good what aboutabout me any of us whats going to happen next i dont know leo shook his head grimly but im pretty sure the idyll is over this is only the beginning but what will we do what can we do welldont panic and dont despair especially dont despair the airseal doors at the end of the module slid open and the downsider hydroponics supervisors voice lilted in girls we got the seed delivery on the shuttle after allis that growtube ready yet leo twitched but turned back one last time before hastening away to grasp a hand of each quaddie with determined pressure its just an old saying but i know its true from personal experience chance favors the prepared mind so stay strong get back to youhe escaped past the hydroponics supervisor with an elaborately casual yawn as if hed merely stopped in to kibbitz a moment upon the work in progress silvers stomach churned as she watched claire fearfully claire sniffled and turned hurriedly away to busy herself with the grow tube hiding her face from their supervisor silver shivered with relief all right for now the churning in silvers stomach was slowly replaced by something hot and unfamiliar filling it crowding out the fear how dare they do this to herto meto us they have no right no right no right rage made her head pound but it was better than the knotting fear there was almost an exultation in it the expression silver bent her head to conceal from the supervisor was a small fierce frown the nutrition assistant a quaddie girl of perhaps thirteen handed leos lunch tray to him through the serving window without her usual bright smile when leo smiled and said thank you the responding upward twitch of her mouth was mechanical and fell away instantly leo wondered in what scrambled form the story of claires and tonys downside disaster of the previous week had reached her ears not that the correct facts werent distressing enough the whole habitat seemed plunged into an atmosphere of wary dismay leo felt a flash of horrible weariness of the quaddies and their everlasting troubles he shied away from a collection of his students eating their lunches near the serving window though they waved to him with assorted hands and instead floated down the module until he saw a vacant space to velcro his tray next to somebody with legs by the time leo realized the legged person was the supply shuttle captain durrance it was too late to retreat but durrances greeting grunt was without animosity evidently he did not unlike some others leo could name hold the engineer obscurely responsible for his student tonys spectacular fiasco leo hooked his feet into the straps to free his hands to attack his meal returned the grunt and sucked hot coffee from his squeeze bulb there wasnt enough coffee in the universe to dissolve his dilemmas durrance it appeared was even in the mood for polite conversation you going to be taking your downside leave soon soon in about a week leo realized with a start time was getting away from him like everything else around here whats rodeo like dull durrance spooned some sort of vegetable pudding into his mouth ah leo glanced around is ti with you durrance snorted not likely hes downside on ice hes appealing a twisted grimace and raised eyebrows pointed up the double meaning not you understand from my point of view i got a reprimand on my record because of that damn tadpole if it had been his first screwup he might have been able to duck getting fired but now i dont think he has a chance your van atta wants his pelt riveted to the airlock doors hes not my van atta leo denied strenously if he was id trade him for a dog and shoot the dog finished durrance a grin twitched his mouth van atta thats all right if the rumor i heard is true he may not have so long to strut either ah leos ears pricked hopefully i was talking yesterday to the jump pilot from the weekly personnel ship from orient ivhed just finished his months gravity leave therelisten up to this one he swears the betan embassy there is demonstrating an artificial gravity device what how piping it in from wormhole space for all i know you bet beta colony is sitting on the math of it till they make their initial killing in the marketplace and recoup their rd costs its apparently been kept under wraps by their military for a couple of years already till they got their head start damn em galactech and everybody else will be on the scramble to catch up every other rd project in the company is going to have to kiss their budget goodbye for a couple of years you watch my god leo glanced up the length of the cafeteria module crowded with quaddies my god durrance scratched his chin reflectively if its true do you have any idea what its going to do to the space transport industry the jump pilot claims the betans got the damned thing there in two monthsfrom beta colonyboosting at fifteen gees and insulating the crew from the acceleration using it therell be no limit to acceleration now but fuel costs it probably wont affect bulk cargos much for that very reason but the passenger tradell be revolutionized the speed news travels whichll affect the rate of exchange between planetary currenciesmilitary transport where they dont care what they spend on fueland you can bet thatll affect interplanetary politicsits a whole new game all around durrance finished scraping the last globs of food out of the pockets of his lunch tray damn the colonials good old conservative earthbased galactech left in the lurch again you know im really tempted to emigrate out to the farther end of the wormhole nexus sometimes the wifes got family on earth though so i dont suppose we ever will leo hung stunned in his straps as durrance droned on after a moment he swallowed the bite of squash still in his mouth there being no more practical way to dispose of it do you realize he choked what this will do to the quaddies durrance blinked not much surely theres still going to be plenty of jobs to do in free fall it will destroy their edge in profitability versus ordinary workers thats what it was the downside medical leaves that were boosting the personnel costs eliminate them and theres nothing to choose betweencan this thing provide artificial gravity on a space station if they could mount it on a ship they can put it on a station opined durrance its not some kind of perpetual motion though he cautioned it sucks power like crazy the jump pilot said thatll cost something not as muchand surely theyll find more design efficiencies as they go alongoh god this chance wasnt going to favor the quaddies this chance favored no one damn damn damn the timing ten years from now even one year from now it could have been their salvation here now might it bea death sentence leo flipped his feet out of the straps and coiled to launch himself toward the module doors you just leaving this tray here asked durrance can i have your dessert leo waved a hand in impatient assent as he sprang away one look at bruce van attas glum and hostile face as leo swung into his habitat office confirmed durrances story have you heard this artificial gravity rumor leo demanded anyway one last lurch of hopelet van atta deny it name it fraud van atta glared at him in profound irritation how the hell did you find out about it its none of your business where i found out about it is it true oh yes it is my business i want to keep this under wraps for as long as possible it was true then leos heart shrank why how long have you known about it van attas hand flipped the edges of a pile of plastic flimsies computer printouts and communiques magnetized to his desk three days its official then oh quite official van attas mouth twisted in disgust i got the word from galactech district headquarters on orient iv apmad apparently met the news on her way home and made one of her famous field decisions he rattled the flimsies again and frowned theres no way around it do you know what came in yesterday on the heels of this thing kline station has cancelled its construction contract with galactech the first one we were going to send the quaddies out on paid the penalty without a murmur kline stations out toward beta colony they must have found out about this weeks agomonths theyve switched to a betan contractor who we may presume is undercutting us the cay project is cooked nothing left to do but wrap it up and get the hell out of here the sooner the better damn so now im associated with a loser project ill come out reeking with odor of loss wrap wrap how what do you mean wrap that bitch apmads most favored scenario ill bet she was purring when she cut these ordersthe quaddies gave her nervous palpitations yknow theyre to be sterilized and stashed downside any pregnancies in progress to be abortedshit and we just started fifteen of em what a fiasco a year of my career down the tubes my god bruce youre not going to carry out those orders are you oh no just watch me van atta stared at him chewing his lip leo could feel himself tensing pale with his suppressed fury van atta sniffed what dyou want leo apmad could have ordered them exterminated theyre getting off lightly it could have been worse and if it had beenif she had ordered the quaddies killedwould you have carried it out inquired leo deceptively calm she didnt cmon leo im not inhuman sure im sorry for the little suckers i was doing my damndest to make em profitable but theres no way i can fight this all i can do is make the wrap as quick and clean and painless as possible and cut the losses as much as i can maybe somebody in the company hierarchy will appreciate it painless to whom to everybody van atta grew more intent and leaned toward leo with a scowl that means i dont need a lot of panic and wild rumors floating around you hear i want business as usual right up to the last minute you and all the other instructors will go on teaching your classes just as if the quaddies really were going out on a work project until the downside facility is ready and we can start shuttling em maybe take the little ones firstthe salvageable parts of the habitat are supposed to be moved around the orbit to the transfer station we might cut some costs by using quaddies for that last job to imprison them downside oh come off the dramatics theyre being placed in a perfectly ordinary drilling workers dormitory only abandoned six months ago when the field ran dry van atta brightened slightly in selfcongratulation i found it myself looking over the possible sites to place em itll cost next to nothing to refurbish it compared to building new leo could just picture it he shuddered and what happens in fourteen years when and if orient iv expropriates rodeo van atta ruffled his hair with both hands in exasperation how the hell should i know at that point it becomes orient ivs problem theres only so much one human being can do leo leo smiled slowly in grim numbness im not sure what one human being can do ive never pushed myself to the limit i thought i had but i realize now i hadnt my selftests were always carefully nondestructive this test was a higher order of magnitude altogether this tester perhaps scorned the merely humanly possible leo tried to remember how long it had been since hed prayed or even believed never he decided like this hed never needed like this before van atta frowned at him suspiciously youre weird leo he straightened his spine as if seeking a posture of command just in case you missed my message let me repeat it loud and clear you are to mention this artificial gravity business to no one that means especially no quaddies likewise keep their downside destination secret ill let yei figure out how to make them swallow it without kicking its time she earned her overinflated salary no rumors no panics no goddamn workers riotsand if there are ill know just whose hide to nail to the wall got it leos smile was canine concealingeverything got it he withdrew without turning his back or speaking another word dr yei was not usually easy to track down it being her habit to circulate often among the quaddies observing behavior taking notes making suggestions but this time leo found her at once in her office with plastic flimsies stuck to every available surface and her desk console lit like a christmas tree did they have christmas at the cay habitat leo wondered somehow he thought not did you hear her glum slouch answered his question even as his white face and rapid breathing finished asking it yes ive heard she said wearily glancing up at him brace just dumped the whole habitats personnel evacuation logistics on my desk to organize he he tells me being an engineer will be doing facility dismantling and equipment salvage flow charts just as soon as i get the bodies out of his way excuse me the damned bodies leo shook his head helplessly are you going to do it she shrugged her lips compressed how can i not do it quit in high dudgeon it wouldnt change a thing this affair would not be rendered one iota less brutal for my walking out and it could get a lot worse i dont see how leo ground out you dont she frowned no i dont suppose you do you never appreciated what a dangerous legal edge the quaddies are balanced on here but i did one wrong move andoh damn it all i knew apmad needed careful handling everything got away from me although i suppose this artificial gravity thing would have killed the project whoever was in charge we are very very lucky that she didnt order the quaddies exterminated you have to understand she had something like four or five pregnancies terminated for genetic defects back on her home world when she was a young woman it was the law she eventually gave up got divorced took an offplanet job with galactechcame up through the ranks she has a deep emotional vested interest in her prejudices against genetic tampering and i knew it and blew it she still could order the quaddies killeddo you understand that any report of trouble unrest magnified by her genetic paranoias and she squeezed her eyes shut massaged her forehead with her fingertips she could order itwho says youve got to carry it out you said you cared about the quaddies weve got to do something said leo what yeis hands clenched spread wide what what what one or twoeven if i could adopt one or two take them away with mesmuggle them out somehow who knowswhat then to live on a planet with me socially isolated as cripples freaks mutantsand sooner or later they would grow to adulthood and then what and what about the others a thousand leo and if apmad did order them exterminated what excuse would you find then for doing nothing oh go away she groaned you have no appreciation for the complexities of the situation none what do you think one person can do i used to have a life of my own once before this job swallowed it ive given six yearswhich is five and threequarters more than you haveive given all i can im burned out when i get away from this hole i never want to hear of quaddies again theyre not my children i havent had time to have children she rubbed her eyes angrily and sniffed inhalingtearsor just bile leo didnt know leo didnt care theyre not anybodys children leo growled thats the trouble theyre some kind of genetic orphans or something if youre not going to say anything useful please go away she repeated a wave of her hand encompassed the mass of flimsies i have work to do leo had not struck a female since he was five years old he removed himself shaking he drifted slowly through the corridors back toward his own quarters cooling and whatever had he hoped to get from yei anyway relief from responsibility was he to dump his conscience on her desk a la bruce and say take care of it and yet and yet and yet there was a solution in here somewhere he could feel it a palpable dim shape like a tightness in the gut a mounting screaming frustration the problem that refused to fall into the right pieces the elusive solutionhed solved engineering problems that presented themselves at first as such solid unscalable walls he did not know where the leaps beyond logic that ultimately topped them came from except that it was not a conscious process however elegantly he might diagram it post facto he could not solve it and he could not leave it alone but picked uselessly at it counterproductive like picking a scab in a rising compulsive frenzy the wheels spun imparting no motion its in here he whispered touching his head i can feel it i just cant see it they had to get out of rodeo local space somehow that much was certain all the quaddies there was no future here it was the damn peculiar legal setup what was he to dohijack a jump ship but the personnel jump ships carried no more than three hundred passengers he could just barely picture himself holding aa what what weapon he had no gun his pocket knife featured mainly screwdriversright hold a screwdriver to the pilots head and cry jump us to orient ivwhere he would promptly be arrested and jailed for the next twenty years for piracy leaving the quaddies to do what in any case he could not possibly hijack three ships at the same time and that was the minimum number needed leo shook his head chance favors he muttered chance favors chance favors orient iv would not want the quaddies nobody was going to want the quaddies what indeed could their future be even if freed from galactech gypsy orphans alternately ignored exploited or abused in their dependency on the narrow environment of humanitys chain of space facilities talk about technology traps he pictured silverhe had little doubt just what sort of exploitation would be her lot with that elegant face and body of hers no place for her out there no leo denied silently the universe was so damned big there had to be a place a place of their own far far from the trappings and traps of human socalled civilization the histories of previous utopian social experiments in isolation were not encouraging but the quaddies were exceptional in every way between one breath and the next the vision took him it came not as a chain of reason more words words words but as a blinding image all complete in its first moment inherent holistic gestalt inspired every hour of his life from now on would be but the linear exploration of its fullness a stellar system with an m or g or k star gentle steady pouring out power for the catching circling it a jovian gas giant with a methane and waterice ring for water oxygen nitrogen hydrogen most important of all an asteroid belt and some equally important absences no earthlike planet orbiting there also to attract competition not on a wormhole jump route of strategic importance to any potential conquistadors humanity had passed over hundreds of such systems in its obsessive quest for new earths the charts were glutted with them a quaddie culture spreading out along the belt from their initial base a society of the quaddies by the quaddies for the quaddies burrowing into the rocks for protection against radiation and to seal in their precious air expanding leapfrogging from rock to rock to drill and build new homes minerals all around more than they could ever use whole hydroponics farms for silver a new world to build a space world to make morita station look like a toy why leos eyes widened with delight its an engineering problem after all he hung limply in air entranced fortunately the corridor was empty of passersby at the moment or they would surely have thought him mad or drugged the solution had been lying around him in pieces all this time invisible until hed changed he grinned dementedly possessed he yielded himself up to it without reservation all all there was no limit to what one man might do if he gave all and held back nothing didnt hold back didnt look backfor there would be no going back literally medically that was the heart of it men adapted to free fell it was the going back that crippled them i am a quaddie leo whispered in wonder he regarded his hands clenched and spread his fingers just a quaddie with legs he wasnt going back as for that initial basehe was floating in it right now it merely required relocating his cascading thought clicked over the connections too rapidly to analyze he didnt need to hijack a spaceship he was in one all it needed was a bit of power and the power lay readytohand in rodeo orbit being gratuitously wasted even at this moment to shove mere bulk petrochemicals out of orbit what might a petrochemical podbundle mass compared to a chunk of the cay habitat leo didnt know but he knew he could find out the numbers would be on his side anyway whatever their precise magnitudes the cargo thrusters could handle the habitat if it were properly reconfigured and anything the thrusters could handle one of the monster cargo superjumpers could manage too it was all there allfor the taking for the taking chapter it took an hour of stalking before leo was able to catch silver alone in a monitor blind spot in a corridor leading from the free fall gym is there someplace we can talk in private he asked her i mean really private her wary glance around confirmed that she understood him perfectly still she hesitated is it important vital life or death for every quaddie that important well wait a minute or two then follow me he trailed her slowly and casually through the habitat a flash of shimmering hair and blue jersey at this or that crossbranching then down one corridor he suddenly lost her silver sh she hissed at his ear a wall panel hinged silently inward and one of her strong lower hands reached out to yank him in like a fish on a line it was dark and narrow behind the wall for only a moment then airseal doors parted with a whisper to reveal an oddshaped chamber perhaps three meters across they slipped within whats this asked leo stunned the clubhouse anyway we call it that we built it in this little blind pocket you wouldnt notice it from outside unless you were looking for it at just the right angle tony and pramod did the outside walls siggy ran the ductwork in others did the wiring the airseals we built from spare parts werent they missed her smile was not in the least innocent quaddies do the computer records entry too the parts just sort of ceased to exist in inventory a bunch of us worked together on itwe just finished it about two months ago i was sure dr yei and mr van atta would find out about it when they were questioning me her smile faded to a frown in memory but they never asked just the right question now the only vids we have left are the ones that happened to be stored in here and darla doesnt have the vid system up yet leo followed her glance to a dead holovid set obviously in process of repair fixed to the wall there were other comforts lighting handy straps a wall cabinet that proved to be stuffed with little bags of dried snacks abstracted from nutrition raisins peanuts and the like leo orbited the room slowly nervously examining the workmanship it was tight was this place your idea sort of i couldnt have done it alone though you understand its strictly against our rules for me to bring you in here silver added somewhat truculently so this better be good leo silver said leo its your uniquely pragmatic approach to rules that makes you the most valuable quaddie in the habitat right now i need youyour daring and all the other qualities that dr yei would doubtless call antisocial ive got a job to do that i cant do alone either he took a deep breath how would you quaddies like to have your own asteroid belt what her eyes widened bruciebaby is trying to keep it under wraps but the cay project has just been scheduled for terminationand i mean that in the most sinister sense of the word he detailed the antigravity rumor to her all that he had yet heard and van attas secret plans for the quaddies disposal with rising passion he described his vision of escape he didnt have to explain anything twice how much time do we have left she asked whitely when he had finished not much a few weeks at most i have only six days until im forced downside by my gravity leave ive got to figure out some way to duck that im afraid i might not be able to get back here weyou quaddieshave to choose now and i cant do it for you i can only help with some of the parts if you cannot rescue yourselves you will be lost guaranteed she blew out her breath in a silent whistle looking troubled indeed i thoughtwatching tony and clairethey were doing it the wrong way tony talked about finding work but do you know he didnt think to take a worksuit with him i didnt want to make the same mistakes we arent made to travel alone leo maybe its something that was built into us but can you bring in the others leo asked anxiously in secret let me tell you the quickest endscenario for this little revolution i can imagine would be for some quaddie to panic and tell trying to be good this is a real conspiracy all rules off i sacrifice my job risk legal prosecution but you risk much more there are some who urn should be told last said silver thoughtfully but i can bring the important ones in weve got some ways of keeping things private from the downsiders leo glanced around the chamber subtly reassured leo her blue eyes targeted him searchingly how are we going to get rid of the downsiders well we wont be able to shuttle them down to rodeo thats for certain from the moment this thing comes out in the open you can count on the habitat being cut off from resupply besieged was the word leos mind suggested and carefully edited the way i thought of was to collect them all in one module throw in some emergency oxygen cut it off the habitat and use one of the cargo pushers to move it around orbit to the transfer station at that point they become galactechs problem not ours hopefully itd ball things up a bit at the transfer station too and give us a little more time how do you plan toto make them all get into the module leo stirred uncomfortably well thats the point of no return silver there are weapons all around us here we just dont recognize them because we call them tools a lasersolderer with the safety removed is as good as a gun theres a couple of dozen of them in the workshops point it at the downsiders and say moveand theyll move what if they dont then you must fire it or choose not to and be taken downside to a slow and sterile death and you choose for everybody when you make that choice not just for yourself silver was shaking her head i dont think thats such a good idea leo what if somebody panicked and actually fired one the downsider would be horribly burned well yes thats the idea her face crumpled with dismay if i have to shoot mama nilla id rather go downside and die mama nilla was one of the quaddies most popular creche mothers leo recalled vaguely a big elderly womanhed barely met her as his classes didnt involve the younger quaddies i was thinking more in terms of shooting bruce leo confessed im not sure i could even do that to mr van atta said silver slowly have you ever seen a bad burn leo yes so have i a brief silence fell we cant bluff our teachers said silver finally all mama nilla would have to do is say give that over now siggy in that voice of hers and he would its notits not a smart scenario leo leos hands clenched in exasperation but we must get the downsiders off the habitat or nothing else can be done if we cant theyll just retake it and youll be worse off than when you started all right all right weve got to get rid of them but thats not the way she paused looking at him more doubtfully could you shoot mama nilla do you really thinksaypramod could shoot you leo sighed probably not not in cold blood even soldiers in battle have to be brought to a special state of mental excitement to shoot total strangers silver looked relieved all right so what else would have to be done saying we could take over the habitat reconfiguring the habitat can be done with tools and supplies already aboard though everything will have to be carefully rationed the habitat will have to be defended from any attempt by galactech to recapture it while this is going on the highenergydensity beam welders could be quite effective discouragements to shuttles attempting to board usif anybody could be induced to fire one he added with a dry edge company inventory doesnt include armored attack ships fortunately a real military force would make short work of this little revolution you realize his imagination supplied the details and his stomach bunched queasily our only real defense is to get gone before galatech can produce one that will require a jump pilot he studied her anew thats where you come in silver i know a pilot whos going to be passing through the transfer station very soon who might be um easier to kidnap than most especially if you came along to lend your personal persuasion ti ti he confirmed she looked dubious maybe leo fought down another and stronger wave of queasiness ti and silver had a relationship predating his arrival he wasnt really playing pimp logic dictated this he realized suddenly that what he really wanted was to remove her as far from the jump pilot as possible and do what keep her for yourself get serious youre too old for her ti was whattwentyfive maybe perhaps violently jealous for all leo knew she must prefer him leo tried virtuously to feel old it wasnt hard most of the quaddies made him feel about eighty anyway he wrenched his mind back to business the third thing that has to be done first leo thought over the wording of that and concluded unhappily that it was all too accurate is nail down a cargo jumper if we wait until we boost the habitat all the way out to the wormhole galactech will have time to figure out how to defend them such as jumping them all to the orient iv side and thumbing their noses at us until we are forced to surrender that means he contemplated the next logical step with some dismay weve got to send a force out to the wormhole to hijack one and i cant go with it and be here to defend and reconfigure the habitat both itll have to be a force of quaddies i dont know leo ran down maybe this isnt such a great idea after all send ti with them suggested silver reasonably he knows more about the cargo jumpers than any of us mm said leo drawn back to optimism if he was going to pay attention to the odds against this escapade succeeding he might as well give up now and avoid the rush screw the odds he would believe in ti if necessary he would believe in elves angels and the tooth fairy that makes um suborning ti step one in the flow chart leo reasoned aloud from the moment hes missed were out in the open racing the clock that means all the advance planning for moving the habitat had better be donein advance andoh oh my leos eyes lit what i just had a brilliant idea to buy us a head start leo timed his entrance carefully waiting until van atta had been holed up in his habitat office nearly the first two hours of the shift the project chief would be starting to think about his coffee break by now and reaching the degree of frustration that always attended the first attack on a new problem in this case dismantling the habitat leo could picture the entangled stage of his planning precisely hed gone through it himself about eight hours previously locked in his own quarters brainstorming on his computer console after a brief pause to render his programs inaccessible to snoops the leftover military security clearance from the argus cruiser project worked wonders leo was quite sure no one in the habitat not van atta and certainly not yei possessed a higher key van atta frowned at him from the clutter of printouts his computer vid scintillating multiscreened and colorful with assorted habitat schematics now what leo im busy those who can do those who cant teach and those who cant teach leo finished silently go into administration he maintained his usual bland smile not letting the edged thought show by any careless gleam or reflection ive been thinking brace leo purred id like to volunteer for the job of dismantling the habitat you would van attas brows rose in astonishment lowered in suspicion why van atta would hardly believe it was out of the goodness of his heart leo was prepared because as much as i hate to admit it you were right again ive been thinking about what im going to bring away from this assignment counting travel time ive shot four months of my lifemore before this is doneand ive got nothing to show for it but some black marks on my record you did it to yourself van atta reminded rubbed his chin upon which the bruise was fading to a green shadow and glowered i lost my perspective for a little while its true leo admitted ive got it back a bit late sneered van atta but i could do a good job argued leo wondering how one could achieve the effect of a hangdog shuffle in free fall better not overdo it i really need a commendation something to counterweight those reprimands ive had some ideas that could result in an unusually high salvage ratio cut the losses it would take all the scut work off your hands and leave you free to administer hm said van atta clearly enticed by a vision of his office returning to its former pristine serenity he studied leo his eyes slitting very welltake it theres my notes theyre all yours ah just send the plans and reports through my office ill send em on thats my real job after all administration certainly leo swept up the clutter yes send em through youso you can replace my name with your own leo could almost see the wheels turn in the smug light of van attas eyes let leo do the work and van atta siphon off the credit oh youll get the credit for how this project ends all right bruciebabyall of it ill need a few other things leo requested humbly i want all the quaddie pusher crews that can be spared from their regular duties in addition to my own classes these useless children are going to learn to work like they never worked before supplies equipment authorization to sign out pushers and fuelgotta start some onsite surveyingand i need to be able to commandeer other quaddie spot labor as needed all right oh are you volunteering for the handson part too a fleeting vindictive greediness crossed van attas face followed by doubt what about keeping this under wraps till the last minute i can present the preplanning as a theoretical class exercise at first buy a week or two theyll have to be told eventually you know not too soon ill hold you responsible for keeping the chimps under control you copy i copy do i have my authorization ohand ill need to get an extension against my downside gravity leave hq doesnt like that liability its either me or you bruce true van atta waved a hand already sinking back gratefully from harried to languid mode all right you got it a blank check leo tamped a wolfish grin into a fawning smile youll remember this wont you brucelater van attas lips too drew back i guarantee leo ill remember everything leo bowed himself out mumbling gratitude silver poked her head through the door to the creche mothers private sleep cubicle mama nilla sh mama nilla held her finger to her lips and nodded toward andy asleep in a sack on the wall with his face peeping out she whispered for heavens sake dont wake the baby hes been so fussyi think the formula disagrees with him i wish dr minchenko were back here ill come out in the corridor the airseal doors swished shut behind her in preparation for sleep mama nilla had exchanged her pink working coveralls for a set of flowered pajamas cinched in around her ample waist silver suppressed an urge to clamp herself to that soft torso as she had in desperate moments when she was littleshe was much too grownup to be cuddled anymore she told herself sternly hows andy doing she asked instead with a nod toward the closed doors hm all right said mama nilla though i hope i can get this formula problem straightened out soon and well im not sure you could call it depression exactly but his attention span seems shorter and he fussesdont tell claire that though poor dear she has enough troubles tell her hes all right silver nodded i understand mama nilla frowned introspectively i wrote up a protest but my supervisor blocked it illtimed she said ha more like mr van atta has her spooked i could just ahem anyway ive been turning in overtime chits like crazy and i requested an extra assistant be assigned to my creche unit maybe when they realize that this foolishness is costing them money theyll give in you can tell claire that i think yes said silver she could use a little hope mama nilla sighed i feel so badly about this whatever possessed those children to try and run off anyway i could just shake tony and as for that stupid security guard i could just well she shook her head have you heard any more about tony that i could pass on to claire ah yes mama nilla glanced up and down the corridor to assure herself of their privacy dr minchenko called me last night on the personal channel he assures me tonys out of danger now they got that infection under control but hes still very weak dr minchenko means to bring him back up to the habitat when he finishes his own gravity leave he thinks tony will complete his recovery faster up here so thats a bit of good news you can pass on to claire silver calculated her lower fingers tapping out the days unobtrusively below mama nillas line of sight and breathed relief that was one massive problem she could report to leo as solved tony would be back before their revolt broke into the open his safe return might even become the signal for it a smile lit her face thanks mama nilla that is good news revolution for the bewildered leo decided grimly should be his course title or worse remedial revolution the shell of floating quaddies hovering expectantly around him in the lecture module had been officially augmented by both the offduty pusher crews and loaded with all the offshift older quaddies silver had been able to contact covertly sixty or seventy altogether the lecture module was jammed causing leo to jump ahead mentally and think about oxygen consumption and regeneration plans for the reconfigured habitat there was tension as well as carbon dioxide in the air rumors were afloat already leo realized god knew in what mutant forms it was time to replace rumors with facts silver waved all clear from the airseal doors turning all four thumbs up and grinning at leo as one last tshirted quaddie scurried within the airseal doors slid shut eclipsing her as she turned to take up guard duty in the corridor leo took up his lecture station in the center the center the hub of the wheel where stresses are most concentrated after some initial whispering poking and prodding they hushed for him to an almost frightening attentiveness he could hear them breathing we would need you even if you werent an engineer leo silver had remarked were all too used to taking orders from people with legs are you saying you need a front man hed asked amused is that what its called her gaze upon him had been coolly pragmatic he was getting too old his brain was shortcircuiting to some distant rock beat slipping back to the noisier rhythms of his adolescence let me be your front man baby call me leo call me anytime day or night let me help he eyed the closed airseal doors was the man waving the baton at the front of the parade pulling it after himor being pushed along ahead of it he had a queasy premonition he was going to learn the answer he woofed a breath and returned his attention to the lecture chamber as some of you have already heard leo began words like pebbles in the pool of silence a new gravity technology has arrived from the outlying planets its apparently based on a variation of the necklin field tensor equations the same mathematics that underlie the technology we use to punch through those wrinkles in spacetime we call wormholes i havent been able to get hold of the tech specs yet myself but it seems its already been developed to the marketable stage the theoretical possibility was not strictly speaking new but i for one never expected to see its practical capture in my lifetime evidently neither did the people who created you quaddies there is a kind of strange symmetry to it the spurt forward in genetic bioengineering that made you possible was based on the perfection of a new technology the uterine replicator from beta colony now barely a generation later the new technology that renders you obsolete has arrived from the same source because thats what you have become before you even got onlinetechnologically obsolete at least from galactechs point of view leo drew breath watching for their reactions now when a machine becomes obsolete we scrap it when a mans training becomes obsolete we send him back to school but your obsolescence was bred in your bones its either a cruel mistake or or or he paused for emphasis the greatest opportunity you will ever have to become a free people dont dont take notes leo choked as heads bent automatically over their scribble boards illuminating his key words with their light pens as the autotranscription marched across their displays this isnt a class this is real life he had to stop a moment to regain his equilibrium he was positive some child at the back was still highlighting no notesreal life in reflexive virtue pramod floating near looked up his dark eyes agitated leo there was a rumor going around that the company was going to take us all downside and shoot us lake tony leo smiled sourly thats actually the least likely scenario you are to be taken downside yes to a sort of prison camp but this is how guiltfree genocide is handled one administrator passes you on to the next and him to the next and him to the next you become a routine expense on the inventory expenses rise as they always do in response your downsider support employees are gradually withdrawn as the company names you selfsuflicient life support equipment deteriorates with age breakdowns happen more and more often maintenance and resupply become more and more erratic then one nightwithout anybody ever giving an order or pulling a triggersome critical breakdown occurs you send a call for help nobody knows who you are nobody knows what to do those who placed you there are all long gone no hero takes initiative initiative having been drained by administrative bitching and black hints the investigating inspector after counting the bodies discovers with relief that you were merely inventory the books are quietly closed on the cay project finis wrap it might take twenty years maybe only five or ten you are simply forgotten to death pramods hand touched his throat as if he already felt the rasp of rodeos toxic atmosphere i think id rather be shot he muttered or leo raised his voice you can take your lives into your own hands come with me and put all your risks up front the big gamble for the big payoff let me tell you he gulped for courage mustered megalomaniafor surely only a maniac could drive this through to successlet me tell you about the promised land chapter leo stretched for a look out the viewport of the cargo pusher at the rapidlyenlarging transfer station damn the weekly passenger ship from orient iv was already docked at the hub of the wheel newly arrived it was doubtless still in the offloading phase but nothing seemed more likely to leo than for a pilotor expilotlike ti to invite himself aboard early to kibbitz the jump ship was blocked from view as they spiraled around the station to their own assigned shuttle hatch the quaddie piloting the pusher a darkhaired copperskinned girl named zara in the purple tshirt and shorts of the pusher crews brought her ship smartly into alignment and clicked it delicately into the clamps on the landing spoke leo was encouraged toward belief in her top rating among the pusher pilots after all despite his qualms about her age barely fifteen the mild acceleration vector of the stations spin at this radius tugged at leo and his padded chair swung in its gimbals to the newlydefined upright position zara grinned over her shoulder at leo clearly exhilarated by the sensation silver in the quaddieformfit acceleration couch beside zara looked more dubious zara completed the formal litany of crosschecks with transfer station traffic control and shut down her systems leo sighed illogical relief that traffic control hadnt questioned the vaguelyworded purpose of their filed flight planpick up material for the cay habitat there was no reason they should have leo wasnt even close to exceeding his powers of authorization yet watch silver said zara and let a lightpen fall from her fingers it fell slowly to the padded strip on the wallnowfloor and bounced in a graceful arc zaras lower hand scooped it back out of the air leo waited resignedly while silver tried it once too then said come on weve got to catch ti right silver pulled herself up by her upper hands on her headrest swung her lowers free and hesitated leo shook out his pair of grey sweat pants hed brought for the purpose and gingerly helped her pull them over her lower arms and up to her waist she waved her hands and the ends of the pant legs flopped and flapped over them she grimaced at the unaccustomed constraint of the bundled cloth upon her dexterity all right silver said leo now the shoes you borrowed from that girl running hydroponics i gave them to zara to stow oh said zara one of her upper hands flew to her lips what i left them in the docking bay zara sorry silver blew out her breath against leos neck maybe your shoes leo she suggested i dont know leo kicked out of his shoes and zara helped silver slip her lower hands into them how do they look said silver anxiously zara wrinkled her nose they look kinda big leo sidled around to catch their reflection in the darkened port they looked absurd leo regarded his feet as though hed never seen them before did they look that absurd on him his socks seemed suddenly like enormous white worms feet were insane appendages forget the shoes give em back just let the pant legs cover your hands what if someone asks what happened to my feet silver worried aloud amputated suggested leo due to a terrible case of frostbite suffered on your vacation to the antarctic continent isnt that on earth what if they start asking questions about earth then illill quash them for rudeness but most people are pretty inhibited about asking questions like that we can still use the original story about your wheelchair being lost luggage and were on our way to try and get it back theyll believe that come on leo backed up to her all aboard her upper arms twined around his neck and her lowers clamped around his waist with slightly paranoid pressure as she cautiously entrusted her newfbund weight to him her breath was warm and tickled his ear they ducked through the flex tube and into the transfer station proper leo headed for the elevator stack that ran upor downthe length of the spoke to the rim where the transient rest cubicles were to be found leo waited for an empty elevator but it stopped again and others boarded leo had a brief spasm of terror that silver might try to strike up a friendly conversationhe should have told her explicitly not to talk to strangersbut she maintained a shy reserve transfer station personnel gave them a few uncomfortable covert stares but leo gazed coldly at the wall and no one attempted to broach the silence leo staggered exiting the elevator at the outer rim where the gee forces were maximized little though he wished to admit it three months of nullgee deconditioning had had its inevitable effect but at halfgee silvers weight didnt even bring their combined total up to his earthside norm leo told himself sternly he shuffled off as rapidly as possible away from the populated foyer leo knocked on the numbered cubicle door it slid open a male voice yeah what they had cornered the jump pilot leo plastered an inviting smile on his face and they entered ti was propped up on the bed dressed in dark trousers tshirt and socks idly scanning a handviewer he glanced up in mild irritation at leo unfamiliar to him then his eyes widened as he saw silver leo dumped silver as unceremoniously as a cat on the foot of the bed and plopped into the cubicles sole chair to catch his breath ti gulik gotta talk to you ti had recoiled to the head of the bed knees drawn up hand viewer rolled aside and forgotten silver what the hell are you doing here whos this guy he jerked a thumb at leo tonys welding teacher leo graf answered silver smearily experimentally she rolled over and pushed her torso upright with her upper hands this feels weird she raised her upper hands balancing leo thought for all the world like a seal on a tripod formed by her lower arms huh she returned her upper hands to the bed to lend support achieving a doglike posture fine hair flattened all her grace stolen by gravity no doubt about it quaddies belonged in nullgee we need your help lieutenant gulik leo began as soon as he could desperately whos we asked ti suspiciously the quaddies hah said ti darkly well the first thing i would like to point out is that i am not lieutenant gulik any more im plain ti gulik unemployed and quite possibly unemployable thanks to the quaddies or at any rate one quaddie he frowned at silver i told them it wasnt your fault said silver they wouldnt listen to me you might at least have covered for me said ti petulantly you owed me that much he might as well have hit her from the look on her face back off gulik leo growled silver was drugged and tortured to extract that confession seems to me any owing in here goes in the other direction ti flushed leo bit back his annoyance they couldnt afford to piss the jump pilot off they needed him too much besides this wasnt the conversation leo had rehearsed ti should be leaping through hoops for those morningglory eyes of silvers the psychology of reward and all thatsurely he must respond to a plea for her good if the young lout didnt appreciate her he didnt deserve to have herleo forced his thoughts back to the matter at hand have you heard about this new artificial gravity field technology yet leo began again something admitted ti warily well its killed the cay project galactechs dropping out of the quaddie business huh yeah well that makes sense leo waited a beat for the next logical question which didnt come ti wasnt an idiot he was therefore being deliberately dense leo pushed on relentlessly they plan to ship the quaddies downside to rodeo to an abandoned workers barracks he repeated the forgottentodeath scenario he had described to pramod a week earlier and looked up to gauge its effect the pilots face was closed and neutral well im very sorry for them ti did not look at silver but i totally fail to see what im supposed to do about it im leaving rodeo in six hours never to returnwhich is just fine with me by the way this place is a pit and silver and the quaddies are being dropped into that pit and the lid clamped over them and the only crime theyve committed is to become technologically obsolete doesnt that mean anything to you cried leo heatedly ti bolted upright indignantly you want to talk about technological obsolescence ill show you technological obsolescence this his hand touched the implant plugs at midforehead and temples the cannula at the nape of his neck this i trained for two years and waited in line for a year for the surgery to implant my jump set its a tensor bitcode version because thats the jump system galactech uses and they underwrote part of the cost of it transstellar transport and a few independents also use it everybody else in the universe is gearing up to necklin colordrive you know what my chances of being hired by tst are after being fired by galactech zilch zero nada if i want a jump pilots job i need this surgically removed and a new implant without a job i cant afford an implant without an implant i cant get a job screw you ti gulik he sat panting leo leaned forward ill give you a pilots berth gulik he said clearly on the biggest jump ship ever to fly rapidly before the pilot could interrupt he detailed his vision of the habitat converted to colony ship its all here all we need is a pilot a pilot who can plug into the galactech drive system all we needis you ti looked perfectly appalled youre not just talking grand lunacyyoure talking grand larceny do you realize what the cash value of the total configuration would be they wouldnt let you out of jail till the next millennium im not going to jail im going to the stars with the quaddies your cell will be padded this isnt crime this iswar or something crime is turning your back and walking away not by any legal code i know of all right then sin oh brother ti rolled his eyes now it comes out youre on a mission from god right let me off at the next stop please gods not here somebodys got to fill in leo backed off hastily from that line of thought padded cells indeed i thought you were in love with silver how can you abandon her to a slow death tis not in love with me interrupted silver in surprise whatever gave you that idea leo ti gave her an unsettled look no of course not he agreed faintly you ahyou always knew right we just had a mutually beneficial little arrangement is all thats right confirmed silver i got books and vids ti got relief from physiological stress downsider males need sex to stay healthy you know they cant cope with stress it makes them disruptive wild genes i suppose where did that line of bullshit come from leo began and broke off never mind he could guess he closed his eyes pressed them with his fingertips and groped for his lost argument right so to you silver is just disposable like a tissue sneeze in her and toss her away ti looked stung give it up graf im no worse than anyone else but im giving you the chance to be better dont you see leo silver interrupted again she was now sprawled on her stomach on the bed her chin propped awkwardly on one upper hand after we get to our asteroid beltwherever it turns out to bewhat are we going to do with the superjumper the superjumper well be detaching the habitat and opening it out again surelybuilding on to itthe jumper unit would just be sitting there in parking orbit cant we give it to ti what said leo and ti together as payment he jumps us to our destination he gets to keep the jump ship then he can go off and be a pilotowner set up his own transport business whatever he likes in a stolen ship yipped ti if were far enough away that galactech cant catch up with us were far enough away that galactech cant catch up with you said silver logically then youll have a ship that fits your neural implant and nobody will be able to fire you again because youll be working for yourself leo bit his tongue hed brought silver along expressly to help persuade tiso what if it wasnt the blandishment hed envisioned from the blitzed look on the pilots face theyd gotten through to his launchbutton at last leo lidded his eyes and smiled encouragement at her besides she went on her eyelashes fluttering in return if we do succeed in jumping out of here habitat and all mr van attas going to be left looking an awful fool she let her head flop back on the bed and smiled sideways at ti oh said ti in a tone of enlightenment ah are your bags all packed asked leo helpfully over there ti nodded to a pile of luggage in the corner but but dammit if this thing crashes theyll crucify me ah said leo here see he opened his red coveralls at the neck and drew out the lasersolderer concealed in an inner pocket i jimmied the safety on this thing itll fire an extremely intense beam for quite a distance now until the atmosphere dissipates itfarther than the distance across this room certainly he waved it negligently ti ducked eyes widening if we end up under arrest you can truthfully testify that you were kidnapped at gunpoint by a crazed engineer and his mad mutant assistant and made to cooperate under duress you may be a hero one wayor another the mad mutant assistant smiled blindingly at ti her eyes like stars you ahwouldnt really fire that thing would you choked ti cautiously of course not leo said jovially baring his teeth he put the solderer away ah tis mouth twitched briefly in response but his eye returned often thereafter to the lump in leos coveralls when they made it back to the shuttle hatch where the pusher was docked zara was gone oh god moaned leo had she wandered off gotten lost been forcibly removed a frantic inventory found no message left on the comm no note pinned anywhere pilot shes a pilot leo reasoned aloud is there anything she could have needed to do weve plenty of fuelcommunicating with traffic control is done right from here he realized with a cold chill that he hadnt actually forbidden her to leave the pusher it had been so selfevident that she was to stay out of sight and on guard selfevident to himself leo realized who could say what was selfevident to a quaddie i could fly this thing if necessary said ti in a most unpressing tone looking over the control deck its all manual thats not the point said leo we cant leave without her the quaddies arent supposed to be over here at all if she gets picked up by the station authorities and they start asking questionsalways assuming she hasnt been picked up by something worse what worse i dont know what worse thats the trouble silver meanwhile had rolled off the acceleration couch to the deck strip after a moment of thoughtful experimentation she achieved a fourhanded forward shuffle and marched off past leos knees pant legs trailing where are you going after zara silver stay with the ship we dont need two of you lost for gods sake leo ordered sternly ti and i can move much faster well find her i dont think so murmured silver distantly she reached the flex tube stared up and down the corridor which curved away to right and left ringing the spoke you see i dont think shes gone far if she got on the elevator she could be practically anywhere on the station by now said ti silver reared up on her tripoded lower arms raised her uppers over her head and narrowed her eyes for a look around the elevator foyer to her left the controls would be hard for a quaddie to reach besides shed know she was more likely to run into downsiders there i think she went this way she raised her chin and shuffled determinedly off to her right on all fours after a moment she picked up speed by changing her gait to a series of gazellelike bounds in the lowgee of the spoke leo and ti of necessity bounded after her leo felt absurdly like a man chasing a runaway pet it was an optical illusion of the quadrimanual locomotionquaddies even looked more human in free fall a strange rumbling noise approached around the curve of the corridor silver hooted and skidded to one side against the outer wall oh sorry cried zara whizzing past torsodown and chin up on a low rollerpallet all four hands going like paddle wheels to propel her along the deck braking proved more difficult than acceleration and zara fetched up beside silver with a crash leo horrified bounded over to them but zara was already disentangling herself and sitting up cheerfully even the roller pallet was undamaged look silver zara said flipping the pallet over wheels i wonder how theyre beating the friction inside those casings feel theyre not hot at all zara cried leo why did you leave the ship i wanted to see what a downsider toilet chamber looked like said zara but there wasnt one on this level all i found was a closet full of cleaning supplies and this she patted the roller pallet can i take the wheels apart and see whats inside no roared leo she looked quite putout but i want to know bring it along silver suggested and take it apart later her eyes flicked up and down the corridor leo was slightly consoled that at least one quaddie shared his sense of urgency yes later leo agreed for the sake of expediency lets go now he tucked the roller pallet firmly under his arm to thwart further experimentation the quaddies he reflected didnt seem to have a very clear idea of private property probably came from a lifetime spent in a communal space habitat with its tight ecology planets were communal in the same way really except that their enormous size put so much slack in their systems it was disguised habits of thought indeed here he was worried over the theft of a roller pallet while planning the greatest space heist in human history ti almost bolted when he found out what the rest of the assignment they had planned for him was to be leo prudently didnt fill in these details until the pusher was safely launched from the transfer station and halfway back to the habitat you want me to hijack the superjumper yelped ti no no leo soothed him youre only going along as an advisor the quaddies will take the ship but my ass will depend on whether or not they can then i suggest you advise well ye gods the trouble with you ti lectured leo kindly is that you lack teaching experience if you had youd have faith that the most unlikely people can learn the most amazing things after all you werent born knowing how to pilot a jumpyet lives depended on your doing it right the first time and every time thereafter now youll know how your instructors felt thats all how do instructors feel leo lowered his voice and grinned terrified absolutely terrified a second pusher packed with fuel and supplies for its longrange excursion was waiting in the slot next to theirs as they docked at the habitat leo resisted a strong urge to take ti aside and fill his ear with advice and suggestions for his mission alas their experience in criminal theft was all too comparablezero equalled zero no matter how unequal the years each was multiplied by they floated through the hatch into the docking module to find several anxious quaddies waiting for them ive modified more solderers leo pramod began unnecessarilythree of his four hands clutched the improvised arsenal to his torso one each for five people claire hovering at his shoulder eyed the weapons with dread fascination good give them to silver shell have charge of them until the pusher gets to the wormhole said leo they made their way down the hand grips to the next hatch zara swung within to begin her preflight checks ti craned his neck after her nervously are we leaving right now time is critical said leo we dont have more than four hours till youre missed at the transfer station shouldnt there be aa briefing or something ti too leo appreciated was having trouble committing himself to falling free well jumped or was pushed after the initial impulse it would make no practical difference youll have almost twentyfour hours boosting at one gee to midpoint and then flipping and braking the rest of the way to work out your plan of attack silver will be depending on your knowledge of the superjumpers weve already discussed various methods of achieving surprise shell fill you in oh is silver going silver leo enlightened him gently is in command tis face flickered through an array of expressions settled on dismay screw this theres still time for me to go back and catch my ship and that leo overrode him is precisely why silver is in charge your capture of a cargo jumper is the signal for a quaddie uprising here on the habitat and that uprising is their death warrant when galactech discovers it cannot control the quaddies it will almost certainly be frightened into an attempt to violently exterminate them escape must be assured before we tip our hand the ship you must catch is out that way leo pointed i can depend on silver to remember that you leo smiled thinly are no worse than anyone else ti subsided at that although not happily silver zara siggy a particularly husky quaddie from the pusher crews named jon and ti five crammed into a ship meant for a crew of two and not designed for overnight use in any case leo sighed the superjumpers carried a pilot and an engineer fivetotwo wasnt altogether bad odds but leo wished he could have loaded them even more overwhelmingly in the quaddies favor they filed through the flex tube into the pusher silver at the end paused to embrace pramod and claire who had lingered to see them off were going to get andy back silver murmured to claire youll see claire nodded and hugged her hard silver turned last to leo who was gazing doubtfully at the flex tube through which the crew hed drafted had gone i thought the quaddies were going to be the weak link in this hijacking operation jittered leo now im not so sure dont let ti cave on you eh silver dont let him bring you down you have to succeed i know ill try leo why did you think ti was in love with me i dont know you were intimatethe power of suggestion maybe all those romances ti doesnt read romances he reads ninja of the twin stars werent you in love with him at first anyway she frowned it was exciting to be beating the rules with him but ti is well is ti love like in the booksi always knew it wasnt really real when i got to looking around at our own downsiders nobody was like that i guess i was stupid to like those stories so much i suppose theyre not realistici havent read them either to tell you the truth but its not stupid to want something more silver more than what more than to be worked over by a lot of selfcentered legged louts thats what were not all like that are we why after all was he being moved now to lay a load of his own on her when she needed all her concentration for the task ahead leo shook his head anyway dont let ti get confused between his ninjawhatsit and what youre trying to do either i dont think even ti could mistake a company jumpship crew for the black league of eridani said silver leo could have wished for more certainty in her tone wellhe cleared his throat inexplicably blocked take care dont get hurt you be careful too she did not hug him as she had pramod and claire right and dont ever believe his mind cried after her as she vanished into the flex tube that nobody could love you silver but it was too late to call the words aloud the airseal doors shut with a sigh like regret chapter the freight shuttle docking bay was chilly and claire rubbed all her hands together to warm them only her hands seemed cold her heart beat hot with anticipation and dread she looked sideways at leo floating as seemingstolid as ever by the airseal doors with her thanks for pulling me off my work shift for this claire said are you sure you wont get into trouble when mr van atta finds out whos to tell him said leo besides i think bruce is losing interest in tormenting you everythings so obviously futile all the better for us anyway i want to talk to tony too and i figure ill have a better chance of getting his undivided attention after youve got the reunionbit over with he smiled reassuringly i wonder what condition hell be in you may be sure hes much better or dr minchenko wouldnt be subjecting him to the stresses of travel even to keep him close under his eye a thump and the whir and grind of machinery told claire that the shuttle had arrived in its clamps her hands reached out drew in selfconsciously the quaddie manning the control booth waved to two others in the bay and they locked the flex tubes into position and sealed them the personnel tube opened first and the shuttles engineer stuck his head through to double check everything then whipped back out of sight claires heart lurched in her chest and her throat constricted dryly dr minchenko emerged at last and hovered a moment one hand anchored to a grip by the hatch a leatheryfaced vigorous man his hair was as white as the galactech medical service coveralls he wore he had been a big man now shrunken to his frame like a withered apricot but like a withered apricot still sound claire had the impression he only needed to be rehydrated and hed pop back to likenew condition dr minchenko shoved off from the hatchway and crossed the bay toward them landing accurately by the grips around the airseal doors why hullo claire he said in a surprised voice and ahgraf he added less cordially youre the one let me tell you i dont appreciate being leaned on to authorize violation of sound medical protocol you are to spend double time in the gym for the duration of your extension you hear yes dr minchenko thank you said leo promptly who was not as far as claire knew spending any time in the gym at all these days wheres tony can we help you get him to the infirmary ah he looked more closely at claire i see tonys not with me dear hes still in hospital downside claire stifled a gasp oh nois he worse not at all i had fully intended to bring him with me in my opinion he needs free fall to complete his recovery the problem is um administrative not medical and im on my way right now to resolve it did brace order him kept downside asked leo thats right he frowned at leo and im not pleased to have my medical responsibilities interfered with either hed better have a mighty convincing explanation daryl cay wouldnt have permitted a screwup like this you um havent heard the new orders yet then said leo carefully with a warning glance at clairehush what new orders im on my way to see the little schmuckthat is the man right now get to the bottom of this he turned to claire switching firmly to a kinder tone its all right well get it straightened out all tonys internal bleeding is stopped and theres no further sign of infection you quaddies are tough you hold your health much better in gravity than we downsiders do in free fall well we explicitly designed you not to undergo deconditioning i could only wish the confirming experiment hadnt happened under such distressing conditions of course he sighed youth has something to do with it speaking of youth hows little andy sleeping better for you now claire almost burst into tears i dont know she squeaked and swallowed hard what they wont let me see him what leo studying his fingernails distantly put in andy was removed from claires care on charges of childendangering or some such thing didnt bruce tell you that either dr minchenkos face was darkening to a brickred hue removed from a breastfeeding motherobscene his eyes swept back over claire they gave me some medicine to dry me up explained claire well thats something his mollification was slight who did dr curry he didnt report it to me you were on leave on leave doesnt mean incommunicado you graf spit it out what the hells going on around here has that pocketmartinet lost his mind you really havent heard well youd better ask bruce im under direct orders not to discuss it minchenko gave leo a stabbing glare i shall he pushed off and entered the corridor through the airseal doors muttering under his breath claire and leo were left looking at each other in dismay how are we going to get tony back now cried claire its less than twentyfour hours till silvers signal i dont knowbut dont cave now remember andy hes going to need you im not going to cave claire denied she took a steadying gulp of air not ever again what can we do well ill see what strings i can pull to try and have tony brought upbullshit bruce tell him i have to have tony to supervise his welding gang or somethingim not sure maybe minchenko and i together can work something though i dont want to risk rousing minchenkos suspicions if i cant leo inhaled carefully well have to work out something else dont lie to me leo said claire dangerously dont leap to conclusions yes i knowyou knowthe possibility exists that we wont be able to retrieve him all right i said it right out loud but please note any er alternative scenarios depend on ti to pilot a shuttle for us and must wait until we reconnect with the hijack crew at which point we will have captured a jumpship and i will begin to believe that anything is possible his brows quirked stressed and if its possible well try it promise there was a growing coldness in her she firmed her lips against their tremble you cant risk everybody for the sake of just one thats not right well there are a thousand things that can go wrong between now and somepoint of no return for tony it may turn out to be quite academic i do know dividing our energies among a thousand whatifs instead of concentrating them for the one sure nextstep is a kind of selfsabotage its not what we do next week its what we do next that counts most what must you do next claire swallowed and tried to pull her wits back together go back to work pretend like nothings going on continue the secret inventory of all possible seed stocks uh finish the plan of how were going to hook up the growlights to keep the plants going while the habitat is moved away from the sun and as soon as the habitat is ours start the new cuttings and bring the reserve tubes online to start building up extra food stocks against emergencies and uh arrange cryostorage of samples of every genetic variety we have on board to restock in case of disaster thats enough leo smiled encouragement the next step only and you know you can do that she nodded we need you claire he added all of us not just andy food production is one of the fundamentals of our survival well need every pair er every set of expert hands and youll have to start training youngsters passing on that howto knowledge that the library no matter how technically complete cant duplicate i am not going to cave claire reiterated through her teeth answering the undercurrent not the surface of his speech you scared me that time in the airlock he apologized embarrassed i scared myself she admitted you had a right to be angry just remember your true target isnt in here he touched her collarbone above her heart fleetingly its out there so he had recognized it was rage rage blocked and turned inward and not despair that had brought her to the airlock that day in a way it was a relief to put the right name to her emotion in a way it was not leo that scares me too he smiled quizzically welcome to the human club the next step she muttered right the next reach she gave leo a wave and swung into the corridor leo turned back to the freight bay with a sigh the nextstep speech was all very well except when people and changing conditions kept switching your route around in front of you while your foot was in the air his gaze lingered a moment on the quaddie docking crew who had connected the flex tube to the shuttles large freight hatch and were unloading the cargo into the bay with their power handlers the cargo consisted of manhigh grey cylinders that leo did not at first recognize but the cargo wasnt supposed to be unrecognizable the cargo was supposed to be a massive stock of spare cargopusher fuel rods for dismantling the habitat leo had sung dulcetly to van atta when jamming the requisition through so i wont have to stop and reorder so what if we have leftovers they can go to the transfer station with the pushers when theyre relocated credit them to the salvage disturbed leo drifted over to the cargo workers whats this kids oh mr graf hello well im not quite sure said the quaddie boy in the canaryyellow tshirt and shorts of airsystems maintenance of which docks locks was a subdivision i dont think ive ever seen it before its massive anyway he paused to unhook a report panel from his powerhandler and gave it to leo theres the freight manifest it was supposed to be cargopusher fuel rods the cylinders were about the right size they surely couldnt have redesigned them leo tapped the manifest keypaditem a string of code numbers quantity astronomical they gurgle the yellowshirted quaddie added helpfully gurgle leo looked at the code number on the report panel more closely glanced at the grey cylindersthey matched yet he recognized the code for the pusher rodsor did he he entered fuel rods orbital cargo pusher type ii cross ref inventory code the report panel blinked and a number popped up yes it was the sameno by god gpd versus the gpd emblazoned on the cylinders quickly he tapped in gpd there was a long pause not for the report panel but for leos brain to register gasoline leo croaked in disbelief gasoline those idiots actually shipped a hundred tons of gasoline to a space station what is it asked the quaddie gasoline its a hydrocarbon fuel used downside to power their land rovers a freebie byproduct from the petrochemical cracking atmospheric oxygen provides the oxidant its a bulky toxic volatile flammableexplosiveliquid at room temperature for gods sake dont let any of those barrels get open yes sir promised the quaddie clearly impressed with leos list of hazards the legged supervisor of the orbital pusher crews arrived at that moment in the bay trailed by a gang of quaddies from his department oh hello graf look i think it was a mistake letting you talk me into ordering this loadwere going to have a storage problem did you order this leo demanded what the supervisor blinked then took in the scene before him what thewhere are my fuel rods they told me they were here i mean did you personally place the order with your own little fingers yes you asked me to remember well leo took a breath and handed him the report panel you made a typo the super glanced at the report panel and paled oh god and they did it leo gibbered running his hands through what was left of his hair they filled iti cant believe they filled it loaded all this stuff onto the shuttle without once questioning it sent a hundred tons of gasoline to a space station without once noticing that it was utterly absurd i can believe it sighed the super oh god oh well well just have to send it back and reorder itll probably take about a week its not like our fuel rod stocks are really low in spite of the rate youve been using them up for that special project youre so hushyhush about i dont have a week thought leo frantically have twentyfour hours maybe i dont have a week leo found himself raging i want them now put it on a rush order he lowered his voice realizing he was becoming conspicuous the super was offended enough to overcome his guilt theres no need to throw a fit graf it was my mistake and ill probably have to pay for it but its plain stupid to charge my department for a rush shuttle trip on top of this one when we can perfectly well wait this is going to be bad enough as it is he waved at the gasoline hey kids he added stop unloading this loads a mistake its all gotta go back downside the shuttle pilot was just exiting the personnel hatch in time to hear this what he floated over to them and leo gave him a brief explanation in very short words of the error well you cant send it back this trip said the shuttle pilot firmly im not fueled up to take a full load itll have to wait he shoved off to take his mandatory safety break in the cafeteria the quaddie cargo handlers looked quite reproachful as the direction of their work was reversed for the second time but they limited their implied criticism to a plaintive are you sure now sir yes sighed leo but find some place to store this stuff in a detached module you cant leave it in here yes sir leo turned again to the pusher crew supervisor ive still got to have those fuel rods well youll just have to wait i wont do it van attas going to have enough of my blood for this already you can charge it to my special project ill sign for it the super raised his eyebrows slightly consoled well ill try all right ill try but what about your blood already sold thought leo thats my lookout isnt it the super shrugged i guess he exited muttering one of the pusher crew quaddies trailing him gave leo a significant look leo returned a severe shake of his head emphasized by a throatcutting gesture with his index finger indicating silence i he turned and nearly rammed pramod waiting patiently at his shoulder dont sneak up on me like that he yelped then got better control of his fraying nerves sorry you startled me what is it weve run into a problem leo but of course who ever tracks me down to impart good news never mind what is it clamps clamps theres a lot of clamped connections outside we were going over the flow chart for the habitat disassembly for um tomorrow you know i know dont say it we thought a little practice might speed things up yes good hardly any of the clamps will unclamp even with power tools uh leo paused taken aback then realized what the problem was metal clamps mostly worse on the sun side much worse we couldnt get any of those to come at all some of them are visibly fused some idiot must have welded them welded yes but not by some idiot by the sun leo it doesnt get that hot not directly what youre seeing is spontaneous vacuum diffusion welding metal molecules are evaporating off the surfaces of the pieces in the vacuum slowly to be sure but its a measurable phenomenon on the clamped areas they migrate into their neighboring surfaces and eventually achieve quite a nice bond a little faster for the hot pieces on the sun side a little slower for the cold pieces in the shadebut ill bet some of those clamps have been in place for twenty years oh but what do we do about them theyll have to be cut pramods lips pursed in worry that will slow things down yeah and well have to have a way set up to reclamp each connection in the new configuration too gonna need more clamps or something that can be made to work as clamps go round up all your offshift work gang were going to have to have a little emergency scrounging session leo stopped wondering if he was going to survive the great takeover and started wondering if he was going to survive until the great takeover he prayed devoutly that silver was having an easier time of it than himself silver hoped earnestly that leo was having an easier time of it than herself she hitched herself around in the acceleration couch increasingly uncomfortable after their first eight hours of flight and rested her chin on the padding to regard her crew crammed in the pushers cabin the other quaddies were drooped and draped as she was only ti seemed comfortable feet propped up and leaning back in his seat in the steady geeforces i saw this great holovid siggy waved some hands enthusiastically that had a boarding battle the marines used magnetic mines to blow holes like bubble cheese in the side of the mothership and just poured through he added a weird ululating cry for sound effects the aliens were running every which way stuff flying everywhere as the air blew out i saw that one said ti nest of doom right you got it for us reminded silver did you know it had a sequel said ti aside to siggy the nests revenge no really do you suppose first of all said silver nobody has found any intelligent aliens yet hostile or not secondly we dont have any magnetic mines thanks be and thirdly i dont think ti wants a lot of unsightly holes blown in the side of his ship well no conceded ti we will go in through the airlock said silver firmly which was designed for just that purpose i think the jumpship crew will be surprised enough when we put them in their escape pod and launch it without um frightening them into doing whoknowswhat with a lot of premature whooping even if colonel wayne in nest of doom led his troops into battle with his rebel yell over their comm links i dont think real marines would do that it would be bound to interfere with their communications she frowned siggy into submission well just do it leos way silver went on and point the lasersolderers at them they dont know us they wouldnt know whether wed fire or not how after all could strangers know what she didnt know herself speaking of which how do we know which superjumper to she groped for terminology cut out of the herd it ought to be easier to get permission to come aboard if the crews someone ti knows well on the other hand it might be harder to she trailed off disliking the thought especially if they tried to fight back jon could wrestle them into submission offered ti thats what hes here for after all husky jon gave him a woeful look i thought i was here as the pusher backup pilot you wrestle them if you want theyre your friends ill hold a solderer ti cleared his throat anyway id like to get d if its there we arent going to have much choice though theres only likely to be a couple of superjumpers working this side of the wormhole at any one time anyway basically we go for whatever ship thats just jumped over from orient iv and dumped its empty pod bundles and hasnt started to load on new ones yet thatll give us the quickest getaway theres not that much to plan we just go do it the real trouble will start said silver when theyve figured out what were really up to and start trying to take the ship back a glum silence fell for the moment even siggy had no suggestions leo found van atta in the downsiders gym tramping determinedly on the treadmill the treadmill was a medical torture device like a rack in reverse springloaded straps pulled the walker toward the tread surface against which his or her feet pushed for an hour or more a day by prescription an exercise designed to slow if not stop the lower body deconditioning and long bone demineralization of free fell dwellers by the expression on van attas face he was stamping out the measured treads today with considerable personal animosity cultivated irritation was indeed one way to muster the energy to tackle the boring but necessary task after a moments thoughtful study leo decided upon a casual and oblique approach he slipped out of his coveralls and velcroed them to the wallstrip retaining his red tshirt and shorts and floated over and hooked himself into the belt and straps of the unoccupied machine next to van attas have they been lubricating these things with glue he puffed grasping the hand holds and straining to start the treads moving against his feet van atta turned his head and grinned sardonically whats the matter leo did minchenko the medical minidictator order a little physiological revenge on you yeah something like thathe got it started at last his legs flexing in an even rhythm he had skipped too many sessions lately have you talked to him since he came up yeah van attas legs drove against his machine and angry whirring spurted from its gears have you told him whats going to be happening to the project yet unfortunately i had to id hoped to put him off to the last with the rest minchenko is probably the most arrogant of cays old guardhes never made it a secret that he thought he should have succeeded cay as head of project instead of bringing in an outsider namely me if he hadnt been slated for retirement in a year id damn well have taken steps to get rid of him before this did he ahvoice objections you mean did he yowl like a stuck pig you bet he did carried on like i was personally responsible for inventing the damned artificial gravity i dont need this shit van attas treadmill moaned in counterpoint to his words if hes been with the project from the beginning i guess the quaddies are practically his lifes work allowed leo reasonably mm van atta marched it doesnt give him the right to go on strike in a snit though even you had more sense in the end if he doesnt show signs of a more cooperative attitude when hes had a chance to calm down and think through how useless it is it may be easier to extend currys rotation and just send minchenko back downside ah leo cleared his throat this didnt exactly smell like the good opening hed been hoping for but there was so little time did he talk to you about tony tony van attas treadmill buzzed like a hornet for a moment if i never see that little geek again in my life it will be too soon hes been nothing but trouble trouble and expense i was rather hoping to get some more use out of him myself said leo carefully even if hes not medically ready to go back on regular outside work shifts ive got a lot of computer console work and supervisory tasks i could delegate to him if he was here if we could bring him up nonsense snapped van atta you could much more easily tap one of your other quaddie work gang leaderspramod sayor pull any quaddie in the place i dont care who thats what i gave you the authorization for were going to start moving the little freaks down in just two weeks it makes no sense to bring up one minchenko wouldnt let out of the infirmary till then and so i told him he glared at leo i dont want to hear one more word about tony ah said leo damn clearly he should have taken minchenko aside before hed muddied the waters with van atta too late now it wasnt just the exercise that was making van atta red in the face leo wondered what all minchenko had really saiddoubtless pretty choice it would have been a pleasure to hear too expensive a pleasure for the quaddies though leo schooled his features to what he hoped would be read through his puffing and blowing as sympathy for van atta hows the salvage planning going asked van atta after a while almost complete oh really van atta brightened well thats something at least youll be amazed at how totally the habitat can be recycled leo promised with perfect truth so will the company brass and fast just as soon as we get the goahead ive got it laid out like a war game he closed his teeth on further double entendres you still planning the grand announcement to the rest of the staff at tomorrow leo inquired casually in the main lecture module i really want to be in on that i have a few visual aids to present when youre done naw said van atta what leo gulped he missed a step and the springs slammed him painfully down on one knee on the treadmill padded against just such clumsiness he struggled back to his feet did you hurt yourself said van atta you look funny ill be all right in a minute he stood leg muscles straining against the elastic pull regaining his breath and equilibrium in the face of pain and panic i thoughtthat was how you were going to drop the shoe get everybody together just go over the facts once after minchenko im tired of arguing about it said van atta ive told yei to do it she can call them into her office in small groups and hand out the individual and department evacuation schedules at the same time much more efficient and so leo and silvers beautiful scheme for peacefully detaching the downsiders hammered out through four secret planning sessions was blown away on a breath wasted was the flattery the oblique suggestion that had gone into convincing van atta that it was his idea to gather unusually the entire habitat downsider staff at once and make his announcement in a speech persuading them all they were being commended not condemned the shaped charges to cut the lecture module away from the habitat at the touch of a button were all in place the emergency breath masks to supply the nearly three hundred bodies with oxygen for the few hours necessary to push the module around the planet to the transfer station were carefully hidden within the two pusher crews were drilled their pushers fueled and ready fool he had been to lay plans that depended on van atta following through on anything leo felt suddenly sick it was going to have to be the secondchoice plan then the emergency one theyd discussed and discarded as too risky too potentially uncontrolled in its results numbly he detached his springs and harness and hooked them back in their slots on the treadmill frame that wasnt an hour said van atta i think i did something to my knee lied leo im not surprised think i didnt know youve been skipping exercise sessions just dont try to sue galactech cause we can prove personal neglect van atta grinned and marched on virtuously leo paused by the way did you know that rodeo warehousing just misshipped the habitat a hundred tons of gasoline and theyre charging it to us what as leo turned away he had the small vindictive satisfaction of hearing van attas treadmill stop and the snap of a toohastilydetached harness rebounding to slap its wearer ow van atta cried leo did not look back dr curry met claire as she arrived for her appointment at the infirmary oh good youre just on time claire glanced up and down the corridor and her eyes searched the treatment room into which dr curry shood her wheres dr minchenko i thought hed be here dr curry flushed faintly dr minchenko is in his quarters he wont be coming on duty but i wanted to talk to him dr curry cleared his throat did they tell you what your appointment was for no i supposed it was for more medication for my breasts ah i see claire waited a moment but he did not expand further he busied himself laying out a tray of instruments by their velcro collars and placing them in the sterilizer not meeting claires eyes well its quite painless once she might have asked no questions docilely submittingshe had undergone thousands of obscure medical tests starting even before she had been freed as an infant from the uterine replicator the artificial womb that had gestated her in a nowclosed section of this very infirmary once she had been another person before the downside disaster with tony for a little time thereafter she had hovered close to being no one at all now she felt strangely thrilled as if she trembled on the edge of a new birth her first had been mechanical and painless perhaps that was why it had failed to take root what she began to squeak too tiny a voice she raised it loud in her own ears what is this appointment for just a small local abdominal procedure said dr curry airily it wont take long you dont even have to get undressed just roll up your shirt and push down your shorts a bit ill prep you you have to be immobilized under the sterileairflow shield in case a drop or two of blood gets on the loose youre not immobilizing me what is the procedure it wont hurt and will do you no harm at all come on over now he smiled and tapped the shield unit which folded out from the wall what repeated claire not moving i cant discuss it itsclassified sorry youll have to askmr van atta or dr yei or somebody tell you what ill send you over to dr yei right after and you can talk to her all right he licked his lips his smile grew steadily more nervous i wouldnt ask claire groped after a phrase she had heard a downsider use once i wouldnt ask bruce van atta for the time of day dr curry looked quite startled oh and muttered not quite under his breath i wondered why you were second on the list who was first on the list asked claire silver but that engineering instructor has her on some kind of assignment friend of yours right youll be able to tell her it doesnt hurt i dont carei dont give a damn if it hurts i want to know what it is her eyes narrowed as the connections clicked at last then widened in outrage the sterilizations she breathed youre starting the sterilizations how did youyou werent supposedi mean whatever makes you think that gulped curry she dodged for the doorway he was closer and quicker and sealed it in front of her nose she caromed off the closing panel now claire calm down panted curry zigzagging after her youll only hurt yourself totally unnecessarily i can put you under a general anesthetic but its better for you to use a local and just lie still you do have to lie still i have to do this one way or another why do you have to do this cried claire did dr minchenko have to do thisor is that why he isnt here whos making you and how that you have to if minchenko was here i wouldnt have to snapped curry infuriated he ducked out and left me holding the bag now come over here and position yourself under the sterishield and let me set up the scanners or ill have to getget quite firm with you he inhaled deeply psyching himself up have to claire taunted have to have to its amazing some of the things downsiders think they have to do but theyre almost never the same things they think quaddies have to do why is that do you suppose his breath woofed out and his lips tightened angrily he plucked a hypodermic off his tray of instruments he laid it out in advance claire thought hes rehearsed this in his mindhe made his mind up before i ever got here he launched himself over to where she hovered and grabbed her left upper arm stabbing the needle towards it in a swift silver arc she grabbed his right wrist slowing it to a straining standstill so they were locked for a moment muscles trembling tumbling slowly in the air then she brought up her lower arms to join her uppers curry gasped in surprise and for breath as she parted his arms wide overpowering even his young male torso he kicked his knees thumping her but with nothing to push against he couldnt drive them with enough force to really hurt she grinned in wild exhilaration brought his arms in out again at will im stronger im stronger im stronger than him and i never even knew it carefully she locked her powergripping lower hands around his wrists and freed her uppers both hands working together easily peeled his clutching fingers from the hypodermic she held it up and crooned this wont hurt a bit no no he was wriggling too much for her inexperience to try for a swift venous injection so she went for a deltoid muscle instead and went on holding him until he grew woozy and weak which took several minutes after that it was easy to immobilize him under the sterishield she looked over his tray of instruments and touched them wonderingly how far should i carry this turnabout do you think she asked aloud he whimpered in his wooziness and twitched feebly against the soft restraints panic in his eyes claires eyes lit she threw back her head and laughed really laughed for the first time inhow long she couldnt remember she put her lips near his ear and spoke clearly dont have to she was still laughing softly when she sealed the doors to the treatment room behind her and flew down the corridor toward refuge chapter it had been a mistake to let ti insist on docking to the superjumper silver realized as the crunch and shudder of their impact with the docking clamps reverberated through the pusher zara hovering anxiously emitted a tiny moan ti snarled wordlessly over his shoulder at her returned his fraying attention to the controls noher mistake to let his downsider male legged authority override her own reasonshe knew he wasnt rated for these pushers hed told her so himself he was only the authority after they got inside the superjumper no she told herself firmly not even then zara she called take the controls dammit ti began if youd just we need ti too much on the comm channels to spare him for piloting silver inserted hoping desperately ti would not spurn this offered sop for his pride mm grudgingly ti let zara shoulder him aside the flex tube docking ring wouldnt seal properly a second docking and all the hopeful jiggling the autowaldos could supply couldnt make the locking ring seal properly silver either feared she would die or wished she could she wasnt sure all her palms sweated and transferring the lasersolderer from one to another only made the grip clammier see said ti to zara you cant do any better zara glared at him you bent one of the rings you dipstick you better hope its theirs and not ours thats dipshit john laboring back by the hatch trying to make it seal corrected helpfully if youre going to use downsider terminology get it right pusher r calling galactech superjumper d ti quavered into the comm von were going to have to disengage and come around to the other side this isnt working go ahead ti came the jump pilots voice in return are you sick you dont sound so good that was a miserable docking just what is this emergency anyway ill explain when were aboard ti glanced up got a confirming nod from zara disengaging now their luck was better on the starboard hatch no silver reminded herself again we make our own luck and its my responsibility to see its good and not bad ti pushed through the flex tube first the jumpships engineer was waiting for him on the other side silver could hear his angry voice gulik you bent our portside docking ring you wireheads all think youre mr twinkletoes when youre plugged into your sets but on manual you are without exception the most hamhanded he broke off his voice thinning out in a little hiss as silver flitted through the hatch and hovered her lasersolderer pointed sturdily at his stomach it actually took him a moment to notice the weapon his eyes widened and his mouth opened as siggy and jon backed her up from behind take us to where the pilot is ti said silver she hoped the fear that edged her voice made her sound angry and fierce not pale and weak all her strength seemed washed out of her leaving her limpstomached she swallowed and took a tighter grip on the solderer what the hell is this began the engineer his voice a taut octave higher than before he cleared his throat and brought it back down who are you people anyway gulik are they with you ti shrugged and produced a sickly smile that was either very well acted or real not exactly im kind of with them siggy reminded pointed his solderer at ti silver when approving this ploy had kept her inner thoughts about it most secret going in with ti unarmed apparently under the quaddies guns covered him in case of later capture and legal prosecution equally it disguised the possibility of making his ersatz kidnapping real should he decide to bolt back to the side of his legged companions at the last moment wheels within wheels did all leaders have to think on multiple levels it made her head hurt they filed quickly through the compact crews section to nav and com the jump pilot sat enthroned in his padded chair plugged into the massive crown of his control headset a temporary regal cyborg his purple company coveralls were stitched with gaudy patches proudly proclaiming his rank and specialization his eyes were closed and he hummed tunelessly in time to the throbbing biofeedback from his ship he yelped in surprise as his headset detached and rose cutting his communion with his machine when ti thumbed the disconnect control god ti dont do things like thatyou know better a second yelp at the sight of the quaddies was swallowed with a gulp he smiled at silver in complete bewilderment his eyes after one shocked pass over her anatomy locked politely on her face she wriggled the lasersolderer to bring it to his attention get out of your chair she ordered he shrank back into it look lady uh what is that laser gun get out of your chair his eyes measured her measured ti flicked to his engineer his hand stole to his seat harness buckle hesitated his muscles tensed get out slowly silver added why he asked stalling silver thought these people want to borrow your ship ti explained hijackers breathed the engineer he coiled floating in his position near the airseal door jons and siggys solderers swivelled toward him mutants get out silver repeated her voice rising uncontrollably the pilots face was drawn and thoughtful his hands floated from his belt to rest in a parody of relaxation over his knees what if i dont he challenged softly she fancied she could feel control of the situation slipping from her to him sucked up by his superior imitation of coolness she glanced at ti but he was staying safely and firmly in his part of helplessand unhelpfulvictim lying low as the downsiders phrased it a heartbeat passed another another the pilot began to relax visibly in his long exhalation a smug light of triumph in his eyes he had her number he knew she could not fire his hand went to his belt buckle and his legs curled under him seeking launch leverage she had rehearsed it in her mind so many times the actual event was almost an anticlimax it had a glassy clarity as if she observed herself from a distance or from another time future or past the moment shaped the choice of target something she had turned over and over without decision before she sighted the solderer at a point just below his knees because no valuable control surfaces lay behind them pressing the button was surprisingly easy the work of one small muscle in her upper right thumb the beam was dull blue not enough to even make her blink though a brief bright yellow flame flared at the edge of the melted fabric of his supposedly nonflammable coveralls then winked out her nostrils twitched with the stink of the burnt fabric more pungent than the smell of burnt flesh then the pilot was bent over himself screaming ti was babbling voice strained what dja do that for he was still strapped to his chair silver his eyes were wells of astonishment the engineer after a first convulsive movement froze in a submissive ball eyes flickering from quaddie to quaddie siggys mouth hung open jons was a tight line the pilots screams frightened her swelled up her nerves to lance through her head she pointed the solderer at him again stop that noise she demanded amazingly he stopped his breath whistled past his clenched teeth as he twisted his head to stare at her through painslitted eyes the centers of the burns across his legs seemed to be cauterized shadowed black and ambiguousshe was torn between revulsion and the curious desire to go take a closer look at what she had done the edges of the burns were swelling red yellow plasma already seeping through but clinging to his skin no need for a handvac the injury did not seem to be immediately lifethreatening siggy unstrap him and get him out of that control chair silver ordered for once siggy zipped to obey with no argument not even a suggestion of how to do it better gleaned from his holodrama viewing in fact the effect of her action on everyone present not just their captives was most gratifying everyone moved faster this could get addictive silver thought no arguments no complaints some complaints was that necessary ti asked as the prisoners were bundled ahead of them through the corridor he was getting out of his seat for you he was going to try and jump me you cant be sure of that i didnt think i could hit him once he was moving its not like you had no choice she turned toward him with a snap he flinched away if we do not succeed in taking this ship a thousand of my friends are going to die i had a choice i chose id choose again you got that and you choose for everybody silver leos voice echoed in her memory ti subsided instantly yes maam yes maam silver blinked and pushed ahead of him to hide her confusion her hands were shaking in reaction now she entered the lifepod first ostensibly to yank all the communications equipment but for the emergency directional finder beeper and to check for the firstaid kitit was there and completealso to be alone for a moment away from the wide eyes of her companions was this the pleasure in power van atta felt when everyone gave way before him it was obvious what firing the weapon had done to the defiant pilot what had it done to her for every action an equal and opposite reaction this was a somatic truth visceral knowledge ingrained in every quaddie from birth clear and demonstrable in every motion she exited the pod a hoarse moan broke from the pilots lips as his legs accidently bumped against the hatch as they stuffed him and the engineer through into the lifepod sealed it and fired it away from the jumpship silvers agitation gave way to a cool pool of resolve within her even though her hands still trembled with distress for the pilots pain so quaddies were no different than downsiders after all any evil they could do quaddies could do too if they chose there by placing the growtubes at this angle with a sixhour rotation they could get by with four fewer spectrum lights in the hydroponics module and still have enough lumens falling on the leaves to trigger flowering in fourteen days claire entered the command on her lap board computer and made the analog model cycle all the way through once on fastforward just to be sure the new growth configuration would cut the power drain of the module by some twelve percent from her first estimate good for until the habitat reached its destination and they unfurled the delicate solar collectors again power would be at a premium she shut off the lap board and sighed that was the last of the planning tasks she could do while still locked up here in the clubhouse it was a good hiding place but too quiet concentration had been horribly difficult but having nothing to do she discovered as the seconds crept on was worse she floated over to the cupboard and took a pack of raisins and ate them one at a time when she finished the gluey silence closed back in she imagined holding andy again his warm little fingers clutching hers in mutual security and wished for silver to hurry up and send her signal she pictured tony medically imprisoned downside and hoped in anguish silver might delay that by some miracle they might yet regain him at the last minute she didnt know whether to push or pull at the passing minutes only that each one seemed to physically pelt her the airseal doors hissed jolting her with anxiety was she discovered no it was three quaddie girls emma patty and kara the infirmary aide is it time claire asked hoarsely kara shook her head why doesnt it start whats keeping silver claire broke off she could imagine all too many disastrous reasons for silvers delay shed better signal soon said kara the hunt is up all over the habitat for you mr wyzak the airsystems maintenance supervisor finally thought of looking behind the walls theyre over in the docking bay section now everybody on his crew is having the most terrific outbreak of clumsiness a curved moon of a grin winked in her face but theyll be working this way eventually emma gripped one of karas lower arms in that case is this really the best place for us to hide itll have to do for now i hope things break before dr curry works all the way down his list or its going to get awfully crowded in here said kara is dr curry recovered then asked claire not certain if she wanted to hear a yes or a no enough to do surgery id hoped hed be out longer kara giggled not exactly hes kind of hanging there all squintyeyed and puffy just supervising while the nurse gives the injections or he would be if they could find any of the girls to give injections to injections abortifacient kara grimaced oh a different list from mine then so that was why emma and patty looked pale as from a narrow escape kara sighed yeah well were all on one list or another in the end i guess she slipped back out claire was cheered by the company of the other two quaddies even though it represented a growing danger of discovery not only of themselves but of their plans how much more could go wrong before the habitats downsider staff started asking the right questions suppose the entire plot was discovered prematurely following up the loose end shed left should she have submitted docilely to currys procedure just to keep the secret a little longer suppose a little longer was all it took to make the difference between success and disaster now what i wonder said emma in a thin voice just wait unless you brought something to do said claire emma shook her head kara just grabbed me off about ten minutes ago i didnt think to bring anything she got me out of my sleep sack patty confirmed a yawn escaped her despite the tension im so tired these days emma rubbed her abdomen absently with her lower palms in a circular motion familiar to claire so the girls had already started childbirth training i wonder how all this is going to go sighed emma how it will turn out where well all be in seven months hardly a figure chosen at random claire realized away from rodeo anyway or dead if were dead we wont have a problem patty said if not claire how is labor whats it really like her eyes were urgent seeking reassurance from claires expertise as the sole initiate present in the maternal mysteries of the body claire understanding responded it wasnt exactly comfortable but its nothing you cant handle dr minchenko says we have it a lot better than downsider women we have a more flexible pelvis with a wider arch and our pelvic floor is more elastic on account of not having to fight the gravitational forces he says that was his own design idea like eliminating the hymenwhatever that was something painful i gather ugh poor things said emma i wonder if their babies ever get sucked from their bodies by the gravity i never heard of such a thing said claire doubtfully he did say they had trouble close to term with the weight of the baby cutting off circulation and squeezing their nerves and organs and things im glad i wasnt born a downsider said emma at least not a female one think of the poor downsider mothers who have to worry about their helpers dropping their newborns she shuddered its horrible down there claire confirmed fervently remembering its worth risking anything not to have to go there truly but well be by ourselves in seven months that is said patty you had help you had dr minchenko emma and mewell be all alone no you wont said claire what a nasty thought kara will be thereill comewell all help leo will be coming with us emma offered trying to sound optimistic hes a downsider im not sure thats exactly his field of expertise said claire honestly trying to picture leo as a medtech he didnt care for hydraulic systems hed said she went on more firmly anyway all the complicated stuff in andys birth mostly had to do with data collecting because i was one of the first and they were working out the procedures dr minchenko said just having the baby wasnt all that much dr minchenko didnt do itreally i didnt do it my body did about all he did was hold the handvac messy but straightforward if nothing goes wrong biologically she thought and had the lastminute wit not to say aloud patty still looked unhappy yes but birth is only the beginning working for galactech kept us busy but weve been working three times as hard since this escapething came up and youd have to be a dim bulb not to see its going to get harder later theres no end in sight how are we going to handle it all and babies too im not sure i think much of this freedomstuff leo talks it up but freedom for who not me i had more free time working for the company you want to go report to dr curry suggested emma patty shrugged uncomfortably no i dont think by freedom he means free time said claire thoughtfully more like survival likelike not having to work for people who have a right to shoot us if they want a twinge of harsh memory edged her voice and she softened it selfconsciously well still have to work but it will be for ourselves and our children mostly our children said patty glumly thats not all bad remarked emma claire thought she caught a glimpse of the source of pattys pessimism and next timeif you want a next timeyou can choose who will father your baby there wont be anybody around to tell you patty brightened visibly thats true claires reassurances seemed effective the talk drifted to less threatening channels for a while much later the airseal doors parted and pramod stuck his head in we got silvers signal he said simply claire sang out in joy patty and emma hugged each other whirling in air pramod held out a cautionary hand things havent started yet youve got to stay in here a while longer no why emma cried were waiting for a special supply shuttle from downside when it docks is the new signal for things to start happening claires heart thumped tonydid they get tony aboard pramod shook his head his dark eyes sharing her pain no fuel rods leos really anxious about them hes afraid that without them we might not have enough power to boost the habitat all the way out to the wormhole ohyes of course claire folded back into herself stay in here hang on and ignore any emergency klaxons you may hear said pramod his lower hands clenched together in a gesture of encouragement and he withdrew claire settled back to wait she could have wept with the tension of it but patty and emma didnt need the bad example bruce van atta pressed a finger to one side of his nose squeezing the nostril shut and sniffed mightily then switched sides and repeated the procedure damn free fall and its lack of proper sinus drainage among its other discomforts he could hardly wait to get back to earth even dismal rodeo would be an improvement he wondered idly if he could whip up some excusego inspect the quaddie barracks being readied perhaps that could be stretched out to about five days if he worked it right he drifted over and shored himself across one corner of dr yeis piewedgeshaped office sighting over her desk his back to a flat inner wall and his feet braced where her magnetboard curved thick with stuckon papers and flimsies yeis lips tightened with annoyance as she swivelled to face him he hitched his feet to a comfortably crossed position deliberately letting them muss her papers outpsyching the psycher she glanced back to her holovid display declining to rise to the bait and he mussed a few more female wimp he thought a relief that they had only a few weeks left to work together and he didnt have to jolly her up any more so he prodded how far along are we well i dont know how youre doingin fact she added rather venomously i dont even know what youre doing van atta grinned in appreciation so the worm could wriggle after all some administrators might have taken offense at the implied insubordination he congratulated himself upon his sense of humor but so far ive finished orienting about half the staff to their new assignments anybody give you a hard time ill play bad guy if necessary he offered nobly and go lean on the noncooperative everybody is naturally rather shocked she replied however i dont think your direct intervention will be required good he said jovially i do think it would have been better to tell them all at once this business of releasing the information in bits and dribbles invites just the sort of rumormongering that is least desirable yeah well its too late now his words were cut short by the startling hoot of an alarm klaxon shrilling out over the intercom yeis holovid was abruptly overridden by the central systems emergency channel a hoarse male voice a strained facegood god it was leo grafsprang from the display emergency emergency graf calledwhere was he calling fromwe are having a depressurization emergency this is not a drill all habitat downsider staff should proceed at once to the designated safe area and remain there until the allclear sounds on the holovid a computergenerated map sketched itself showing the shortest route from this terminal to the designated safe modulesmodule van atta saw holy shit the pressurization drop must be habitatwide what the hell was going on emergency emergency this is not a drill graf repeated yei too was staring bugeyed at the map looking more like a frog than ever how can that be the sealing system is supposed to isolate the problem area from the rest i bet i know spat van atta grafs been messing with the habitats structure preparatory to salvageill bet he or his quaddies just screwed something up royally unless it was that idiot wyzak did somethingcome on emergency emergency grafs voice droned on this is not a drill all habitat downsider staff should proceed at oncesonofabitch his head snapped around winked out leaving only the urgently pulsing map on the display van atta beat yei whose eye was still caught by the map out the door to her office and through the airseal doors at the end of the module that should have been sealed and werent the doors seemed to sag halfopened controls dead useless as van atta and yei joined a babbling stream of staffers speeding toward safety van atta swallowed cursing his sinuses as one ear popped and the other throbbing failed to adrenalinspurred anxiety shivered in his stomach lecture module c was already mobbed when they arrived with downsiders in every state of dress and undress one of the nutrition staff had a case of frozen food clutched under her armvan atta rejected the notion that she had inside information about the duration of the emergency and decided she must have simply had it in her hands when the alarm sounded and not thought to drop it before she fled close the door howled a chorus of voices as his and yeis group entered a distinct breeze sighed past them rising to a whistle cut to silence as the doors sealed chaos and babble ruled in the crowded lecture module whats going on ask wyzak hes out there surely dealing with it if not hed better get the hell out there is everybody here where are the quaddies what about the quaddies they have their own safe area this isnt big enough their gym probably i didnt catch any directions for them on the holovid to the gym or anywhere else try the comm half the channels are dead cant you even raise central systems lady i am central systems shouldnt we have a headcount does anybody know exactly how many there are up on rotation right now two hundred seventytwo but how can you know which are missing because theyre trapped and which are missing because theyre out there dealing with it let me at that damned comm unit close the door van atta himself joined the chorus this time semiinvoluntarily the pressure differential was becoming more marked he was glad he wasnt a latecomer if this went on it would shortly become his duty to see the doors stayed closed at any cost no matter who was pounding for admittance from the other side he had a little list well anybody who lacked the wit to respond quickly to emergency instructions shouldnt be on a space station survival of the fittest if they hadnt amassed the whole two hundred seventytwo by now they were surely getting close van atta pushed his way through the bobbing crowd toward the center of the module stealing momentum from this or that person at the price of their own displacement a few turned to object saw who had nudged them and bit short their complaints somebody had the cover off the comm unit and was peering into its guts in frustration lacking delicate diagnostic tools doubtless dropped somewhere back in the habitat cant you at least raise the quaddies gym demanded a young woman ive got to know if my class made it there well why didnt you go with em then the wouldbe repairman snapped logically one of the older quaddies took them he told me to come here i didnt think to argue with him with that alarm howling in our ears no go grimacing the man clicked the cover shut well im going back and find out said the young woman decisively no youre not interrupted van atta theres too many people breathing in here to open the door and lose air unnecessarily not till we find out whats going on how extensive this is and how long its likely to last the man tapped the holovid cover if this thing doesnt cut in the only way were going to find out anything is to send out somebody with a breath mask to go check well give it a few more minutes damn that overweening fool graf what had he done and where was he in a breath mask somewhere van atta trusted or better yet a pressure suitalthough if graf had indeed caused this unholy mess van atta wasnt sure he wished him a pressure suit let him have a breath mask and a nasty case of the bends for just punishment idiot graf so much for grafs famous safety record blessings in disguise at least the engineer wouldnt be able to jam that down his throat any more a little humility would be good for him and yetthe situation was so damned anomalous it shouldnt be possible to depressurize the whole habitat at once there were backups on the backups interlocks separated baysany accident so systemwide would take foresight and planning a little hiss escaped his teeth and van atta locked into himself in a sudden bubble of furious concentration eyes widening a planned accidentcould it be could it possibly be genius graf an accident an accident a perfect accident the very accident hed most desired but had never dared wish for aloud was that it that had to be it fatal disaster for the quaddies now at the last moment when they were all together and it could be accomplished at one stroke a dozen clues fell into place grafs insistence upon handling all the details of the salvage planning himself his secretiveness his anxiety for constant updates on the evacuation schedulehis withdrawal from social contacts that yei had observed with disfavor obsessive work schedule general air of a man with a secret agenda driven to exhaustionit was all culminating in this of course it was secret now that he had penetrated the plot himself van atta could only concur the gratitude of the galactech hierarchy to graf for relieving them of the quaddie problem must appear indirectly in better assignments quicker promotionshe would have to think up some suitably oblique way of transmitting it on the other handwhy share van attas lips drew back in a vulpine grin this was hardly a situation where graf could demand credit where it was due after all graf had been subtlebut not subtle enough there would have to be a sacrifice for the sake of form after the accident all he had to do was keep his mouth shut and van atta had to wrench his attention back to his present surroundings ive got to check on my quaddies the young woman was growing wildeyed she gave up on the comm unit and began to shove her way back toward the airseal doors yes another man joined her and ive got to find wyzak hes still not here hes bound to need help ill go with you no cried van atta urgently almost adding youll spoil everything youre to wait for the allclear i wont have a panic well all just sit tight and wait for instructions the woman subsided but the man said skeptically instructions from whom graf said van atta yes it was not too early to start making it clear to witnesses where the handson responsibility lay he controlled his excitementspurred rapid breathing trying for an aura of steady calm though not too calmhe must appear as surprised as anyno more surprised than anywhen the full extent of the disaster became apparent he settled down to wait minutes dragged past one last panting group of refugees made it through the airseal doors the habitatwide rate of depressurization must be slowing one of the administrators from inventory controlold habits die hardpresented him with an unsolicited headcount of those present he silently cursed the censustakers initiative even as he accepted the results with thanks the proof that all were not present might compel him to action he did not desire to take only eleven downsider staff members had not made it a necessary price to pay van atta assured himself nervously some were doubtless holed up in other pressurized pockets or so he could maintain he had believed later their fatal mistakes could be pinned on graf a group by the airseal doors was making ready to bolt van atta inhaled and paused momentarily uncertain how to stop them without giving away everything but a cry of dismay went up from one womanall the air is out of the corridor now we cant get through without pressure suits van atta exhaled in relief he made his way to one of the modules viewports it framed a dull vista of unwinking stars the port on the other side gave an oblique view back toward the habitat movement caught his eye and he mashed his nose to the cold glass in an attempt to make out the details the silvery flash of worksuits bobbing over the outside surface of the habitat refugees or a repair party could his first hypothesis of a real accident be correct after all not good but in any case it was still graf s baby but there were quaddies out there dammit quaddie survivors he could see the arms graf had not made his stroke complete just two quaddie survivors if one was male and the other female would be as bad as a thousand from apmads point of view perhaps the work party was allmale there was graf himself among the flitting figures they carried an assortment of equipment the wavering distortion of his transverse view through the port prevented him from making out just what he twisted his neck craning painfully then the work party was eclipsed by a curve of the habitat a pusher slid into and out of his view arcing smoothly over the lecture module more escapees quaddie or downsider hey an excited voice from within the lecture module disrupted his frantic observations were in luck gang this whole cupboard is filled with breath masks there must be three hundred of em van atta swivelled his head to spot the cupboard in question the last time hed been in this module that storage had been filled with audiovisual equipment who the hell had made that switch and why a bang reverberated through the module with a peculiar sharp resonance like having ones head in a metal bucket when someone whacked it with a hammer hard shrieks and screams the lights dimmed then came up to about a quarter of their former brilliance they were on the modules own emergency power power from the habitat had been cut off power wasnt all that had been cut off stunned van atta saw the habitat begin to turn slowly past his viewport no it wasnt the habitatit was the module that was moving a generalized aaah went up from the mob within as they began to drift toward one wall and pile up there against the gentle acceleration being imparted from without van atta clung convulsively to the handholds by the viewport realization washed over him almost physically radiating hotly from his chest down his arms his legs pounding up through the top of his head as if to burst through his skull betrayed he was betrayed betrayed completely and on every level a spacesuited figure with legs was waving a cheery farewell at the module from beside a gaping hole burned in the side of the habitat van atta shook with chagrin ill get you graf itt get you you doublecrossing sonofabitch you and every one of those fourarmed little creeps with you calm down man dr yei was saying having somehow snagged up by his viewport what is it he realized hed been mumbling aloud he wiped saliva from the corners of his mouth and glared at yei youyouyou missed it you were supposed to be keeping track of everything thats going on with those little monsters and you totally missed it he advanced on her intending he knew not what slipped from a handhold swung and skidded down the wall his blood beat so hard in his ears he was afraid he was having a coronary he lay a moment with his eyes closed gasping temporarily overwhelmed by his emotions control he told himself in a mortal fear of his imminent selfdestruction control stay in controland get graf later get him get them all chapter leo unsuited to the wails of disturbed quaddies what do you mean we didnt get them all he asked his elation draining away he had so hoped that his troublesor at least the downsider parts of themwould be over with the ignition of the jet cord cutting off lecture module c four of the area supervisors are locked in the vegetable cooler with breath masks and wont come out reported sinda from nutrition and the three crewmen from the shuttle that just docked tried to make it back to their ship said a yellowshirted quaddie from docks locks we trapped them between two airseal doors but theyve been working on the mechanism and we dont think we can hold them much longer mr wyzak and two of the lifesupport systems supervisors are um tied up in central systems to the wall hand grips reported another quaddie in yellow adding nervously mr wyzak sure is mad three of the creche mothers refused to leave their kids said an older quaddie girl in pink theyre all still in the gym with the rest of the little ones theyre pretty upset nobodys told them whats going on yet at least not when id left and um theres one other person added redclad bobbi from leos own welding and joining work gang in a faint tone were not quite sure what to do about him immobilize him to start began leo wearily well just have to arrange a life pod to take the stragglers that may not be so easy said bobbi you outnumber him take tentake twentyyou can be as careful as you likeis he armed not exactly admitted bobbi seeming to find her lower fingernails objects of new fascination the quaddie equivalent of footshuffling leo realized graf boomed an authoritative voice as the airseals at the end of the worksuit locker room slid open dr minchenko launched himself across the module to thump to a halt beside leo and gave the locker an extra bang with his fist for emphasis one could not after all stomp in free fall the unused breath mask trailing from his hand bounced and quivered what the hell is going on here theres no bleeding pressurization emergency he inhaled vigorously as if to prove his point the quaddie girl kara in the white tshirt and shorts of medical trailed him looking mortified sorry leo she apologized i couldnt get him to go am i to run off to some closet while all my quaddies asphyxiate minchenko demanded indignantly of her what do you take me for girl most everybody else did she offered hesitantly cowardsscoundrelsidiots he sputtered they followed their computerized emergency instructions said leo why didnt you minchenko glared at him because the whole thing stank a habitatwide pressurization loss should be almost impossible a whole chain of interlocking accidents would have to occur such chains do occur though said leo speaking from wide experience theyre practically my speciality just so purred minchenko lidding his eyes and that vermin van atta billed you as his pet engineer when he brought you in frankly i thoughtahem he looked only mildly embarrassed that you might be his triggerman the accident seemed so suspiciously convenient just now from his point of view knowing van atta that was practically the first thing i thought of thanks snarled leo i knew van attai didnt know you minchenko paused and added more mildly i still dont what do you think youre doing isnt it obvious not entirely no oh certainly you can hold out in the habitat for a few months cut off from rodeoperhaps years barring counterattacks if you were conservative and clever enoughbut what then there is no public opinion to come to your rescue here no audience to grandstand for its halfbaked graf youve made no provisions for reaching help were not asking for help the quaddies are going to rescue themselves how minchenkos tone scoffed though his eyes were alight jump the habitat then keep going even minchenko was silenced momentarily oh leo finished struggling into his red coveralls and found the tool he wanted he pointed the lasersolderer firmly at minchenkos midsection it did not appear to be a task he could safely delegate to the quaddies and you he said stiffly can go to the transfer station in the life pod with the rest of the downsiders lets go minchenko barely glanced at the solderer his lips curled with contempt for the weapon and leo felt its wielder dont be more of an idiot than you can help graf i know they foxed that cretin curry so there are still at least fifteen pregnant quaddie girls out there not counting the results of unauthorized experiments which judging from the way the level is dropping in that box of condoms in the unlocked drawer in my office are becoming significant kara started in guilty dismay and minchenko added aside to her why do you think i pointed them out to you dear be that as it may graf he fixed leo with a stern eye if you throw me off what do you plan to do if one of them presents at labor with placenta praevia or a postpartum prolapsed uterus or any other medical emergency that requires more than a bandaid well but leo was taken aback he wasnt quite sure what placenta praevia was but somehow he didnt think it was medical gobbledygook for a hangnail nor that a precise explanation of the term would do anything to ease the ominous anxiety it engendered in him was it something likely to occur given the alterations of quaddie anatomy there is no choice to stay here is death for every quaddie to go is a chancenot a guaranteeof life but you need me argued minchenko you have towhat leos tongue stumbled you need me you cant throw me off minchenkos eyes flicked infinitesimally to the solderer well huh leo choked i cant kidnap you either whos asking you to you are evidently he cleared his throat look i dont think you understand im taking this habitat out and were not coming back not ever were going out as far as we can go beyond every inhabited world its a oneway ticket im relieved at first i thought you were going to try something stupid leo found his emotions churning a mixture of suspicion jealousyand a sharp rising anticipationwhat a relief it would be not to have to carry it all alone you sure theyre my quaddies minchenkos hands clenched opened daryls and mine i dont think you half understand what a job we did what a good job developing these people theyre finely adapted to their environment superior in every way thirtyfive years workam i to let some total stranger drag them off across the galaxy to whoknowswhat fate besides galactech was going to retire me next year youll lose your pension leo pointed out maybe your freedompossibly your life minchenko snorted not much of that left not true leo thought the bioscientist possessed enormous life over threequarters of a century of accumulation when this man died a universe of specialized knowledge would be extinguished angels would weep for the loss unlesscould you train quaddie doctors its a forgone conclusion you couldnt minchenko ran his hands through his clipped white hair in a gesture part exasperation part pleading leo glanced around at the anxiously hovering quaddies listening inlistening in while men with legs decided their fate again not right the words popped out of his mouth before reasoned caution could stop them what do you kids think a ragged but immediate chorus of assent for minchenkorelief in their eyes too minchenkos familiar authority would clearly be an immense comfort to them as they travelled farther into the unknown leo was suddenly put in mind of the way the universe had changed to a stranger place the day his father had died just because were adults doesnt automatically mean we can save you but this was a discovery each quaddie would have to make in their own time he took a deep breath all right how could one suddenly feel a hundred kilos lighter when already weightless placenta praevia god minchenko did not react with immediate pleasure theres just one thing he began arranging his features in a humble smile quite horribly out of place on his face whats he sweating for now leo wondered suspicions renewed what madame minchenko who my wife i have to get her i didntrealize you were married where is she downside on rodeo hell leo suppressed an urge to start tearing out the remains of his hair pramod listening reminded tonys down there too i know i knowand i promised clairei dont know how were going to work this minchenko was waiting his expression intensenot a man used to begging only his eyes pleaded leo was moved well try well try thats all i can promise minchenko nodded dignified hows madame minchenko going to feel about all this anyway shes loathed rodeo for twentyfive years minchenko promisedsomewhat airily leo thought shell be delighted to get away minchenko didnt add i hope aloud but leo heard it anyway all right well weve still got to round up these stragglers and get rid of them leo wondered wistfully if it was possible to drop dead painlessly from an anxiety attack he led his little troop from the locker room claire flew from handgrip to handgrip along the branching corridors done with patience at last her heart sang with anticipation the airseal doors to the raucous gym were crowded with quaddies and she had to restrain herself from forcibly elbowing them out of her way one of her old dormitory mates in the pink tshirt and shorts of creche duty recognized her with a grin and reached out with a lower hand to pull her through the mob the littlest ones are by door c said her dorm mate ive been expecting you after a quick visual check to be sure her flight plan didnt violently intersect anyone elses taking a similar shortcut her dorm mate helped her launch herself in that direction by the most direct route across the diameter of the big chamber the buxom figure in pink coveralls claire sought was practically buried in a swarm of excited frightened chattering crying fiveyearolds claire felt a twinge of real guilt that it had been judged too dangerous to their secrecy to warn the younger quaddies in advance of the great changes about to sweep over them the little ones didnt get a vote either she thought andy was tethered to mama nilla weeping miserably mama nilla was desperately trying to pacify him with a squeeze bottle of formula with one hand while holding a reddening gauze pad to the forehead of a crying fiveyearold with the other two or three more clung for comfort to her legs as she tried to verbally direct the efforts of a sixth to help a seventh who had torn open a package of protein chips too wide and accidently allowed the contents to spill into the air through it all her calm familiar drawl was only slightly more compressed than usual until she saw claire approaching oh dear she said in a weak voice andy claire cried his head swivelled toward her and he launched himself away from mama nilla with frantic swimming motions only to fetch up at the end of his tether and rebound back to the creche mothers side at this point he began screaming in true earnest as if by resonance the bleeding boy started crying harder too claire braked by the wall and closed in on them claire honey im sorry said mama nilla twitching her hips around to eclipse andy but i cant let you have him mr van atta said hed fire me on the spot twenty years or no twenty yearsand god knows who theyd get thentheres so few i can really trust to have their heads screwed on right andy interrupted her by launching himself again he batted the proffered bottle violently out of her hand and it spun away a few drops of formula adding tangentially to the general environmental degradation claires hands reached for him i cant i really cantoh hell take him it was the first time claire had ever heard mamma nilla swear she unhooked the tether and her freed left side was instantly set upon by the waiting fiveyearolds andys screams faded at once to a muffled weeping as his little hands clamped her fiercely claire folded him to her with all four arms no less fiercely he rooted in her shirtuselessly she realized just holding him might be enough for her but the reverse was not necessarily true she nuzzled in his scant hair delighting in the clean baby smell of him tender sculptured ears translucent skin fine eyelashes every part of his wriggling body she wiped his nose happily with the edge of her blue shirt its claire she overheard one of the fiveyearolds explaining knowlegeably to another shes a real mommy she glanced up to catch them gravely inspecting her they giggled she grinned back a sevenyearold from an adjoining group had retrieved the bottle and hung about watching andy with interest the cut on the little quaddies forehead having clotted enough mama nilla was at last able to carry on a conversation you dont happen to know where mr van atta is do you she asked claire worriedly gone said claire joyously gone forever were taking over mama nilla blinked claire they wont let you we have help she nodded across the gym where leo in his red coveralls caught her eyehe must have just arrived with him was another legged figure in white coveralls what was dr minchenko still doing here a sudden fear twinged through her had they failed to clear the habitat of downsiders after all for the first time it occurred to her to question mama nillas presence why didnt you go to your safe zone claire asked her dont be silly dear oh dr minchenko mama nilla waved to him over here the two downsider men lacking the freeflying confidence of the quaddies crossed the chamber via a rope net hung across a farther arc and made their way toward mama nillas group ive got one here who needs some biotic glue mama nilla hugging the cut quaddie said to dr minchenko as soon as he drew near enough to hear whats going on is it safe to take them back to the creche modules yet its safe replied leo but youre going to have to come with me ms villanova i dont leave my kids till my relief arrives said mama nilla tartly and ninetenths of the department seems to have evaporated including my department head leo frowned have you had your briefing from dr yei yet no they were saving the best for last said dr minchenko grimly for obvious reasons he turned to the creche mother galactech has just terminated the cay project liz without even consulting me bluntly he outlined the termination scenario for her i was writing up protests but graf here beat me to it rather more effectively i suspect the inmates are taking over the asylum he thinks he can convert the habitat into a colony ship i think i choose to believe he can you mean youre responsible for this mess mama nilla glared at leo and looked around clearly stunned i thought claire was babbling the other two downsider creche mothers had come over during the explanation and hung in the air looking equally nonplussed galactechs not giving you the habitat are they mama nilla asked leo faintly no ms villanova said leo patiently we are stealing it now i wouldnt ask you to get involved in anything illegal so if youll just follow me to the life pod mama nilla stared around the gym a few groups of youngsters were already being herded out by some older quaddies but these kids cant handle all these kids theyre going to have to said leo no noi dont think you have the foggiest idea how laborintensive this department is he doesnt confirmed dr minchenko rubbing his lips thoughtfully with a forefinger theres no choice said leo through his teeth now kids let go of ms villanova he addressed the quaddies clutching her she has to leave no said the one wrapped around her left knee shes gotta read our stories after lunch she promised the one with the cut began crying again another one tugged her left sleeve and whispered loudly mama nilla i gotta go to the toilet leo ran his hands through his hair unclenched them with a visible effort i need to be suited up and outsideright now lady i dont have time to argue all of you his glare took in the other two creche mothers move it mama nillas eyes glinted she held out her left arm with the quaddie attached blue eyes peering frightenedly at leo around mama nillas sturdy bicep are you going to take this little girl to the bathroom then the quaddie girl and leo stared at each other in equal horror certainly not the engineer choked he looked around another quaddie will claire after a barracudalike investigation andy chose this moment to begin wailing protests at the lack of expected milk from his mothers breasts claire tried to soothe him patting his back she felt like crying herself for his disappointment i dont suppose dr minchenko interjected mildly that you would care to come along with us liz there would be no going back of course us mama nilla regarded him sharply are you going along with this nonsense i rather think so thats all right then she nodded but you cant leo began graf dr minchenko said did your little depressurization drama just now give these ladies any reason to think they were still going to have air to breathe if they stayed with their quaddies it shouldnt have said leo i didnt even think about it said one of the creche mothers looking suddenly dismayed i did said the other frowning at leo i knew there were emergency air supplies in the gym module said mama nilla its in the regular drill after all the whole department ought to have come here i diverted em said leo shortly the whole department should have told you to go screw yourself mama nilla added evenly allow me to speak for the absent she smiled icily at the engineer one of the creche mothers addressed mama nilla in distress but i cant come with you my husband works downside nobodys asking you to roared leo the other creche mother ignoring him added to mama nilla im sorry im sorry liz i just cant its just too much yes exactly leos hand hesitated over a lump in his coveralls abandoned it and switched to trying to herd them all along with broad armwaving gestures its all right girls i understand mama nilla soothed their evident anxiety ill stay and hold the fort i guess got nobody waiting for this old body after all she laughed it was a little forced will you take over the department then dr minchenko confirmed with mama nilla keep it going any way you cancome to me when you cant she nodded looking withdrawn as if the bottomless complexity of the task before her was just beginning to dawn dr minchenko took charge of the quaddie boy with the stilloozing cut on his forehead leo at last successfully pried loose the other two downsider women saying come on i have to go empty the vegetable cooler next with all this going on what is he doing spending time cleaning out a refrigerator mama nilla muttered under her breath madness mama nilla i gotta go now the little quaddie wrapped all her arms tightly around her torso by way of emphasis and mama nilla perforce broke away andy was still wailing his indignant disappointment in intermittent bursts hey little fellow dr minchenko paused to address him thats no way to talk to your mama no milk explained claire glumly feeling dreadfully inadequate she offered him the bottle which he batted away when she attempted to detach him momentarily in order to dive after it he wrapped himself around her arm and screamed frantically one of the fiveyearolds twisted up and put all four of his hands over his ears pointedly come with us to the infirmary said dr minchenko with an understanding smile i think i have something that will fix that problem unless you want to wean him now which i dont recommend oh please said claire hopefully it will take a couple of days to get your systems interlocked again he warned the biofeedback lag time being what it is but i havent had a chance to examine you two since i came up anyway claire floated after him with gratitude even andy stopped crying pramod hadnt been joking about the clamps leo thought with a sigh as he studied the fused lump of metal before him he punched up the specs on the computer board floating beside him a bit slowly and clumsily with his pressuregloved hands this particular insulated pipe conducted sewage unglamorous but a mistake here could be just as much a disaster as any other and a lot messier leo thought with a grim grin he glanced up at bobbi and pramod hovering at the ready beside him in their silvery worksuits five other quaddie work teams were visible along the habitats surface and a pusher jockeyed into position nearby rodeos sunlit crescent wheeled in the background well they must certainly be the galaxys most expensive plumbers the mess of variouslycoded pipes and tubing before him formed the umbilical connections between one module and the next shielded by an outer casing from microdust pitting and other hazards the task at hand was to realign the modules in uniform longitudinal bundles to withstand acceleration each bundle strapped together like the cargo pods would form a sturdy selfsupporting balanced mass at least in terms of the relatively low thrusts leo was contemplating just like driving a team of yoked hippopotamuses but realigning the modules entailed realigning all their connections and there were lots and lots and lots of connections a movement caught the corner of leos eye pramods helmet followed the tilt of leos there they go pramod remarked both triumph and regret mingled in his voice the life pod with the last remnant of downsiders aboard fled silently into the void a flash of light winking off a port even as it shrank from sight around rodeos curvature that was it then for the legged ones bar himself dr minchenko mama nilla and a slightly demented young supervisor waving a spanner theyd pried out of a duct who declared his violent love for a quaddie girl in airsystems maintenance and refused to be budged if he came to his senses by the time they reached orient iv leo decided they could drop him off meantime it was a choice between shooting him or putting him to work leo had eyed the spanner and put him to work time the seconds seemed to wriggle over leos skin like bugs beneath his suit the remnant group of evicted downsiders must soon catch up with the bewildered first batch and start comparing notes it wouldnt be long after that leo judged that galactech must start making its countermoves it didnt take an engineer to see a thousand ways in which the habitat was vulnerable the only option left to the quaddies now was speedy flight phlegmatic calm leo reminded himself was the key to getting out of this alive remember that he turned his attention back to the job at hand all right bobbi pramod lets do it get ready with the emergency shutoffs on both ends and well get this monster horsed around chapter his fellow refugees gave way before him as bruce van atta stormed out of the boarding tube and into the passenger arrival lounge of rodeo shuttleport three he had to pause a moment hands braced on his knees to overcome a wave of dizziness induced by his abrupt return to planetside gravity dizziness and rage for several hours during the ride around rodeo orbit in the cutoff lecture module van atta had been horribly certain that graf was intending to murder them all despite the contrary evidence of the breath masks if this was war graf would never make a good soldier even i know better than to humiliate a man like this and then leave him alive youll be sorry you doublecrossed me graf sorrier still you didnt kill me when you had the chance he restrained his rage with an effort van atta had ordered himself aboard the first available shuttle down from a transfer station overburdened by the surprise arrival of almost three hundred unexpected bodies he had not slept in the twenty hours since the detached lecture modules airlock had with agonizing glitches and delays finally been married to that of a station personnel carrier he and the other cay habitat employees had disembarked in disorganized batches from their cramped prisonmobile and been ferried to the transfer station where yet more time had been wasted information it had been almost a full day since they had been evicted from the cay habitat he must have information he boarded a slide tube and headed for shuttleport threes administration building with its communications center dr yei pattered after him wimping about something he paid little attention he caught sight of his own wavering reflection in the plexiplastic walls of the tube as he was carried along above the shuttleport tarmac haggard he straightened and sucked in his gut it would not do to appear before other administrators looking beaten or weak the weak went under he gazed through his pale image and across the shuttleport laid out below on the far side of the tarmac at the monorail terminal cargo pods were already starting to pile up ah yes the damned quaddies were a link in that chain too a weak link a broken link soon to be replaced he arrived at the communications center at the same moment as shuttleport threes chief administrator chalopin she was trailed by her security captain whatshisname oh yes that idiot bannerji what the hell is going on here chalopin snapped without preamble an accident why havent you requested assistance they told us to hold all flightsweve got a major production run backed up halfway to the refinery keep holding it then or call the transfer station moving your cargo is not my department oh yes it is orbital cargo marshalling has been under cay project aegis for a year experimentally he frowned stung it may be my department but its not my biggest worry right now look lady i got a fullscale crisis here he turned to one of the comm controllers can you punch me through to the cay habitat at all theyre not answering our calls said the comm controller doubtfully almost all of the regular telemetry has been cut off anything telescopic sighting anything i might be able to get a visual off one of the comsats said the controller he turned to his panel muttering in a few minutes his screen coughed up a distant flat view of the cay habitat as seen from synchronous orbit he stepped up the magnification what are they doing asked chalopin staring van atta stared too what insane vandalism was this the habitat resembled a complex threedimensional puzzle pulled apart by an idle child detached modules seemed spilled carelessly floating at all angles in space tiny silver figures jetted among them the solar power panels had mysteriously shrunk to a quarter of their normal area was graf embarked on some nutty scheme for fortifying the habitat against counterattack perhaps well it would do him no good van atta swore silently are they preparing for a siege or something dr yei asked aloud evidently following a similar line of thought surely they must realize how futile it would be who knows what that damn fool graf thinks van atta growled the mans run mad there are a dozen ways we can stand off at a distance and knock that installation to bits even without military supplies or just wait and starve them out theyve trapped themselves hes not just crazy hes stupid maybe said yei doubtfully they mean to just go on quietly living up there in orbit why not the hell you say im going to hook them out of there and doublequick too somehow no bunch of miserable mutants are going to get away with sabotage on this scale sabotagetheftterrorism they are not mutants began yei they are geneticallyengineered childr mr van atta sir piped up another comm controller i have an urgent memo for you listed on my allpoints can you take it here yei cut off spread her hands in frustration now what van atta muttered seating himself before the comm unit its a recorded message from the manager of the cargo marshalling station out at jumppoint ill put it online said the tech the vaguely familiar face of the jump point station manager wavered into focus before van atta van atta had met him perhaps once early in his stint here the small jumppoint station was manned from the orient iv side and was under orient ivs operations division not rodeos its employees were regular union downsiders and did not normally have contact with rodeo nor with the quaddies once destined to replace them the station manager looked harried he gabbled through the preliminary ids then came abruptly to the meat of his matter what the hell is going on with you people anyway a crew of mutant freaks just came out of nowhere kidnapped a jump pilot shot another and hijacked a galactech cargo superjumper but instead of jumping out theyve headed back with it toward rodeo when we notified rodeo security they indicated the mutants probably belonged to you are there more out there are they running wild or something i want answers dammit ive got a pilot in the infirmary a terrorized engineer and a crew on the verge of panic from the look on his face the station manager was on the verge of panic himself jumppoint station out how old is this memo said van atta rather blankly about the comm tech checked his monitor twelve hours sir does he think the hijackers are quaddies why wasnt i informed van attas eye fell on bannerji standing blandly at attention by chapolins elbow why wasnt i informed of this at once by security at the time the incident was first reported you were unavailable said the security captain devoid of expression since then weve been tracking the d and its continued to boost straight toward rodeo it doesnt answer our calls what are you doing about it were monitoring the situation i have not yet received orders to do anything about it why not wheres norris norris was operations manager for the entire rodeo local space area he ought to be on this thing true the cay project was not in his chain of command proper as van atta reported directly to company ops dr norris said chalopin is attending a materials development conference on earth in his absence i am acting operations manager captain bannerji and i have discussed the possibility of his taking his men and the shuttleport three security and rescue shuttle and attempting to board the hijacked ship were still not sure who these people are or what they want but they appear to have taken a hostage compelling caution on our part so weve let them continue to decrease their range while we attempt to gain more information about them this she eyed him beadily brings us to you mr van atta is this incident somehow connected to your crisis at the cay habitat i dont see how van atta began and broke off because suddenly he did see how sonofabitch he whispered lord krishna dr yei said and wheeled to stare again at the live vid of the habitat halfdismantled in orbit far above them it cant be grafs crazy hes crazy the mans a flaming megalomaniac he cant do this the engineering parameters paraded inexorably through van attas mind masspowerdistanceyes a pareddown habitat a percentage of its lessessential components dropped might just barely be torqued by a superjumper into wormhole space if it could be wrestled into position at the distant jump point the whole damn thing theyre hijacking the whole damn thing van atta cried aloud yei wrung her hands halfcircling the vid theyll never manage theyre barely more than children hell lead them to their deaths its criminal captain bannerji and the shuttleport administrator glanced at each other bannerji pursed his lips and opened his hand to her as if to say ladies first do you think the two incidents are connected then chalopin pressed van atta too paced back and forth as if he could so coax an angle from flat view of the habitat the whole damn thing yei answered for him yes we think so van atta paced on hell and theyve got it apart already we arent going to have time to starve em out got to stop em some other way the cay project workers were very upset at the abrupt termination of the project yei explained they found out about it prematurely they were afraid of being remaindered downside being unaccustomed to gravity i never had a chance to introduce the idea gradually i think they may actually be trying torun away somehow captain bannerjis eyes widened he leaned across the console on one hand and stared into the vid consider the lowly snail he muttered who carries its house on its back on cold rainy days when it goes for a walk it never has to backtrack van atta put an extra half meter of distance between himself and the suddenly poetic security captain weapons van atta said what kind of weapons does security have on tap stunners answered bannerji straightening up and studying his right thumbnail was there a flash of mockery in his eyes no he wouldnt dare i mean on your shuttle said van atta irritably shipmounted weapons teeth you cant make a threat without teeth there are two mediumpower shipmounted laser units last time we used them waslet me seeto burn through a log snag that had backed up flood waters threatening an exploration camp yes well its more than they have anyway said van atta excitedly we can attack the habitator the superjumpereither really the main thing is to keep them from connecting with each other yes get the jumpship first without it the habitat is a sitting target we can polish off at our leisure is your security shuttle fueled up and ready to go bannerji dr yei had paled hold on whos talking about attacking anything we havent even made verbal contact yet if the hijackers are indeed quaddies im sure i could persuade them to listen to reason its too late for reason this situation calls for action van attas humiliation burned hot in his stomach fueled by fear when the company brass found out how totally he had lost controlwell hed better be firmly back in control by then yes but yei licked her lips its all very well to threaten but the actual use of force is dangerousmaybe destructivehadnt you better get some kind of authorization first if something went horribly wrong you wouldnt want to be left holding the bag surely van atta paused it would take too much time he objected at last maybe a day to reach district hq on orient iv and return and if they decided it was too hot and bounced it all the way to apmad on earth it could be several days before we got a reply but its going to be several days isnt it said yei watching him intently even if they succeed in fitting the habitat to the superjumper they arent going to be able to swing it around and boost it like a fast courier it would never stand the strain it would use too much fueltheres lots of time yet wouldnt it be better to get authorization to be safe then if anything went wrongit wouldnt be your fault well van atta slowed still further how typical of yeis wishywashy wimpy indecision he could almost hear her in his head now lets all sit down and discuss this like reasonable people he loathed letting her push his buttons still she had a valid point coveryourass was a fundamental rule for survival even of the fittest well no dammit one thing i can damn well guarantee is that galactech is going to want this whole fiasco kept quiet the last thing theyll want is a lot of rumors flying around about their pet mutants running wild better for all of us if this is handled strictly inside rodeo local space he turned to bannerji thats the first priority thenyou and your men have got to get that jumpship back or at least disable it that remarked bannerji to the air would be vandalism besides as has been pointed out beforeshuttleport three security is not in your chain of command mr van atta he glanced significantly at his boss who stood listening and pulling worriedly on a strand of hair escaped from her sleek coiffure true she agreed the habitat may be your problem mr van atta but this jumpship hijacking is clearly under my jurisdiction regardless of their connections and theres still a cargo shuttle docked up there thats mine too though the transfer station reported they picked up its crew from a life pod van atta stood fuming blocked blocked by the damned women it had been chalopins buttons yei had been aiming for he realized suddenly and shed scored a hit too thats it then he said through his teeth at last well bounce it to hq and then well see whos in charge here dr yei closed her eyes briefly as if in relief at a word from chalopin a comm tech began readying his system for the relay of a scrambled emergency message to district to be radioed at the speed of light to the wormhole station recorded and jumped through on the next available transport and radiorelayed again to its destination in the meantime said van atta to chalopin what are you going to do about your he drew the word out sarcastically hijacking proceed with caution she replied levelly we believe there is a hostage involved after all were not sure if all the galactech staff is off the habitat yet either put in dr yei van atta growled unable to contradict her but if there were still downsiders being held aboard senior management must surely realize the need for a swift and vigorous response he must call the transfer station next and get the final head count if all these dithering idiots were going to force him to sit on his hands for the next several days he could at least lay his plans for action when he was unleashed and he was certain he would be unleashed sooner or later he had not failed to read apmads underlying horror of the mutant quaddies when word of this mess finally arrived on her desk it would goose her three meters straight up in the air hostages or no hostagesvan attas eyes narrowed hey he said suddenly were not as helpless as you think two can play that gamei have a hostage too you do said dryei puzzled then her hand went to her throat damn straight and to think i almost forgot that fourarmed geek tony is down here tony was grafs teachers petand that little cunt claires favorite prick and she was surely a ringleaderif she couldnt swing this to his advantage he was dead in the head he spun on his heel come on yei those little suckers are going to answer our calls now jump pilots might swear their ships were beautiful but really leo thought as the d heaved silently into view the superjumper looked like nothing so much as a mutant mechanical squid a podlike section at the front end contained the control room and crew quarters protected from the material hazards encountered during acceleration by an oblate laminated shield and from the hazards of radiation by an invisible magnetic cone arcing out behind trailed four enormously long mutually braced arms two housed normal space thrusters two housed the heart of the ships purpose the necklin field generator rods that spun the ship through wormhole space during a jump between the four arms was a huge empty space normally occupied by cargo pods the bizarre ship would look more sensible when that space was filled with habitat modules leo decided at that point he would even break down and call it beautiful himself with a jerk of his chin leo called up a vid of his worksuits power and supply levels displayed on the inside of his faceplate he would have just time to see the first module bundle pushed into place and attached before being forced to take a break and restock his suit not that he hadnt been ready for a break hours ago he blinked sand and water from his itching nodoubtbloodshot eyes wishing he could rub them and sucked another mouthful of hot cofifee from his drink tube he wanted fresh cofifee too the stuff he was drinking now had been out here as long as he had and was growing just as chemically vile opaque and greenish the d sidled near the habitat matching velocities precisely and shut down its engines the flight lights blinked out and the parking lights signalling that it was safe to approach flicked on banks of floods suddenly illuminated the vast cargo space as if to say welcome aboard leos gaze strayed to the crews section dwarfed by the arcing arms from the corner of his eye he saw a personnel pod peel away from the superjumpers starboard side and ferry off toward the habitat modules somebody heading homesilver ti he had to talk to ti as soon as possible a previously unrealized knot unwound in his stomach silvers back safe he caught himself up everybody was back but not safe yet he activated his suit jets and caught up with his quaddie crew thirty minutes later leos heart eased as the first module bundle slid smoothly into place in the ds embrace in a minor nightmare undispelled by checking and rechecking his figures hed envisioned something not fitting followed by endless delays for correction the fact that theyd heard nothing from downside yet apart from repeated pleas for communication did not reassure him much galactech management on rodeo had to respond eventually and there wasnt a thing he could do to counter that response until it shaped itself rodeos apparent paralysis couldnt last much longer meanwhile it was half past breaktime maybe dr minchenko could be persuaded to disgorge something for his throbbing head to replace the eight hours sleep he wasnt going to get leo punched up his work gang leaders channel on his suit comm bobbi take over as foreman im going inside pramod bring in your team as soon as that last strap is bolted down bobbi be sure that second module bundle is tied in solid before you adjust and seal all the end airlocks right yes leo im on it bobbi waved acknowledgement from the far end of the module bundle with a lower arm as leo turned away one of the oneman minipushers that had helped tug the module bundle into place detached itself and rotated preparing to thrust away and help the next bundle already being aligned beyond the superjumper one of its attitude jets puffed then even as leo watched emitted a sudden intense blue stream its rotation picked up speed thats uncontrolled leo thought his eyes widening in the bare moment it took him to call up the right channel on his suit comm the rotation became a spin the pusher jetted off wildly missing colliding with a worksuited quaddie by a scant meter as leo watched in horror it caromed off a nacelle on one of the superjumpers necklin rod arms and tumbled into space beyond the comm channel from the pusher emitted a wordless scream leo bounced channels vatel he called the quaddie manning the nearest other little pusher go after her the second pusher rotated and sped past him he saw the flash of one of vatels gloved hands visually acknowledging the order through the pushers wideangle front viewport leo restrained a heartwrenching urge to jet after them himself damn little he could do in a powerdepleted worksuit it was up to vatel had it been humanor quaddieerror or a mechanical defect that had caused the accident well he would be able to tell quickly enough once the pusher was retrieved if the pusher was retrieved he squelched that thought instead he jetted over to the necklin rod nacelle the nacelle housing was deeply dented where the pusher had collided with it leo tried to reassure himself its only a housing its put there just to protect the guts from accidents like this right hissing in dismay he pulled himself around to shine his worksuit light into the manhigh dark aperture at one end of the housing oh god the vortex mirror was cracked over three meters wide at its elliptical lip mathematically shaped and polished to angstromunit precision it was an integral control surface of the jump system reflecting bleeding or amplifying the necklin field generated by the main rods at the will of the pilot not just crackedshattered in a starry burst cold titanium deformed past its limits leo moaned a second light shone in past him leo glanced around to find pramod at his shoulder is that as bad as it looks pramods voice choked over the suit comm yes sighed leo you cantdo a welded repair on those can you pramods voice was rising what are we going to do fatigue and fear the worst possible combinationleo kept his own tired voice flat my suit supplylevel readout says were going to go inside and take a break right now after that well see to leos immense relief by the time he had unsuited vatel had retrieved the errant pusher and brought it back to dock at its habitat module they unloaded a frightened bruised quaddie pilot it locked on i couldnt get it off she wept what did i hit did i hit somebody i didnt want to dump the fuel it was the only way i could think of to kill the jet im sorry i wasted it i couldnt shut it off she was leo guessed all of fourteen years old how long have you been on work shift he demanded since we started she sniffed she was shaking all four of her hands trembling as she hung in air sideways to him he resisted an urge to straighten her up good god child thats over hours straight go take a break eat something and go sleep she looked at him in bewilderment but the dorm units are all cut off and bundled with the creches i cant get there from here is that why look threefourths of the habitat is inaccessible right now stake out a corner of the suit locker room or anywhere you can find he gazed at her tears in bafflement a moment then added its allowed she clearly wanted her own familiar sleep sack which leo was in no position to supply all by myself she said in a very small voice shed probably never slept with less than seven other kids in the room in her life leo reflected he took a deep controlling breathhe would not start screaming at her no matter how wonderfully it would relieve his own feelingshow had he gotten sucked into this childrens crusade anyway he could not at the moment recall come along he took her by the hand off to the locker room found a laundry bag to hook to the wall and helped stuff her into it along with a packaged sandwich her face peered from the opening making him feel for a weird moment like a man in process of drowning a sack of kittens there he forced a smile all better huh thank you leo she sniffed im sorry about the pusher and the fuel well take care of it he winked heroically get some sleep huh therell still be plenty of work to do when you wake up youre not going to miss anything uh nightynight night in the corridor he rubbed his hands over his face nng threefourths of the habitat inaccessible it was more like ninetenths by now and all the module bundles were running on emergency power waiting to be reattached to the main power supply as they were loaded into the superjumper it was vital to the safety and comfort of those trapped aboard various subunits that the habitat be fully reconfigured and made operational as swiftly as possible not to mention everyones having to start to learn their way around a new maze multiple compromises had driven the designcreche units for example could go in an interior bundle docks and locks had to be positioned facing out into space some garbage vents were unavoidably cut off power mods had to be positioned just so the nutrition units now serving some three thousand meals a day required certain lands of access to storage getting everyones routines readjusted was going to be an unholy mess for a while even assuming all the module bundles were loaded in rightsideup and attached headendround when leo wasnt personally supervisingor even when he was watching leo admitted to himself his face was numb and now the kickerquestionshould they continue loading at all onto a superjumper that was just possibly fatally disabled the vortex mirror god why couldnt she have rammed one of the normal space thruster arms why couldnt she have run over leo himself leo called a familiar male voice floating down the corridor his arms crossed angrily came the jump pilot ti gulik silver starfished from handgrip to handgrip behind him trailed by pramod gulik grabbed a grip and swung to a halt beside leo leos gaze crossed silvers in a frustratingly brief and silent hello before the jump pilot pinned him to the wall what have your damned quaddies done to my necklin rods sputtered ti we go to all this trouble to catch this ship bring it here and practically the first thing you do is start smashing it upi barely got it parked his voice faded pleasetell me that little mutant he waved at pramod got it wrong leo cleared his throat one of the pusher attitude jets apparently got stuck in an on position throwing the pusher into an uncontrollable spin the term unpreventable accident is not in my vocabulary but it certainly wasnt the quaddies fault huh said ti well at least youre not trying to pin it on the pilot but what was the damage really the rod itself wasnt hit ti let out a relieved breath but the portside titanium vortex mirror was smashed tis breath became a howl in a minor key thats just as bad calm down maybe not quite as bad i have one or two ideas yet i wanted to talk to you anyway when we took over the habitat there was a freight shuttle in dock ti eyed him suspiciously lucky you so planning not luck something silver doesnt know yet leo caught her eye she braced herself visibly soberly intent upon his words we werent able to get tony back before we took over the habitat hes still in hospital downside on rodeo oh no silver whispered is there any way leo rubbed his aching forehead maybe im not sure its good military thinkingthe precedent had to do with sheep i believebut i dont think i could live with myself if we didnt at least try to get him back dr minchenko has also promised to go with us if we can somehow pick up madame minchenko shes downside too dr minchenko stayed silver clapped her hands clearly thrilled oh good only if we retrieve the madame leo cautioned so thats two reasons to chance a downside foray we have a shuttle we have a pilot oh no began ti now wait a minute and we desperately need a spare part if we can locate a vortex mirror in a rodeo warehouse you wont ti cut in firmly jumpship repairs are handled solely by the district orbital yards at orient iv everythings warehoused on that end i know cause we had a problem once and had to wait four days for a repair crew to arrive from there rodeos got nothing to do with superjumpers nothing he crossed his arms i was afraid of that said leo lowly well theres one other possibility we could try to fabricate a new one here on the spot ti looked like a man sucking on a lemon graf you dont weld those things together out of scrap iron i know damn well they make em all in one piecesomething about joins impeding the field flowand that suckers three meters wide at the top end the thing they stamp them out with weighs multi tons and the precision requiredit would take you six months to put a project like that together leo gulped and held up both hands fingers spread had he been a quaddie he might have been tempted to double the estimate but ten hours he said sure id like to have six months downside in a foundry with a monster alloysteel press die machined to the millimicron just like the big boys and mass watercooling and a team of assistants and unlimited fundingid be all set up to make ten thousand units but we dont need ten thousand units there is another way a quickanddirty oneshot but one shots all were going to have time for but i cant be up here refabricating a vortex mirror and down there rescuing tony both at the same time the quaddies cant go i need you ti id have needed you to pilot the shuttle in any case now ill just need you to do a little more look you ti began theory was i was going to get out of this with a whole skin cause galactech would think i was kidnapped and had jumped you out with a gun to my head a nice simple believable scenario this is getting too damned complicated even if i could pull off a stunt like that theyre not going to believe i did it under duress what would keep me from flying downsideand just turning myself in thats the sort of questions theyll be asking you can bet your ass no dammit not for love nor money i know leo growled weve offered both ti glared at him but ducked his head to evade silvers eyes a thin young voice was echoing down the corridor leo leo here leo answered what now one of the younger quaddies swung into sight and darted toward them leo weve been looking all over for you come quick what is it an urgent message on the comm from downside were not answering their messages total blackout remember the less information we give them the longer its going to take them to figure out what to do about us but its tony leos guts knotted and he lurched after the messenger silver pale and the others followed hot behind the holovid solidified showing a hospital bed tony was braced against the raised backrest looking directly into the vid he wore tshirt and shorts a white bandage around his left lower bicep a thick stiffness to his torso hinting at wrappings beneath his face was furrowed flushed over a pale underlay his blue eyes shifted nervously whiterimmed like a frightened ponys to the right of his bed where bruce van atta stood took you long enough to answer your call graf van atta said smirking unpleasantly leo swallowed hard hullo tony we havent forgotten you up here claire and andy are all right and back together youre here to listen graf not talk van atta interrupted he fiddled with a control there ive just cut your audio so you can save your breath all right tony van atta prodded the quaddie with a silvercolored rodwhat was it leo wondered fearfullysay your piece tonys gaze shifted back to the silent vid image leo guessed and his eyes widened urgently he took a deep breath and began gabbling whatever youre doing leo keep doing it never mind about me get claire awayget andy away the holovid blacked out abruptly although the audio channel remained open a moment longer it emitted a strange spatting noise a scream and van atta swearing hold still you little shit before the sound cut off too leo found himself gripping one of silvers hands claire was on her way over silver said lowly to be in on this call leos eyes met hers i think youd better go divert her silver nodded grim understanding right she swung away the vid came back up tony was huddled silently in the far corner of the bed head down hands over his face van atta stood glaring rocking furiously on his heels the kids a slow learner evidently van atta snarled to leo id make it short and clear graf you may hold hostages but if you so much as touch em you can be swung in any court in the galaxy ive got a hostage i can do anything i want to legally and if you dont think i will just try me now were going to be sending a security shuttle up there in a little while to restore order and you will cooperate with it he held up the silvery rod pressed something leo saw an electric spark spit from its tip this is a simple device but i can get real creative with it if you force me to dont force me to leo nobodys forcing you to leo began ah van atta interrupted just a minute he touched his holovid control now talk sos i can hear you and it had better be something i want to hear nobody here can force you to do anything leo grated whatever you do you do of your own free will we dont have any hostages what we have is three volunteers who chose to stay forfor their consciences sake i guess if minchenkos one of them youd better watch your back leo conscience hell he wants to hang onto his own little empire youre a fool graf here he made a motion offvid come talk to him in his own language yei dr yei stepped stiffly into view met leos eyes and moistened her lips mr graf please stop this madness what you are trying to do is incredibly dangerous for all concerned van atta illustrated this by waving the electric prod over her head with a sour grin she glanced at him in irritation but said nothing and plowed on grimly surrender now and the damage can at least be minimized please for everyones sake you have the power to stop this leo was silent for a moment then leaned forward dr yei im fortyfive thousand kilometers up youre there in the same room you stop him he flicked the holovid off and floated in numb silence is that wise choked ti uncertainly leo shook his head dont know but without an audience theres no reason to carry on a show surely was that acting how far will that guy really go in the past ive known him to have a pretty uncontrolled temper when he got wound up an appeal to his selfinterest usually unwound him but as youve realized yourself the um career rewards in this mess are minimal i dont know how far hell go i dont think even he knows after a long pause ti said do you ahstill need a shuttle pilot leo chapter silver clutched the arms of the shuttle copilots seat tightly in mixed exhilaration and fear her lower hands curled over the seats front edge seeking purchase deceleration and gravity yanked at her she spared a hand to doublecheck the latch of the shoulderharness snugging her in as the shuttle altered its attitude to nosedown and the ground heaved into view red desert mountains rocky and forbidding wrinkled and buckled below them passing faster and faster as they dropped closer ti sat beside her in the commanders chair his hands and feet barely moving the controls in tiny constant corrections eyes flicking from readout to readout and then to the real horizon totally absorbed the atmosphere roared over the shuttles skin and the craft rocked violently in some passing wind shear silver began to see why leo despite his expressed anguish at the risk to them all of losing ti downside had not substituted zara or one of the other pusher pilots in tis stead even barring the foot pedals landing on a planet was definitely a discipline apart from jetting about in free fall especially in a vehicle nearly the size of a habitat module theres the dry lake bed ti nodded forward addressing her without taking his eyes from his work right on the horizon will it bevery much harder than landing on a shuttleport runway silver asked in worry no problem ti smiled if anything its easier its a big puddleits one of our emergency alternate landing sites anyway just avoid the gullies at the north end and were home free oh said silver reassured i hadnt realized youd landed out here before well i havent actually ti murmured not having had an emergency yet he sat up more intently taking a tighter grip on the controls and silver decided perhaps she would not distract him with further conversation just now she peeked around the edge of her seat at dr minchenko holding down the engineers station behind them to see how he was taking all this his return smile was sardonic as if to tease her for her anxiety but she noticed his hand checking his seat straps too the ground rushed up from below silver was almost sorry they had not after all waited for the cover of night to make this landing at least she wouldnt have been able to see her death coming she could of course close her eyes she closed her eyes but opened them again almost immediately why miss the last experience of ones life she was sorry leo had never made a pass at her he must suffer from stress accumulation too surely faster and faster the shuttle bumped bounced banged rocked and roared out over the flat cracked surface she was sorry she had never made a pass at leo clearly you could die while waiting for other people to start your life for you her seat harness cut across her breasts as deceleration sucked her forward and the rumbling vibration rattled her teeth not quite as smooth as a runway ti shouted grinning and sparing her a bright glance at last but good enough for company work all right so nobody else was gibbering in terror maybe this was the way a landing was supposed to be they rolled to a quite demure stop in the middle of nowhere toothed carmine mountains ringed an empty horizon silence fell well said ti here we are he released his harness with a snap and turned to dr minchenko struggling up out of the engineers seat now what where is she if you would be good enough said dr minchenko to provide us with an exterior scan a view of the horizon scrolled slowly several times through a monitor as the minutes ticked by in silvers brain the gravity silver discovered was not nearly so awful as claire had described it it was much like the time spent under acceleration on the way to the wormhole only very still and without vibration or like at the transfer station only stronger it would have helped if the design of the seat had matched the design of her body what if rodeo traffic control saw us land she said what if galactech gets here first its more frightening to think traffic control might have missed us said ti as for who gets here firstwell dr minchenko mm he said glumly then he brightened leaned forward and froze the scan and put his finger on a small smudge in the screen perhaps kilometers distant dust devil said ti plainly trying to control his hopes the smudge focused land rover said dr minchenko smiling in satisfaction oh good girl the smudge grew into a boiling vortex of orange dust spun up behind a speeding land rover five minutes later the vehicle braked to a halt beside the shuttles forward hatchway the figure under the dusty bubble canopy paused to adjust a breath mask then the bubble swung up and the side ramp swung down dr minchenko adjusted his own breath mask firmly over his nose and followed by ti rushed down the shuttle stairs to assist the frail silverhaired woman who was struggling with an assortment of oddshaped packages she gave them all up to the men with evident gladness but for a thick black case shaped rather like a spoon which she clutched to her bosom in much the same way silver thought as claire clutched andy dr minchenko shepherded his lady anxiously upward toward the airlockher knees moved stiffly on the stairsand through where they could at last pull down their masks and speak clearly are you all right warren madame minchenko asked perfectly he assured her i could bring almost nothingi scarcely knew what to choose think of the vast amounts of money we shall save on shipping charges then silver was fascinated by the way gravity gave form to madame minchenkos dress it was a warm dark fabric with a silver belt at the waist and hung in soft folds about her booted ankles the skirt swirled as madame minchenko stepped echoing her agitation its utter madness were too old to become refugees i had to leave my harpsichord dr minchenko patted her sympathetically on the shoulder it wouldnt work in free fall anyway the little pluckers fall back into place by gravity his voice cracked with urgency but theyre trying to kill my quaddies ivy yes yes i understand madame minchenko twitched a somewhat strained and absent smile at silver who hung onehanded from a strap listening you must be silver yes madame minchenko said silver breathlessly in her mostpolitest voice this woman was quite the most aged downsider silver had ever seen bar dr minchenko and dr cay himself we must go now to get tony dr minchenko said well be back as quick as we can drive silver will help you shes very good hold the ship the two men hustled back out and within moments the land rover was boiling off across the barren landscape silver and madame minchenko were left regarding each other well said madame minchenko im sorry you had to leave all your things said silver diffidently hm well i cant say im sorry to be leaving here madame minchenkos glance around the shuttles cargo bay took in rodeo by implication they shuffled forward to the pilots compartment and sat the monitor scanned the monotonous horizon madame minchenko still clutched her giant spoon suitcase in her lap silver hitched herself around in her wrongshaped seat and tried to imagine what it would be like to be married to someone for more than twice the length of her own life had madame minchenko been young once surely dr minchenko had been old forever however did you come to be married to dr minchenko silver asked sometimes i wonder madame minchenko murmured dryly half to herself were you a nurse or a lab tech she looked up with a little smile no dear i was never a bioscientist thank god her hand caressed the black case im a musician of sorts silver perked with interest synthavids do you program weve had some synthavids in our library the company library that is the corner of madame minchenkos mouth twisted up in a halfsmile theres nothing synthetic in what i do im a registered historianperformer i keep old skills alivethink of me as a live museum exhibit somewhat in need of dustingonly a few spider webs clinging to my elbow she unlatched her case and opened it to silvers inspection burnished reddish wood satinsmooth caught and played back the colored lights of the pilots compartment madame minchenko lifted the instrument and tucked it under her chin its a violin ive seen pictures of them silver offered is it real madame minchenko smiled and drew her bow across the strings in a quick succession of notes the music ran up and down likelike quaddie children in the gym was the only simile silver could think of the volume was astounding where do those wires on top attach to the speakers silver inquired pushing up on her lower hands and craning her neck there are no speakers the sound all comes from the wood but it filled the compartment madame minchenkos smile became almost fierce this instrument could fill an entire concert hall do you play concerts once when i was very youngyour age maybe i went to a school that taught such skills the only school for music on my planet a colonial world you see not much time for the arts there was a competitionthe winner was to travel to earth and have a recording career which he subsequently did but the recording company underwriting the affair was only interested in the very best i came in second there is room for so very few her voice faded in a sigh i was left with a pleasing personal accomplishment that no one wanted to listen to not when they had only to plug in a disc to hear not just the best from my world but the best in the galaxy fortunately i met warren about then my permanent patron and audience of one probably as well i wasnt trying to make a career of it we moved so often in those days when he was finishing school and starting work with galactech ive done some teaching here and there to interested antiquarians she tilted her head at silver and did they teach you any music with all the things theyve been teaching you up on that satellite we learned some songs when we were little said silver shyly and then there were the flutetoots but they didnt last long flutetoots little plastic things you blew in they were real one of the crechemothers brought them up when i was about oh eight but then they sort of got all over the place and people were complaining about the um tooting so she had to take them all back i see warren never mentioned the flutetoots oh madame minchenkos eyebrows quirked ah what sort of songs oh silver drew breath and sang roy g biv roy g biv hes the color quaddie that the spectrum gives redorangeyellow green and blue indigo violet all for you she broke off flushing her voice sounded so wavery and weak compared to that astonishing violin i see said madame minchenko in a strangely choked voice her eyes danced though so silver didnt think she was offended oh warren she sighed the things you have to answer for may i silver began and stopped surely she would not be permitted to touch that lavish antique what if she forgot to hold onto it for a moment and the gravity pulled it from her hands try it madame minchenko finished her thought why not we appear to have a little time to kill here im afraid tut oh i used to protect this one it sat unplayed for years locked up in climatecontrolled vaults dead then of late i began to wonder what i was saving it for here now raise your chin so tuck so madame minchenko curled silvers fingers around the violins neck what nice long fingers you have dear and er what a lot of them i wonder what asked silver as madame minchenko trailed off hm oh i was just having a mental picture of a quaddie in free fall with a twelvestring guitar if you werent squashed into a chair as you are now you could bring that lower hand up it was a trick of the light perhaps of rodeos westering sun sinking toward the sawtoothed horizon and sending its red beams through the cabin windows but madame minchenkos eyes seemed to gleam now arch your fingers so fire the first problem had been to find enough pure scrap titanium around the habitat to add to the mass of the ruined vortex mirror to allow for the inevitable losses during refabrication a fortypercent extra mass margin would have been enough for leo to feel comfortable with there ought to have been titanium storage tanks for nasty corrosive liquidsa single say hundredliter tank would have done the trickconduits valves something for the first desperate hour of scrounging leo was convinced his plan would come to grief right there in step one then he found it in of all places nutrition a cooler full of titanium storage canisters massing a good halfkilo apiece their varied contents were hastily dumped into every substitute container leo and his quaddie raiders could find cleanup leo had called guiltily over his shoulder to the appalled quaddie girl now running nutrition is left as an exercise for the student the second problem had been to find a place to work pramod had pointed out one of the abandoned habitat modules a cylinder some four meters in diameter it was the work of another two hours to tear holes in the side for entry and pack one end of it with all the conductive scrap metal mass they could find the mass was then surfaced with more abandoned habitat module skin pounded out and rendered as nearly glasssmooth as they could make it in a shallow concave bowl of carefully calculated arc that spanned the diameter of the module now their mass of scrap titanium hung weightless in the center of the module the brokenup pieces of the vortex mirror and the flattenedout food canisters were all bound together by a spool of pure titanium wire some brilliant quaddie child had produced for them out of stores the dense grey metal glittered and glowed in their worklights and the reflection from a shaft of hardedged sunlight falling through one of their entry holes leo glanced around the chamber one last time four worksuited quaddies each manned a laser unit braced around the walls bracketing the titanium mass leos measuring instruments floated tethered to his belt ready to his pressuregloved hands it was time leo touched his helmet control darkening his faceplate commence firing said leo into his suit comm four beams of laser light lanced out in unison pouring into the scrap for the first few minutes nothing appeared to be happening then it began to glow dark red bright red yellow whitethen visibly one of the exfood canisters began to sag flowing into the jumble the quaddies continued to pour in the energy the mass was beginning to drift slightly one of leos readouts told him although the effect was not yet visible to the naked eye unit four powerup about ten percent leo instructed one of the quaddies flashed a lower palm in acknowledgement and touched his control box the drift stopped good his bracketing was working leo had had a horrid vision of the molten mass of metal drifting off into the side wall or worse fatally brushing into somebody but the very beams that melted it seemed enough to control its motion at least in the absence of stronger sources of momentum now the melt was obvious the metal becoming a white glowing blob of liquid floating in the vacuum struggling toward the shape of a perfect sphere boy is that stuff ever going to be pure when were done leo reflected with satisfaction he checked his monitoring devices now they were coming up on a moment of critical judgment when to stop they must pour in enough energy to achieve an absolutely uniform melt no funny lumps left in the middle of the gravy but not too much even though it was not visible to the eye leo knew there was metal vapor pouring off that bubble now part of his calculated loss more importantly looking ahead to the next stepevery kilocalorie they dumped into that titanium mass was going to have to be brought back out planetside the shape he was trying to get would have been formed against a copper mold with lots and lots of water to carry away the heat at the desired rate in this case rapidly singlecrystal splatcooling it was called well at least hed figured out how to achieve the splat part of it cease firing leo ordered and there it hung their sphere of molten metal bluewhite with the violent heat energy contained within it perfect leo checked and rechecked its centered position and had laser number two give it one more halfsecond blast not for melt but for momentums sake all right said leo into his suit comm now lets get everything out of this module thats going out and doublecheck everything thats staying last thing we need now is for somebody to drop his wrench in the soup pot right leo joined the quaddies in shoving their equipment unceremoniously out the holes torn in the side of the module two of his laser operators went with it two stayed with leo leo checked centering again and then they all strapped themselves to the walls leo switched channels in his suit comm ready zara he called ready leo the quaddie pilot responded from her pusher now attached to the gutted modules stern now remember slow and gentle does it but firm pretend your pusher is a scalpel and youre just about to operate on one of your friends or something right leo there was a grin in her voice dont swagger girl leo prayed inwardly go when youre ready going hang on up there there was at first no perceivable change then leos harness straps began to tug gently at him it was the habitat module not the molten ball of titanium that was moving leo reminded himself the metal did not drift it was the back wall that moved forward and engulfed it it was working by god it was working the metal bubble touched the back wall spread out and settled into its shallow bowl mold increase acceleration by the first increment leo called into his comm the pusher powered up and the molten titanium circle spread its edges growing toward the desired diameter some three meters wide already losing its bright glow creating a titanium blank of controlled thickness ready after cooling for explosive molding into its final subtle form steady on that does it splatcooling well not exactly leo was uncomfortably aware that they were probably not going to achieve a perfect internal singlecrystal freeze but it would be good good enoughas long as it was good enough that they didnt have to melt it down and start all over again that was the most leo dared pray for they might barely have time to make one of these suckers not two and when was the threatened response from rodeo arriving soon surely he wondered briefly what the new gravity technology was going to do to fabrication problems in space like this revolutionize seemed too mild a term certainly too bad we didnt have some now he thought stillhe grinned concealed within his helmetthey were doing all right he pointed his temperature gauge at the back wall the piece was cooling almost as rapidly as he had hoped they were still due for a couple of hours of driving around until it had dumped enough heat to remove from the wall and handle without danger of deformation all right bobbi im leaving you and zara in charge here leo said its looking good when the temperature drops to about five hundred degrees centigrade bring it on back well try to be ready for the final cooling and the second phase of the shaping carefully trying not to add excess vibration to the walls leo loosed his harness and climbed to the exit hole from this distance he had a fine view of the d now more than half loaded and rodeo beyond better go now before the view became more distant than his suit jets could close he activated his jets and zipped quickly away from the side of the stillgentlyaccelerating moduleandpusher unit it chugged off looking a drunken juryrigged wreck indeed concealing hope in its heart leo aimed toward the habitat and phase ii of his jumpshipsrepairedwhileuwait scheme it was sunset on the dry lake bed silver gazed anxiously into the monitor in the shuttle control cabin as it swept the horizon brightening and darkening each time the red ball of the sun rolled past they cant possibly be back for at least another hour madame minchenko watching her pointed out in the best case thats not who im looking for answered silver hm madame minchenko drummed her long agesculptured fingers on the console unlatched and tilted back the copilots seat and stared thoughtfully at the cabin roof no i suppose not stillif galactech traffic control saw you land and sent out a jetcopter to investigate they should have been here before now perhaps they missed your landing after all perhaps theyre just not very organized suggested silver and theyll be along any minute madame minchenko sighed all too likely she regarded silver pursing her lips and what are you supposed to do in that case i have a weapon silver touched the lasersolderer lying seductively on the console before the pilotcommanders seat in which she sprawled but id rather not shoot anybody else not if i can help it anybody else there was a shade more respect in madame minchenkos voice shooting people was such a stupid activity why should everybodyanybodybe so impressed silver wondered irritably you would think she had done something truly great like discover a new treatment for black stemrot her mouth tightened then her lips parted and she leaned forward to stare into the monitor oh oh here comes a ground car not our boys already surely said madame minchenko in some unease has something gone wrong i wonder its not your land rover silver fiddled with the resolution the slanting sunlight poured through the dust turning it into a glowing red smokescreen i think its a galactech security groundcar oh dear madame minchenko sat up straight now what we dont open the hatches anyway no matter what in a few minutes the groundcar pulled up about fifty meters from the shuttle an antenna rose from its roof and quivered demandingly silver switched on the commit was so irritating not to have the full use of her lower armsand called up a menu of the comm channels from the computer the shuttle seemed to have access to an inordinate number of them security audio was she tuned them in by god hey you in thereanswer yes what do you want said silver there was a spluttery pause why didnt you answer i didnt know you were calling me silver answered logically yeah wellthis freight shuttle is the property of galactech so am i so what eh look lady this is sergeant fors of galactech security you have to disembark and turn this shuttle over to us a voice in the background not quite sufficiently muffled inquired hey berndyou think well get the ten percent bonus for recovering stolen property on this one dream on growled another voice nobodys gonna give us a quarter million madame minchenko held up a hand and leaned forward to cut in quavering young man this is ivy minchenko my husband dr minchenko has commandeered this craft in order to respond to an urgent medical emergency not only is this his right its his legally compelled dutyand you are required by galactech regulation to assist not hinder him a somewhat baffled growl greeted this im required to take this shuttle back those are my orders nobody told me anything about any medical emergency well im telling you the background voice again its just a couple of women come on the sergeant are you going to open the hatch lady silver did not respond madame minchenko raised an inquiring eyebrow and silver shook her head silently madame minchenko sighed and nodded the sergeant repeated his demands his voice frayinghe stopped just short silver felt of degenerating into obscenities after a minute or two he broke off after a few more minutes the doors of the ground car winged up and the three men now wearing breath masks clambered out to stamp over and stare up at the hatches of the shuttle high over their heads they returned to the groundcar got init circled going away silver hoped against hope no it came up and parked again under the forward shuttle hatch two of the men rummaged in the back for tools then climbed to the cars roof theyve got some kind of cutting things said silver in alarm they must be going to try to cut their way in banging reverberated through the shuttle madame minchenko nodded toward the lasersolderer is it time for that she asked fearfully silver shook her head unhappily no not again besides i cant let them damage the ship eitherits got to stay spaceworthy or we cant get home she had watched ti she inhaled deeply and reached for the shuttle controls the foot pedals were hopelessly awkward to grope for she would have to get along without them right engine activate left engine activatea purr ran through the ship brakesthere surely she pulled the lever gently to the release position nothing happened then the shuttle lurched forward frightened at the abrupt motion silver hit the brake lever again and the ship rocked to a halt she searched the outside monitors wildly where the shuttles starboard airfoil had swept over the roof of the security groundcar missing it by half a meter silver realized with a guilty shudder that she should have checked its height before she began to move she might have torn the wing right off with ghastly chaining consequences to them all the security guards were nowhere to be seenno there they were scattered out onto the dry lake bed one picked himself up out of the dirt and started back toward the groundcar now what if she parked or even rolled some distance and parked they would only try again it couldnt take too many more attempts till they got smart and shot out the shuttles tires or otherwise immobilized it a dangerously unstable standoff silver sucked on her lower lip then leaning forward awkwardly in a seat never designed for quaddies she released the brakes partway and powered up the port engine the shuttle shuddered a few meters farther forward skidding and yawing behind them the monitor showed the groundcar half obscured by orange dust kicked by the exhaust its image wavering in the heat of it she set the brakes as hard as they would go and powered up the port engine yet more its purr became a whineshe dared not bring it to the howling pitch ti had used during landing who knew what would happen then the groundcars plastic canopy cracked in a crazed starburst and began to sag if leo had been right in his description of that hydrocarbon fuel they used downside here for their vehicles in just a second more she ought to get a yellow fireball engulfed the groundcar momentarily brighter than the setting sun pieces flew off in all directions arcing and bouncing fantastically in the gravity field a glance at her monitors showed silver the security men now all running in the other direction silver powered down the port engine released the brakes and let the shuttle roll forward across the hardbaked mud fortunately the old lake bed was quite uniform so she didnt have to worry about the fine points of shuttle operation such as steering one of the security men ran after them for a minute or two waving his arms but he fell behind quickly she let the shuttle roll on for a couple of kilometers braked again and shut the engines off well she sighed that takes care of them it certainly does said madame minchenko faintly adjusting the monitor magnification for a last glance behind a column of black smoke and a dying orange glow in the distant gathering dusk marked their former parking place i hope all their breath masks were well filled silver added oh dear said madame minchenko perhaps we ought to go back and do something surely theyll have the sense to stay with their car and wait for help though and not try to walk off into the desert the company safety vids always emphasize that stay with your vehicle and wait for search and rescue arent they supposed to be search and rescue silver studied the tiny images in the monitor not much vehicle left but they all three seem to be staying there well she shook her head its too dangerous for us to try and pick them up but when ti and the doctor get back with tony maybe the security guards could have your land rover to go home in if um nobody else gets here first oh said madame minchenko thats true good idea i feel much better she peered reflectively into the monitor poor fellows ice leo watched from the sealed control booth overlooking the habitat freight bay as four worksuited quaddies eased the intact vortex mirror taken from the ds second necklin rod through the hatch from outside the mirror was an awkward object to handle in effect an enormous shallow titanium funnel three meters in diameter and a centimeter thick at its broad lip mathematically curved and thickening to about two centimeters at the central closed dip a lovely curve but definitely nonstandard a fact leos refabrication ploy must needs cope with the undamaged mirror was jockeyed into place nested into a squiggle of freezer coils the spacesuited quaddies exited from the control booth leo sealed the outside hatch and set the air to pump back into the loading bay in his anxiety leo literally popped out of the control booth with a whoosh of air from the remaining pressure differential and had to work his jaw to clear his ears the only freezer coils big enough to be adequate to the task had been found by bobbi in a moment of inspiration once more in nutrition the quaddie girl running the department had moaned when she saw leo and his work gang approach again they had ruthlessly ripped the guts out of her biggest freezer compartment and carried them off to their work space in the largest available docking module now installed as part of the d less than a quarter of the final habitat reassembly was left to go leo estimated despite the fact that hed pulled a dozen of the best workers onto this project in a few minutes three of his quaddies joined leo in the freight bay leo checked them over they were bundled up in extra tshirts and shorts and longsleeved coveralls left by the evicted downsiders with the legs wrapped tight to their lower arms and secured by elastic bands they had scrounged enough gloves to go around good leo had been worried about frostbite with all those exposed fingers his breath smoked in the chilled air all right pramod were ready to roll bring up the water hoses pramod unrolled several lengths of tubing and gave them to the waiting quaddies another quaddie ran a final check of their connections to the nearest water spigot leo switched on the freezer coils and took a hose all right kids watch me and ill show you the trick of it you must bleed the water slowly onto the cold surfaces avoiding splash into the air at the same time you must keep it going constantly enough so that your hoses dont freeze up if you feel your fingers going numb take a short break in the next chamber we dont need any injuries out of this leo turned to the backside of the vortex mirror nestled among but not touching the freezer coils the mirror had been in the shade for the last several hours outside and was good and cold now he thumbed his valve and let a silvery blob of water flow onto the mirrors surface it spread out in swift feathers of ice he tried some drops on the coils they froze even faster all right just like that start building up the ice mold around the mirror make it as solid as you can no air pockets dont forget to place the little tube to let the air evacuate from the die chamber later how thick should it be asked pramod following suit with his hose and watching in fascination as the ice formed at least one meter at a minimum the mass of the ice must be equal to the mass of the metal since weve only got one shot at this well go for at least twice the mass of the metal we arent going to be able to recover any of this water unfortunately i want to doublecheck our water reserves because two meters thick would certainly be better if we can spare it however did you think of this asked pramod in an awed tone leo snorted as he realized pramod had the impression that he was making this entire engineering procedure up out of his head in the heat of the moment i didnt invent it i read about it its an old method they used to use for preliminary test designs before fractal theory was perfected and computer simulations improved to todays standards oh pramod sounded rather disappointed leo grinned if you ever have to make a choice between learning and inspiration boy choose learning it works more of the time ihope critically leo drew back and watched his quaddies work pramod had two hoses one in each set of hands and was rapidly alternating between them blob after blob of water flowing onto the coils and the mirror the ice already starting to thicken visibly so far he hadnt lost a drop leo heaved a weary sigh of relief it seemed he could safely delegate this part of the task he gave pramod a high sign and left the bay to pursue a part of the job he dared not delegate to anyone else leo got lost twice threading his way through the habitat to toxic stores and hed designed the reconfiguration himself it was no wonder he passed so many bewilderedlooking quaddies on the way everyone seemed frantically busy on the principle of miserylovescompany leo could only approve toxic stores was a chill module sharing no connections whatsoever with the rest of the habitat but a triplechambered and alwaysclosed airlock of thick steel leo entered to meet one of his own welding and joining gang quaddies still assigned to habitat reconfiguration on his way out hows it going agba leo asked him pretty good agba looked tired his tan face and skin were marked with red lines telltales of recent and prolonged time in his worksuit those stupid frozen clamps were really slowing us up but were just about to the end of them hows your thing going all right so far i came in to prepare the explosive were that far along do you remember where the devil in all this the modules curved walls were packed with supplies we keep the slurry explosive it was over there agba pointed good leos stomach shrank suddenly what do you mean was he only means its been moved leo suggested hopefully to himself well weve been using it up at a pretty good clip blowing open clamps blowing them open i thought you were cutting them off we were but then tabbi figured out how to pack a small charge that cracked them apart on the line of the vacuum fuse about half the time theyre reusable the other half theyre no more ruined than if wed cut em agba looked quite proud of himself you havent used it all for that surely well there was a little spillage outside of course agba misapprehending added in response to leos horrified look he held out a sealed halfliter flask to leos inspection this is the last of it i figure it will just about finish the job nng leos snatching hands closed around the bottle and clutched it to his stomach like a man smothering a grenade i need that i have to have it i have to have ten times that much his thought howled silently oh said agba sorry he gave leo a look of limpid innocence does this mean we have to go back to cutting clamps yes squeaked leo go he added yes before he exploded himself agba with an uncertain smile ducked back out the airlock it sealed leaving leo alone a moment to hyperventilate in peace think man think leo told himself dont panic there was something some elusive fact or factor in the back of his mind trying to tell him this wasnt the end but he could not at present recall unfortunately a careful mental review of his calculations keeping track on his fingers oh to be a quaddie only confirmed his initial fear the explosive fabrication of the titanium blank into the complex shape of the vortex mirror required besides an assortment of spacers rings and clamps three main parts the ice die the metal blank and the explosive to marry the two shotgun wedding indeed and what is the most important leg of a threelegged stool the one that is missing of course and hed thought the slurry explosive was going to be the easy part forlorn leo began systematically going around the toxic stores module checking its contents an extra flask of slurry explosive might have been misplaced somewhere alas the quaddies were all too conscientious in their inventory control each bin contained only what its label proclaimed no more no less agba had even updated the label on the bin just now contents slurry explosive type b onehalf liter flasks quantity about this time leo stumbled literally over a barrel of gasoline no some six barrels of the damn stuff which had somehow washed up here now strapped firmly to the walls god knew where the rest of the hundred tons had gone leo wished it all in hell where it might at least be of some conceivable use he would gladly trade the whole hundred tons of it for four aspirins a hundred tons of gasoline of which leo blinked and let out an aaah of exultation of which a liter or so mixed with tetranitro methane would make an even more powerful explosive he would have to look it up to be surehe would have to look up the exact proportions in any casebut he was certain he had remembered aright learning and inspiration that was the best combination of all tetranitro methane was used as an emergency oxygen source in several habitat and pusher systems it yielded more o per cc than liquid oxygen without the temperature and pressure problems of storage in a highly refined version of the early tetranitro methane candles which when burned gave off oxygen nowoh godif only the tnm hadnt all been used by somebody toto blow up balloons for quaddie children or some damn thingthey had been losing air during the habitat reconfiguration pausing only to put the flask back in its bin and arrange a sign on the barrels reading in large red print this is leo grafs gasoline if anyone else touches it he will break all their arms he raced out of the toxic stores module and away to find the nearest working library computer terminal chapter twilight lingered on the dry lake bed the luminous bowl of the sky darkening gradually through a deep turquoise to a starflecked indigo silver found her attention constantly distracted from horizonscan by the entrancing color changes of the planetary atmosphere seen through the ports what subtle variety downsiders enjoyed bands of purple orange lemon green blue with cobalt feathers of water vapor melting in the western sky it was with some regret that silver switched the scan to infrared its computerenhanced colors gave clarity to her vision but seemed crude and garish after the real thing at last came the sight her heart desired a land rover bouncing over the distant hilly pass and skidding down the last rocky slopes then peeling out over the lake bed at maximum acceleration madame minchenko hurried out of the pilots compartment to let down the hatch stairs as the land rover roared to a halt beside the shuttle silver clapped all her hands with delight as she saw ti thump up the ramp burdened with tony clinging piggyback just as leo had carted her at the transfer station they got him they got him dr minchenko followed close behind there was a short argument back at the airlock doctor and madame minchenkos muffled voices then dr minchenko galloped back down the stairs to crack a cold flare and stick it to the land rovers roof it gave off a brilliant green glare good the stranded security guards should have no trouble seeing that beacon silver decided with some relief silver scrambled back across to the copilots seat as ti staggered into the pilots compartment dumped tony into the engineers seat and vaulted into the command chair he yanked his breath mask down around his neck with one hand while switching on controls with the other hey whos been messing with my ship silver turned and pulled herself up to look over the top of her seat at tony who had rid himself of his own breath mask and was trying to get his seat straps in order you made it she grinned he grinned back ust barry er right behin us his blue eyes silver realized were huge with pain as well as excitement his lips swollen what happened to you silver turned to ti what happened to tony that shit van atta burned him in the mouth with his damn cattle prod or whatever the hell that thing was he had said ti grimly his hands dancing over the controls the engines came alive lights flickered and the shuttle began to roll ti hit his intercom dr minchenko you folks strapped down back there yet just a moment came dr minchenkos reply there yes go did you have any trouble asked silver sliding back into her seat and groping for her own straps as the shuttle taxied not at first we got to the hospital all right walked right in with no problem i thought sure the nurses were going to question our taking tony but evidently they all think minchenko is god there we just blasted right through and were on our way out with me playing donkeythats all i am just transportation yknowwhen who should we meet going out the door but that sonofabitch van atta coming in silver gasped we tripped him updr minchenko wanted to stop and beat the shit out of him on account of tonys mouth but he would have had to delegate the most of it to mehe is an old man little though he wants to admit iti dragged him out to the land rover i last heard van atta running off screaming for a security jetcopter hes surely found one by now ti scanned the monitors nervously yes damn there he pointed a colorized flare swooped over the mountains marking the following copters position in the monitor well they cant catch us now the shuttle rocked in a wide circle then halted the engines pitch rose from purr to whine to scream its white landing lights tunneled the darkness in front of them ti released the brakes and the ship sprang forward gobbling up the light with a terrifying noisy rumble that ceased abruptly as they rotated into the air the acceleration shoved them all back in their seats what the hell does that idiot think hes doing ti muttered through his teeth as the jetcopter grew rapidly in the tracking monitor try to play chicken with me will you it was swiftly apparent that was exactly the jetcopters intent it arced toward them diving as they rose evidently with some idea of forcing them down tis mouth thinned to a white line his eyes blazing and he powered his ship up further silver gritted her teeth but kept her eyes open they passed close enough to see the copter out the ports whipping in a strobelike flash through their lights in the blink silver could see faces through the bubble canopy frozen white blurs with dark round holes of eyes and mouths but for one individual possibly the pilot who had his hands pressed over his eyes then there was nothing between them and the silver stars fire and ice leo rechecked the tightness of every cclamp personally then jetted back a few meters in his worksuit to give his efforts one last visual inspection they floated in space a safe kilometers distance from the dhabitat configuration which hung huge and complete now above rodeos arc anyway it looked complete on the outside as long as you didnt know too much about the hysterical lastminute tiedowns still going on within the ice die when finished had turned out over three meters wide and nearly two meters thick its outer surface was irregular it might have been a tumbling bit of space debris from some gas giants ice ring its secret inner side precisely duplicated the smooth curve of the vortex mirror that had molded it the evacuated inner chamber was capped by layers first the titanium blank next a layer of pure gasoline for a spacera handy second use leo had found for it unlike other possible liquids it would not freeze at the ices present temperaturethen the thin plastic divider circle then his precious tnmgasoline explosive then a cap of scrap habitat skin then the bars and clampsall in all quite a birthday cake time to light the candle and make his wish come true before the ice die began to sublimate in the sunlight leo turned to motion his quaddie helpers to get behind the protective barrier of one of the abandoned habitat modules floating nearby another quaddie he saw was just jetting over from the dhabitat configuration leo waited a moment to give him or her time to come up and get behind their shelter not a messenger surely he had his suit comm for that hai leo said tonys voice thickly through the suit comm sorry im lae for workdyou leave any for me tony it wasnt easy trying to embrace someone through a worksuit but leo did his best hey hey youre just in time for the best part boy said leo excitedly i saw the shuttle dock a bit ago yes and a horrid turn it had given him for a moment thinking it was van attas threatened security force at last until hed correctly identified it as theirs didnt think dr minchenkod let you go anywhere but the infirmary is silver all right shouldnt you be resting shes fine dr minchenko had a lot t do n claire n andys asleepi looked indidnt want to wake the baby you sure youre feeling all right son your voice sounds funny hurt mah mout sall right ah briefly leo explained the task in progress youve arrived for the grand finale leo jockeyed his suit around until he could just see over the abandoned module what weve got out there in that box on topthe cherrybomb on the icing as it wereis a charge capacitor with a couple thousand volts stored in it leads down into a filament placed in the liquid explosivei used an incandescent light bulb filament with the polyglass envelope knocked offthat thing sticking up is an electric eye swiped from a door control when we hit it with a burst from this optical laser it closes the switch and the lectricity sets the exlosive off not exactly the high voltage pouring through the filament literally explodes the wire and its the shock wave from the exploding wire that sets off the tnm and gasoline which blows the titanium blank out until it hits the ice die and transfers its momentum whereupon the titanium stops and the ice ah carries the momentum away quite spectacularly which is why were behind this module he turned to check his quaddie crew everybody ready if you can stick your head up and watch why cant we complained pramod i have to have lineofsight for the laser said leo primly leo aimed the optical laser carefully and paused a moment for the anxiety rush so many things could go wronghed checked and recheckedbut there comes a time when one must let all the doubts go and commit to action he gave himself up to god and pressed the button a brilliant soundless flash a cloud of boiling vapor and the ice die exploded shards flying off in all directions the effect was utterly enchanting with an effort leo tore his gaze away and ducked hastily back behind the module the afterimage danced across his retinas teal green and magenta his pressuregloved hand resting against the modules skin transmitted sharp vibrations as a few highspeed ice cubes pelted against the other side and ricocheted off into space leo remained hunkered a moment staring rather blankly at rodeo now im afraid to look pramod jetted around the module its all in one piece anyway its tumblinghard to see the exact shape leo inhaled lets go catch it kids and see what weve got it was the work of a few minutes to capture the work piece leo refused to let himself call it the vortex mirror just yetit might still turn out to be scrap metal the quaddies ran their various scanners over the curving grey surface i cant find any cracks leo said pramod breathlessly its a few millimeters overthick in spots but nowhere too thin thick we can take care of during the final laserpolish thin we cant remedy ill take thick said leo bobbi waved her optical laser crossing and recrossing the curved surface numbers blurring in her digital readout its in spec leo its within spec we did it leos innards were melting wax he breathed a long and very tired sigh of happiness all right kids lets take it indoors back to thethedarn it we cant keep calling it the dand habitatreconfiguation ah sure cant agreed tony so what are we going to name it an assortment of possibilities flitted through leos mindthe arkthe freedom stargrafs folly home said tony simply after a moment lets go home leo home leo rolled the name in his mouth it tasted good it tasted very good pramod nodded and one of bobbis upper hands touched her helmet in salute of the choice leo blinked some irritating vapor in his suits air was making his eyes water no doubt and tightening his chest yeah lets take our vortex mirror home gang bruce van atta paused in the corridor outside chalopins office at shuttleport three to catch his breath and control his trembling he had a stitch in his side too he wouldnt be the least surprised if he were developing an ulcer out of all this the fiasco out on the dry lake bed had been infuriating to pave the way and then have fumbling subordinates totally fail himutterly infuriating sheer chance that having returned to his own downside quarters for a muchneeded shower and some sleep hed awakened to take a piss and called shuttleport three to check progress they might not even have told him about the shuttle landing otherwise anticipating grafs next move he had flung on his clothes and rushed to the hospitalif hed been moments sooner he might have trapped minchenko within he had already chewed out the jetcopter pilot reamed his ass for his cowardice in failing to force down the launching shuttle for his dilatory failure to arrive at the lake bed faster the redfaced pilot had clamped his jaw and his fists and said nothing doubtless properly ashamed of himself but the real failure lay higher upon the other side of these very office doors he jabbed the control and they slid aside chalopin her security captain bannerji and dr yei had their heads together around chalopins computer vid display captain bannerji had his finger on it and was saying to yei can get in here but how much resistance dyou think youll surely frighten them very much said yei hm im not crazy about asking my men to go up with stunners against desperate folk with much more lethal weapons what is the real status of those socalled hostages thanks to you snarled van atta the hostage ratio is now five to zero they got away with tony damn them why didnt you put a hour guard on that quaddie like i told you we should have put a guard on madame minchenko too chalopins head came up and she gave him an expressionless stare mr van atta you seem to be laboring under some misconceptions about the size of my security forces here i have only ten men to cover three shifts seven days a week plus ten each from each of the other two shuttleports thats thirty properly armed theyd be a substantial strike force ive already borrowed six men from the other two ports to cover our own routine while my entire force is devoted to this emergency why havent you stripped them all mr van atta rodeo ops is a big companybut a very small town there are not ten thousand employees here altogether plus an equal number of dependents not also employed by galactech my security is a police force not a military one they have to cover their own duties double for emergency squad and search and rescue and be ready to assist fire control dammiti drove a wedge for you with tony why didnt you follow up immediately and board the habitat i had a force of eight ready to go up to orbit said chalopin tartly upon your assurance of cooperation from your quaddies we were not however able to get any confirmation of that cooperation from the habitat itself they went right back to maintaining comm silence then we spotted our freight shuttle returning so we diverted the forces to capture itfirst a ground car and then as you yourself came howling in here demanding not two hours ago a jetcopter well get them back together and get them into orbit dammit for one thing you left three of them out on the lake bed remarked captain bannerji sergeant fors just reported insays their groundcar was disabled theyre returning in dr minchenkos abandoned land rover itll be at least another hour before theyre back for another as dr yei has several times pointed out we have not yet received authorization to use any kind of deadly force surely youve got some kind of hot pursuit clause argued van atta that he pointed upward indicating the events now going on in rodeo orbit is grand theft in progress at the very least and dont forget a galactech employee has already been shot by them i havent overlooked that fact murmured bannerji but dr yei put in having asked hq for authorization to use force we are now obliged to wait for their reply what after all if they deny the request van atta frowned at her his eyes narrowing i knew we should never have asked you maneuvered us into that damn you theyd have swallowed any fait accompli we presented and been glad of it now he shook his head in frustration anyway youre overlooking other sources of personnel the habitat staff itself can be used to follow up the opening security drives into the habitat theyre scattered all over rodeo by now dr yei remarked back to their downside leave quarters most of them bannerji cringed visibly and do you have any idea the kind of legal liability that situation would present to security so deputize em a beeping from chalopins desk console interrupted van atta a comm techs face appeared in the vid administrator chalopin comm center here you asked us to advise you of any change in the status of the habitat or the d they umappear to be preparing to leave orbit put it on up here chalopin ordered the comm tech produced the flat view from the satellite again he upped the magnification and the habitatd configuration halffilled the vid the ds two normalspace thruster arms had been augmented by four of the big thruster units the quaddies used to break cargo bundles out of orbit even as van atta watched in horror the array of engines flared into life stirring a glittering wake of space trash the monstrous vehicle began to move dr yei stood staring openmouthed her hands clapped to her chest her eyes glistening strangely van atta felt like weeping with rage himself you see he pointed his voice cracking you see what all this interminable dithering has resulted in theyre getting away oh not yet purred dr yei it will be at least a couple of days before they can possibly arrive at the wormhole there is no just cause for panic she blinked at van atta went on in an almost hypnotically cloying voice you are extremely fatigued of course as are we all fatigue invites mistakes in judgment you should restget some sleep his hands twitched he burned to strangle her on the spot the shuttleport administrator and that idiot bannerji were nodding reasonable agreement a choked growl steamed from van attas throat every minute you wait is going to complicate our logisticsincrease the rangeincrease the risk they all had the same bland stare on their faces van atta didnt need his nose rubbed in ithe could recognize concerted noncooperation when he smelled it damn damn damn he glowered suspiciously at yei but his hands were tied his authority undercut by her sweet reason if yei and all her ilk had their way nobody would ever shoot anybody and chaos would rule the universe he snarled inarticulately wheeled on his heel and stalked out claire woke without yet opening her eyes snugged in her sleep sack the exhaustion that had drenched her at the end of last shift was slow to ebb from her limbs she could not hear andy stirring yet good a brief respite before diaper change in ten minutes she would wake him and they would exchange services he relieving her tingling breasts of milk the milk relieving his hungry tummymoms need babes she thought sleepily as much as babes need moms an interlocking design two individuals sharing one biological system so the quaddies shared the technological system of the habitat each dependent on all the others dependent on her work too what was next germination boxes grow tubesno she could not yank grow tubes around today today was acceleration dayher eyes sprang open and widened in joy tony she breathed how long have you been here been watching you abou fifteen minutes you sleep pretty can i come in he hung in air dressed again in his familiar comfortable red tshirt and shorts watching her in the halflight of her chamber gotta tie down anyway accelerations about to start already she wriggled aside and made room for him entwining all their arms touching his face and the alarming bandage still wrapping his torso are you all right all right now he sighed happily lying there in that hospitalwell i didnt expect anyone to come after me horrible risk to younot worth it he nuzzled her hair we talked about it the risk but we couldnt leave you us quaddiesweve got to stick together she was fully awake now reveling in his physical reality muscled hands bright eyes fuzzy blond brows losing you would have diminished us leo said and not just genetically we have to be a people now not just claire and tony and silver and siggyand andyi guess its what leo calls synergistic were something synergistic now a strange vibration purred through the walls of her chamber she hitched around to scoop andy out of his sleep restraints beside her and fold him to her with her upper hands while still holding tonys lowers with her lowers under the sleep sacks cover andy squeaked lips smacking and fell back to sleep slowly gently her shoulderblades began to press against the wall were on our way she whispered its starting its holding together tony observed in wonder they clung to each other wanted to be with you at this moment she let the acceleration have her laying her head against the wall cushioning andy on her chest something went clunk in her cupboard shed check it later this is the way to travel sighed tony beats stowing away its going to be strange without galactech said claire after a while just us quaddies what will andys world be like i wonder thatll be up to us i guess said tony soberly thats almost scarier than downsiders with guns yknow freedom huh he shook his head not like id pictured it yeis suggested sleep was out of the question morosely van atta returned not to his living quarters but to his own downside office he had not checked in there for a couple of weeks it was about midnight now shuttleport three time his downside secretary was offshift it suited his foul humor to sulk alone after about twenty minutes spent muttering to himself in the dim light he decided to scan his accumulated electronic mail his usual office routine had gone to pot these last few weeks anyway and of course the events of the last two days had blown it entirely to hell perhaps a dose of boring routine would calm him enough to consider sleep after all obsolete memos outofdate requests for instructions irrelevant progress reportsthe quaddie downside barracks he noted with a grim snort was advertised as ready for occupancy at fifteen percent over budget if he could catch any quaddies to put in them instructions from hq viz wrapping up the cay project unsolicited advice upon salvage and disposal of its various parts van atta stopped abruptly and backed up two screens on his vid what had that said again item postfetal experimental tissue cultures quantity disposition cremation by igs standard biolab rules he checked the source of the order no it hadnt come through apmads office as hed first guessed it came from general accounting inventory control part of a long computergenerated list including a variety of lab stores the order was signed by a human though some unknown middle manager in the gaic back on earth by damn van atta swore softly i dont think this twit even knows what quaddies are the order had been signed some weeks before he read the opening paragraph again the project chief will oversee the termination of this project with all due speed the quick release of personnel for other assignments is particularly desirable you are authorized to make whatever temporary requisitions of material or personnel from adjacent divisions you require to complete this termination by after another minute his lips drew back in a furious grin carefully he pulled the precious message disc from the machine pocketed it and left to go find chalopin he hoped he might rout her out of bed chapter arent you about done out there yet tis taut voice crackled through leos worksuit comm one last weld ti leo answered check that alignment one more time tony tony waved a gloved hand in acknowledgement and ran the optical laser check up the line that the electron beam welder would shortly follow youre clear pramod he called and moved aside the welder advanced in its tracks across the workpiece stitching a flange for the last clamp to hold the new vortex mirror in place in its housing a light on the beam welders top flashed from red to green it shut itself off and pramod moved in to detach it bobbi floated up immediately behind to check the weld with a sonic scan its good leo itll hold all right clear the stuff out and bring the mirror in his quaddies moved fast within minutes the vortex mirror was fitted into its insulated clamps its alignment checked all right gang lets move back and let ti run the smoke test smoke test tis voice came over the comm whats that i thought you wanted a tenpercent powerup its an ancient and honorable term for the final step in any engineering project leo explained turn it on see if it smokes i should have guessed ti choked how very scientific use is always the ultimate test but powerup slowly eh gently does it weve got a delicate lady here youve said that about eight or ten times leo is that sucker in spec or out in on the surface anyway but the internal crystalline structure of the titaniumwell it just isnt as controlled as it would have been in a normal fabrication is it in spec or out im not going to jump a thousand people to their deaths dammit especially if im included in in leo spoke through his teeth but justdont horse it around huh for the sake of my blood pressure if nothing else ti muttered something it might have been screw your blood pressure but leo wasnt sure he didnt ask for a repeat leo and his quaddie work gang gathered their equipment and jetted a safe distance from the necklin rod arm they hung a hundred meters or so above home the light of rodeos sun was pale and sharp here within an hour of the wormhole jump point more than a bright star but far less than the nuclear furnace that had warmed the habitat in rodeo orbit leo seized the moment to gaze upon their cobbledtogether colony ship from this rare exterior vantage over a hundred modules had finally been bundled together along the ships axis all carrying onmore or lesstheir previous functions damned if the design didnt look almost intended in a lunaticfunctional sort of way it reminded leo a bit of the thrilling ugliness of the early space probes of the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries miraculously it had held together under two days steady acceleration and deceleration inevitably items here and there inside had been found to have been overlooked the younger quaddies had crawled about bravely cleaning up nutrition had managed to get everyone fed something though the menu was a trifle random thanks to yeoman efforts on the part of the young airsystems maintenance supervisor who had stayed on and his quaddie work gang they no longer had to cease accelerating periodically for the plumbing to work for a while leo had been convinced the potty stops were going to be the death of them all not that he hadnt grabbed the opportunities himself for the final touchingup on their vortex mirror see any smoke tis voice inquired in his ear nope thats it then you people better get your asses inside and as soon as youve got everything nailed down leo id appreciate it if youd come up to nav and com something in the timbre of tis voice chilled leo oh whats up theres a security shuttle closing on us from rodeo your old buddy van attas aboard and ordering us to halt and desist i dont think theres much time left youre still maintaining comm silence i trust oh yeah sure but that doesnt prevent me from listening eh theres a lot of chatter from the jump stationbut that doesnt worry me as much as whats coming up from behind i um dont think van atta handles frustration too well on edge is he over the edge i think those security shuttles are armed yknow and a lot faster than this monster in normal space just cause their lasers are classed as light weaponry doesnt mean its exactly healthy to stand around in front of em id just as soon jump before they got in range i read you leo waved his work gang toward the entry hatch to the worksuit locker module so it was coming at last leo had devised a dozen defenses in his mind upended beam welders explosive mines for the longanticipated physical confrontation with galactech employees trying to retake the habitat but all his time had been gobbled up by the vortex mirror and as a result only the most instant of weapons such as the beam welders were now available and even they would have no use indoors in a boarding battle he could just picture one missing its target and slicing through a wall into an adjoining creche module handtohand in free fell the quaddies might have some advantage weapons cancelled that being more dangerous to the defenders than the attackers it all depended on what kind of attack van atta launched and leo hated depending on van atta van atta swore into the comm one last time then dealt the off key an angry blow he had run out of fresh invective hours before and was conscious of repeating himself he turned from the comm console and glowered around the security shuttles control compartment the pilot and copilot up front were busy about their work bannerji commanding the force and dr yeiand how had she inserted herself into this expedition anywaywere strapped to their acceleration couches yei in the engineers seat bannerji holding down the weapons console across the aisle from van atta thats it then snapped van atta are we in range for the lasers yet bannerji checked a readout not quite please said dr yei let me try to talk to them just once more if theyre half as sick of the sound of your voice as i am theyre not going to answer growled van atta youve spent hours talking to them face ittheyre not listening any more yei so much for psychology the security sergeant fors stuck his head through from the rear compartment where he rode with his twentysix fellow galactech guards whats the word captain bannerji should we suit up for boarding yet bannerji quirked an eyebrow at van atta well mr van atta which plan is it to be it appears were going to have to cross off all the scenarios that started with their surrendering you got that shit straight van atta brooded at the comm which emitted only a grey empty hiss on its vid as soon as were in range start firing on em then disable the necklin rod arms first then the normal space thrusters if you can then we blast a hole in the side march in and mop up sergeant fors cleared his throat you did say there were a thousand of those mutants aboard didnt you mr van atta what about the plan of skipping the boarding part and just taking the whole vessel in tow back to wherever you want it arent the odds a little um lopsided for boarding complain to chalopin shes the one who balked at drafting help from outside security proper but the odds arent what they appear the quaddies are creampuffs half of them are children under twelve for gods sake just go in and stun anything that moves how many fiveyearold girls do you figure youre equal to fors i dont know sir fors blinked i never pictured myself fighting fiveyearold girls bannerji drummed his fingers on his weapons console and glanced at yei is that girl with the baby aboard the ones i almost shot that day in the warehouse dr yei claire yes she replied levelly ah bannerji glanced away from her intent gaze and shifted in his seat lets hope your aim is better this time bannerji said van atta bannerji rotated a computer schematic of a superjumper in his vid running calculations you realize he said slowly that the real event is going to have some uncontrolled factorsthe probability is good that were going to end up punching some extra holes in the inhabited modules while were going for the necklin rods thats all right said van atta bannerjis lips screwed up doubtfully look bannerji added van atta impatiently the quaddies areah have made themselves expendable by turning criminal its no different than shooting a thief fleeing from any other land of robbery or breakin besides you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs dr yei ran her hands hard over her face lord krishna she groaned she favored van atta with a tight peculiar smile ive been wondering when you were going to say that i should have put a side bet on itrun a pool van atta bristled defensively if you had done your job right he returned no less tightly we wouldnt be here now breaking eggs we could have boiled them in their shells back on rodeo at the very least in fact i intend to point out to management later believe me but i dont have to argue with you any more for everything i intend to do i have a proper authorization which you have not shown to me chalopin and captain bannerji saw it if i have my way youll get a termination out of this yei she said nothing but acknowledged the threat with a brief ironic tilt of her head she leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms apparently silenced at last thank god van atta added to himself get suited up fors he told the security sergeant nav and com in the d was a crowded chamber ti ruled from his control chair enthroned beneath his headset silver manned the comm and leoheld down the post of chief engineer he supposed the chain of command became rather blurred at this point perhaps his title ought to be official ships worrier his guts churned and his throat tightened as all lines of action approached their intersection at the point of no return the security shuttle has stopped broadcasting silver reported thats a relief said ti you can turn the sound back up now not a relief denied leo if theyve stopped talking they may be getting ready to open fire and it was too late too close to jump point to put a beam welder and crew outside to fire back tis mouth twisted in dismay he closed his eyes the d seemed to tilt lumbering under acceleration were almost in position to jump he said leo eyed a monitor theyre almost in range to fire he paused a moment then added they are in range to fire ti made a squeaking noise and pulled his headset down poweringup the necklin field gently yelped leo my vortex mirror silvers hand sought leos he was overwhelmed by a desire to apologize to silver to the quaddies to god he didnt know who i got you into this im sorry if you open a channel silver said leo desperately his head swimming in panicall those childrenwe could still surrender never said silver her grip tightened on his hand and her blue eyes met his and i choose for all not just for myself we go leo ground his teeth and nodded shortly the seconds thudded in his brain syncopated with the hammering of his heart the security shuttle grew in the monitor why dont they fire now asked silver fire ordered van atta bannerjis bright computer schematics drew toward alignment numbers flickering lights converging dr yei van atta noticed was no longer in her seat probably hiding out in the toilet chamber this dose of real life and real consequences was doubtless too much for her just like one of those wimp politicians van atta thought scathingly who talks people into disaster and disappears when the shooting starts fire now he repeated to bannerji as the computer blinked readiness locked onto its target bannerjis hand moved toward the firing switch hesitated do you have a work order for this he asked suddenly do i have a what said van atta a work order it occurs to me that technically this could be considered an act of hazardous waste disposal it takes a work order signed by the originator of the requestthats youmy supervisorthats administrator chalopinand the company hazardous waste management officer chalopin has turned you over to me that makes it official mister but not complete the hazardous waste management officer is laurie gompf and shes back on rodeo you dont have her authorization the workorder is incomplete sorry sir bannerji vacated the weapons console and plunked himself down in the empty engineers seat crossing his arms its as much as my job is worth to complete an act of hazardous waste disposal without a proper order the environmental impact assessment has to be attached too this is mutiny yelled van atta no it isnt bannerji disagreed cordially this isnt the military van atta glared redfaced at bannerji who studied his fingernails with an oath van atta flung himself into the weapons console seat and reset the aim he might have knownanything you wanted done right you had to do yourselfhe hesitated the engineering parameters of the dclass superjumpers racing through his mind where on that complex structure might a hit not merely disable the rods but cause the main thrusters to blow entirely cremation indeed and the deaths of the four or five downsiders aboard could at need be blamed on bannerjii did my best maamif hed done his job as id first requested the schematic spun in the vid display there must be a point in the structureyes there and there if he could knock out both that control nexus and those coolant lines he could start an uncontrolled reaction that would result inpromotion probably after the dust had settled apmad would kiss him just like a heroic doctor singlehandedly stopping a plague of genetic abomination from spreading across the galaxy the target schematic pulled toward alignment again van attas swearing palm closed around the firing switch in a momentjust a moment what are you doing with that dr yei asked bannerjis voice in startlement applying psychology the back of van attas head seemed to explode with a sickening crack he pitched forward cutting his chin on the console bumping the keypads turning his firing program to confetticolored hash in the vid he saw stars inside the shuttle blurring purple and green spotsgasping he straightened back up dr yei bannerji objected if youre trying to knock a man out youve got to hit him a lot harder than that yei recoiled fearfully as van atta surged up out of his seat i didnt want to risk killing him why not muttered bannerji under his breath furiously van attas hands closed around yeis wrist he yanked the metal wrench from her grasp you cant do anything right can you he snarled she was gasping and weeping fors spacesuited but still minus his helmet stuck his head through again from the rear compartment what the hell is going on up here van atta shoved yei toward him bannerji squirming uncomfortably in his seat was clearly not to be trusted hold onto this crazy bitch she just tried to kill me with a wrench oh she told me she needed it to adjust a seat attitude remarked fors ordid she say seat but he held yeis arms her struggle as ever was weak and futile with a hiss van atta heaved himself back into the weapons console seat and called up the targeting program again he reset it and switched on the view from the exterior scanners the dhabitat configuration stood out vividly in the vid the cold and distant sunlight silvergilding its structure the schematics converged caging it the d wavered rotated and vanished the lasers fired lances of light striking into empty space van atta howled beating his fists on the console blood droplets flicking from his chin they got out they got out they got out yei giggled leo hung limply in his seat restraints laughter bubbling in his throat we made it ti swung his headset up and sat no less limply his face white and linedjumps drained pilots leo felt as if hed just been twisted inside out himself squeaking but the nausea passed quickly your mirror was in spec leo ti said faintly yes id been afraid it might explode during the stresses of the jump ti eyed him indignantly thats not what you said i thought you were the hotshot testing engineer look id never made one of those things before leo protested you never know you only make the best possible guesses he sat up trying to gather his scattered wits were here we made it but whats going on outside was there any damage to the habitatsilver see what you can get on the comm she too was pale my goodness she blinked so that was a jump sort of like six hours of dr yeis truth serum all squeezed into a second ugh are we going to be doing this a lot i certainly hope so said leo he unstrapped himself and floated over to assist her space around the wormhole was empty and sereneleos secret paranoid vision of jumping into waiting military fire was not to be he noted gladly but wait a ship was approaching themnot a commercial vessel something dangerous and officiallooking its some sort of police ship from orient iv silver guessed are we in trouble undoubtedly dr minchenkos voice cut in as he floated into nav and com galactech will certainly not take this lying down you will do us all a favor graf if you let me do the talking just now he elbowed both silver and leo aside taking over the comm the minister of health of orient iv happens to be a professional colleague of mine while his is not a position of great political power it is a channel of communication to the highest levels of government if i can get through to him we will be in a much better position than if we try to deal with some low level police sergeant or worse military officer minchenkos eyes glinted there is no love lost between galactech and orient iv at the moment whatever galactechs charges we can countertax fraudoh the possibilities what do we do while youre talking asked ti keep boosting advised minchenko its not over is it silver said quietly to leo as they floated out of minchenkos way somehow i thought our troubles would be over if only we could get away from mr van atta leo shook his head a jubilant grin still kept crooking up the comer of his mouth he took one of her upper hands our troubles would have been over if bruciebaby had scored a hit or if the vortex mirror had blown up in the middle of the jump or ifdont be afraid of troubles silver theyre a sign of life well deal with them togethertomorrow she breathed a long sigh the tension draining from her face her body her arms an answering smile at last lighted her eyes making them bright like stars she turned her face expectantly toward his he found himself grinning quite foolishly for a man pushing forty he tried to twitch his face into more dignified lines there was a pause leo said silver in a tone of sudden insight are you shy who me said leo the blue stars squeezed for a moment into quite predatory glitters she kissed him leo indignant at her accusation kissed her back more thoroughly now it was her turn to grin foolishly a lifetime with the quaddies leo reflected could be all right they turned their faces to the new sun
