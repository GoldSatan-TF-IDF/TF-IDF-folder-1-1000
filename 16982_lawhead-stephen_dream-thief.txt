stephen r lawhead dream thief the man is sleeping the huddled mass of nerves and sinews rests easily on the bed outwardly there is no movement inwardly the brain hums with random activity a maintenance force continually monitors the mans internal activity by way of a vast trunkline of nerves at rest the network is dark momentary sparks of electrical impulses shunt their messages to and fro along the axons at the outer fringes the individual beads of light link up and begin their journey up the spinal column like midnight trains heading for the city eventually they arrive and send their impulses off into the tangled circuitry of the brain where each flash briefly noted dies out except for these momentary pinpoint flares the system is dark and quiet gradually the sparks increase their activity more messages are coming in flooding the circuits the lines begin to hum glowing with energy impulses of light speed to their destination deep within the labyrinth illuminating their passage soon the darkened webwork is alive with lightarcing tingling pulsing throbbing with electricity the man is waking the dreams had been at spence again he could feel their lingering presence like a dimly remembered whisper they were unsettling in a vague sort of way nothing he could put a finger onhaunting there was a word that seemed to fit he felt haunted now nine weeks into the project he was not so sure he wanted to finish that was a strange thought for almost three years he had worked for nothing else but the chance to test his theories in the most highly respected advancement center the orbiting space lab gm it had taken him a year to write the grant proposal alone and he was here against considerable odds his project had been chosen to back out now would be professional suicide spence raised his head carefully from his pillow he removed the scanning capa thin plastic helmet lined with neural sensorsand placed it on its hook over the couch he wondered how the nights scan had gone but realized he was feeling less and less interested than before when he had started the project his first thought was to run to the control room to see his scan as soon as he awoke now he seldom bothered although he still occasionally wondered he shrugged and stumbled into the tiny sanibooth to begin his morning routine he emerged from his quarters and hurried off to the commissary without stopping by the control room ill check in later he thought not really caring if he did he headed down the axial and joined the flow of traffic the space station even one the immense size of gmor gotham as it was called by those who considered it hometeas beginning to wear on him he glanced around at his colleagues and at the wellscrubbed faces of the student cadets and knew that he was in the presence of the brightest minds on any planet but he watched as the cadets followed one another dumbly into von braun hall and thought there must be something more knowledge was supposed to set one free wasnt it spence did not feel very free he suddenly felt an urge to lose himself among the eager students and so allowed himself to be pushed into the lecture hall when the line stopped moving he flopped into a cushioned chair the overhead lights dimmed and the automatic transcriber poked its hood up from the seat directly in front of him he absentmindedly flicked a switch at the arm of his chair which sent the hood sliding back into its receptacle unlike everyone else around him spence had no intention of taking notes he swiveled his lead to his left and was shocked to find himself sitting next to a skeleton the skeletons sunken eyes blinked brightly back at him acid the thin skin of its face tightened in a grimace on anyone else it would have been a hearty grin my name is hocking said the apparition im reston spences mouth was dry and he licked his lips trying not to stare hockings body was painfully thin bones jutted out at sharp angles and his head wobbled uncertainly on his tooslender neck why isnt the man in a hospital bed somewhere wondered spence he looked too weak to endure even sitting through the lecture hocking rested in the hitech comfort of a pneumochair his body which could riot have weighed more than eighty pounds sank into the supporting cushions he looked like a mummy in a sarcophagus a thin tangle of wires made its way out of the base of hockings skull and disappeared into the headplate of the chair obviously mindcontrolled spence considered the chair probably monitored its occupants vital sins as well what level are you spence heard his voice asking it was an automatic question one that opened every conversation between gothams inhabitants alevel sector hocking blinked spence was immediately impressed he had never heard of anyone reaching that designation to most people it way merely a theoretical possibility how about you hocking nodded slightly in his direction spence hesitated ordinarily he would have been proud to share his designation but it was embarrassing to him now oh im clevel he said and let it go at that spence knew that most of his countrymen never progressed beyond the lower sectors of elevel even those allowed aboard advancement centers were mostly dlevelalthough none were ever below sector spence realized he was staring again hocking shifted his weight awkwardly in the chair it was clear that he suffered from some neuromuscular ailmentlie had no muscle control at all or at least very little im sorry spence said at last its just that ive never met an alevel before you must be very proud of yourself he knew it sounded foolish but the words were already out it has its advantages hocking replied he flashed his grimace again ive not met many cs it was impossible for spence to determine if the skeleton was joking or not true cs were a rarity and bs were almost nonexistent but on gotham there were plenty of both before he had time to wonder further hocking spoke again what is your specialty reston i sleep said spence sarcastically and do you dream spence prickled at the notion that thin specter might know something about his special problem he also noticed that hockings voice came not from his throat but from a source at either side of his head the chair amplified his voice as he spoke this colored hockings speech with an eerie cast as it overlapped his natural voice somewhat and have spence the impression that hocking was speaking a duet with himself hocking noticed his glance and his voice automatically lowered a tone hocking had only to think and some need was accomplished having never actually seen one of the rare and expensive biorobotic devices spence wondered what else the chair could do the lecture began and ended much as lectures do spence remembered nothing of it except the feeling all through that the person sitting next to him was watching him appraising him sizing him up for some unknown purpose spence squirmed in his seat uncomfortably when at last the lecture was over he stood up turning to tell hocking that he would see him again on an orbiting university no matter how huge one always ran into the same people but as he turned he realized hocking was already gone he thought he glimpsed the back of the white ovoid chair in the flood that moved nut the doors of the lecture hall but he was not sure spence wandered along to the commissary nearby one was conveniently located on every level of the station since scientists hated to be more than a few steps away from their coffee he fell into the short line and picked up one of the blue circular trays and a matching plastic mug he slid into a booth at the far side of the dining area and dosed his hot black liquid with a liberal amount of sweetener his mind drifted back to the day he left earth he could still see his father beaming at him through the tears and he smelled the soft citrus scent of oranges in the air they were sitting at a table beneath an orange tree in the courtyard of the visitors center at the g m ground base just relax and dont tense up his father was saying you wont black out that way dont forget to i wont forget i dont have to fly the shuttle you know besides it isnt like it used to be i wish your mother could see you she would be so proud i know dad i know do you think you could write now and then i know i dont know much about what youre doingyour research and allbut i like to know how you are youre all ive got now the effect of longterm space travel on human brain functions and sleep patterns im part of the ltst project i told you be fineits a small city up there and you have kate shes here you and kate thats all ill try to write but you know how i am just a line or two now and then so ill know how you are a loudspeaker hidden in the branches of the tree crackled out gm shuttle colossus now ready for hoarding passengers please take your places in the boarding arse the two men looked at each other it was then spence saw his father cry hey ill miss you too dad he said his voice flat and unnatural ill be back in ten months and ill tell you all about it goodbye son his father sniffed twin tracks of moisture glistened on iris face they hugged each other awkwardly and spence walked away spence still saw the tears and his father standing in his shirt sleeves under the orange tree looking old gird shaken and alone an unbroken horizon of gently rolling hills stretched out as far as spence could see they were soft hills of early spring the air held a raw chill under gray overcast skies silhouetted in the distance spence could see people moving among the hill—û with heavy burdens he walked closer for a better look the people were oldmen and women working togetherpeasants dressed in tatters they wore no shoes though some of them had wrapped rags stuffed with straw around their feet to keep out the cold in their long bony hands the peasants held wattle baskets filled with stones those with full baskets were walking stoically toward a dirt road single file with their burdens on their shoulders the baskets were obviously heavy some of the peasants strained under the weight spence was overcome with pity for these unfortunate people he turned to those working around him pulling stones from the soil the stones were white as mushrooms and big as loaves of bread spence bent down to help a struggling old woman lift her heavy load he pleaded with her to rest but his words were unheeded the woman neither looked at him nor made any sign that she had heard him he ran from one to another trying to help them but always with the same resultno one seemed to notice him in any way spence sat down brooding over his ineffectiveness he noticed the air was deathly silent and when he looked up all the peasants were gone they had left the field and were moving along the road he was all alone suddenly he felt a tremble in the earth and at his feet a white stone slowly surfaced from beneath the ground as he looked around other stones erupted from the soil like miniature volcanoes spence became frightened and began running across the field to catch up with the last of the retreating figures when he caught up with the peasants they were standing atop the high bank of a river its dark muddy water swirling below the workers were dumping the rocks into the water he rushed up breathless just in time to see the last few peasants empty their baskets to his horror he saw that the baskets contained not stones now but heads he stepped closer as the last heads tumbled into the water in grim fascination he recognized hocking and tickler and then with a shock he saw his own are you dreaming spencer yes is it the same dream the same as before it is but its over now you may sleep a little longer and then awaken when you hear the tone a highpitched electronic tone awakened spence from a deep sleep he spun around in the chair and glanced at the digiton above the console he had been asleep only twenty minutes tickler was still nowhere in sight he rubbed his face with his hands and wondered idly where his assistant managed to hide whenever he needed him he rose from the chair and stretched soon tickler came bustling into the room he was all apologies i am sorry to have kept you waiting dr reston have you been here long oh about an hour i guess spence yawned i was uh detained ticklers sharp features gleamed with a slight perspiration it was clear that he was worked up over something spence decided it was too late to start another session that day i think well try it again tonight i wont need you til then i suppose you have something to do elsewhere tickler looked at him his head cocked to one side as if examining some new variety of mushroom spore i suppose he scratched his chin yes no problem tonight then spence handed him a sheaf of folded printouts which he required to be deciphered and charted in a thick logbooka purely meaningless task since the same computer that spit out the information could chart it as well but spence preferred the personal touch thanks he said without meaning it tickler took the printouts to an adjacent room and set to work spence watched the back of his head as he weaved over the printouts and then left the lab spence made his way down to central parkthe vast circular expanse of tropical plants and trees grown to help recycle the carbon dioxide of gothams fifteen thousand inhabitants the park formed a living green belt around the entire station and provided a natural setting for relaxation and recreation the place was usually crowded though quiet with people seeking refuge from the tyranny of duralumandplastic interiors he had nothing else in mind other than to lose himself among the ferns and shrubbery and let the day go his first thought upon reaching the garden level was that he had discovered a fine time to comethe section was virtually empty he saw only a few strolling couples and a handful of administrative types sitting on benches he took a deep breath the atmosphere was warm and moist reeking of soil and roots vegetation and water artificially controlled he knew but he could not help thinking that this was exactly as it would be back on earth he walked aimlessly along the narrow winding paths looking for a private spot to stretch out and meditate upon the state of his being to think about the dreams and try to get a hold on himself he was not afraid of going mentala term they used to describe a person cracking under space fatiguealthough that was something everyone eventually had to face he knew that wasnt it but he also knew he was not feeling right and that bothered him something on the dim edges of his consciousness was gnawing away at the fibers of his mind if he could figure out what it was expose it then he would be able to deal with it presently he came upon a secluded spot he stood for a moment deciding whether to stay or look further with a shrug he parted the ferns and stepped into the semidarkness of the quiet glade he sat down on the grass and tipped his head back on his shoulders high above him the sunlight slanted in through the immense chevrons of the solar shields he saw the graceful arc of the space station slide away until it bent out of sight one could tramp the six kilometer circumference of gotham at the garden level and achieve the illusion of hiking an endless trail ordinarily the green and quiet soothed spences troubled mind but not today he lay back and tried to close his eyes but they would not remain closed he shifted position several times in an effort to get comfortable nothing he did seemed to make any difference he felt ill at ease and jittery as if someone very close by was watching him as he thought about those unseen eyes on him he grew more certain that he was being watched he got up and left the shaded nook glancing all around to see if he could catch a glimpse of his spy he struck along the path once more and seeing no one became more uneasy he told himself that he was acting silly that he was becoming a prime candidate for that room with the rubber wallpaper as he scolded himself he quickened his pace so that by the time he reached the garden level concourse he was almost running he glanced quickly over his shoulder to see if he was being followed for some reason he halfexpected hockings eggshaped chair to come bobbing into view from behind a shrub still looking over his shoulder he dashed through the entrance and tumbled fullforce into a body entering the garden the unlucky bystander was thrown to the floor and lay sprawling at his feet while spence stood blinking not quite comprehending what had just happened sorry he burst out finally as if prodded by electric shock the greenandwhite rumpled jumpsuit of a cadet flailed its arms in an effort to rise spence latched onto a swinging arm and hoisted the suit to its feet only then did he glimpse the bewildered face which scanned him with quick apprehensive eyes im dr reston biopsych are you hurt he volunteered no sir i didnt see you coming it was my fault no im sorry really i thought he turned and looked over his shoulder again i thought someone might be following me dont see anybody the cadet said peering past spence into the garden there was nothing to be seen except the green curtain of vegetation unbroken but for the careless splashes of white and yellow flowers blooming at random throughout the garden im kurt and im biopsych first year i thought id met most of the faculty in my department well im not an instructor im research oh kurt said absently well ive got to get back to work the cadet started off glad to meet you dr reston see you around on the overgrown donut of the space station the cadets always said see you around spence appreciated the pun the unbroken horizon of gently rolling hills stretched out as far as spence could see the same horizon the same hills as in previous dreams in the distance he saw people moving among the hills with heavy burdens closer he recognized these as the peasants who labored in rags to rid the arid hills of stones which they tumbled into their rough twig baskets with their skinny hands all was familiar painfully so to spence who had lived the dream often he watched as the barefoot peasants shifted the weight of the baskets upon their bony shoulders and shuffled single file along the road others around him still strained to lift the stones white as mushrooms and big as loaves of bread from the soil he knew he was powerless to help them in any way his words and actions were ignored he was invisible to them spence again sat down brooding over his ineffectiveness again the air was deathly silent the peasants were gone he felt the earth tremble at his feet as a round white stone surfaced from beneath the ground he looked around him and other stones were erupting from the soil like miniature volcanoes when he stood he found himself once again atop the high bank of a river the dark muddy water swirled in rolling eddies below the last peasant dumped his basket into the water and spence heard a voice call his name he turned and saw a dozen huge black birds wheeling in the air he followed them and realized he was standing on an immense plain which stretched limitless into the distance rising in front of him on that flat grasscovered plain stood an ancient crumbling castle he lifted his foot the landscape blurred and then he stood within the courtyard of the castle before a scarred wooden door which he tried and found open an empty marble corridor of stairs spiraled down away from him he followed it deeper it wound eventually arriving at the entrance to a small chamber dimly lit spence rubbed his eyes and stepped forward into the room the light of the room seemed to emanate from a single sourcean incredibly large egg floating in the center of the chamber he to watched horrified as the egg began bobbing slightly and rose up higher into the air as it rose it revolved and he then saw what he fearedthe egg was the back of hockings chair but it was upside down as it slowly revolved he saw hocking sitting serenely in his chair laughing the chair floated closer hocking threw him a toothy grimace and became a leering malevolent deathshead spence turned and fled the eggchairdeathshead pursued him he raced for the door at the end of the corridor and burst through to discover an inky black night scattered with a thousand stars over his shoulder earth a serene blue globe rose in the sky as he stumbled bleeding across a rocky alien landscape spence watched the shuttle pull away from the huge arcing flank of the space station he stood on a small observation platform overlooking the staging area watching the routine arrival of supplies and the departure of personnel going down or rather back to earth on furlough he wished he was going with them he had never felt more like giving up than he did right now his life had settled into a dull aching throb between depression and loneliness he did not know which was worse the black haze through which he seemed to view life around him or the sharp pangs which arrowed through his chest whenever he immersed himself in the stream of people moving along the trafficways and realized that he did not really know a single other soul but underlying both of these unpleasant realities was he knew the very thing which he dreaded most the dreams since that afternoon in central park nearly two weeks before he had begun to feel those invisible eyes on him every waking moment he fancied they watched him while he slept he felt his sanity slowly slipping away he gazed up through the giant observation bubble into the velvet black void of space burning with a billion pinpoint flares of nameless stars he was gazing at the rim of the milky way but remained oblivious to the sight what am i going to do he whispered aloud to himself he turned away as the shuttles white bulk dropped slowly from view below him there was a whir as the docking net was withdrawn and a faint whispered hiss as the inner airlocks equalized spence yawned and thought again for the billionth timehow tired he was he had not closed his eyes to speak of in the last three daysquick catnaps a few minutes here and there was all he had been avoiding sleep like a youngster avoids the dentist when the tooth throbs and pain numbs the jaw he hoped that by some miracle the pain the dreams would just go away at the same time he knew that hope was futile he would have to have some real sleep soon if he was to remain even partially upright and coherent he had the odd apprehension that he was turning into a zombie one of those pathetic creatures of myth destined to roam the twilight regions neither completely dead nor fully alive no thoughts no feelings just an ambulatory carcass directed by some demon will beyond itself but the idea of sleep had become repugnant to him becoming a zombie was less frightening than the thought of the nightmare which waited for him to drift into blissful peace before unfolding him in its awful insanity spence shook his head to clear it he was beginning to ramble he looked around and realized that his unattended steps had brought him to broadway turning to the left he started to make his way back to the biopsych section and the sleep lab to his own quartersthere again to wrestle with the question to sleep or not to sleepbut something caught his eye and he stopped and looked again all he saw was a brightly illuminated sign the same as any other which identified the trafficways of gotham spence stood staring at the sign for several seconds before he realized what had arrested his flagging attention the words office of the director and the red arrow pointing the opposite way seemed to hold a special fascination for him in his befuddled state without thinking about it or making a decision at all he discovered his feet moving him mechanically along toward the directors office and without surprise he knew why he was going there perhaps subconsciously he had intended to request a psych leave for some time now in his sleepdeprived condition his body was taking him where he had wanted to go all along but had not dared for lack of nerve spence moved blindly along somehow managing to avoid the others hurrying to and fro along the trafficway twice he caught strange looks from passersby but their glances of questioning concern failed to register it was as if he had withdrawn to an inner mental cell and only peered out curiously from behind the bars the reactions of others meant nothing to him after much turning and several level changesspence was oblivious to it allhe arrived at adsec as he stood contemplating the partition which separated him from the receptionist inside he came to himself i cant go in there like this he muttered he spun around spied a convenience station and took himself inside he peered into the mirror as he leaned over the duralum basin and marveled at the sight he presented redrimmed eyes burned out of a pallid expressionless face unwashed hair started from his head as if afright deep lines drew a pliant mouth into a frowning scowl it was the very visual representation of how he felt the outer man imitating the inner spence shook his head in disbelief and filled the basin with cold water he let the water run until it threatened to overflow and then plunged his hands in scooped up a double handful and splashed it on his face the sting of the water cleared his senses somewhat and he felt better at once he repeated the procedure several times and then made an attempt to flatten his hair he dried his hands at a nearby blower and then stepped from the vestibule once more into the trafficway with some hesitation he pushed the access plate and the translucent partition slid open slightly he stepped woodenly in and forced a grin at the tightlipped receptionist who greeted him with the flash of a professional smile and the standard good afternoon whom do you wish to see please imive come to see the director said spence as he looked around for his office among the several which opened off of the central reception area he saw it and started toward it im sorry called the receptionist do you have an appointment yes spence lied and kept on going he approached the door pushed the access plate and walked in he was not expecting anything in particular but the room which opened before him startled him with its size and regal appointments compared to his own crabbed cube of a room and all the other totally spaceefficient quarters chambers and labs he had been in on the station this one was palatial in its utter disregard for constraint he could not help gawking as he stared at the beautiful expanse of open space which met his eyes the room was a huge octagonal chamber with a high curving dome above a broad area part of which was given to a sort of loft which was reached by a spiraled rank of broad steps the princely spaciousness of the quarters was further enhanced by a huge observation bubble which formed part of a convex wall over the loft the effect to an observer like spence was one of entering a great hall with a window opening onto the universe beyond his feet were sunk into several centimeters of thick buffcolored carpet green plants of several types and miniature flowering trees splashed color against pale slategray walls and tawny furnishings notably absent was any hint of aluminum or other metallic surfaces it was an office such as one would find in one of the great bastions of corporate power back on earth but rarely on a space station rank thought spence did indeed have its privileges yes said a voice close by spence jerked around quickly immediately embarrassed im sorry i didnt see you when i came in the bright china blue eyes which met his sparkled thats all right im often overlooked no i didnt mean he broke off the young lady several years his junior was laughing at him he colored at that feeling ridiculous and completely out of place he did not know what to say and for a few moments stared unabashedly at the girl sitting casually at a low desk just inside the entrance to the mammoth office she wore a jumpsuit like everyone else on gm but hers was a light powderbluedefinitely not regulation her long blonde hair hung down in loose ringlets swept back from her temples and secured somehow at the back of her head to fall in curls along her slender wellformed neck was there something she asked the smile this time was accompanied by just the barest hint of a flutter of her long dark lashes oh yes spence brought himself forcibly back to his mission i have come to see the director why may i ask spence started how impertinent id rather discuss that with the director himself thank you he said stuffily and hoped it had put her back in her proper place the nerve certainly she smiled again only if i knew what it was about it might help you to get in to see him sooner thats all i had hoped to be able to see him at once im afraid not but its very important i must see him today i wont take but a few minutes of his time couldnt you just tell him its private and urgent no again that impertinence spence in his exhaustion felt a hot current of anger rising to his head he willed himself to remain calm may i wait he asked nodding to a chair set in among a grove of miniature palms if you like said the girl coolly and as spence moved to take his seat she added only it will most likely be a rather long wait he i dont mind interrupted spence firmly he plopped himself down in the soft fabric cushions of the chair with a demonstration of defiant resolve the young woman went back to her work without another glance at him for a while he ignored her and busied himself with studying the dimensions of the directors official lair tiring of that he moved his attention by degrees to the woman at the desk opposite him she had begun entering data into a terminal at the side of her desk he marveled at her quickness and dexterity that was obviously why she had been hired for the job of assistant to the director observed spence it was not for her tact as he watched he formed several other opinions about her she was he determined of the giddy sort given to suppressed giggles and flouncy sentiments undoubtedly frivolous very likely not a brain in her head at the barest hint of anything intellectual she would probably flutter her eyelashes and simper im afraid thats too deep for little of me she was pretty there was no denying that but spence told himself it was a superficial beauty which had no lasting quality for someone unparticular she would make a suitable mate but for one like himself she would never do never in a billion chronemes it did not occur to spence that he had just painted her with exactly the same unflattering strokes he painted nearly every other woman that for him was easier than just admitting that he had no time for women that romance would interfere with his research and career that he was afraid of women because he did not trust himself to be faithful to both an intimate relationship with another human being and to his work he had a certain right to be afraid he had seen too many gifted men burdened by cares for a wife and family succumb to secondrate research centers and teaching jobs the young dr reston intended to fly as high as he could and no woman was going to hold him down the young lady squirmed under his unrelenting gaze she tilted her head and peered back at him their eyes met and spence looked quickly away but soon he was staring at her again she smiled and then laughed as she turned to confront him is this your way of getting a girls attention excuse me he was unprepared staring is there something you want was i staring im sorry i didnt mean look i only want to see the director when will he be available the girl glanced at her watch and said oh next week some time maybe thursday what spence leaped from his seat and bounded over to the desk i thought you said i could wait you may wait as long as you like but he wont be back until next thursday you said spence sputtered his hands clenched themselves in angry fists at his side i said it would likely be a rather long wait you interrupted me before i could finish is this the way you treat everyone on important business she flashed him a defiant smirk no only those who waltz in demanding to see the director without an appointment she had him he was defeated and disgraced it was true he had behaved like an idiot a wave of cool shame instantly quenched the anger just as the flames threatened to touch off his temper the young secretary smiled at him again and he did not feel so bad so were even she said now would you like to start again at the beginning spence only nodded fine is this personal business or official well personal see that wasnt hard ill put you down for an appointment friday morning first thing his assistant will call you you mean youre not his assistant i thought you thought i was i know no im only filling in while they are away mr wermeyer is his assistant now spence felt doubly the fool he wished only to be allowed to melt into the carpet and slink away thank you he muttered and backed away slowly the partition slid closed terminating the episode in the directors office he sighed and made his way back to his quarters more hopelessly tired than ever the old head came up slowly lizardlike the large oval yellow eyes gazed outward from under halfclosed lids yellowed skin the color and texture of ancient parchment stretched tautly over a smooth flat skull and hung in folds around the sagging neck not a hair remained in the scalp not a whisker not an eyelash a thin slightly rounded band stretched across the smooth brow this circlet pulsed with a purplish light of its own throbbing as waves of energy flashed and dimmed hocking could see him as if wreathed in smokeclearly in the center of his field of vision but shimmering and indistinct on the periphery the face regarded him with a steady glare the expression beyond contempt or malice though traces of both were there beyond weariness or simple age cold reptilian it was an expression utterly alien to any assignable human emotion in a lesser being the face and its mysterious scowl would have created at least a sense of dread if not outright fear but hocking was used to it ortu he said the name softly distinctly we are ready to proceed with the final experiment i have found a subject especially receptive to the stimulus hocking licked his lips and waited for a reply for a moment he doubted whether the image before him had heard but he knew it had the reply would come in time proceed then as i have instructed the words were spoken evenly but with an unusual coloringthe faintest suggestion of a foreign accent but indecipherable i thought you would be pleased ortu we can begin at last hockings upper lip twitched enthusiastically at long last pleased for what reason should i be pleased oh there are so many there was no mistaking the venom in the voice pleased that it has taken so long that even my inexhaustible patience has been tried time and time again to no result that my plans should rest on the feeble efforts of a creature too stupid to comprehend the smallest fraction of the work the circlet on his forehead flashed brightly hocking endured the sarcasm bravely i have been particularly careful in my choice of a subject this time he is a sleep scientist named reston and hes quite malleable we will not be disappointed again i assure you very well begin at once ortu closed his eyes and his ancient head sank once more it shall be done hocking too closed his eyes and when he opened them again the glimmering image had vanished he sat in his chair in the center of his darkened quarters the whisper of a smile flitted across his skeletal features now at last all was ready the final test could begin spence stepped from his sanibooth actually whistling he felt better than he had in weeks rested alert and happy he had slept the whole night long the sleep of the dead and not one dream had intruded upon his slumberat least not the dreams he had learned to fear of late those without color without form which seemed born of some alien sterile intelligence which came into his mind and left him shaking and drained but without memory whatever had been bothering him was now gone or so he hoped perhaps it had only been the strain of adapting to the confines of the station gm was the largest of the orbiting advancement centers it was also the highest actually it was the worlds first selfsustaining space colony maintaining an orbit three hundred and twenty thousand kilometers above the earth around a point astrophysicists called libration five that distance or rather the thought of that distance sometimes had a strange effect on newcomers some experienced symptoms of claustrophobia others became nervous and irritable and had difficulty sleeping or had bad dreams often these problems were not immediately apparent they developed slowly over the first weeks and months of the rookie jumpyear and had very little in common with the allied problem of space fatigue which only seasoned veteransthose in their fifth or sixth jumpyearseemed to contract that was something else entirely so spence feeling very pleased with himself that he had weathered the worst and had come through rubbed his body with a hot moist towel to remove the fine blue powder of the personal sanitizer and then tossed the towel into the laundry port he dressed in a fresh blue and gold jumpsuit and made his way into the lab to reweave the dangling threads of his project he slipped into the lab quietly and found dr tickler hunched over a worktable with an array of electronic gear and testing equipment spread out around him good morning said spence amiably there was no real day or night but the gothamites maintained the illusion and the station flipped slowly over on its axis on a twelvehour cycle to help in the deception oh there you are yes good morning tickler bent his head around to observe spence closely he wore a magnifying hood which made his eyes bug out absurdly like two glassy doorknobs splotched with paint anything serious one of the scanners is fritzing nothing serious i thought i would take the opportunity to set it in order spence detected a slight rebuff in ticklers clipped tone then he remembered he had missed the work assignment he made for last night im sorry ii wasnt feeling very well yesterday that was true enough i fell asleep i should have let you know and the days before that tickler tilted his head forward and raised the hood to look at him sharply before spence could think of a suitable reply his assistant shrugged and said it makes no difference to me dr reston i can always get another assignmentnot with so prestigious a colleague perhaps but one where my services will be taken seriously you on the other hand i suspect would find it somewhat difficult to secure an assistant at this late date you would be forced to postpone your project would you not spence nodded mutely yes i thought so well the choice is yours but i will put up with no more of this i respect your work dr reston and i will have mine so respected nowhe smiled a stiff little smile devoid of any warmthnow that we understand one another i am sure there will be no further problems you are correct returned spence woodenly he felt like a schoolboy who had been tardy once too often and now had been properly scolded that was bad enough but he hated being reminded that he was only on gm by way of a generous grant and could not chart his own course beyond the narrowly defined limits of the grant he had no money of his own at least not the kind needed to pay for a berth aboard even the smallest space lab let alone gm by sheer brainpower alone he was here that and the goodwill of the gm advancement board i can assure you that there will be no further misunderstandings now we will begin where we should have last evening as they worked together readying the lab for the next battery of experiments the happy inner glow rekindled spences spirits he did feel better than he had in weeks and after all it could have been worse for him tickler could have requested reassignment that would have really bollixed up the works and made him look bad before the board in the end he came around to feeling fairly grateful to tickler for the reprimand he had it coming maybe even needed it to settle his mind on his work once more and he felt a little sorry for tickleran older man himself a clevel phd reduced to playing lab assistant and watching younger men advance in his place one had to feel sorry as he passed by the control booth with its huge reading board he caught a glimpse of himself in the reflection of the halfsilvered window he saw a young man leaving his twenties lean slightly above average in height straight of limb and steady of hand large dark eyes looked out from under a brown thatch of hair which no matter how it was combed always appeared rebellious the face showed a quick intelligence and by the thrust of a firm jaw a decisive resolve almost bordering on stubbornness it was a face which did not easily show emotion but one which was saved from being completely cold and aloof by a full sensitive mouth perched above a deeply cleft chin the shift wore away and by the end of it he was ready to begin the next round of sleep experiments he celebrated the return of his will to work by treating himself to an hour in gothams arcade playing rat race his favorite hologame it was one of the latest generation of hologames featuring a biofeedback variable that homed in on the players mental and emotional reflexes in his present good spirits spence racked up halfamillion points before the rats caught him and he turned the game over to a group of impatient cadets he left the noisy arcade and was soon strolling idly along his favorite path among the great green ferns of central park he had stopped to steep himself in the damp earthy atmosphere of the placeeyes closed face tilted upward to receive shieldreflected sunlight drawing great gulps of air deep into his lungswhen he heard a rustle behind him reluctantly he turned to allow the other to pass and as he opened his eyes discovered himself blinking into two liquid orbs of china blue fringed with long dark lashes you spence jumped back involuntarily the disarming intruder laughed and replied gaily i thought it was you i see i was right i never forget a face you startled me i didnt mean to shout at you you are forgiven ive been following you you certainly wander around an awful lot i almost lost you several times you were following me how else was i going to apologize i happened to see you in the concoursei always come down to the park every day apologize spence kicked himself for babbling like an imbecile for what he added for my shocking behavior yesterday im sorry really i had no right to treat you that way very unprofessional of me oh thats all right he muttered the young lady chattered on its just that it was close to the end of the shift and i was getting a little giddy i do that when i get tired and anyway daddy has been gone so long im afraid ive kind of let the decorum of his office disintegrate daddy another inner kick oh there i go again im always getting ahead of myself somehow you mean your father is the director of gm yesthe colony not the corporation then youre his daughter buffoon what are you saying thats right she laughed it makes it nice that way you work for him i mean no not really i was just helping out because both he and his assistant are gone i didnt have anything else to do theyve been gone all week setting up some sort of field trip or something that sounds interesting spence was dying for something halfintelligent to say at least he had passed imbecile and was now merely moronic does it i suppose so to a scientist i mean i have no desire to go tramping around on mars or anywhere else i didnt even like the jump up here very much spence had heard about such field trips as she called them at least once a session various cadets would be chosen to take a trip to one of the extraterrestrial bases to see firsthand the work going on there mars was without doubt the deluxe trip anyone who made that one would add an appreciable amount of prestige to his credentials when is theah field trip supposed to take place i hope you dont mind my asking would you like to walk for a while my name is spencer spence i know i looked it up in your file dr reston to his look of mild surprise she added oh it wasnt hard i told you i never forget a face and i remembered the bar code on your jumpsuit right they began to walk slowly among the ferns and leafy trees now however spence was aware of a new scent among the musky odors of the tropical garden a fresh clean scent lemons he decided im ari its short for ariadne only if you ever call me that ill never speak to you again for an instant spence considered that would be an extremely unfortunate event but then realized he hardly knew the girl at all hmmm he screwed up his face into a contemplative scowl ariadnethats greek mythology she was the daughter of king minos of crete she gave her lover theseus a ball of twine which he used to escape the labyrinth of the minotaur very good she laughed and clapped her hands not one person in a thousand remembers that oh i regard myself something of a classicist remarked spence with a mockserious air ari its a nice name i like it i like yours too they stopped walking as spence turned to look at her he could feel his nerve evaporating well its been nice talking to you she said i do have to go now maybe well run into each other again sometime she hesitated bye she turned quickly and ducked under a large frond and spence watched her dart away like a deer her long blonde hair flagging behind as she disappeared among the green shadows he stood perplexed by the strange mix of emotions which assailed him he was sorry to see her go and yet he told himself that he could not feel that way that he had never seen her before yesterday that she was just like every other girl he had ever met still a vague sense of loss settled on him as he continued to walk the garden paths spence stumbled bruised and bleeding across a rocky alien landscape over his shoulder earth a beautiful serene blue globe rose full in the black formless sky he winced with pain as needlelike shards of tiny cinders sliced the soles of his bare feet and scraped the flesh away from his knees and the palms of his hands when he fell he felt a cool wetness on his cheek and lifted a hand to his face tears he was crying then he was standing on the top of a low mountain overlooking a lush green valley around him a gentle breeze played among tiny yellow flowers shifting their sunny heads playfully with each gust the air bore a sweetly pungent scent and seemed to vibrate with a faintly audible tinkling sound which reminded him of bells in the valley below small white houses each surrounded by its own neat acreage dotted the slopes in an orderly fashion he could see the minute figures of people going about their daily chores moving in and out of the little houses an atmosphere of unfathomable peace and wholeness enfolded the valley like a golden mist and spence was cryingheartbroken because he did not belong in that valley among those people who lived in such simple splendor the air grew cold around him the fragile yellow flowers shriveled at his feet the tears froze on his face he heard the empty howl of frigid winds roaring down as if from incredible heights he looked down in despair and watched the verdant valley wither and turn brown the whitened wisps of dried grass and leaves flurried about him in the savagely gusting wind he shivered and wrapped his arms tightly across his chest to keep warm he glanced down at his feet and saw that he stood upon hard bare earth he saw something sparkle and beheld a small pile of diamonds glittering in the icy glare of a harsh violent moon they were his tearsfrozen where they had fallen the earth would not receive them spence was awake long before he opened his eyes he simply lay and allowed the waves of feeling to wash over him filling the cavernous emptiness inside his chest with fiercely contending emotions he felt like a leaf tossed in a tempest a rag blown before the glowering storm he lay with his eyes clamped shut and tried to make sense of it all at last the storm subsided and he wearily opened his eyes and got up placing the scanner cap on its hook he sat for a moment on the edge of the couch experiencing a mild lightheadedness which he had not noticed before the moment passed and he stood up slowly and in doing so his hand brushed his headrest he stared at it as if he had never seen it before the light sky blue of the pillows case bore two darker stains side by side he touched them lightly knowing what they were the pillow was damp with his tears and i cant help feeling that it was a mistake to use myself as a subject in the research thats all spence was speaking quietly but with some conviction to dr lloyd head of the biopsych department of gotham he had sought out dr lloyd as a sympathetic ear but i disagree dr reston i was on the academic board that evaluated your grant proposal i voted for it i think it is quite sound and if i may say so quite insightful how else can a scientist fully evaluate subjective data without himself experiencing the phenomena which produce the data your work with tyrosine hydroxylase interaction with catecholamines is little short of revolutionary i think you have touched upon a very viable research model and one which if successful could pioneer the way for some very prime developments in sleep science your research is key to the ltst project as a whole speaking as a colleague id like to see you continue i think that is imperative spence was not hearing what he had hoped to hear dr lloyd with great enthusiasm was defending spences own pro posal against him perhaps there would be a way to restructure the project maybe dr lloyd smiled benignly and shook his head from side to side slowly you havent given it a proper chance why not see where it will take you i could interpose another subject into the same designi wouldnt have to no no i can understand your anxiety but you have already done so much how do you know that you are not even now evincing some of the signs of ltst yourself eh have you thought of that but dr reston believe me i admire your work i would hate to see anything augur ill for the progress youve already made your career is in its ascendancy you will go far but as a friend i must warn you dont tinker with your design now it would not look good to the board you would not wish to appear shall we say undecided wishywashy i am afraid the board would take a dim view of any changes at this late date and as a member of the board i would have to agree i suppose youre right dr lloyd thank you for your time spence rose reluctantly to his feet and his colleague led him to the door with his hand on spences shoulder any time dr reston please feel free to stop by any time thats what im here for lloyd chuckled delighted that he could be of help to the legendary young dr reston go back to your work i should tell you were all watching your progress with the greatest interest thank you goodbye sir dont mention it goodbye come by any time spence had met with a brick wall of his own making he had not considered it before but it made sense that gm would want him as much as he had first wanted them his presence would lend to the overall prestige of the center and now that they had him they were not going to let anything happen to him that would lessen his value as a contributor they were not about to let anything stand in the way of dr restons glorious success not even dr reston himself he walked gloomily back to the lab feeling trapped what was happening to him was he losing his sanity was this how it started the dreams were back end they were beginning to exert more and more control over his sleep state he awoke in the morning drained and unrested his emotions on the ragged edge the dreams themselves he could not remember they were shadowy forms which moved barely beyond the edges of consciousness was lloyd right was he undergoing the strain associated with longterm space travel if so how was that possible he had not been on gm long enough was there some mechanism which acted to somehow speed up his own experiencethe encephamine injections perhaps or was there some other explanation only one thing was certain the dreams had returned to haunt him perhaps he should do as dr lloyd suggested simply follow where his mind would take him spence shrank from the thought there was something in him that rebelled at that suggestion irrationally rebelled it seemed because it was solidly logical advice yet something within spencehis spirit his conscience that tiny inner voicescreamed a warning at the thought of abandoning his reason to the design of the project even if it was his own project spence sought to quell this inner mutiny as he walked back to the lab there was no reason not to continue as plannedno scientifically objective reason he entered the lab with the faint whisper of the sliding partition the lights were off and tickler was gone the lab was quiet he stepped in and the door slid closed behind him leaving him in complete darkness and silence he turned to fumble in the blackness for the access plate in order to switch on a lighting panel overhead as he wheeled around the faintest trace of a glimmer caught his eye he stopped and turned back slowly in the darkness of the empty lab he perceived a strange luminescence a sort of halo barely visible hanging in the air in the center of the lab he closed his eyes and opened them again and the slight greenish glow remained as spence watched the radiant spot seemed to coalesce to focus and grow brighter by degrees and he moved toward the glow as if drawn by a heavy magnetic force the halo was quite visible now it even threw off a gentle reflection all around spence walked slowly around it his muscles tensed like a cat ready to spring it was like nothing he had ever seen whichever way he moved the shimmering halo showed always the same face to him a luminescent wreath of pale green light shining with a gleaming radiance which shifted and danced under his gaze the center of the halo remained unaffected by the light through it he could see the dim outlines of objects on the other side of the room spence edged cautiously closer sideways like a crab he attempted to look away but his curiosity or some greater force held his attention firmly he could not resist now he was standing very close to the glowing presence in the center of the lab so close that he could feel a tingling sensation on his hands and face a tiny prickling of the flesh as if with extreme cold he raised one hand toward the aura and saw it surrounded by the greenish cast gradually he noticed a movement within the haloa very transparent shimmer of deepest blue almost beyond human vision the radiance intensified and cast out beams which glittered gold and silver as they fluoresced within the green aura of the halo although he stood rooted firmly in his place he experienced the unnerving sensation of traveling very rapidly into the halo as if he were being sucked into a swirling vortex of cold blue fire with this sensation came a quickening of his physical senses his heart began beating rapidly his breathing labored sweat beaded up on his forehead and neck he was feeling very weak and dizzy teetering on the brink of consciousness when he felt a unique sensation the flesh at the base of his neck began creeping upward in tiny pinpricks over his scalp for one brief instant he wondered what that could mean what could it be the answer hit him like a shock every hair on his head was standing on end spence opened his mouth to cry out but no sound came he was held in the steely grip of a terror he could not name a fear which came swimming at him from the darkened corners of the roomof his mind he could not move or scream or look away only endure some small part of his mind withdrew from the horror which now twisted his features it watched with dread fascination as the green aura flared brilliantly and the whirling blue lightning slowed and began to take shape to his rational inner eye it appeared that a scene was taking place behind a filmy curtain of light but the movements were too indistinct and too remote to be understood gradually he became aware of a sound which perhaps had been there all along but had gone unnoticed it was the thin needlelike tinkling of tiny bells this he heard not with his ears but inside his head and on the surface of his skin and hearing it now in this way turned his blood to ice water in his veins for up to this moment it was a sound heard only in his dreams with an effort he raised his hands and clamped them over his ears and screamed with every fiber of will left in him then he toppled insensible to the floor here he is the flashlight beam played over the slumped figure on the floor passed out ill get the lights said a second slightly higher pitched voice no leave them off he might wake up replied the first what shall we do with him we cant just leave him on the floor why not we can come back later he might remember right lets put him in the sleep lab good idea hook up the scanner too that way he wont be sure even if he remembers he wont be sure ill take his feet careful dont wake him up t o spence i t see m e d as if his mind returned like a rock dropped into a lake he felt his awareness returning falling slowly through the void of darkness while he himself waited floating to receive it the floating sensation continued for some time when he tried to move his head he was overcome by a powerful dizziness and the feeling that he was falling in slow motion into a vast bottomless pit so he lay motionless and tried to collect the fragments of his thoughtswhat was left of them he remembered talking to dr lloyd and then returning to the lab that was allonly darkness after that and yet there must be something more for here he was if his guess was correct in the sleep lab lying on the scanners cav couch how he had gotten there he could not say from the control room he heard the soft chime of the session clock then ticklers voice sounded over the speaker drifting down from above like snow the session is terminated dr reston shall i bring up the lights yes he heard himself say bring up the lights the overhead panels began to glow faintly at first but steadily until he could make out the ordinary cylindrical dimensions of the room he sat up slowly as the last waves of dizziness rolled over him he gripped the sides of the cav couch and started awkwardly to his feet aware that tickler was watching him closely from the control booth he felt a tug and realized that he was wearing the scanning cap he slipped it off and tossed it back onto the couch in the depression his head had made and then moved slowly as in a dream toward the booth good scan this session doctor tickler said happily bring it to me after breakfast spence shook his head groggily anything wrong no i uh didnt sleep very well thats all you remember of course that you have scheduled to inter view cadets for the assistantships today tickler do we really need an assistant i mean the project is just myself and you it isnt as if we were in hienthose guys want thirty people for every experiment each department is required to take a cadet well couldnt simmons take an extra one i dont really see where we need to biopsych is a small department yes tickler sniffed but it will hardly expand if those of us in a position to encourage the interest of bright young minds fail to take full advantage of the assistantship program spence hated ticklers testimonials so to prevent further aggravation he replied as evenly as he knew how you are right of course in fact i think it would be a good idea for you to interview the cadets yourself me but dr reston i i dont see why not you have a good feel for that sort of thing i will however want to approve your choice when youve found the right candidate for the job bring him to me spence ducked quickly out of the control booth bringing an end to the matter he stepped into the corridor and began threading his way to the commissary once free from ticklers annoying presence his mind returned to the mysterious problem of his blackout in the jumble of the crowded cafeteria he found seclusion to properly mull it over in his mind noise considered spence was just as good an insulator as perfect quiet maybe better with a proper level of random sound the mind turned naturally inward completely shutting out the rest of the world the clash and clatter of trays and utensils the din of voices and the unrelenting drone of insipid background music which filled the busy commissary raised the noise factor to the perfect volume for contemplation with his tray of scrambled eggs grapefruit and coffee he made his way to an empty table in the corner past others dining on an assortment of foods he saw spaghetti roast beef tomato cups chicken salad pancakes omelets and hot dogsbreakfast lunch and dinner served simultaneously to accommodate the schedules of various shifts the sight of roast beef and gravy sitting next to scrambled eggs and toast always threw him it did not look right somehow spence chewed thoughtfully and at the end of his meal was no closer to an answer than before the missing hours were simply gone ten hoursmaybe twelvecould not be accounted for not by his own memory at any rate he gulped the last of his tepid coffee and determined to check the scan in the labthe scan tape would show a momentbymoment account of his mental whereabouts on its four red wavy lines he entered the lab and saw that tickler had gone he went to the control booth and found the spool where tickler had left it duly cataloged and ready for filing after his inspection spence snapped the seal and unrolled the strip to the beginning watching the yards and yards of wavy lines unravel through his fingers at the start of the tape he saw the date and time notation est gm the scan continued for nineandaquarter hours without interruption each peak and valley every blip of an alpha spark or beta flash was duly recorded he saw the even rhythmic progress of his nights sleep his presence was accounted for but what about before the scan where had he been what had he done why couldnt he remember spence rolled up the tape and resealed the spool he had to get out of the lab and thinkor not think he decided on central park the humidity increased noticeably as he approached the concourse entrance to the park it was only when he smelled the slightly musty fragrance of the gardens atmosphere that he realized how flat was the carefully controlled and filtered air of the rest of the center he stepped down onto the turf and threw a hand up to protect his eyes from the dazzling brightness which engulfed him instantly the solar shields those immense louvered slats which could be opened or closed to regulate the amount of light allowed in upon the garden were open wide in an approximation of high noon spence stood blinking for some moments until his eyes became used to the brilliant light then struck along one of the many meandering pathways he followed the path toward the center of the garden and the greensward hoping to find an empty bench in one of the secluded nooks formed by the trees and hedges which were landscaped to provide privacy a quick survey of the perimeter showed that all the benches were taken mostly by young women soaking up the suns beneficial rays he had just about completed the circuit when he stopped in front of the last bench it too was occupied he was about to turn away when he realized he knew the owner of the upturned face and closed eyes mind if i sit down he asked the blue eyes fluttered open and a hand rose to shade them oh dr restonspence i mean please do sit down im taking up far more than my fair share of space he sat down at the extreme end of the bench and looked at the young lady realizing that he had nothing at all to say to her he smiled she smiled back idiot spence shrieked to himself say something the smile lingered evaporating at the edges did you have a successful meeting ari saved him by starting the conversation meeting oh no he thought im babbling again youve forgotten already you had a meeting with my fatheror was that some other dr reston is he back then you mean mr wermeyer hasnt called you yet i could say something to him if you like daddys been busy since he got back but you should have been called ill see what i can do i have a certain amount of pull you know no i wouldnt think of asking you ill wait my turn maybe it was another dr reston then the one i had in mind was quite insistent very urgentmatter of life and death apparently the crisis has passedi had time to cool off thanks for the offer though i still do want to see him well you may be in luck if you care to wait for a little while my fathers coming down to get me when his meetings over were going to lunch together you could talk to him then i wouldnt intrude dont be silly i dont mind anyway i wouldnt have offered if i still didnt feel a little guilty about treating you so disgracefully ive forgotten all about it believe me youre nice she smiled again and spence felt the warmth of it touch his face like the rays of the sun and in that moment without either one of them thinking very much about it without desiring it at all they became friends it was a natural thing for ari she had many friends and made friends easily for spence though it was quite a different thing he did not make friends easilyespecially with women he didnt know how to talk to them and never felt comfortable around them so it was with a shock that he realized some time later that he had spent over an hour talking with ari without for a moment feeling ill at ease and it was with a pang of genuine regret that spence saw the portly though dignified form of the gm director approaching from across the lawn oh daddy shouted ari jumping up spence stood as well daddy youll remember dr reston yes indeed the man called daddy held out a wide firm hand which spence took in his own and received vigorous shaking it is good to see you again director zanderson the last time spence had seen the director had been at a reception for the new grant winners a few days prior to making the jump i am always pleased to see one of our brightest new colleagues in fact i believe you have your first review coming up do you not yes i believe so i saw it on my calendar how do you like it here dr reston youre finding it all you hoped it would be yes and much more spence said truthfully daddy ive asked spence to join us for lunch i know how you love a new audience ari put her arm around her father who looked amused daughter the decorum of my office she kissed him on the cheek what will dr reston think tell me did you ever see such an impertinent young lady spence was saved from having to answer by ari who announced im starving lets go to lunch this instant or you will both have to carry my limp and languishing body through the garden to the commissary how would that suit your precious decorum dr reston i regret my daughters shocking manners his eyes twinkled at the sight of her but i reiterate her invitation would you join us there seemed to be no graceful way out so he said id be delighted they were walking back to their respective places spence to his lab the director to his office and ari to the cultural arts center it had been one of the most enjoyable lunches spence could remember they had eaten not in the commissary as he expected but in one of gothams four excellent restaurants the belles esprit a very commendable copy of a french cafe spence had not previously visited any of the restaurants anwas surprised and pleased to find them quite different from the commissaries he was less surprised to find that like exclusive restaurants on earth they were quite expensive the commissaries were free the restaurants were not they had dined on hearts of palm and artichoke vinaigrette and quiche lorraine and spence had come away feeling soothes and refreshedas much by the company as by the food anatmosphere the zandersons father and daughter proved them selves very convivial hosts they had so drawn him out that he talked a great deal more about himself than he ever did as a rule but he had enjoyed it and more than once during the meal he had looked up to discover aris bright blue eyes watching him with a curious expression now they were nearing the junction tube where he would leave them to go back to the lab for one who had inwardly shud dered at the luncheon invitation he was honestly sorry to setheir short time together end i hope youll consider my offer director zanderson was saying i think youd find the experience rewarding it would even help in your research i dare say a smart young man like yourselfi imagine you could devise a few experiments that would make the trip quite worthwhile spence was only half listening to the directors proposition im afraid that with my review coming up he started to object oh thats just a formality grinned the director besides should you decide to lead one of the research teams on the trip the review could be postponed or perhaps waived altogether terraforming is the futurevery exciting business i wish i could go back myself but duties you know he looked a little awkwardly at the director ari noticed his discomfort and came to his aid oh daddy terraforming is your great mania it isnt everyones quit badgering him about it im sure spencer has better things to do than to go roaming about on a dusty old rock i know i do the director clucked his tongue such a worrisome girl well i wont press you for an answer dr reston but i hope youll think it over the martian experience is truly fantastic i will think it over and thank you both for a most enjoyable lunch it was really very nice im glad you could join us i always like to get better acquainted with my colleagues well goodbye good afternoon said ari they turned and strolled arminarm off along the main axial spence watched them go and then started back along the tube to the lab tickler was waiting for him when he returned the fussy assistant appeared miffed about something he gave spence a series of sideways glances which spence figured were supposed to represent disapproval spence happily ignored the vague reproofsafter all he had just eaten lunch with the director there was nothing which could even remotely threaten his selfesteem at that moment well tickler how are we coming along this afternoon are we ready for tonights session i plan to increase the electroencephamine quotient by another five percent i would like to test the scanner before we run the experiment i havent forgotten tickler said he nodded toward the control room and spence saw that they had a visitor perhaps you will remember assigning me to secure our new assistant so soon you certainly didnt waste a minute very well lets meet him he motioned to the cadet who sat watching them through the control window the young man got up and came to stand beside tickler spence offered his hand to the short young assistant i see that you have already met dr tickler if i know him hes probably put you to work already im dr reston yesweve already met replied the stranger as they shook hands spence looked at him a little closer though the cadet seemed familiar he could not place him im sorry i dont expect youd remember said the cadet i bumped into you in the garden concourse one day a week or so ago kurt wasnt it he did remember the incident thats right kurt millen first year dlevel sector well very good to have you aboard i hope we can make this an interesting assignment for you i take it you approve of my choice asked tickler spence did not see the queer smirk which accompanied the question or he might have had second thoughts instead he said yes yes i think kurt will do just fine he can begin by helping you ready the scanner test while i prepare the encephamine the shift proceeded uninterrupted and as he worked spence thought again of his talk with ari and embarrassed himself with the warm feelings which accompanied those thoughts there is something about that girl he told himself be careful his cautious inner voice replied the golden mist had vanished in the empty howl of frigid winds roaring down from untold heights the lush green valley withered and turned brown the whitened wisps of dried grass and the petals of tiny yellow flowers flurried around him in the savagely gusting wind he shivered and wrapped his arms tightly across his chest in an effort to keep warm he stared down at his feet and saw that he stood upon hard barren ground around him he saw the sparkling glint of diamonds glittering in the icy glare of a harsh violent moon they were his tearsfrozen where they had fallen the hard earth would not receive them spence turned and lurched away and he was instantly standing on a vast open plain under a great windswept sky where thin clouds raced overhead to disappear beyond the horizon as he watched he was overcome by the urge to follow those feathery clouds to see where they went he began to run lifting his feet and leaning ahead but his legs did not obey properly each step dragged more slowly than the last as if his strength were being mysteriously sapped away soon his legs had grown too heavy to move he felt himself sinking into the arid soil sucked down as by quicksand he struggled to move as the dry red sand rose above his knees but his weight pulled him down and down by centimeters he screamed and his voice rang hollow in his ears he looked around and saw that he was trapped in a great glass bubble and the sand continued to rise now it seemed to be falling out of the sky burying him alive he felt the gritty sting and heard the dry bristling hiss as it pelted down on him it filled his hair and eyes he looked up and saw the glass bubble narrow far above him and sand pouring through a tiny opening to come trickling down as the sand rose to his chest he pushed it away with his arms but it fell relentlessly and soon he was deeper than before he screamed again and heard the ring of silence knowing that his cries could not be heard beyond the glass as the sand closed over his head he realized that he was trapped in an hourglass and the sand had just run out spence awoke with a gasp and sat bolt upright on the couch the sleep chamber was perfectly darka black velvety darkness which pressed in on him with an oppressive weight he could feel it enfolding him covering him smothering him he wanted to get up to run away and escape the awful presence of the dream but an unseen force held him in his place he lay back down slowly and as he did so he saw something in the heavy darkness which made his breath catch in his throat directly above him midway between the couch and where he judged the chamber ceiling to be a very faint greenish glow hovered shimmering in the dark he sank back into the cav couch and watched as the glow intensified and took the shape of a luminous wreath with tiny tendrils of light radiating out from it the center of the wreath was dim and unformed but he sensed that something dark and mysterious boiled within the radiant halo there was a familiarity about the glowing green halo which puzzled him he felt as if he had seen or experienced it before somewherebut where he could not remember still the sense of recognition persisted and with it mounting fear his body began to tremble in the center of the halo the dim outlines of amorphous shapes could be seen weaving themselves of blue light subtle and indistinct they flared and subsided shifting roiling synapsing inside the green aura the transparent blue fibrils sparked silver flashes that glittered when they touched the green halo the thing seemed to tug at him drawing him up and into it he had the sensation of falling he reached out a trembling hand to ward off the fall fear arced through him like a highvoltage shock his heart seized in his chest clamped tightly in an unseen fist blood drummed in his ears the swirling inner eye of the shining wreath distilled into a translucent core a round glimmering mass made up of tiny pinpoint flecks of pure light the ovoid shape spun slowly on its axis spence dug his fingernails into the fabric of the couch as his flesh began prickling to the thin needlelike tinkling of a sound felt rather than heard the sound of his dreams spence fought a wave of nausea rising in him sweat beaded on his forehead and upper lip he struggled weakly to look away but the force of the shining thing held him fast his mouth opened in a silent scream of terror his tongue cleaved to the roof of his mouth still the shimmering mass rotated slowly and spence sank even further into the depths of the nightmare he watched itturning turning refining itself pulling together creating itself out of atoms of light with eyes wide and horrorfilled spence at last recognized the solidifying shape it was a face and a face he knew too well to feel anything but the utmost dread and repulsion staring out at him from the blazing halo were the skeletal features of hocking hello dad listen thanks for coming down to the center the image on the screen peered back at him apprehensively can you see me okay fine i said thanks for coming down to the base i know it isnt easy for you are you all right spencer when they said you wanted to talk to me i was afraid something had happened to you hurried over as fast as i could the lady here said you were ill not illi had an accident a minor accident i fell down and hit my head thats all but when i went in for an aspirin they popped me into the med bay spence had stuck with his story about falling down and saw no reason to change it now he did not want to worry his father any more than he already had youre sure youre all right the face in the vidphone screen did not look reassured of course im all right it was nothing but since they wanted to keep me in here for a few hours i thought id have them patch in a signal to the base for me you get to do that when youre sick oh was all his father said anyway i havent been able to write or anything so i thought it might be fun if we could phone each otheralmost as good as being there is your work going all right fine dad everythings fine listen i wanted to tell you that i wont be able to call you again for a while im going to be pretty busy i may be going out with one of the research teams on a field assignment how long would that last spencer you wouldnt be gone too long no not too long spence lied a couple months thats all ill vidphone you when i get back he could see that his father did not understand what he was talking about he looked worn and worried and was apparently struggling to accept the fact that his son would be away longer than anticipated spence wished he had not called his breakingthenewsgently strategy was not working how have you been dad is kate taking care of you kate is very busy with the boys she has her hands full you know i dont like to bother her the boys are in fourth form dad theyre in school all day you wont bother her call her if you need anything will you do that i suppose so mr reston said doubtfully listen i have to go now i can leave here in a few minutes i only wanted to tell you not to worry about me if you dont hear from me for a while ill be working thats all he hated to tell his father like this but there was no way of telling him directly he would not have understood in all of spences growingup years his parents had never understood they did not comprehend his work nor could they follow his explanations when he tried to describe it to them he was simply too far beyond them he had eventually given up trying to make them understand he stopped trying to bridge the gap the image on the vidphone screen licked its lips nervously and leaned into the picture youll call when you get back yes its the first thing ill do i miss you spencer i miss you too dad goodbye goodbye son take care of yourself the screen went blank spence sat staring at the blank flickering screen for several moments then pushed the unit away it retracted back into a nook in a panel beside the bed he looked up just in time to see his physician approaching feeling better dr reston the medic came to stand at the head of his bed he entered a code on the data screen above the bed and read spences chart feeling fine dr williams with a good word from you ill be on my way said spence as cheerfully as he could im taking up too much of your time not at all were having a special this week free tuneups for all firsttime customers youre a lucky guy thanks but if its all the same to you ill take you up on that some other time he made a move to get up but a troubled look from the doctor stopped him whats the matter i was hoping you would tell me ii dont understand have you found something no youre perfectly healthy as far as we can determine but i think we should have a talk spence had a sinking feeling there is something wrong i think so yes the doctor drew up a stool and sat down beside spence who chewed his lip nervously not physically continued williams that is at least not in any of the areas we have checked out he gazed at his patient intently and spence got the idea he was being measured for his tensile strength like a spring being stretched to see how much it could take before snapping he waited for the tension to break spence the doctor started then hesitated bad sign thought spence whenever they use your first name it means trouble do you have any idea why youre here the calm physicians eyes watched him carefully his face a mask of impassive interest which gave away nothing yes spence laughed i tripped over a stool in the lab i bumped my head thats all you werent in your lab spence spence had had another blackoutthat much he knew he thought his story about bumping his head had been accepted without question he cringed at the thought ofwhat his memory was blank and that scared him more than anything no spence asked more timidly than he would have liked where was i then you were in the cargo bay air lock impossible who told you that the workers who found you they brought you in and i see no reason to doubt their story its on videotape all air locks are monitored for security spence was dumbfounded he could not believe what he was hearing theres something else he didnt like the doctors tone of voice whats that the air lock was depressurizing you were bleeding off air preparatory to opening the outer doors thats absurd why would i do a thing like that i dont know but id like to find out the doctor pulled a thin metallic object out of his pocket and began fingering it look if you think i wandered into an air lock and then depressurized it on purpose youre crazy that would be suicide the doctor shrugged sometimes people cant take it they want so badly to get out they dont wait for a shuttle you were lucky a cadet saw you heading for the air lock and reported it to the crew chief there were some workmen in pressure suits nearby another few seconds and youd have been beyond repair no im not buying it ill have to see the tapes before i believe it that can be arranged of course but i was hoping youd level with me if there is something bothering you i could help you dont understand i dont know what youre talking about i tripped and bumped my head that is all thats all you remember nothing else no unusual feelings lately nothing uncomfortable other blackouts perhaps spence winced at the word blackouts did the doctor know something more no there is nothing else the physician sighed heavily what are you going to do now i mean what will happen to me nothing youre free to go butyou wont i mean have to report this no i dont think so you dont seem to me to be in any immediate danger you are stable in other words thanks spence said darkly then i can go yes but i hope you will remember that my door is openif you think of anything else or want to talk about it further ill remember spence swung himself down from the high bed and followed dr williams out of the room in the small reception office he turned aside and pressed the access plate as the partition slid open he turned to nod to the physician who still watched him closely thank you dr williams goodbye one other thing dr reston with a sideways glance the medic stepped close and whispered you dont have any enemies do you that was a stupid foolish thing to do what were you i thinking of you imbeciles do you think this is some kind of game were not dealing with peasants this time gentlemen reston is a very intelligent sensitive man another mistake like the last one and he will smell the rat oh yes he will reston is smart and he is strongwilled we must handle him very carefully hocking glared at the two quaking before him maybe it would be better to get someone else suggested the younger of the two men are you questioning my decision do you doubt me look at me you two hockings eyes started from his skull and veins stood out on his forehead his lips drew back in a savage sneer it was only a suggestion muttered the offender anyway you said he wouldnt remember a thing shut up hockings chair rose in the air with a faint whir of its internal mechanism it swiveled away momentarily and when he turned again to face his henchmen his features had relaxed somewhat do either of you have any idea how close we are to our goal we are on the very threshold of a new epoch in human history think of it gentlemen the wealth of the universe will soon be oursand that is only the beginning our power will be limitless all mankind will bow before us well be gods gentlemen we will control the minds of the entire human race hockings voice was a whisper his eyes shone like hard black beads as the chair inched closer a sudden flash arced across the gap from hockings chair to his assistants and a tremendous cracking sound filled the room hocking opened his mouth and laughed as his helpers lay writhing on the floor beneath him just a taste of the agony awaiting those who disappoint me do not disappoint me again gentlemen now then pick yourselves up off the floor and listen to me we have work to do he had just reached the main access tube and was still pondering dr williamss question about possible enemies when he heard a voice behind him they let you go spence he turned to see ari hurrying up behind him it was nothing it must have been somethingyoure blushing dr reston he felt the crimson flush rise to his cheeks how did you find out about it he tried to sound unconcerned the director gets a list of all sick bay admissions i saw your name on the list i wanted to see how you were you came to see me yes but they said you had already been dismissed i must have missed you by only a few seconds are you sure youre all right im fine really just a little tired if youll excuse me he turned to leave but ari fell into step beside him linking her arm in his spence felt his skin tingle under her touch im on my way to my quarters ill walk with you she smiled her sunny smile at him you dont mind do you spencer no not at all they walked off together arm in arm spence imagined that everyone they passed stopped to gawk at them he tried to shrug off the feeling that this was anything but an innocent promenade a guy walking a girl to her door but to his shrunken sense of social etiquette the occasion loomed much larger they made their way along the tube to a main axial and then toward the adsec cluster where ari and her father had their quarters she kept up a running monologue the whole way relieving spence of the obligation to provide anything more than a perfunctory nod or grunt he paid little attention to what she said wondering instead how he might gracefully excuse himself and make his getaway he told himself he had more important things to do than escort aggressive young women around the space station he wanted to free himself to think about what was happening to him well here we are said ari they stood before a buffcolored panel would you like to come in ill make some tea tea well i dont think please do id like it very much if you would she had already punched her access code into the digits of the glowing plate and the panel slid open she kept her hold on his arm and tugged him gently inside he stepped hesitantly through the portal and looked around the zandersons quarters were quite plush much more luxurious than his own spartan accommodations its shocking i know but it cant be helped im afraid she followed his gaze around the large spacious rooms the director does live welltoo well perhaps oh i dont know said spence its a tough job he needs a place like this to unwind you cant do that in a cubbyhole still i feel guilty sometimes look at thiscarpet on the floors yet it must have cost a fortune to lug that up here and leather furniture i like it its beautiful sure its beautiful go ahead and take a seat i wont be a minute spence settled himself into the soft leather cushions at one end of a long handsome couch he rubbed his hand absently over the dark polished grain of the leather and wondered how long it had been since he had felt anything so fine so natural next to him on a low teak table sat a star globe with an earth the size of a grapefruit surrounded by a transparent shell upon which were painted the major stars of the galaxy it was an exquisite antique next to the globe was a picture in a walnut frame a striking darkhaired woman smiled out from the picture and spence realized at once where ari had come by her good looks but there was an unsettling quality about the picture the womans eyes were not focused on the camera they held a distant aloof look almost a vacant stare though the woman smiled warmly her smile did not light up those cold empty eyes it was as if two separate pictures had been somehow overlapped two very different moods had been captured in that single photographic moment and the effect was chilling ari returned and saw him studying the picture she placed the tray of tea things on the table and began to pour your mother he asked still looking at the photograph yes said ari she did not look up i dont think ive ever met her is she here no shes not prefers the earth beneath her feet is that it mother ari started and then hesitated she glanced at spence and then looked away mother isnt with us anymore im sorry i didnt know he raised his mug to his lips and sipped ow oh careful its hot i should have warned you did you burn yourself ill live an uneasy silence settled over the room spence shifted nervously in his seat i wanted to come up here in the worst way said ari after a while i thought it would be an adventure disappointed a little i know what you meanits like an enormous office building only you can never go outside youre right if not for the garden i dont know what id do well id go berserk i know i would you could leave any time you wanted couldnt you why do you stay daddy he needs me besides this being my first jump i could never let it be said that the directors daughter couldnt even endure one tour of duty youll get used to it everyone does not everyone ive already seen several who havent its a frightening thing spence found the conversation had wandered too close to a topic he did not wish to explore he changed the subject good tea thank you she bent her head and sipped from her steaming mug he watched the delicate curve of her neck and the way the light reflecting off the table filled the hollow of her throat her blond curls swung down as she drank and she tossed them back with an easy practiced flip their eyes met spence looked away i should be going i have to get back to work i sat around in sick bay a little longer than i should have i think very well but you must promise to come again soon i will he rose to his feet and headed for the door ari followed him and said as the panel slid open spence i almost forgot were having a function here tomorrow evening i mean second shift youre invited i am since when since right now im inviting you its just a few of the faculty and research people daddy thinks its a good idea for the two groups to mix youll fit right in i dont know ill think about it he stepped through the portal please come ill expect you the sliding panel cut her short and spence headed back to the lab he thrust his hands deep into the side pockets of his jumpsuit and ambled along with his head down soon he was lost in thought over his inexplicable behavior in the cargo bay assuming that the physician was rightand there was no reason to doubt himwhat had he been doing down there why couldnt he remember im cracking up i am losing my mind are you relaxed spencer yes i am going to give you a new suggestion are you ready yes i want you to think about the color blue do you under stand think of all the things that are blue and that suggest the color blue to you the color blue spencer blue the wind had risen out of the east and spence turned his face into it it blew cold and the sky above glowered down in a fierce blueblack rage close by he heard the chop of water as waves dashed themselves against rocks in the shallows he turned to the sound and saw the ocean stretching out to the horizon blue under the dark blue clouds he looked into the clear blue water and saw small silverblue fish darting by in schools speeding like tiny rockets away into deeper space suddenly spence was with them he felt himself sinking into the water as around him the fish flashed through the blue halflight of their frigid world he could see their silver sides zigzagging off into the murky distance he could see their large round eyes staring at him as they fled down and down he sank slowlylike a coin spinning over and over to rest finally upon the silt at the oceans bottom he felt the ocean floor rise up beneath his feet and as he touched down he realized he was not in the water at all he raised his eyes and saw that he had dropped into an enormous cavern whose high vaulted roof arched away into blue shadows curiously formed projections sprouted from the floor and dangled from the ceiling these were translucent and faintly luminous glowing with a cool greenishblue inner light he walked a few hesitant steps among them as among the timbers of a silent forest his footsteps echoing back to him from the dark depths of the cave he became aware of another sound which seemed to come humming up from beneath the floor through his feet and into his bones a grinding sound which grew louder as he descended deeper into the tunnel spence walked among the glowing stalagmites following the sound soon he heard a rhythmic thrumming as if the earth were churning grinding the great stone roots of the mountains to dust the sound grew until it filled the cavern he walked on as if drawn to its source his stomach vibrated with the rumble and he smelled a sharp bitter scent in the dank air of the cave far ahead he saw a pulsing blue light illuminating a far wall of the cave he felt something gritty on his lips he raised a hand to his face and saw that it was covered with a fine blue powder the grit fell down upon him in a gentle rain drifting like fine snow covering his clothing and hair then he was standing on the brink of a vast chasm which split the cavern floor the rumble had grown to thunder deafening him as raking light flashed blue lightning around him the gritty powder rose like smoke from a pit as he gazed into the chasm something was moving in the churning depths of the holeas if some enormous beast were thrashing out its life in agony in the darkness he made out a roiling black mass heaving and subsiding groaning and shuddering amidst the roar now jagged flashes of blue lightning tore through the darkness illuminating the pit clinging to the rocks he lowered himself to peer over the edge deep into the chaos below in the piercing glare of the lightning bolts he saw strange shapes tumbling and tumbling grinding against one another crushing each other and sending up an endless cloud of powdery blue grit like a velvet mist another flash peeled away the darkness and he saw clearly into the tumbling mass below some of the shapes were elongated and curved others round and bulky as boulders still others long and thin in that instant he realized what it was that filled the huge stone caldron bones the gigantic bones of prehistoric monsters whirled below him in perpetual motiona disjointed dance macabre in that instant of recognition he felt his grip on the rocks give way and he fell he twisted in the air and his hands clawed for a scrabbling hold on the smooth rock face but it was too late he plunged screaming into the grinding churning dance of the bones spence came to himself sitting upright on the couch the trailing echo of his scream still rang in the darkened chamber like a fading memory but the dream had vanished like a vapor it was gone and he could remember nothing but the terror that had awakened him presently the lights began to come up faintly he guessed that tickler stood behind the glass and heard the scream tickler he called yes sir his assistants voice grated metallically through the overhead speakers did i scream just now im sorry did you hear anything unusuala scream a yell anything like that when dr reston just now when i woke up no sir the alarm went off in the control booth so i turned on the lights that is the procedure youre quite right thank you his heart was still beating rapidly he could feel the tension in his shoulders and neck his hands still clutched the sides of the cav couch in a death grip he felt certain the scream had been real that it was not merely part of his dream but why would tickler lie about a thing like that perhaps he had not been in the booth when spence screamed or perhaps he was covering up the fact that he had himself dozed off at his post possibly but it was not like tickler spence rose and stretched and made his way into the control room tickler was just winding the scan onto a spool spence watched him finish and place a seal on the loose end will that be all for now tickler asked yes you may go i wont be needing anything further this shift but tell kurt when he comes in that id like the log posted and id like to see the averages for the last three sessions the averages yes just as soon as he gets them finished but we have never dont argue tickler please just do as i say i know its a little extra work but thats what we have an assistant for isnt it very well ill tell him tickler turned brusquely and went out i wonder whats eating him this time with tickler it was always something spence brushed the thought from his mind and left the control booth crossed the lab and entered his quarters despite the nights sleep he did not feel at all rested he felt as though he had run several miles or climbed a sheer rock cliff his muscles were tense and knotty and he could smell that he had sweated through his underclothes he thought to sanitize and change but then had a better idea the exerdome why not he could use the exercise maybe he would find a threesome who needed a fourth for a game of pidg as he donned his silvered mylar exersuit it occurred to him that perhaps his problems stemmed from stress and overwork he had exercised little since coming to gotham except for his occasional rambles through the garden and a swim now and then he had indulged in no physically strenuous activity a fast game of pidg or a few laps around the dome would loosen him up and relax him he took a main axial to the lowgray central tower of the city nearly weightless he sprang four meters from the corridor to the lift and stepped onto a disc pulling up the handgrips as it engaged the belt up he rose to the dome he could hear laughter and shouts pinging down the metal tube from above it reminded him of going swimming as a boy and hearing the sounds of happy frolic ringing from the pool a long way off when the lift gate opened he stepped off onto the spongy surface of the domeor rather bounced off with the first step for he was now completely weightless he spun awkwardly for a moment before remembering to pull in his arms and legs to regain control he brought his knees up to his chest and when he floated near enough to the curved surface once again thrust his legs down he arrowed off the side of the dome and flew straightway toward the center high above him a net stretched across the observation portion of the dome to keep errant human missiles from colliding with the tempered glass beyond the netting he could see a bright mist of stars hanging in their inky void lower he could see the upsidedown crescent of the moon and the smaller blue thumbnail slice of the earth spence flew into the netting tucked his head down and landed on his back he pulled himself across the net to a near wall above him a group of cadets performed an intricate display of aerial acrobaticsdoing flips and somersaults across the center of the dome around the perimeter several joggers sped along the track another group ran perpendicular to the first a couple of fluffy pidg birds floated down near the lift platform no one seemed interested in getting up a game so spence swam to the edge of the net and walked up the great bulging sphere of the dome to the red strip designated as the track the tracks surface bore a slightly irregular bumpy grain which gave a runner that little extra bit of traction needed to get moving in zero gravity spence carefully set his feet on the track and then started walking smoothly with exaggerated care one false step and he would go spinning off toward the center of the dome but he maintained his concentration and increased the pace feeling the illusion of weight return to him actually it was only momentum he felt and which held him to the track soon he was running easily around the inner wall of the dome he caught the other joggers on the track and fell into pace with them in the rhythm of running his muscles relaxed and the tension flowed from him automatically his body took over and his mind turned once again to the enigma of his dreams that he dreamed was certain his rem line on the scan showed plainly what he knew instinctively and if he required further proof the emotional residuethat silt left behind when the angry waters had raced onwas real enough not to remember a dream was normal enough one remembered only the tiniest fraction of ones dreams over a lifetime they simply flitted by in the nightspun out of the stuff of the subconscious and reabsorbed into the fabric of the psyche upon waking but blackouts were not normal spence felt as if whole chunks of his life were missing there were gaps in his memory which he could not cross dark curtains behind which he could not see that scared him more than the nightmares more than the cargo bay incident he feared the helplessness the utter defenselessness of not knowing what was happening to him the carefully reasoned and researched framework of his life teetered precariously threatening to topple completely and he did not know what to do about it he lowered his head and spurted past the others his lungs burned and sweat stung his eyes but he continued running faster and faster as if to escape the fear which came swimming out of the darkness of the starspangled night beyond the netting closing his eves he thrust the fear from him as if it were a solid object he could throw aside after his run spence lay motionless in the center of the dome turning slowly on his own axis like a minor planet the warm glow of exertion throbbed through his limbs he had reached that blissful state of exhaustion where body and spirit were reconciled one to the other and the universe hummed with peace he listened to the play of others and watched through halfclosed lids as the red line of the track circled him aimlessly it was he thought a tribute to the supreme egotism of the mind that he seemed completely stationary while the entire space city of gotham revolved around him around and around it went spinning in its own lazy orbitnow the black mirror of the observation bubble now the red line of the track the red line of the track something about that seemed important spence jerked his head up and sent himself floundering away at an obtuse angle in the same instant it came to him the red line of the track was the red line of his sleep scan he had meant to check it but had forgotten or the thought had been driven from his mind by the circumstances of his latest blackout suddenly it seemed more important than ever he dove for the nearest wall and then propelled himself toward the lift platform he raced back to the lab with his heart pounding and the certainty drumming in his brain that he was very close to finding an answer to the riddle of his dreams spence snapped the seal and unrolled the strip to the beginning watching meters and meters of paper tape unwind through his fingers at the start of the tape he saw the date and time notation est gm the scan continued for nine and threequarter hours without interruption each peak and every valley every blip of an alpha spark or beta flash was duly recorded he saw the minute fluctuations in cerebral blood flow the rise and fall of body temperature heart rate and thyroid activity the intermittent rem flutters he saw in short the even rhythmic progress of his nights sleep his every moment was accounted for undeniably sohe held the evidence in his own hands but it was not enough he turned to the cabinet where all the spools were kept there were dozens of them each one containing the polysomnographic information of one nights sleep session he lifted the row containing the scans of the last week he checked each one they were all there labeled and sealed correctly he checked the week before that and the next one too all was in order tickler was as precise as he was stuffy spence knew that if he looked at every spool over the last ten weeks he would find them in order still a small gray shadow of doubt clung to his mind he turned once more to the scan he had unrolledthe one from the night of his first blackout three days ago he pulled the tape through his hands and examined it closely it was no different from all the others he spied the yellow plastic cover of the log book on the corner of the console and pulled it to him on top of the log book lay a piece of green graph paper on which was plotted the averages spence had requested for the last three sessions kurt must have come in and finished it while he was out he glanced at the graph of the averages and then opened the log book and traced up the columns to the session of the fifteenth he found no irregularities in any of the figures or information he closed the book with the sinking feeling that all was in order and only he was out of sync he threw the book down on the console and leaned back with his hands clasped behind his head if an answer existed to his problems it would have to exist in some form in the hard data before him somewhere in the miles of tape or in the figures in the book the key to the locked room of his mind could be found of that he was certain his faith in the scientific method stood on solid unshakable rock on a whim he swiveled to the data screen at one end of the console the waferthin halfsilvered glass shone smooth as polished stone mira said spence spence reston here ready for command a mellifluous female voice said ready dr reston spence uttered the simple command compare entries for psg seven series ltst fivefifteen to fiveeighteen for similarties display only please he laced his fingers behind his head and leaned back in his chair instantly the wafer screen flashed to life and the results began filling the screen it seemed there were many similarities between one nights scan and the next in terms of basic numerical components all of the information gathered during a scanning session was translated into numbers for purposes of data storage and retrieval they were all alike in many ways and yet all different the command was too broad that much he could see but he did not know how to narrow the question because he did not know precisely what he was looking for he crossed his arms over his chest and frowned at the screen just what did he hope to find after several minutes of hard thought he stood and began pacing the cramped confines of the booth compare and contrast he thought thats where you start on a fishing expedition of this type compare and contrast he had already compared and that had not shown him anything out of the ordinary perhaps contrasting the same information would produce something he turned to the screen and said contrast psg ltst entries for fivefifteen to fiveeighteen display only please the numbers vanished and in their place the screen began printing zero contrast within normal range of variability in other words dead end spence glanced at the digiton above the console in a few minutes tickler would arrive to begin the session he did not want tickler to find him here like this playing detective a silly thought he knew have a perfect right to examine the data of my own experiment for goodness sakesbut he preferred that tickler should know nothing about his inquiry judging he had time for two more stabs in the dark he said compare psg ltst seven series entries fivefifteen to fiveeighteen for similarities of less than one percent variability display only please he nodded with satisfaction by decreasing the percentage of variability he had narrowed the question significantly in moments mira came back with its findings the message read zero comparison spence frowned again there were apparently no great similarities or differences in any of the scans beyond the normal range of his individual sleep pattern with a sigh he kicked back his chair this kind of blind fumbling was useless unless he knew what he hoped to discover no amount of random searching would help thank you mira that is all for he stopped in midsentence it occurred to him that he had not compared all of the scans only those from the fifteenth to the eighteenththe two dates encompassing his blackouts mira compare all psg ltst seven series entries display entries with similarities of less than one percent variability there was a slight hesitation the wafer screen went blank he imagined he could hear the chips crackling with speeding electrons as mira wracked her magnetic memory spence sat on the edge of his chair and watched the clock tick away the seconds any moment tickler would come walking in hurry spence muttered hurry then the words appeared he read the message as it came up psg ltst seven series entries with less than variability and jackpot spence jumped out of his chair and stared at the screen in disbelief there it was an anomaly too large to exist its very presence an impossibility if he had discovered it any other way he would have chalked it up to a computer glitch but he had a strong suspicion that it was no glitch he had uncovered a vital bit of informationstumbled blindly over it more likebut there spelled out in fluorescent orange was the evidence he picked up the yellow log book and paged through to the entry of he pulled the sheet and placed it next to the entry of they were not at all similar each entry in ticklers neat precise hand was slightly differentnot enough to vary a great deal but enough for spence to see that they were both unique apparently mira had glitched after all there was no similarity between the two scans spence heard the swoosh of the panel opening and ticklers quick footsteps entering the lab he said that is all mira thank you good evening dr reston good evening tickler spence turned and forced what he hoped was a casual smile are we ready to begin our session ticklers small weasel eyes glanced from spence to the wafer screen above the terminal oh i meant to tell you about that i am canceling the session this evening spence surprised himself with that announcement i dont understand sir ive prepared everythingwere all ready if you never mind it can wait i have something else for you to do tonight you and kurt that is i want you to run averages for the last two weeks i think a curve may emerge that we may want to explore that should take you most of the session i think butpardon my askingwhat are you going to do spence could see that tickler was upset the inflexible little man did not bend easily to the unexpected im going to a function at the directors suite i imagine it will be rather late when i get back so when you finish you can go i will expect to see you tomorrow first shift spence turned to leave ticklers jaw pumped the air in silence yes was there something else tickler shook his head he had recovered himself no i imagine we can handle it from here he snapped good night then said spence stepping from the booth he smiled a devious smile to himself as he crossed the lab to his quarters a quick change and he would still make the party in plenty of time spence donned a clean informal nonregulation jumpsuit and struck off for the directors quarters he was pleased with himself for remembering the party at the last secondit was perfect he wanted to get away from the lab and out of ticklers presence to think about his discovery what exactly if anything did it mean at the time it had seemed electrifyingly significant now as he hurried along the crowded trafficways of gotham flowing with the changing shifts his startling revelation seemed a little on the trivial side there were at least a dozen different ways of accounting for the match up of the two entries spence ticked them off one by one as he dodged and elbowed his way to the zandersons by the time he arrived at the buffcolored portal he had convinced himself that his discovery lacked any real bones it would never stand up there had to be more something else that would tell him what this bare shred of fact meant what that something was he had no idea spencer im so glad to see you come in ari beamed at him over the threshold as the panel slid open spence shook himself out of his reverie and returned her smile i hope im not too late she drew him into the room which was humming with the conversation of the guests several turned to regard the newcomer with frank disapproving glances most ignored his entrance i think some of your guests are sorry i bothered to show up at all nonsense silly you just havent been properly introduced come along daddy will want to do the honors ari steered him into the gathering and around conversational cliques to where her father held forth at a buffet urging tiny sandwiches on doubtful patrons he was surrounded by womenthe wives of faculty and fellows decided spencewho tittered politely at his jokes while they picked among the delicacies offered on the board daddy look whos here ari took her fathers arm and expertly wheeled him around to face spence dr reston good of you to come kind of you to invite me here get yourself a plate and dig in the rumaki is delicious thank you maybe a little later i daddy i told spencer that you would introduce him to some of the others wont you please oh of course id be delighted to looktheres olmstead packer head of high energy come along whos that with him another new face i believe director zanderson piloted them both forcefully ahead through the standing clusters of socializers spence bobbed along in his wake out of the corner of his eye he saw ari disappear into a knot of partygoers with a plate of hors doeuvres he abandoned himself to his immediate fate tell me dr reston have you thought any further about the research trip why yes ive considered it im not pressing not pressing oh here we are gentlemen the director broke in on the two men clapping a hand on a shoulder of each id like you to meet dr reston biopsych before any further introductions could take place the man previously identified as packer thrust out a hand and said glad to meet you im olmstead packer and this is my colleague adjani rajwandhi ill leave you gentlemen to become better acquainted dont forget to go by the buffet now dont be bashful the director left spence in the care of his new acquaintances and plunged back into the swirl olmstead packer laughed heartily and said there goes a dynamo a rolypoly dynamo why if we could harness that energyjust think these hien bookworms remarked rajwandhi they cannot stand to see anything without an outlet in it they think all the world is a power grid not true adjani not true at all the universe is one big reactor and were all subatomic particles bounding around in our random orbits packer smiled broadly spence took to the big redbearded cherub immediately with his kinky red hair that looked like rusty steel wool and his droopylidded brown eyes he appeared an almost comic figure always on the verge of laughing out loud adjani on the other hand was a slight mongoose of a man who looked at the world through keen eyes bright and hard as black diamonds he had about him an air of mystery which spence found intriguing and slightly exotic dr rajwandhi is a fellow of my department began packer but not of your discipline interrupted adjani nosadly not of our discipline what project are you attached to dr rajwandhi asked spence politely to my colleagues i am just adjani please i am currently assigned to the plasma project this is under dr packers supervision you flatter me adjani roared packer his teeth flashing white from out of the auburn tangle of his beard he said to spence adjani here is under no ones supervision the man has not yet been born who can keep up with him and he does not know how to take direction can i help it if god granted me full measure of what other men possess only in part youll get no argument from me snake charmer ill sing your praises from here to jupiter and back turning once more to spence he explained adjani is our spark plugand the best in the business spence looked at the slim adjani with new respect a spark plug as they were called was a member of an elite group of men and women so gifted as to be completely expert in numerous fields of studyas many as five or six whereas most scientists and theoricians were specialists training their professional vision to ever narrower bands of the scientific spectrum those like adjaniand there were very few of themworked in reverse enlarging the scope of their knowledge wider and wider in effect they were specialists in everything physics chemistry astronomy biology metallurgy psychology and all the rest most often they were employed as systematiciansmen who could view the overall course of a project and draw valuable information from other areas of study and bring it to bear upon a particular problem they acted as catalysts of creativityspark plugsproviding those quick dynamic bursts of creative insight for projects that had grown too complex to rely on the accidental crosspollinization of ideas from other disciplines they were the connection men making much needed connections between the problem at hand and useful data from areas unrelated to the project which nevertheless offered possible insight or solutions to stubborn problems and connection men were in great demand science had long ago realized that it could no longer afford to wait for chance to match up and germinate the ideas from which scientific breakthroughs were born the system if it was to remain healthy and viable needed help the scientific method needed the boost that geniuses like adjani could give so spence was duly impressed he had never met a spark plug there were not many of them and the discipline was still too new to have penetrated into all branches of study mostly connection men were snapped up by the bigger and more lavishly funded programs like high energy or laser physics im glad to know you adjani said spence and he meant it olmstead packer fixed on spence with keen interest tell us about yourself me i ah spence could not think of a thing to say im new here this is my first jumpyear i thought so this is adjanis first jump too i had one devil of a time trying to get him up here cal tech had their claws in him and didnt want to let him go youre not from cal tech are you nonyu why do you ask oh it just seems that i remember a dr reston from cal techbut it couldnt be why that was years ago now that i think of it its not an uncommon name spence could not bring himself to admit that packer was talking about his father dr restonthe professor spence had never known he did not want to discuss his fathers breakdown did you attend cal tech asked spence stanford replied packer proudly though most of my time was spent at jpl you are engaged in the ltst sleep study correct why yes fascinating work said packer and vital said adjani if we are ever to probe beyond our solar system we must understand the delicate psychological balance between sleep and mental wellbeing can the sleep state be prolonged indefinitely is it a function of certain chemical interactions within the brain can individual sleep patterns be molded to the changing demands of space flight very interesting very important questions you are working on dr reston my friends call me spence now it was spences turn to be flattered adjani true to his calling seemed to know intimately the nature of his work tell me spence do you think well be able to put our crews to sleep for say a year or two on a trip between stars thats a tough one spence puffed out his cheeks and let the air whistle through his teeth it is not entirely out of the question though i admit right now it looks like a long shot this is still virgin territory were exploring you understand our expectations are likely to run beyond our abilities for some time to come you are a pioneer spence and a cautious one that is good adjani smiled at him packer asked the question with ulterior motives i surmise oh how so spence raised his eyebrows and regarded packer with mock suspicion see what did i tell you hes a quick one all right yes i admit it i had something in mind and i though i might get a little comfort from your answer olmstead is leading the research trip this year since hes taking sixteen of his thirdyear students with him he dreads the flight it isnt the flight i mind its my third trip to mars and i get so bored five weeks is a long time to occupy oneself aboard a bucketi wouldnt mind a long nap it would not take five weeks if you and your hien theorists would stop theorizing and perfect the plasma drive jibed adjani the big physicist pulled a hurt face and shook his head wearily see spence see what i have to put up with now its my fault that we have no plasma drive just between you and me dr reston i think adjani is a saboteur sent from cal tech to disrupt our experiments they would like to be first to patent the plasmaion drive ive been thinking about coming along on the research trip myself director zanderson has asked me then you must come by all means said adjani not so fast do you play pidg packer fixed him with a hard look after a fashion yes ive not had a great deal of zerog experience but i like the game fine that settles it you must come and you must be on our team the faculty and students always have a pidg tournament during the mars cruise it has become something of a tradition and an object of intense competition the only trouble is not many of the faculty indulge in the sport they lose consistently remarked adjani i really havent made up my mind i have so much to do here if zanderson has suggested you go i would think seriously about it he does not extend the invitation to everyone you are fortunate to have it come so soon they talked a long time though to spence it seemed only seconds when olmstead packers wife came to pry her husband loose to mix with some of her friends adjani excused himself as well and vanished into the press around the buffet spence felt naked and obvious having no one to talk to the camaraderie he had experienced with the two men evaporated all too quickly i thought id never get you back said a voice behind him he turned to see ari standing there she seemed always to be popping up unexpectedly im driftingsave me he said it didnt look to me like you needed saving it looked like you were having a good time no i mean now she smiled shyly and said ill save you would you like something to eat daddy will be most disappointed if you dont at least try the mousse id love to try it ari led the way to the buffet and spence followed gladly he had begun to feel that above all else he did not want to be lonely anymore the buffet looked as if it had been attacked by sharks daddys pride and joylook at it now lamented ari she handed spence a plate and took one herself oh well we might as well join in the plunder lets dig in they inched their way along the table laden with platters and serving dishes containing a varied and exotic fare shrimp on ice salmon aspic sweet and sour meatballs souffl–πs of several kinds quiches a great cheddar wheel cold roast beef and ham baby lobster tails relishes and pickles brandied pears deviled crabs avocados stuffed with chicken and tuna salad petits fours cakes and many other delicacies some of which spence did not readily recognize not that it made a difference whether he recognized any particular dish ari adroitly ushered them through the snarl of elbows and reaching hands and filled both plates while spence tagged after her trying not to spill anything oh no sighed ari as they arrived at a great empty bowl the cut glass vessel appeared to have been recovered from a mud wallow just as i feared the mousse is gone too bad but i think i know where there may be some more follow me they edged through the crowd and dodged diners who stood on the periphery holding their plates to their mouths she led him away from the confusion of the gathering through a dim passageway and into a room which had been transformed into a makeshift kitchen it looked more like the staging area for a major battle several employees of gothams food service worked over platters valiantly attempting to reconstruct beauty from the spoils on the plates before them replacing wilted lettuce and replenishing depleted items they worked deftly and quickly shouldered their trays and faced once more into the fray we should have come here first murmured ari its quieter heres the mousse or whats left of it she picked up a spoon and shook a healthy dollop onto his already overflowing plate it will take me a week to eat all this nonsense ive seen you eat remember he looked around for a place to sit there were no chairs in the room at all shall we join the others asked ari i would rather face lions she raised an eyebrow that was the right answer i know a place that may not have been discovered come along they ducked out through a side door and across the hallway into a small vestibule he gathered the room was a sort of private sitting room bookshelves lined the walls on three sides on the fourth there was a large abstract green painting above a low couch a table in front of the couch bore the telltale traces of diners who had eaten and departed leaving behind the litter of their repast daddy calls this his reading room he says its cozier than his library or office most often he just comes in here to nap they sat down on the couch and fell to eating at once spence sampled a bite of each of the items on his plate in turn before devouring them one at a time its very good he mumbled around a mouthful only the best for our guests he regarded her with a look of genuine gratitude thanks for inviting me i dont usually he stopped im glad i came she looked down at her plate im glad you came too i guess i didnt think you would to tell you the truth i didnt either what changed your mind i dont know maybe im just a pushover for chocolate mousse then well have to serve it more often she said gaily but youre not eating yours he glanced down at his plate it had become a muddied palette of confused colors and textures he put it down on the table in front of him i dont like mousse he admitted she laughed then and to spence it seemed as if the room suddenly brightened silly then why did you let me give it to you i dont know you seemed to be enjoying yourself ari blushed slightly and lowered her head well i am she seemed to become flustered then and said no more silence reclaimed the room and laid a gulf between them it grew until neither one wanted to cross it the atmosphere became sticky ari im not too good at this sort of thing spence was surprised to hear his own voice bleating uncertainly into the vacuum you dont have to say anything said ari she raised her blue eyes to his i understand its just that i words failed him please it isnt important she smiled at him and cocked her head to one side i think we should rejoin the party daddy will wonder what happened to me youre right spence stood slowly ari remained seated and he looked down on her and then offered his hand and helped her to her feet thanks he said softly they crossed the room and ari turned putting on her jaunty demeanor again once more the vivacious hostess well be lucky if they dont eat the tablecloth as well she said as they passed the buffet well next time i get hungry for mousse i know where to come said spence she turned to him and placed her hand on his arm i hope you wont wait that long before he could answer she whirled away into the crowd and was gone spence walked back to his quarters alone in a mood of fluttery anticipation almost wonder he had forgotten his anxiety of only hours before in fact he had forgotten a great many things what had taken possession of him now left no room for those darker thoughts though he had no name for what he felthaving never felt it beforehe knew it to be in no small way connected with the person of ariadne zanderson the warmth of the feeling surprised and confused him it was wholly beyond his rational ability to describe it seemed to defy objective analysis leaving him fumbling for an explanation like a man groping for a light switch in a dark room that the elusive feeling might be love did not occur to him he punched in his code and the panel whispered back admitting him into the darkened lab neither tickler nor kurt were to be seen he guessed they had finished and gone long ago that suited him he did not care to think about the project tickler or the scans all he wanted was to throw off his jumpsuit and flop into bedwhich he did after leaving an alarm call with mira spence peered into the depths of a vast chasm as the rumble of underground thunder shook the rocks he clung to fearfully his inward parts trembled to the awesome roar below him whirling in the seething darkness he could see strange shapes churning and grinding sending up a fine blue powder like a velvet mist great jagged flashes of blue lightning rent the air and peeled away the darkness of the pit he looked down and saw clearly into the tumbling mass below in the fleeting illumination of the lightning he saw the groaning shuddering grinding contents of the pit bones the enormous skeletal remains of gigantic prehistoric creatures thrashing in perpetual motion a bolt of lightning raked the rock on which he perched and he felt his hands torn away as he fell backward into the chasm he twisted in the air his fingers clawing empty space for a hold on the rock it was too late spence plunged screaming into the whirling dance of the bones down and down he spun turning and turning the fine blue grit ascending on the warm updrafts stung his eyes and filled his nose and mouth choking him he squirmed and gasped as black mists closed around him the sound of the terrible rumbling thunder gradually died away he dropped like a stone through formless space he felt nothing and heard nothingonly the beating of his own heart and the thump of his blood as it pounded in his ears he felt as if he would fall forever he told himself the notion was absurd perhaps thought spence i am not falling at all but what else could it be all at once a new terror seized his mind he was shrinking instantly he could feel himself becoming smaller dwindling by fine degrees becoming ever smaller though he had no point of reference by which to gauge himself he felt that by now he must be very tiny and still the shrinking continued this is the way it will end thought spence the universe imploding on itself racing back into its flash of creation compressing its atoms back into that single elemental spark from which all matter was born and he was part of it he was one with it now and forever there was no waking this time spence was fully conscious of his surroundings and was aware too that he had been conscious for some time there simply was no dividing line he could point to and say here i was asleep and here awake the shadowy line between waking and dreaming had been erased it no longer existed in spences mind dream and reality had merged before him hung the shimmering iridescent halo of blue light with its tendrils glowing faintly as they waved in the darkness of his quarters the luminous tendrils seemed to be reaching out for him pulling him up into the green shining halo he felt the rising pulling falling sensation and knew that he had felt it before in just this way he knew that he had experienced all this beforethe shining wreath the glistening tendrils the shapeless mass moving darkly in the centerhe knew it but there was no memory of it there was simply a knowing he watched in grim fascination as the swirling inner eye of the halo condensed into a glimmering mass of light he felt a pressure in his chest his lungs burned and he realized he had been holding his breath his heart flung itself against his ribs and he could smell the fear rising from him as the reek from the fur of a wet animal but the thing held him firmly in his place the terror seemed merely a physical response he noted it with scientific curiosity as one might note the progress of water boiling in a beaker and turning into steam or chart the stages of a well known chemical reaction the horror he felt belonged to another part of him and that part no longer connected with his mind a sound like needles clinking or glass slivers breaking against one another rose in volume he noted the sound and marked how it seemed to tingle on the surface of his skin he gazed more deeply into the green halo and saw the forms within weaving themselves into vaguely human shapes these ghostly features then hardened into the recognizable form of a facethe thin wasted face of hocking spence blinked back dully at the leering apparition his mouth was dry he could not speak or cry out the will to do so had left him hocking began speaking to him saying you are becoming accustomed to the stimulus spencer that is good you are making remarkable progress soon we will begin a few simple commands but one thing is needed yet before you are ready we must establish a permanent mental link through which my thought impulses can travel to you heretofore i have been sending suggestions to you through your dreams when our minds are linked however i shall be able to do so in your waking state as well hocking smiled his skeletal smile and spence held in his place stared impassively ahead this will not harm you soothed hocking relax close your eyes empty your mind of all thought think only of the color blue concentrate on the color blue spencer think of nothing else spence obeyed the images commands he closed his eyes and filled his mindscreen with an intense vibrant shade of blue he relaxed his clenched fists and slumped his head hung forward and his chin rested on his chest in a moment i will tell you to open your eyes and look at me but not before i tell youdo you understand concentrate do exactly as i say concentrate spence felt his consciousness slipping away it was as if his soulall that which he called spence and recognized as himselfbegan flowing from him poured out like liquid from a bottle the sensation sent a quiver up his spine and through his limbs once more the highpitched tinkling sound increased boring through the top of his head and into his skull dizziness overcame him and with it a tough little kernel of resistance formed somewhere deep within but the powerful forces working on him threatened to steal even that away no thought spence i cannot let this happen those words echoing inside his brain lacked force all strength had gone out of him no he cried again stop it stop it he did not know whether he spoke the words aloud or whether he merely thought them it did not matter he held to the hard kernel of resistance fighting to hang on to that last tiny shred of himself he found that as he struggled to grasp it a remnant of his will returned relax do not fight it relax spencer this will not hurt you hockings voice sounded inside him hocking was there inside him the hideous realization broke upon his shriveled awareness i will not shouted spence snapping his head up he opened his eyes and saw the shimmering green halo with hockings dreadful face glaring down on him but he saw something else that shocked him back to his senses the quavering fibrils around the edge of the halo were stretched taunt and extending toward him touching him he knew that if he did not break the contact at once he would cease to exist spence reston would become a hollow shell inhabited by hockings mind and controlled by hockings will he could not let that happen already he felt hockings presence seeping into him he screamed and threw himself onto the floor forcing his leaden extremities to move but the tendrils did not release their hold remained attached to his forehead shaking with the effort his muscles turning to jelly and his strength flowing away like water he dragged himself across the floor to the sanibooth hand over hand he pulled himself to his feet sit down spencer relax we are nearly finished relax concentrate hockings voice chanted inside his head relax relax relax he punched the access plate and the door of the booth slid open he teetered on the threshold relax spencer sit down spence heard a crack and felt his cheek sliding down the stalls smooth wall the booth seemed to tilt upside down and he slid to the floor half in and half out his head struck the sensor plate in the floor and he heard the whir of the mechanism as the gentle rain of powder began descending upon him like fine snow the quiet drone of the mechanism was the last thing he heard ari sat in a white molded plastic chair next to spences bed the nurses had just finished washing the last of the blue sanitizing powder from his hair one side of his face bore the red poached look of a sunburn he appeared to have suffered nothing worse than falling asleep on the beach at high noon the patients breathing came slow and regularthe doctor had said that the worst was over there would be some slight inflammation and pain due to the inhalation of the chemical but nothing more serious the physician indicated that it was a wonder spence had not suffocated in the powder his skin would be sensitive for a week or so and it would probably peel spence was fortunate remarked dr williams that he had not fallen face up into the booth he could have been blinded by the ultraviolet light all in all he had escaped unharmed did he tell you about his first accident miss zanderson dr williams had asked nohe mentioned a bump on the head i believe he seemed fine i never dreamed oh its serious all right our young friend is manifesting definite selfdestructive tendencies he was found in the cargo bay with the lock open he nearly died i wouldnt tell you this you understand but he seems not to have any close friends except you of course ari frowned and bit her lip what can i do doctor the medic shook his head slowly only watch him get him to talk about what causes these attacks if you can well wait and see itll be better in the long run if he volunteers the information on his own if we pry too hard try to force him to tell us it could drive the cause deeper of course if the bottom drops out well intervene i would rather it never came to that and so would he im sure as with a lot of men in his position one incident like that on his record and he would be ruined professionally ari had listened to dr williams intently and her features reflected the turmoil of her emotions she looked so forlorn when he finished speaking that he felt compelled to comfort her and discount his dire predictions forgive me for speaking frankly dr williams said apologetically i tend to function on a worst case basis i may have overdramatized things a bit hell be all right your dr reston is a strongwilled chap hell snap out of it i daresay ari thanked the doctor then and he had gone away leaving her to wait beside the bed she occupied her time puzzling over the physicians parting words your dr reston was it really so obvious then she wondered after a while a nurse brought in a cup of coffee for her and stayed to chat a little there were no other patients in that particular wing at present so ari was free to stay as long as she wished you can even stretch out on one of the other beds if you like the nurse suggested im not tired and i dont mind waiting thank you for the coffee though the nurse left again dimming the lights and immersing the rigidly efficient and scrupulously spotless hospital room into cool soothing shadow ari heard the door sigh shut and folding her hands in her lap and bowing her head began to pray the golden crown of her bowed head was the first thing spence saw when he woke up i seem always to be waking up here his voice was a hoarse whisper his lungs burned and his throat felt as if it had been stripped raw her head came up smiling its because you fall asleep in such funny places you heard about that huh she nodded her head regarding him with eyes which seemed a deeper shade of blue darkening out of sympathy for him you could have told me yourself she said spence shrugged there wasnt much to tell how do you feel okay you sound terrible thanks spence was suddenly convulsed by a fit of coughing the flames in his lungs leapt up and he felt as if his throat was on fire ari stood quickly and grabbed a plastic cup of ice water from the tray beside his bed here sip some of this she held the cup for him and guided the straw to his mouth better much they looked at one another without speaking for a moment then spence turned his head away was it that bad this time his voice sounded small and faraway ari sat down on the edge of his bed she placed a hand on his arm dont you remember i dont remember anything she placed a cool hand on the side of his face and turned his head toward her its all right spence its going to be all right in the soft light falling from recessed panels overhead ari was transformed in his eyes into a ministering angel who had come to succor him in his hour of need her fair hair shone with a soft luster and her eyes glimmered with calm assurance her lips curved upward in a smile and the shadows caressed the gentle curve of her smooth cheek he lifted a hand to her face and gazed into her eyes she took the hand in hers and kissed it gently spence felt revived he squeezed her hand and pulled it to him how long will i be here this time he asked at length the doctor said at least twentyfour hours but its up to you really how do you feel tired ill leave you to get some rest she stood up from the bed and placed his hand back on his chest giving it a gentle squeeze no i didnt mean shh dont worry ill come back get some sleep now she smiled again as she turned to leave you had me worriedfor a moment i thought it was the mousse i didnt eat it remember he smiled faintly good night spencer he closed his eyes and drifted off into deep untroubled sleep he resisted the attempted mindlink said hocking flatly he did not like admitting failure especially to ortu often the repercussions were unpleasant ortus yellow eyes narrowed as he glared coldly out of the shimmering halo so he is a strongwilled subject ortu i dont know where he found the strength to resist it did not seem possible that this time he could withstand there seem to be a great many things you do not know and far too many impossibilities it does not suit me at all i am displeased with you hocking the metallic band on his brow pulsed more quickly hocking fought to keep his voice under control a minor setback a small delay we are nearly there next time next time the wizened countenance suddenly contorted in a snarl of venomous rage the thinlipped mouth gaped open revealing a row of sharp even brown teeth the yellow eyes flashed fire and the gleaming circlet quivered next time you speak to me of next time i ortu say what is to be or have you forgotten hocking drew back into his chair as if it were a shell he could hide in his fingers jerked spasmodically on the tray before him i have not forgotten how am i ever to forget there was an icy tinge of hate in the underlings voice ortus eyes narrowed once more i made you what you are i can unmake you you came to me a pathetic mass of misshapen flesh i saved you fed your intellect increased the power of your mind do not now pretend that you are sorry it is too late for that crippled one much too late i meant nothing by it ortu i ask your forgiveness for my error hocking swallowed hard and looked steadily into the glowing blue wreath of light his answer seemed to appease his unpredictable mentor ortu drew back and his twisted features went slack becoming once more blank and remote as if he were carved of cold stone what would you have me do asked hocking his breath came easier we are in dangerous territory at present one more projection could break him and he would be ruined for our purposes it could kill him either outcome would be unfortunate it would mean starting over yet again i do not wish to begin again besides his ability to resist interests me we will continue as you wish ortu i will allow him time to regain his strength and then increase the frequency of the dream suggestions that should sufficiently wear down his mental defenses dr reston is after all a very adept subject we have a great wealth of dreamstate images from him already i will have no trouble altering the content of his dreams to suit our purposes the next projection must not fail warned ortu the hollow empty voice was devoid of anger or malice the utterance chilled hocking to the marrow it will not the halo dimmed and began to fade away hocking watched until nothing was left but a faint glow in the air then that too disappeared the eggshaped chair spun silently around and whisked out of the empty chamber i have been too easy on him muttered hocking i have let him escape but no more i will break him like a twin he will acknowledge we reston will crawl to me yu are looking chipper this morning spence turned as ari entered the room she was dressed in a fresh green tunicked jumpsuit with a high collar her hair spilled over her shoulders in flaxen curls she appeared the picture of health and good will i am im leaving when right nowor just as soon as the nurse comes back with my clothes she cocked her head to one side are you sure youre up to it of course i only slipped in the shower im fine besides if i stay here much longer ill starve the food is like dont ask you still sound like a frog your poor throat dr williams says it will clear up in a day or two the chemical isnt harmful but it doesnt do to inhale it in quantity thats all he says if i can stay out of the rain i wont catch pneumonia theres no reason to keep me here can you breathe all right does it hurt not too much whats all this dont you want me to get out certainly i do but i dont want you to have a relapse relapse you knowanother spell or whatever spence stared at the ceiling for a few moments before speak inn again and when he did the bantering tone had none out of his voice ari what do you think has been happening to me i dont know honestly what has dr williams told you nothing hes as puzzled by all this as anybody he considered this listen to we ari i he was inter rupted by the arrival of the nurse with his clothing here we are good as new mr reston everyone was mixter to the nursing staffthat was the only way they could distinguish the medical doctors from all the other varieties abounding on gotham she laid the neatly folded gold and blue bundle of his jumpsuit at the foot of his bed ill wait outside while you change spence said ari she left with the nurse when he emerged from the sick bay ward he looked fit and rested and better than ari had seen him she wondered if she had been overconcerned surely spence knew what was best he turned his head when he saw her and she saw the sunburned portion of his face no she was right to be worried he needed looking after dr williams stepped up to dismiss his patient as spence met ari at the portal i hope youll think about what i said dr reston my offer still stands ill think about it but i dont think ill change my mind the physician shook his head its up to you im always available i appreciate that the panel slid open spence and ari stepped through goodbye doctor ill try to stay out of trouble for at least a week please i need my beds for sick people the sliding door cut him off well where to asked ari how about lunch ill buy yes to lunch but ill buy i have a favor to ask you all right where shall we go belles exprit is okay with me okay with you my it must be some favor but im game lets go they made their way along the trafficways of gotham to the socalled leisure level taking several lifts and a shunt tube to their destination when they arrived in the plaza there was a line of people waiting to be seated in the restaurant ah perfect timing said spence thats the trouble with a good beanery word gets out and the tourists take over want to go someplace else its worth the wait lets stay the line moved slowly and the two filled the time talking about mundane items of gotham news spence did not mention again his reason for the rendezvous but ari let him work up to it in his own way at last they were ushered to a small table and sat facing one another over a stiff white tablecloth spence hardly glanced at the menu and put it aside ari decided he was getting ready to tell her what he had begun to explain in sick bay ari the waiter attired in a black suit with white shirt and tie and looking very continental appeared to take their order what would you like monsieur even the french accent was commendable spence decided that the waiters for the various restaurants were recruited for their acting ability as much as for their efficiency they seemed to be the flower of their flock and far better than any spence had had the fortune to run into on earth perhaps they were in fact french waiters after all we will have the artichokes vinaigrette to start and the sole new peas or cauliflower monsieur new peas and i think i would like a nice beaujolais shall i bring a bottle sir a half bottle will be fine thank you it was only after the waiter had gone that he realized he had not consulted his guest for her order im sorry im afraid i neglected to ask you what you wanted she laughed dont be embarrassed you read my mind i do this so seldom im afraid im out of practice and dont apologize theres nothing to apologize for just the same next time ill let you do all the talking im not complaining spencer a girl would be a fool to scorn a free meal the waiter returned with the wine he showed spence the bottle and spence pretended to read the label he then deftly uncorked it and splashed a swallow into spences glass and handed it to him laying the cork at his hand spence took the cork and sniffed it not knowing what he was smelling for then took a sip of the wine it was smooth and good warming the palate with a vibrant charm thats very good he said the waiter poured their glasses half full and then left the glasses stood before them casting faint crimson shadows on the white cloth spence did not lift a hand toward his glass so ari folded her hands on the table and waited i want to tell you somethingits about what has been happening you dont have to say anything i want toi want you to know he raised his eyes from the white expanse of the tablecloth to meet hers all right im listening she said gently ari i dont know whats happening to me not really he looked at her and for a moment she saw how frightened he was he shook his head and the fear receded pushed back behind its barrier once more but i dont think its me at least not entirely oh i know what dr williams thinks and i have a fair idea what he must have told you but hes forgetting that i am trained in psychology too i know the symptoms and the causes i dont think i fit the profile i mean im hardly manicdepressive and im not schizophrenic at least i dont think i am the waiter returned to lay the glistening greengray artichokes before them he unrolled the napkins and placed them on their laps arranged their silver and then vanished spence continued as if the waiter had never been there at this point i realize i would have a very rough time proving my sanity nobody thinks youre insane dr williams might dispute that nonsense hes concerned and i am too you have to admit though we havent a lot to go on granted these past few weeks however i have doubted my sanity i could feel it slipping away and there was nothing i could do to stop it it was like i was being drained bit by bit only i didnt realize it at first i tried to tell myself that it was overwork pressure new surroundings but i dont think so anymore he sampled some of the artichoke ari who had been nibbling all along laid down her fork i dont think im getting all of this spence perhaps youd better start at the beginning youre right he nodded and took a few more bites of his food i cant remember the beginning there are a lot of things i cant remember whole chunks of my memory are missing but it was some time after i came here though not long after a couple weeks thats all it started with the dreams dreams dont ask me what theyre about because i dont know sometimes i am almost on the verge of rememberingi can almost see a picture in my mind a word or a sound will trigger it but then its gone everything goes blank but i can tell you this they are strange frightening dreams i wake up in a cold sweat trembling once or twice i believe i have screamed i know i have cried in my sleep there is no pattern to it that i can see sometimes it happens during a sessionthe experiments you knowand sometimes when im asleep in my own quarters but the emotional impact stays with me for a while lingering over me like a ghostly presence haunting me thats horrible it gets worse your order sir the waiter materialized out of nowhere to place several steaming dishes before them enjoy your meal monsieur mademoiselle uhoh said spence somethings wrong what is it said ari afraid that some new horror had descended upon spence red wine with sole how gauche he pulled a wry grin ari you are dining with a gauche person she laughed and the sound was a bubbling of music down with convention i dont care besides you know what they say what do they say foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds is it well emerson thought so he said it they both laughed then and ari saw the lines of strain ease from around his eyes and mouth he let go the ice had been broken he had trusted her with his secret now he would confide in her she too relaxed discovering she had been sitting on the edge of her chair since they were seated cheers said spence lifting his glass and clinking it against hers he took a sip of wine and then dug into his food with the haste of a hungry man they ate in silence until he pushed back his plate with a motion of finality he had reached a decision he launched back into his confession willingly the words spilled out in a torrent the floodgates had opened ari sat spellbound as she listened the blackouts began a week agofive days to be exact nothing in my family history would indicate a condition such as this no epilepsy catalepsy or anything of that sort its completely original with me whatever it is what takes place during the blackouts i have no idea neither do i know how long they last precisely i estimate anywhere from six to ten hours working backward from the time i can last remember until i wake up again obviously i am fairly active during these episodes judging from the fact that i seem to be able to get myself into varying degrees of difficulty he raised a hand to the red side of his face these selfdestructive acts as dr williams calls them are well known in psychological literatureespecially in association with blackouts or amnesia it is not unusual for a blackout to result from the trauma of a very destructive or threatening act in other words the mind blocks the memory of the episode because it is simply too painful to remember in my case however i believe it is just the other way around i cant prove anything one way or the other but something inside tells me im right in the assumption i thought about it all last night as i lay in sick bay its just a gut hunch but right now its the best ive got im not sure i understand what im trying to say i guess is that in my case the blackouts come first and trigger the selfdestructive acts only i dont think the point is to destroy myself what is the point to escape flight is one of the oldest animal reflexes its basic universal even the most timid creature will flee into an unknown danger in order to escape a known one but spence ari gasped who or what would want to harm you i dont knowyet but i mean to find out he glanced al aris worried face she was chewing her lower lip and scowling furiously i know how fantastic this all sounds you must think im a raving madman why invent invisible enemies why concoct outrageous theories when the same facts can be explained more simply with known principles ive asked myself those questions a thousand times in the last twentyfour hours but theres something inside me that wont let me accept the other alternative and right now thats all i have ari leaned across the table and placed her hands on his she looked him full in the face and said i believe you spencer you do yes i do for one thing no one could talk the way you do so objectively so logicallywho was suffering the kind of mental distress you describe so i believe you i didnt think it would be that easy i mean theres every reason to lock me away before i hurt myself or someone else but you dont think im going crazy no i dont whatever it is thats causing thesethese seizures it must be something outside yourself thats it ari youve said it something outside of me ive felt it hovering over me a presence i cant describe what its like how can it be though spence clenched his fist i dont know i scarcely believe its possible but thats the feeling i get sometimes did you enjoy your meal sir the waiter asked how long he had been standing there spence wasnt sure he was surprised to see the table cleared of the dishes he had been so wrapped up in his story he had not noticed them being taken away the meal was fine thank you very good sir i will bring your check thank you spence it was a lovely meal if somewhat gruesome no i mean it i cant say i enjoyed the conversationknowing what you have been through but ive enjoyed being with you the waiter brought the check on a silver tray and placed it before spence handing him a silver fountain pen at the same time he signed his name and personal accounting code thank you very much monsieur join us again very soon adieu the waiter turned and snapped his fingers and a white coated young man appeared with a silver coffeepot and filled their china cups he placed between them a tiny silver bowl which contained four delicate pink rosebud mints spence sipped his coffee thoughtfully ari could see him weighing his next words carefully ari ive told you all this because i want to ask a favor of you go ahead its a small thing but its important to me youll probably think its silly no i wont not after all youve told me today i dont think any of this is silly i think its extremely serious well your father asked me to join the research trip to the terraforming project on mars i remember i was there when he asked you right the thing is ive decided to take up his offer im going to go on the trip only no one can know thats where you come in i want you to fix it for me so that all the necessary arrangements are made without anyone beyond your father and his staff knowing about it can you do that i think so i can try but spence do you think thats wise youll be away a long timeanything could happen you could have blackouts again and out there no one would be able to take care of you no medical facilities i have to get away dont you see the blackouts started here and if i stay theyll continue they may happen out there too i realize that but i have to take that risk ari was not convinced she frowned i dont like itits too dangerous why dont you stay here and arrange to have someone monitor your activitiesyour assistant maybe or let dr williams check you over that would be the sane thing to do the sane thing he snapped sorry unfortunate choice of words but you know what i mean he offered to let you come in for a complete physical and psychological and hed keep it off the record he told you about that what else did he tell you what have you two got cooked up nothing spence i didnt mean anything what was the idea keep me talking until i convinced myself to check in as a psycho was that what you had in mind the sudden shift in spences mood frightened ari she did not know what to do so she said listen spencer ill do as you say ill get your trip cleared and ill arrange it so no one will know but i want a favor from you let dr williams look you over before you go it couldnt hurt he leaned back in his chair and fought to regain control of his temper he still glared at her and the look on his face scared her ill think about it he snapped the next moment he was on his feet jumping up so quickly that he sent his chair crashing to the floor heads turned as he stormed out of the restaurant and diners at the tables all around stared at ari and talked behind their hands she colored under their scrutiny the waiter leaped forward instantly and righted the chair no trouble mademoiselle he said and graciously helped her from her seat she hurried from the cafe her cheeks burning scarlet by the time spence reached the lab he was in a foul mood ari had betrayed him he had trusted her confided in her only to find that she was working for dr williams the two of them ganging up on him he did not need he argued he did not need anybody in his present state he was ready to bite the heads off nails the unlucky tickler discovered this to his dismay when he met spence at the portal as the panel slid open where have you been dr reston weve been worried about you you have huh spence threw him a nasty look not worried enough to check the sick bay i was just on my way down there said tickler he wrung his hands as if to wipe off something distasteful when you didnt show up for the session i well i didnt know what to do well you can stop worrying im all right i just had a little accident thats all your voice your face what happened maybe ill tell you about it someday right now i want to go over those averages i asked you to get for me tickler spun completely around in a circle before heading off to the datafile at the opposite end of the lab spence smiled darkly he had really upset the finicky tickler this time he crossed the lab and went to his place in the booth he flopped into his chair and took up the log book fully intending to bleed off his anger with a few hours of furious work but as soon as he settled himself in his chair the comcen screen on the wall next to him began flashing and the beeper shrilled its tone code the tone stopped after one sequence and the flasher stopped too leaving a red bar across the screen evidently the message was not of particular urgency he felt at first inclined to ignore it but instead he punched the display key on the panel beneath the screen he watched as it spelled out his name and id number and the characters inofclsardyrd in computerspeak this meant that the message was of interoffice origin of the lowest grade and was ready to read by simply tapping the display key once more several of the higher grade levels required that a personal access code be entered before the message could be received and some would not be displayed at all but would only be dispensed on paper through the comcen printer lest anyone unauthorized accidentally view the screen when an important message was transmitted spence tapped the display key and read the following spence come see me when you get a chance id like to talk to you adjani this was an unexpected development he was being invited to drop in on the genius just as if they were old friends he was flattered in spite of himself and wondered what adjani wanted to talk to him about only one way to find out go see him he rose just as tickler entered the control booth here are the averages dr reston sniffed his assistant waving a sheaf of printouts at him thanks tickler ill see to them later somethings come up ill be back soon ready the presets for the next battery of experiments well start those tonight and tickler please be careful with the encephamine another spill like last time and you could put the whole station to sleep besides the stuff is expensive spence ducked out leaving the miffed tickler sputtering he left the lab feeling much better than when he had entered it andmoved out onto the trafficway heading for the main axial for some reason he received perverse pleasure in befuddling the stuffy tickler the realization gave him a momentary pang of guilt which he rejected without a second thought he paused on his way to view a directory he had never been to the hien section before and knew only vaguely how to get there he tapped hien into a comcen screen below the directory and instantly received a route suggestion and hurried along he took fifth avenue where it branched off from the main and then made for the belt line tube tram that saved him from having to meander through the complex inner core of gotham he got out of the tube in the blue section and took the nearest lift up four levels to his destination adjanis quarters were two cramped cubicles overflowing with electronic gear magcarts and bubbleplates the rooms were barely larger than sanibooths and spence could see they had been hastily partitioned off from one of the larger labs in one cubicle was a bed and a chair on which were stacked a multicolored tower of magcarts in the other room was a desk and a data base with three wafer screens and keyboards i am afraid one of us will have to sit on the bed explained adjani apologetically as he ushered spence in my arrival has caused some hardship among the housekeepers i believe olmstead was kind enough to divide his quarters with me until a more suitable arrangement can be found come in come in please thank you spence glanced around the cluttered interior every square centimeter of space except for a tentative pathway through the rooms was crammed with data in its various disguiseson paper disc tape and sealed cartridge it reminded spence of his own study cube back at the university years ago i will never complain about my miniature quarters again compared to these mine are cavernous i dont mind really im not here very much mostly im in one of the labs or hotrooms they keep me pretty busy you know personally im beginning to think the only reason packer wanted me here was so he wouldnt have to think anymore the slim brown man paused then added deviously im fixing him though i make him and his shuttle bums think twice as hard he turned and threaded his way carefully into the adjoining cubicle spence followed lightly careful not to start an avalanche adjani plopped the multicolored cartridges onto a kneehigh stack of disc cartons and waved spence to the chair he curled up on the bed in lotus position spence wondered if his host was hindu where are you from adjani san francisco he laughed at spences expression rocking back and forth on the bed i know everyone makes the same mistake my people are from nagaland my father was from imphal my mother from manipur they met in london when my father was teaching at the royal academy he is at oxford now adjani spoke with pride of his parents spence sensed they were close somewhat wistfully he found himself envying adjanis relationship with his familythough he knew nothing at all about themand regretting his own adjani continued they waited eight years to bring me to the united states we came under the necessary skills program just after the war and it cost my father over twelve thousand dollars to buy our entrance visas i was eight years old when we camei remember because i was in seventh form and everyone made fun of me for being so small you were in seventh form when you were only eight spences eyes grew wide in disbelief it was all they could do to keep me in printout paper laughed adjani you stayed in california then yes for the most part when i finished school we went back to india and i spent some time in my fathers homelanda very enlightening experience every son should have the chance to see his father as a young man thats what i saw in nagaland anyway we could not go back to the united states because our visas had expired father went back to great britain i would have joined him i believe but cal tech summoned me for their think tank what about your visa the government waived the regulations olmstead arranged it though he wont admit it we had become friends at stanford and he was afraid that if he did not find me a job he would never see me again quite possibly it was true adjani spread his hands wide now you know my whole lifes storybut for one or two important details its an interesting story im sure your parents are very proud of you adjani shrugged yes and no they realize that i am what i am but they do not deny they had greater plans for me the remark struck spence as absurd adjani was possibly the highest man in his discipline what could be greater than what youre doing right now they had hoped i would become their purohitthe family priest you are hindu asked spence thinking his first impression had been correct oh no laughed adjani i use the word in a general sense we are christians my family hoped i would be a minister like my grandfather this admission made adjani seem even more foreign and mysteriqus for spence religion was merely a holdover from a superstitious age in mans history no true scientist held to dogma does this surprise you spence adjanis black eyes glittered intently as he leaned forward on his couch a little i guess people dont take that stuff seriously anymore ah thats where youre wrong religion is elemental to mans being true religion ennobles it never debases i guess i havent thought much about it one way or the other spence shifted uncomfortably in his seat dont worry adjani smiled broadly i did not invite you here to preach to you spence relaxed and leaned back in his chair i was beginning to wonder why did you ask me here a selfish reason i would like to know you better adjani clasped his hands beneath his chin and rested his elbows on his knees he weighed his next words before saying them and andi do not wish to offend youi thought you looked like someone who could use a friend spence did not speak right away the comment seemed charged with implications he could not fathom at once his eyes became wary and his tone guarded thats very kind of you i appreciate that he said slowly the suspicion in his voice leaked through adjani pounced on it as if it were a snake is that so unusual why no of course not i have lots of friends spence hoped he would not be asked to name them good i would like you to consider me among them spence did not know what to say he was embarrassed but could not think why he should be id be glad to have you as a friend adjani i mean it the words were genuine no one spoke for a few moments adjani sat gazing at spence as if he were reading his future in his face spence felt a strange excitement stir within him and the room grew fuzzy and indistinct at the same time he was aware of a heightened sensitivity to his situation an unseen presence had entered the room he could feel ita force which charged the atmosphere of the tiny room with electricity when adjani spoke his words cut through to spences heart i see a darkness around you like a cloud would you like to tell me what is troubling you spence heard the fading echo of a roar like thunder he could not decide if he had indeed heard the sound or only imagined it for it shrank away to become the sound of his own blood pounding in his ears he dropped like a stone through an infinite darkness falling and falling turning over and over spinning slowly through the void how long he had fallen he could not determine time had no meaning in this formless space but presently he glimpsedfar ahead as in a tunnel a long way offa single beam of white light the light grew stronger and larger as he spun closer growing until it filled his eyes with a gentle radiance he could see it quite clearlya large luminous disk moonlike against the forever darkness all around as he watched the disk changed slightly he noticed that it had features which resembled human features the disk swept closer to him or he to it and he realized that it was not a moon at all but a human skull the skulls black vacant eye sockets rotated slowly toward him to fix him with their hideous blank gaze he could see it clearly now looming ever closer filling the void with its wan ghostly light he saw that the skull was rushing upon him and at the same time that he was shrinking great wrenching spasms of fear shook his bodyhe imagined he could hear his teeth rattle in his head his heart hammered against his ribs and his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth as he fought to cry out spence diminished as the skull swept toward him growing larger as it came now it filled his field of visionits eyes were huge black pits opening before him he put his hands out as if to stop the terrible collision but when he parted them he saw that he was spinning into one of the empty eye sockets the gleaming white teeth in the skulls bony jaw flashed as the mouth opened and began to wag he heard a thin cold laughter emanating from between the skulls bare teeththe horrible fleshless sound of ghostly laughter he clamped his hands over his ears but it was too late the sound had gotten inside his head where it reverberated endlessly now he could see the scaly pitted ridge of bone which formed the brow and the triangular hole of the nose with its jutting sliver of bone slashing out from it the eye hole seemed instantly to expand as he toppled through its yawning craterlike aperture at the moment he fell into the monstrous eye socket spences world flashed redas if he had plunged beneath the surface of a sea of blood his falling shrinking plunging motion abruptly stopped and he felt suspended in the weird crimson glow slowly he became aware of the fact that he lay on a solid shelf of rock his cheek flat against smooth cool stone the deep red color emanated from the stone itself his terrible fear subsided spence raised his head slowly he looked at his hands bringing them before his face in the bloodred glare as if they might belong to someone else but they were his hands and seeing them unaltered calmed his fluttering pulse he stood uncertainly and gazed around him he took one step and his legs gave way beneath him he was still too shaken and dizzy to walk he pushed himself up on his hands and knees and waited until his head cleared in this position staring down at the stone beneath him he saw something which caused his jaw to drop in amazement he rubbed his eyes when he worked up his nerve to look again it still remained he bent to examine it once more to make sure his eyes had not tricked him in the strange light his breath came in long shaky gasps of excitement as he brought his face closer to it yes there was no mistake before him in the red dust of the rock floor was a single naked human footprint spence heard a shout echoing from the high vaulted roof of the cavern and realized with a shock that it was his own voice crying out over and over it cant be it cant be the day dragged away like a wounded snake pulling its injured length painfully along spence felt every slow tick ebbing away as if it were wrung from his own flesh he had been in a sour mood upon waking and knew that he had dreamed again this depressed him thoroughly somehow he imagined that in light of his resolve to deal squarely with the problems besetting him the dreams would not affect him any longer he was wrong if anything they troubled him more deeply than ever he worked the shift away in a silent smoldering rage tickler felt the heat of his anger and kept well out of range the meticulous little man watched his every move from a distance as if spence were a lab specimen that might at any moment show signs of blossoming another head his bright beady eyes followed his master around with keen if secretive interest spence waded through a magcart of neglected administrative work and hoped that tickler had no intention of lingering after the shift ended he had to bite his tongue on several occasions when he felt inclined to suggest that tickler leave for the day no an inner voice cautioned act as if nothing ix amiss nothing out of the ordinary business as usual there was a reason for spences reluctance to open himself to ticklers fussy scrutiny he wanted the next two days to go especially smoothly he wanted to maintain the appearance of stability and order right up to the moment of his departure he wanted his leaving on the mars trip to come as a complete surprise to anyone who might have reason to be interested in such an eventespecially tickler if he had been asked spence could not have given an explanation for adopting this course of action very likely he did not know why himself he told himself it was because he distrusted tickler but he never stopped to consider why that was or what tickler had done to earn such ill will in spences mind he represented a vague uneasiness which sent out vibrations of veiled suspicion like certain nettlesome vines sent out creeping tendrils at last the shift ended and tickler approached his chair quietly with his hands held limply in front of him as if they were wet gloves he had just hung out to dry is there anything else today dr reston spence did not bother to consult the digiton above the console he knew tickler would not have approached one nanosecond before the specified time he pushed back his chair and rubbed his eyes in a show of fatigue oh is it time to quit already i dont mind putting in an extra shift thanks but it isnt necessary weve done a good days work call it quits and well hit it again tomorrow we can ready the equipment for the session tomorrow evening then good day tickler tickler peered back as if he were trying to read a message that was written on spences face in a foreign language are you sure theres nothing else spence shook his head and smiled as broadly as he could you sure are a workhorse no i cant think of a thing that cant be done tomorrow youre free ill see you tomorrow tickler did not reply he only dipped his head in a smarmy little bow and then hurried away like a rat heading back to his burrow after a night in the pantry spence watched him go and then went to the portal himself he cleared the access code on the doorplate and reset it with a new code so that he would not be disturbed now to business he muttered to himself as he sank back into his cav chair behind the console throughout the day as he worked the thought kept nagging him that he should check out the riddle of the identical scan more thoroughly actually the urge was not a new oneit had nagged him before but he simply had not had time to do anything about it until now he fell to with a will he retraced in his mind the steps he had followed to discover the similarity of the two scans in the first place as to what the significance of the supposed similarity could mean he was still at a loss for an answer but deep inside he believed it to be important in some way what he proposed to accomplish next was to establish that it had been no glitch no momentary foulup in the electronic circuitry or in the program which had fed him spurious information spence picked up at the point where he had made his strange discovery three days before mira spence reston here ready for command ready dr reston said miras feminine voice compare all psg seven series ltst entries display entries with similarities with less than one percent variability he sat back to wait tapping his fingers on the table before him while mira worked mirathe initials stood for multiple integrated rational something or other which he could not at the moment rememberwas the largest of a breed of biotic computers whose circuitry was in part derived from organic moleculesprotein grids which had been integrated with electronics she was faster smarter and more creative in a dozen ways than any computer before her within seconds the wafer screen spelled out the message which to spences grim satisfaction matched the previous one psg seven series scans and there it was again the chance that it was a computer error ceased to be a possibility glitches did not repeat themselves the chance that it was a kink in his program was also remote the command was well within the programs range of flexibility retracing his steps completely he opened the yellow log book and matched the two disputed scans they were as he had previously discovered quite different next he pushed the inquiry a step further and went to the cabinet getting out the tray of spools for the week of and the tray for the week of he set the trays down on his nearby desk and fished out the spools in question he snapped the seal on each of them and rolled out a portion of the scan the four red wavy lines undulated evenly across his desk he matched up two intervals and placed one tape over the other and held them to the light the two scans viewed one through the other as they overlapped one another were clearly different he could see peaks in one where there were valleys in the other laid one on top of the other all similarities between them ceased to exist he checked the interval again and even tried to force the comparison by matching peaks and valleys but could not the scans were simply quite different one from the other mira had apparently goofed after all but there was still one more wrinkle to check the bubble memory as an added backup to the overall design of the project spence had recorded each scan on a bubble plate this was the source of the numbers entered in the log book the rising and falling motion of the scanners red ink lines was recorded within the thin sealed cartridge whose magnetic bubbles were interpreted by the computer as a continuous series of numbers for every place the needle rested on the paper tape there was a corresponding number by reading the numerical values the computer could reconstruct the wavy lines on the paper tape he opened the bubble file and pulled the cartridge for the two sessions he popped one cartridge into each of the slots in the memory reader of the console and gave the display command instantly the numbers on the plates began filling the screen he quickly scanned the columns and his breath caught in his throat the two scans were exactly alike he dropped into his swivel chair and propped his feet up on the edge of the table he stared at the rows of identical numbers on the screen and then closed his eyes retreating into thought here at last was the corroborating evidence he had been seekingonly instead of helping to solve the mystery it deepened it he began to think through the steps of his experiment and how it was recorded in all its various stages to determine how a situation such as the one glimmering at him from the wafer screen could ever have happened given the fact that it was impossible for any two scans to be perfectly alikeeven the same man on the same night could not produce two identical scanshe was forced to reckon the evidence an error either human or electronic now with the evidence of the bubble memory the likelihood of an electronic error diminished to the point of infinite improbability the cloud of doubt in which he had so far carried his investigation began to condense into suspicion someone had been tampering with his records the longer he thought about it the more suspicious he became until the unproven hypothesis hardened into certainty someone had been tampering with his materials assuming that much the next question was why why would anyone want to sabotage his experiment no that was the wrong approach not sabotagealter that seemed closer to the mark why would anyone want to alter the evidence and why these particular scans in this particular way to puzzle this latest wrinkle in this confusing development he got up from his chair and shoved it across the room he began pacing with his arms folded across his chest and his head bent down as if he expected the answer to form itself upon the floor the answer when it came hit him like a closed fist between the eyes it nearly knocked him down the simplicity of it staggered himit was so obvious the scans had not been altered they had been duplicated the scan of was a copy of scan that was why they were identi cal what about the other pieces of the puzzle the tape the log book the main computer memory those simply had been man ufactured to fill in the gap too spences mind raced ahead like lightning along a oncetraveled path the morning of had been the morning after his first blackout when he awakened in the sleep chamber that much he remembered clearly he remembered tickler remarking that the scan had gone well that night he also remembered that he had not actually seen the scan at that time it was not until after breakfast that he examined it plenty of time for someone to manufacture the missing pieces and place them in position was the scan of somehow significant probably not it had just been selected at random from among the first of the experiments records it was used to fill in the gaps in the bubble memory and the data base memory what about the paper tape and the log book that was the easiest part those had simply been created wholesale the figures in the log book were dummies and the paper ribbon probably bore the signature of someone elses brainwaves spence swept up in the heady whirl of intrigues real and imagined staggered to his chair and collapsed as if he had just run a thousand meters he had itthe answer or the beginning of the answerand knew that he had it proving it was another matter but he was not interested at present in proving anything he was happy just to know his elation proved shortlived within moments the other question reasserted itself why why had these things been done clearly he stood at the beginning of the maze where it would lead he did not know but at last he felt strong enough to face whatever he might find on an impulse he turned and punched a code into the comcen panel there was someone he had to see before another moment passed when tickler left the lab he did not go directly to his quarters across the corridor from the lab instead he put his head down and scurried as fast as his feet would take him to the main axial and then took a lift tube to the eighth and topmost level of the station he rode the tram along the inner ring radial until the track deadended at a blank white wall next to a large pressure port in the wall a large sign painted in orange letters read danger construction area pressure suit required authorized personnel only adjacent to the port hung a row of baggy pressure suits limp in their racks like deflated men tickler stepped across the trafficway and wormed his way into one of the bulky suits and disengaged it from the rack he then punched a code into the access plate of the portal and stepped quickly through as soon as the panel slid open wide enough to admit him he waited inside the small air lock for the pressure to equalize and then popped the valve he emerged from the little room into the breathtaking blackness of space he stood blinking for a moment looking up into the expanse above him at the stars shining steadily down with their icy light bare spars like the ribs of an ancient sailing vessel stuck up out of the darkness some of these were hung with rows of red lights to mark portions of the station now under construction over the rim of the stations smooth flank floated a work platform loaded with sheets of metal and other materials all secured beneath steel net to keep them from floating into space several robotrucks hovered nearby tethered to the platform with steel cable not a workman could be seen at any of the several sites so tickler proceeded toward a huge cylindrical projection standing at the midpoint of the construction area across the top quarter of the cylinder a diagonal band of light lengthening as the station rotated toward the sun slashed into the darkness ordinarily the whole area would be ablaze with floodlights but the shift was over and a new one would not come on for a few hours tickler had the site all to himself still he wasted no time but moved ahead quickly and carefully his magnetic boots clinking over the honeycombed temporary trafficways set up like scaffolds all around the area he headed for the cylinder when he reached it he paused only long enough for the portal to slide open to admit him once inside and through the air lock he hung up his pressure suit on the rack next to anotheralready waiting there and proceeded a lift tube carried him into the upper section of the silo and when the panel slid open he stepped into a bare apartment of immense size at one end a light shone in a pool on the floor within the pool two figures waited one of the figures resembled an egg you are late snapped the egg as tickler approached i came as quickly as i could explained the breathless tickler as the egg slowly revolved to display the wizened features of hocking he kept me working all shift i couldnt very well ask him to excuse me without arousing suspicion and hocking grimaced and cut off the excuse i have been in contact with ortu he is not pleased with the progress we are making i have taken the blame for our failure upon myself failure tickler asked as if he had never heard the word before he looked to the other figure standing to one side of hockings pneumochair the young man in a cadets jumpsuit stared back dully i expect continued hocking speaking slow and crisply that you and kurt will find a way to make this up to me well the eyes flashed from their sunken depths tickler spread his hands we have done all you have required of us i fail to see how we could have anticipated the setbacks arising from the subjects stubbornness im not talking about that cooed the skeletal hocking i am talking about the breakdown in monitoring the subjects every move between the two of you he should never be out of your sight for a moment do you know where he is right now why yes hes in the lab oh do you know this for a fact could he not have left the lab as soon as you did could he not in fact have followed you here tickler looked worried he cast a quick glance behind him to see if spence had indeed followed him to hockings secret chambers see hocking shouted you do not know reston has consistently moved about the station at will and yet i have stressed time and again how necessary it is to keep him under surveillance during the induction period it is only by the merest chance that he is still with us tickler did not speak he gazed sullenly at the floor but i am raking over old ground suffice it to say that if you cannot watch him more closely than you are at present i will find someone who can he allowed the threat to trail off menacingly now then he continued i have been thinking by this time tomorrow we must have everything prepared to try another induction reston is ripe for it now i can feel it i have given him additional image cues while in dream state we will increase the psychomotor quotient of the tanti this timewe have i believe underestimated our subjects mental strength and willpower that should not hinder us again however if it does not kill him muttered tickler darkly i heard you perfectly tickler you might as well speak up i am willing to risk killing him yes id prefer it to allowing him to slip away again we cannot suffer that to happen that is why i want one of you to be stationed with him when the induction takes place no both men gasped at once and looked apprehensively at one another you idiots the projection will not harm youit is not tuned to your brainwave patterns i want you there to keep an eye on him and to prevent him from escaping again i dont know if it will be that easy he was acting very strangely today i think he may suspect something what can he suspect hocking glared at his hirelings answer me unless you have been careless again i cannot see how he can suspect anything maybe but i was with him today i tell you he does hocking dismissed the warning with an impatient jerk of his head what if he does suspect something by tomorrow at this time it wont matter what our brilliant young friend suspects it will be too late he will be ours the sun shields were nearly closed when spence stepped into the garden the slanting bands of golden light falling through the trees resembled a kind of tropical aurora which flushed everything with heightened color this was spences favorite time to come herejust before the shields closed and the garden received its nocturnal rest he hurried along to the center of the garden and the benches on the greensward as he had hoped the benches were empty not another soul was to be seen anywhere he settled himself on the last bench to wait the only thing missing is mosquitoes thought spence as he listened to the racking squawks of one of central parks halfdozen macaws he closed his eyes and breathed the humid air deep into his lungs tilting his head back to rest on the bench he was still in this attitude eyes closed head thrown back when ari found him i know i havent kept you waiting that long she said how dare you pretend to sleep spences head snapped upright as his eyes flew open he jumped to his feet i didnt hear you come up he looked at her and stood uncertainly gazing intently at her fair face even lovelier in the soft golden light of the garden he tried to read her feelings in her eyes but could not ari he said after an awkward moment thanks for coming after what i did you had every right to refuse and i wouldnt have blamed you she did not make the moment easier for him but stood there looking at him implacably i am sorry i i treated you terribly his eyes sought hers and his voice became hushed ive never asked another person to forgive me but im asking you now please forgive me the smile that transformed her face came like the dawn to his long dark night of despair all the way to the garden he had tortured himself with six kinds of fear and doubt as to the outcome of their meeting her voice over the comcen speaker had been icily polite giving away nothing that he could use to bolster his sinking ego but her smile banished all his dark thoughts oh spence ive been so worried about you furious too mind you but more worried than mad i acted like an ass running out of the cafe that wayi dont know what i was thinking of im sorry youre forgiven now what is so urgent and secret he drew her to the bench and sat her down he looked around him as if he expected spies to be lurking in the shrubbery she could see that his face was flushed with excitement his slightly wildeyed look was creeping over him again she bit her lip what is it spencer i have proof that im not going crazy youre going to have to trust somebody aris voice was firm you cant go it alone they were sitting in her fathers reading room a plate of sandwiches sat untouched on the low table in front of them spence stared at the walled ranks of books as if he might find a title among them that would tell him what to say next i need time to sort this out he said at length there are too many pieces missing i dont like it spencethis running away it isnt safe he swung around to peer at her with a puzzled look itll be all right he said lamely i need to get away from here for a while thats all what makes you think that if someone is tampering with your experiment they would stop there they could hurt you spence for whatever reason you could get hurt very badly he had no answer for that the same thing had crossed his mind many times in the last few hours ari all i know is that if i stay i will be hurt ive got to go someplace out of reach to figure this thing out there was a finality in his tone that did not invite further discussion ari sat with her hands in her lap legs drawn up beneath her she studied her clasped hands and said ill miss you he smiled ill miss you too believe me if i thought there was another way id take it he drew a deep breath i wont be gone long youll see ill be back in no time at all i dont call threeandahalf months no time at all she colored slightly and admitted i was just getting used to having you around well pick up right where we left off i promise he looked at her steadily and said if i stayed you wouldnt want me around it would be more of the same worse maybe youre probably right perhaps it is better this way she turned her head away quickly he moved closer and touched her shoulder tentatively are you crying no she sniffed im allergic to goodbyes spence put his hand to her chin and turned her face toward him a moist trail glistened on her cheek where a tear had fallen he wiped away the spot and bent his head and kissed her very gently thats for missing me he said shyly ari smiled and sniffed rubbing the heel of her hand across her eyes the secrets out now isnt it she looked at him again and he felt his insides turning to warm jelly be very careful spencer dont let anything happen to you i wont he managed to croak spence i will pray for you every day she folded her hands unconsciously i have been praying for you ever since we met he felt as if he had just stepped into a warm shower his skin tingled with a strange excitement and his heart tugged within him he wished that he could say that he would pray for her too but he knew that such a statement would ring false it would cheapen her sincere belief and though spence himself had no such beliefs he did not see any good reason to trample on hers thank you ari he said at last no one has ever said that to me before they sat for a long time in silence finally he rose uneasily to his feet and said i guess id better go ive a lot to do if im going to leave tomorrow night am i going to see you before you go i hope so ill come by here before i head down to the docking bay now youre sure yes youre cleared and no one outside of captain kalnikov knows youre going good but spence shouldnt you tell somebody someone should know you know everyone else will find out after im gone ari sighed all right if thats the way you want it they moved to the portal and spence pressed the access plate ill see you tomorrow he said ducking quickly outside good night spencer ari waved he waved back and the closing panel broke the spell between them he hurried back to his quarters feeling like a cat burglar returning after a nights work a thousand details had to be attended to before he climbed aboard the transport headed for mars between now and then he had precious little time to spare he would need to work through the night he had just closed the door to the vidphone booth at comcen when the call came through he sat down and leaned into the camera slightly resting his elbows on the shelf before him the flat square screen flickered to life in quick bursts of blue light he smiled when the red light above the screen came on spence its kate are you surprised to see me he had not expected to see his sister and for a few seconds could only stare at the image on the screen in fact he had imagined so many emergencies which might have provoked the call that he was a little disappointed to see her your sister kateremember she smiled nervously kate are you all right is everything all right i know i should have given you more warning yes every things fine no emergencies you sound angry its just that its in the middle of the night here im sorry i forgot its three oclock in the afternoon down here spence forced himself to smile in answer to her anxious look dont worry about it i dont mind i wasnt sleeping anyway when comcen said i had a call coming through i assumed something terrible had happened to dad or one of the boys you know everyones fine spence i just wanted to talk to youi hope im not interrupting one of your experiments no no im not working tonight well i feel so awkward i mean just think youre a million miles out in space and here i am talking to you like you were across town or something wait til you get the bill you wont think i was all that close then he paused studying her face on the screen though only two years older then he was kate had always been the wise benevolent elder sister he saw her now a mother of two growing boys looking more than ever like a matron she bore little resemblance to the picture of her he carried around in his head you look tired spence are you feeling all right she was saying im fine ive been working a little too hard thats all dad said youd had an accident it was nothing i bumped my head the conversation seemed to dry up at that point kate licked her lips she was trying to bridge the gap of all those miles by staring very hard into the vidphone screen spence realized it was not a separation of miles but of life that she was trying to cross she was trying to imagine his life in that place clearly it was beyond her why did you call kate he asked softly are you angry dont be angry spence youll think its silly i wont think its silly and im not angry believe me now go ahead and tell me she appeared as if she were about to confess a scarlet sin spence tuesdays dads birthday a pang of guilt arrowed through him he did not feel guilty for forgetting his fathers birthday he had done that often over the years he felt guilty because the event meant nothing to him he did not care and kates reminder made him face the fact that other sons did remember they did care im sorry he said flatly i forgot thats not why i called not to remind you well yes it is but not how you think dad says that you told him youre going on some research trip i told him that yes i remember anyway hes got it in his head that hes never going to see you again you know how he gets sometimes no amount of talking will convince him he says hes sure something terrible is going to happen to you on that triphe doesnt even know where youre goingand that hell never see you again spence could see his father sitting in his faded red chair mumbling and fretting over his sons imagined demise it was one of the stock images of spences childhood and he hated it what do you want me to do kate he asked wishing that his mother was still alive at least she had been able to soothe his fathers irrational fears she had been the cooling balm poured out upon the fevered brow of her husband she answered hesitantly it would be nice if you would call him and wish him happy birthday that way he could see you and hear your voice it might convince him that youre still okay and that youre thinking about him id love to do that kate but i cant ill be on my way to mars by then im leaving tomorrow night and i wont be back for some time he did not feel like rehearsing the details of his trip with her mars really spencer thats fantastic wait until i tell the boystheyll be so thrilled her enthusiasm died almost at once but what about dad im sorry hell just have to understand but isnt there something you could do spence anything i could record a call and have it sent then i could also send a souvenir of the stationhe might like that would you it would make him so happy im sure whatever you could send would be fine it isnt the gift its the thought that counts but it was kates thoughtand that was the whole point ill get something on the next shuttle just send it to me were having a little family party for him on tuesday night ill take care of everything fine youll be notified about the call ill make sure they give you plenty of time to get to the base there was a strained pause well spence id better go take care of yourself now and call when you get back i know two boys who will want to hear their uncle spence tell em all about it ill do that kate goodbye goodbye spence the screen went dark he sat for a moment gazing into the flat gray square then he stood stiffly and left the booth feeling very hollow and alone as if every liquid gram of compassion had been wrung out of him in the pitiful effort of conversation with one of his family members he wandered back to his quarters grayfaced and eyes burning from the exhaustion of his long day he stopped briefly at the visitors center to browse among various souvenirs and memorabilia offered as mementos of a trip to gotham he selected a small cast aluminum replica of the space station which was mounted on a grayish stonepart of an asteroid or a moon rockand designed undoubtedly to be used as a paperweight he paid for his purchase rattling off his account number to a bored clerk who dutifully punched in the data you want it wrapped she asked stifling a yawn no thanks ill eat it here he said and stuffed the object into a zippered pocket and shambled off to his nights rest maintaining the ruse of business as usual proved harder than spence imagined for one thing tickler seemed especially interested in his plans for the next run of experiments set to begin that night when shall i tell our assistant mr millen to join us oh at the usual time i see no reason to deviate from our norm do you no sir not at all i just thought that you might have plans which would necessitate rescheduling in that case i should know about them thats all it was all spence could do to keep from smirking i realize i have been somewhat unpredictable tickler but im turning over a new leaf he turned toward his officious assistant and a lopsided grin stole over his face starting tonight youll notice a dramatic departure from my usual habits tickler bent his head to one side and sucked in his breath as if he were about to press the matter further but then thought better of it that left him holding his breath with his mouth open was there something else asked spence cheerily ahhno tickler exhaled like a leaky balloon i am quite satisfied but he stood there blinking his tiny beady eyes as if he expected to be asked to stay to tea and would be disappointed if he were not spence guessed he was waiting for additional information regarding his plans he decided to end the conversation well then if theres nothing else i suggest we both get busy there is a lot to be done before tonight you may wish to catch some sleep before we begin it could be a long one of course tickler turned and scuttled away spence watched him take up his place at the far end of the lab opposite his own work station all he needs thought spence is whiskers and a tail and the rodent family would have a new patriarch spence had no intention of showing up for the evenings session but as the shift came to an end he made a point of remarking to tickler ill expect you here promptly at the beginning of the third shift i want to start at once to this tickler replied punctuality is my middle name dr reston of course it is said spence i had always wondered tickler left and spence dashed to his quarters and began stuffing his belongings into a travel frame the softsided collapsible carrier of lightweight design used exclusively for shuttle travelers they were a status symbol back on earth identifying seasoned jumpvets naturally they were copied by numerous manufacturers and sold to anyone who wanted one badly enough to pay the outrageous sums these frames fetched his own bore the company logo in silver on the side and had been given to him prior to the jump although allowed to take two frames with him on the trip he decided to squeeze by with one he did not care to be bothered with unnecessary baggage only at the last minute did he decide to take along his camera when it was ready he called housekeeping and asked them to send someone to take it down to the docking bay for him he did not wish to be seen lugging his frame through the station he had played it close this far and did not want to risk giving himself away so near to the payoff within the hour a page came to take his frame down for him do you know who i am spence asked the young man no sir he acted as if it was a question he heard often id appreciate it if no one else knew either if anyone asks you never saw me and the frame belongs to dr packer got that got it spence handed him a stack of coins for his trouble here have one of whatever it is you guys have these days on me i never saw you sir right the kid disappeared pulling the frame through the portal spence went back to his quarters and carefully arranged everything to appear as if he had only stepped from the room and would be returning any moment why he went to the trouble he did not know and he told himself that he was being ridiculous but having adopted the undercover posture he found himself enjoying the intrigue he left the jumpsuit he had been wearing the night before hanging over the chair scattered papers lay on his desk and a mug of cold coffee sat on the table beside the bed the bedclothes themselves he left rumpled when at last he had satisfied himself that everything looked normal he tiptoed out and left the lab he had no sooner crossed the threshold of the portal than he ran smack into his assistant kurt millen kurt he gasped nearly knocking the young man over excuse me dr reston i didnt see you coming were always bumping into one another yes spences mind raced to think of a way to escape without arousing suspicion i i was just on my way to the commissary would you like to join me for one sickening second he thought the cadet would accept his bogus offer thank you for inviting me dr reston but ive got some things to dodr tickler left me a list of chores id better not youre sure just a cup of coffee ill buy spence fearlessly played the charade to the ragged edge maybe some other time sureno problem i wont be a minute he turned and started away id better go grab a place in line so i can get back he left the cadet standing in front of the lab entrance watching him spence kicked himself for overacting his part he had quite possibly created suspicion where no suspicion existed before so to make it look good he strolled dutifully along to the commissary and went inside to stand in line for a few minutes he then left darting back into the trafficway and losing himself in the betweenshift throngs heading to and from the cafeteria he suspected that kurt would try to follow him he told himself the notion was absurd but dodged into a tube and changed levels a couple times anyway arriving at aris door glancing over his shoulder and peering into every shadow spence oh im so glad you came i was afraid something had happened something almost did but theres no problem now he stepped quickly inside and came to stand in the middle of the room with ari they stood face to face both pretending to be coolly friendly and neither one succeeding how long can you stay just a few minutes i should get down to the bay before the others start boardingjust in case i understand ari i wonder if you could do me a favor while im gone said spence suddenly of course anything my dads birthday i got him a souvenir but i forgot to send it could you make sure he gets it i left it in my jumpsuit in my quarters ill take care of it right away spence dont give it another thought delicate silence followed this exchange ari looked at her hands clasping them and unclasping them spence watched her as if she were practicing magic finally she raised her head shyly ill miss you spence i miss you already and youre not even gone ill miss you too ive been thinking that suddenly she was very close and his arms were around her pressing her to him she murmured softly and he smelled the fresh clean scent of perfume in her hair spence youll be gone so long not so long itll pass quickly youll see the words came out in a rush and it was all he could do to keep his composure why this turmoil this confusion over a mere girl whats come over me he thought to himself well id better go he said at last he was beginning to fear that if he stayed with her any longer he would not be able to leave she released him and composed herself putting on a cheery face and manner ill think about you every day she took him by the arm and led him to the door you run along now i know youre going to have a beautiful time of itrunning around in your little space suits all of you playing scientist ill come back and tell you all about it he laughed and his voice made a hollow sound i planned to go down to the bay with you but i wont i dont want you to see me cry he turned her face to his and kissed her gently goodbye ari he whispered and then darted away she heard his footsteps in the corridor and listened until they merged with other sounds then she went back to begin her wait the docking bay hummed with activity the boarding tube had been attached to the transport which bore the name gyrfalcon in glittering gold letters across her bulging bow skids of supplies and baggagemost of it scientific instruments in cargo frameswere being shoved aboard outside the station a small army of maintenance men swarmed the surface of the transport their arc lights playing over the sleek black skin of the ship as they moved through their preflight check it looked like a great black whale patiently enduring a precise grooming by a platoon of tiny silver fishes on the big chronometer above the boarding tube he saw that there was less than an hour to blast time a few of the younger cadet passengers were standing around the bay looking jittery and laughing loudly spence allowed himself only a few seconds more to take in the rush of activity around the great spaceship then he slipped in behind a roboskid loaded with dehydrated rations and entered the boarding tube feeling like a stowaway half expecting someone to challenge him with a halt who goes there no one did no one seemed to notice his arrival at all which produced a peculiar sense of disappointment for spence he reached the end of the brightly lit tube and entered the hold where dozens of men labored to position all the stores and baggage and lock them into place within huge cargo frames he threaded his way through the confusion and started toward the head of the ship and the passenger quarters a few yellowsuited maintenance men moved along the ships central gangways trailing blackandgreen striped hoses and wagons with oddlooking metallic boxes with flashing lights which emitted chirps and clicks as they slid along the floorplates spence also saw the royal blue jumpsuits of the transports crew who were standing at their stations or talking quietly to one another as the yellowsuits fiddled efficiently around them he found an open gallery of seats with their safety webs hanging loosely draped over the headrests as if giant spiders had been busy during the night he walked across the compartment and came to stand before an observation port to look out upon the space station he had just left the activity in the docking bay had intensified in the few minutes since he arrived he could see through the huge observation bubble into the docking bay where some thirty or so cadets had gathered and were waiting to board a great many others had come to see them off and a host of yellowsuits were dashing here and there in lastminute preparations so you are anxious to go to marx yes he turned to greet the hulking form of kalnikov the captain of the transport the burly giant crossed the gallery in two strides and shoved out a great meaty paw which squashed spences as the two shook hands kalnikov looked like the classic russian weight lifterbroad shoulders above a sinewy back thick arms and fists that could probably crush stones his voice rumbled out from deep within his barrel chest yes spence began to confess i was just before he could finish the man slapped him on the back with a bonejarring blow haw i was that way my first time too it is a delicious feeling enjoy thank you spence replied when he regained his breath the stout russian turned and pounded away spence could hear his voice shaking the floorplates ax he bellowed his delight at being spacebound once more he heard a snatch of song ax it boomed out in the corridor god of shining galaxies lead me from this place lord of starfields fly with me beyond the edge of space spence couldnt help smiling he could feel the hum of electricity starting to flow and tingle on his skin he was as excited as any green cadet for the first time in many days he felt alive kalnikovs voice echoed down the gangway welcome my friends come along we are going to enjoy this journey come along for a moment spence entertained an absurd image of god the creator of the universe as a big russian pilot calling his cadets to join him in a fantastic flight of discovery all right murmured spence to himself im ready lead on what do you mean hocking screeched we that is he never showed up tickler stammered how could he not show up he never left the lab thats what you said millen watched him the whole time you said not all the time no said kurt slowly very much aware of the danger he was in at that moment he went to the commixsary for a few minutes you were not to let him out of your sight it couldnt be helped oh and why not hocking demanded color had risen to his cheeks staining his pale flesh with a crimson tinge in the low light of his quarters snaky veins stood out on his forehead and he appeared as if he might burst with rage and frustration i watched him until he got in line at the commissary and then went back to wait i couldnt let him see me watching him could i ortu will hear about this i will not keep this from him this time youll have to face him yourselves unless unless tickler leaped at the first sign of hope that they might somehow avert the wrath of the shadowy and severe ortu unless you find him immediately you have four hours we cant search the whole station in four hours millen whined youll find a way hissed hocking i want him found quickly do you hear me or else ortu will deal with you well find him promised tickler without waiting for hocking to change his mind both men hurried away to begin their search they donned pressure suits and made their way back across the construction site once back inside the station they hung their suits on the racks and stepped into the tram its all your fault muttered tickler thickly my fault kurt glared at his companion i watched him as you instructed you told me to search his quarters as soon as i got a chancewith him in the commissary i had a perfect chance what have we here wasnt going anywhere he told me hed be right back he oh oh you scared me cried ari as the lights went on and pv invited me to go along with him you should have gonethe search could have waited where were you you could have followed him yourself obviously we wouldnt be in this mess now if i had somethings happened to him i tell you i saw him waiting in line at the commissary shut up i dont want to hear any more all that matters now is that we have to find himand fast where should we begin i dont know he could be anyplace by now i told you we should have gone to hocking at onceas soon as he didnt show up for the session millen moaned what difference does it make now what you told me we could not risk making reston suspicious he knows something is going on hes hiding somewhere well he cant have gone far hes on the station somewhere and we have only four hours to find him wait a minute i have an idea i know where to start looking the tram whizzed away on its magnetic cushion began their frenzied search of gotham as the two ari felt strange in spences rooms she had never been to his quarters or even the lab now everything she saw seemed heavy with the presence of him she was afraid to touch anything lest she somehow disturb his memory she shook the feeling off hes only gone on a trip she told herself he hasnt died but the eerie morbidity still lingered like a chill in the small room he could have at least made his bed she thought she bent to the task but drew her hand back from touching the blankets no leave it as it is leave everything as he left it the funeral atmosphere of the room was about to stifle her and she wanted only to get away she found the model of the space station in the pocket of his jumpsuit where he said it would be she fished it out replaced the jumpsuit and left the room stepping back into the darkened lab she found herself in the grasp of tickler kurt stood at the portal with his hand at the access plate i did not mean to startle you miss i thought you might be a prowler ari gasped and blushed i i was looking for dr reston are you a friend of his tickler still held her arm tightly yes are you his assistant i am dr tickler what did you want to see him about oh something personal but its all right i can come back some other time yes perhaps youd better tickler regarded her carefully his eyes stealing over every inch of her what is that you have there this its just a paperweight she said uncertainly she resented ticklers attitude now if you will excuse me she pulled her arm free from his grasp of course im sorry its just that we cannot be too careful you know the work is very important he stepped aside and ari passed with an air of offended dignity inside she was frightened by the way tickler had treated her she began to see why spence wished his mission to remain a secret and she did not regret the lie she told to cover her reason for being there she reached the portal and went through without looking back once out of sight she hurried down to the comcen section to place mr restons paperweight in the mailframe of the next shuttle down follow her said tickler as soon as she left i want to know what shes doing with that model kurt went out at once and slipped unseen upon her trail the middleaged womans blue eyes stared out onto a green expanse of lawn bordered by high hedge rows and softly swaying willows a light breeze lifted the leaves of a lilac bush near the open french doors she sat primly in a large overstuffed chair her hands folded in her lap wrapped in her shapeless cotton print dress of faded blue she looked like a doll grown old waiting for her young mistress to come back and rescue her from loneliness and love her once again mrs zanderson a voice at the door intoned gently the woman did not move there was not a flicker of response in the vacant blue eyes mrs zanderson a whiteuniformed attendant slipped into the room silently and came to stand by the chair its time for your medication caroline here now the nurse held out a green capsule in a white paper cup and placed it in the womans hand she took the hand and lifted it toward the womans mouth and tipped it in there now would you like to go for your walk this morning the woman stared unmoving out the open doors all right then lets get up now thats right well have a nice walk before lunch come along thats right the nurse pulled her gently to her feet and with a hand under her arm guided her out onto the broad green lawn as they crossed the threshold the woman looked back to her room as if she had left something of inestimable value behind and feared for its safety my chair she cried your chair will be safe while were gone it will be there when we return the woman accepted the attendants assurance she turned back to her stroll with a look of grim determination as if she were embarking on a walking tour of the continent she tilted her head toward her nurse and confided as one with a dark secret they are waiting for me back there they want my chair you know we wont let them take your chair dont you worry about it you dont believe me no one believes me they want my chair who wants your chair caroline tell me all about it youre playing with me you dont believe me then you tell me who wants your chair the voice became a dry whisper the dream thiefhe wants me but he cant get me so he wants my chair you wont let him take it will you the deep blue eyes went wide no no he wont get your chair and he wont get you either well fix him dont you worry they walked out upon the lawn in the yellow sunlight of a clear cloudless day several other patients strolled the grounds under the watchful eyes of attendants in white mrs zanderson calmed under the warmth of the day and forgot her agitation of a few moments before recognition drifted back to those troubled eyes why i know youyoure belinda the nurse smiled and nodded thats right you remembered is my ari here i want to see my little girl ari is all grownup now remember she isnt here now but shell be coming to see you soon i have to see her right now i must warn her warn her caroline what would you warn her about the dream thieves silly they are after her too i know it i can feel them theyre after her you dont believe me do you i think youre getting yourself all worked up over nothing caroline we wont let the nasty old dream thieves get your ari will we no of course not youre

else please lets walk all right caroline just as you say well walkbut we wont talk about the dream thieves anymore shall we you just let me take care of them for you look at the pretty flowers caroline all the red ones and yellow onesarent they beautiful yes beautiful mrs zanderson had withdrawn into her shell she stared ahead dully her features appeared cast in gray stone after a short tour of the grounds the nurse brought her back to her room where she once again took up her vigil gripping the arms of the faded red chair with her thin hands like an eagle guarding her clutch all the pictures spence had ever seen of the red planet failed to do it justice mars shone with a rosy glow like a big pink harvest moon its mysterious canals traced in dark red across the surface against the black of space with its litter of stars the planet seemed serene and inviting the transport streaked ever nearer and the red orb grew larger by the hour but the gyrfalcon was still two weeks away from rendezvous its something isnt it spence recognized the voice and turned to meet his friend that it is adjani i know im supposed to be nonchalant about this sort of thing but i cant help staring at itso strange so alien ill tell you a secret everyone else feels exactly as you do even packer he lets on that hes seen it all before and could not care less but ive seen the look on his face when he thinks no one is watching hes as taken with it as anyone else adjani spoke in his light rippling voice his black eyes glowing with the sight before them spence tore himself away from the window and took adjani by the arm come on lets go get something to eat they walked out of the gallery and along the cramped corridor aft to the galley there were several groups huddled over steaming mugs at the long tables a chronometer over the galley window at one end of the rectangular room read good said spence weve got an hour of burn time left we can still have some coffee and a bite to eat like regular human beings kalnikov accelerated the transport periodically during the voyage during these times the thrust of the engines produced the effect of gravity for the passengers and crew then the galley filled with people who were tired of sucking their meals out of vacuum bags and sipping their drinks through tubes in zero gravity they filed past the galley window and picked up mugs of coffee sandwiches and thick squares of crumbly brownies they settled themselves at one of the tables and wolfed down the sandwiches youre looking much better spence im feeling much better i guess im an astronaut at heart this trip agrees with me spence and adjani had become close friends in the long days of the trip they had spent endless hours talking over adjanis magnetic chessboard until spence felt he could trust the slim indian with his life he had been thinking of revealing his secret to him for several days and had decided to risk it the moment they sat down to eat adjani sensed this and provided the opportunity he watched his friend quietly waiting patiently for what spence would say i guess you already know that i was under some kind of pressure back there he jerked his head to indicate gotham i sensed as much yes you read my mind that first time i came to see you it scared me a little im glad weve had some time to get to know each other here because i want to tell you about it adjani said nothing but leaned forward a fraction and inclined his head in a listening attitude i dont know how to say this without sounding like a raving madman but trust me adjani and hear me out spence took a deep breath and launched into his story from the beginning right up to the moment he boarded the transport in secret adjani sat still as a stoneonly his eyes showed that spark which indicated that he attended every word i couldnt tell you before i was afraid you wouldnt believe me spence sipped his chilled coffee and watched his listener for a reaction what you have told me disturbs me greatly my friend i wish that you had told me soonerperhaps that afternoon in my quarters this is a very dangerous game that you have become involved in spence viewed adjanis grave features with alarm he had not expected the reaction he was receiving surely you dont think if it were just a matter of what i think you would be right to tell me to mind my own business but what i have to say to you is not conjecture i have seen it with my own eyes he clasped his hands in front of him and his sight turned inward as he lost himself to his tale when i left school to return to my own country you can imagine how excited i was i had heard my father talk about the mountains of india and the quaint villages perched on the sides of hills and on the edges of chasms i was eager to see the land of my fathers to walk where they had walked but i was naive my friend dreaming of idyllic golden lands i went to the mountains of nagaland and i walked through villages that have not changed in a thousand years but instead of quaint and happy peasants i saw people suffering unspeakably people trapped by something so terrible it twists their minds and hearts do you know what it isfear a fear so great that it drives them to take their own lives in despair they die by the scores every year throwing themselves screaming off the mountains to crush out their lives on the rocks below and so stop the terror many more hundreds collapse under the strain their minds snap and they become little more than automatons but what are they afraid of they have a name for it supno kaa chor translated it means dream thief picturesque it is no joke these people believe that there is a godthe dream thiefwho creeps from house to house in the night and steals the dreams of men while they sleep he replaces their dreams with his own and thereby sows the seeds of madness they say he lives in a mountain place in the himalayas where he keeps his stolen dreams locked in a great ruby which is guarded by six black demons from the underworld it is said that when a person has no more dreams left in him the dream thief sends him into the night to take his own life you dont believe that nonsense surely i believe there is something behind it yes it is real i have seen its effects i have seen the mindless wander the hills screaming in terror in broad daylight i have seen the broken bodies collected from the dry streambeds below the cliffs in the morning after the dream thief has passed through whatever it is it is real but you cant think that ithat i have anything at all in common with a bunch of frightened hillfollk adjani eyed him strangely i am a connection man remember i make a living providing connections between seemingly unrelated facts and information it is my job to suggest what does not readily occur to others i am telling you what i believe is possible it is up to you to discover whether there is something to be gained by examining what i have told you spence stared at adjanis grim expression he was inclined to doubt the connection his friend had suggested but for the obvious foreboding adjani seemed to feel he would have dismissed it outright what do you think i should do he asked we must work out a plan of action and a way to keep you safe until we can get back to gotham to investigate but i am in no danger here spence dismissed the notion with a sweep of his hand you are in great danger my friend you yourself have felt it or you would not have come on this trip as you did you know there is truth to what i say a buzzer sounded signaling the end of burntime gravity in five minutes and everyone in the dining room rose and took their utensils and dishes back to the galley window spence slurped up the last of his coffee and stood he hesitated looking down at adjanis upturned face and the concern written there all right ill do what you say where do we start hocking glared at his henchmen his eyes red rimmed from lack of sleep burned out from his sockets like hot coals his voice shook with anger and frustration three weeks hes been gone not a trace of him not a sign and we have learned nothing from that slip of a girl mr millen have you received an answer to that tracer you put on the pack age she sent it came in only an hour ago well what is it im waiting the package was sent to dr restons homerather his fathers home it contained only the model and a birthday card nothing else hmm that is interesting the eggchair spun around slowly in midair as hocking pondered the meaning of this latest shred of information neither of the others spoke they did not dare break in on their leaders thoughts they had endured hockings fits every waking hour for three long weeks and they feared for their lives but suddenly hocking spun around to face them and his deathly countenance lit with a wicked glee gentlemen he announced our slippery water rat dr reston has jumped ship he has tricked us tickler shook his head how could he we have watched every shuttle and checked every manifesthe never left the station there is no other way out there is one other way you fools the transport hocking grimaced and his eyes blazed hes on that transport to mars he was not listed on the manifest i tell you i checked it a dozen times not even under an assumed name how we have underestimated our friend gentlemen of course he is on that ship he arranged to have himself put aboard outside normal channelsprobably that bubbleheaded girl acted for him she is zandersons daughter after all there is one quick way to find out im going to pay a little visit to zanderson himself tickler frowned doubtfully do you think you should do i not it is time he remembered who his keepers were yes ill go and remind him myself and ill find out whether reston is on that shipas im sure he is hocking stopped and leered at his associates then we shall plan a little surprise for spencer to celebrate a successful journey when he lands on mars well be ready for him spence boarded the landing pod with packer and a halfdozen of his thirdyear men he swung weightless into one of the seats lining the bulkhead and strapped himself in pulling the safety webbing over him and fastening it tightly all around he stared down at the magnificent redgold sphere of mars filling the port below himso large had it grown in the last few days that no more than a slice of its curve could be seen the pod was strangely silent the cadets ordinarily brimming with dash and bravado seemed veiled in their own thoughts every face wore a look of rapt wonder spence suspected that he himself appeared as goggleeyed as the rest of them olmstead packer swam into the center of the pod and called his group to attention hear ye hear ye he said wheeling slowly through the air we will wait until everyone is suited up before popping the hatch i want to check each suit myself before you step out on the surface ive got a yellow sticker to put on each helmet that lets me know ive checked you out anyone who fails to get his suit checked wont get another chance to play outside understood the shaggy red head turned to regard spence and adjani as well that goes for you too gentlemen same as for all first timers just then a rattling shudder passed through the pod followed by a lowpitched vibration which built to a muffled roar and died away almost before it began thatll be one of the other pods going down now said packer as he dived for his seat happy landing gentlemen all braced themselves for the blast that would send them streaking toward the surface of the red planet they heard the thrum of the engine and then a whoosh as if gale force winds had passed over them in the same instant they felt themselves pressed gently back into the jumpseat cushions as the illusion of weight returned to spence it seemed as if they fell like a rock dropped from a mountain peak the burnt orange of the martian landscape spun crazily as the pod descended looming larger and eve larger in the port until individual landmarks could be discerned they fell alarmingly close to the surface considered spence before he remembered that mars atmosphere was very thin an did not extend far out into space still it seemed as if they would smash down upon the red rocks rushing up at them at the last minute the pod turned itself around and the engines sent forth a staccato burst to slow their descent the next thing he felt was a slight bouncing joltas if he were aboard an oldfashioned elevator which had reached its floor he half expected a chime to sound and the doors to open instead the pod erupted with the cheers of the cadets who threw off their webbing straps and jumped to their feet to clap one another on the back in the jubilation of all travelers who arrive safely at their destination from the racks behind each seat they took down the elasticized surface suits and began wriggling into them the suits designed for mars were simple tightfitting polymerized one piece elastic suits much like ocean divers wore all the necessary pressure was supplied by the girdling effect of the elastic a mushroomshaped helmet attached to a wide neck seal on the suit completed the ensemble the helmet had a hemispherical visor which allowed full vision in every direction at the back of the helmet a builtin canister held oxygen pellets for extended rambling on the surface of the planet when all helmets were in place the hatch was popped and each explorer filed past packer who stood at the portal and affixed his yellow triangular stickers to each helmet as he checked each suit spence stood last in line behind adjani and after the once over by packer stepped out into the rustcolored world he bobbed down the steps of the hatch and walked a few paces in the red dirt that powdered beneath his feet his motions were exaggerated and springyan effect of the reduced gravity of mars he grinned from ear to ear with the exhilaration of just being there a human being treading on alien soil he felt strong invinciblealso an effect of reduced gravity he scanned the horizon of the planet and was surprised to find how close it was and how sharp the curve he turned to scan the points of the compass everywhere he turned the same dull red brickcolored dirt met his gaze as if he were lost in a mono chromatic desert rocks of various sizes poked through the red soil some of these were a shade or two lighter or darker than the dirt around them providing the only contrast he could see at the horizon the sky burned a brilliant blue as if infused with fire the blue gradually darkened to jet black directly overhead spence soon found that this changed dramatically depending upon the time of day at high noon the sky was pink at sunset it glowed with golden warmth at the horizon while stars shone hard and bright above like gems spilled out upon a cloth of blackest velvet low in the sky one of mars tiny twin moons hovered above the faraway mountain range at least spence took it to be faraway without a heavy atmosphere to distort images and clothe them in misty shrouds objects and landforms on mars appeared hardedged and distinct whether close at hand or faraway across a stretch of the arid soil he viewed a loose assemblage of buildings huddled domeshaped like a cluster of toadstools the terraforming installation one of five on the planetbut whether it stood two kilometers or ten distant he could not tell he heard a buzzing in the air and turned to find its source he was surprised to see packer standing atop the hatchway with his helmet in his hands shouting at them as his face grew bright red take off your helmets he called through the helmets insulation the words sounded as if he were shouting at them from one end of a very long hose tentatively spence grasped the sides of his helmet and gave it a sideways twist he heard the pressure hiss away and felt his ears pop as if he had suddenly leaped to a high altitude he took a breath and found that he could not stop inhaling its all right packer said a little breathlessly just breathe easy dont overdo it relax and let your body adjust to it there were oohs and ahhs all around as the cadets experienced this wonder of breathing the thin martian air i wanted you to see that you can breathe without a helmet if necessary the atmosphere is still mostly carbon dioxide thats why your lungs feel as if they cant get enough but we have been able to enrich the atmosphere by a few percentage points there is enough oxygen to support life for short periods of time if you do not tax it you could not run or even walk quickly before you passed out but you will not die of suffocation either if you dont exert yourself your more immediate danger is the temperature im sure you are all aware that during the day the temperature this time of year is a uniform degrees celsius as the sun goes down the temperature plunges to minus your suits offer some protection from the violent swing in temperature but they are not designed to be used during the chill of a martian night packer raised his helmet over his head all right put your helmets back on and lets track it to the installation he pointed toward the cluster of buildings spence raised his helmet and paused to breathe once more the incredibly dry thin air tasting its metallic tang on his tongue he closed his eyes and drew it deep into this lungs where it burned with tingling fire it seemed almost as if he were standing on a mountaintop the effect was the same remarkably like the himalayas said a voice beside him he opened his eyes and grinned at adjani standing at his elbow i was thinking of the rockies myself ive never been to the himalayas they replaced their helmets and spence tasted the sweet oxygen as he breathed it in he adjusted the voice amplifier so that he could speak to adjaniadjani did the sameand they trudged off behind the bouncing column of cadets with packer in the lead the terraforming project was in its fifth year on mars at the present stage it took the form of enormous greenhouses filled with broadleaf plants genetically engineered to be virtual oxygen factories the greenhouses pumped in the carbon dioxide of mars and flushed out the oxygen waste of the plants beneath the greenhouses nuclear reactors maintained optimum temperatures heating the plants through long impossibly cold nights the greenhouses were established and working according to plan this trip inaugurated phase two of the project melting the enormous polar ice cap of the planet there was water on mars the first voyager probes had discovered that but it was mostly locked up with the carbondioxide ice at the poles although some minute part existed as water vapor it was not enough to sustain plant life by melting the polar ice it was hoped that enough water vapor might be released to allow the planet to begin rebuilding an earthtype atmosphere as the amount of oxygen and water vapor in the atmosphere grew the temperature would stabilize and the mineralrich soil though dry as desert sandwould perhaps support some varieties of plant life and later animals and eventually man terraforming was a bold idea that seemed bound to work given enough time packer planned an expedition to the poles to view various sites where nuclear devices might be planted to melt the dry ice he was anxious that terraforming of mars be complete within his lifetime i want to see my grandchildren romping over the lush green landscape of mars he told his cadets he was far more taken with this project than with the plasma drive still the first colonies were decades away little red clouds of dust rose from the tramping feet of the cadets as they moved along the trail by the time they reached the installation an octopus arrangement of buildings with the central barracks surrounded by the long rows of greenhouses radiating out from the center like arms everyone was covered with the fine rusty grit they moved along the translucent shells of the greenhouses and spence could see flashes of green from within completely out of keeping with the dullness of their surroundings the occupants of two other landing pods had already reached the installation and were pulling tractors with high wide wheels out of hemispherical sheds cadets under the direction of project leaders were heading back to the pods to begin hauling in the provisions the rest were given chores to do to ready the installation once more for human occupancy spence adjani and packer entered the bombshelter entrance of the barracks and made their way through the tube to the air lock and to the installations nerve center packer took off his helmet and inhaled deeply ahh smell that fresh air it comes from the greenhouses spence took his helmet off as packer waved his hand over a console set in the wall near the air lock lights winked on in a ring around the circular room overhead a shield peeled away to allow sunlight to enter and warm the interior of the sunken sphere all the conveniences of home said packer if your home happens to be antarctica quipped adjani think of it in a few years this whole area will be nothing but greenhouses as far as the eye can see well turn this place into a jungle of lifecareful of course to introduce only the most beneficial of plants and organisms the place will be a paradise its too late said spence youre here already look what youve done to him adjani hes as bad as you are why am i treated like this what have i done to deserve it he broke off his woundedelephant act to direct them around the cavernous interior of the living unit come on ill show you where to hang your hats spence glanced at the wall console where a crimson signal had bloomed in one corner does that red light mean anything whats that oh that one its a meteorological signal must be a special weather report coming in he keyed a code on the consoles pad the data screen lit up green and began scrolling sentences theres a simoom blowing up near the equator it could reach us by tomorrow morning well have to stay inside a few days at least and keep the shields up a simoom a stormwind and sand a sandstorm such as youve never seen before its like a gigantic sandblaster winds up to four hundred and eighty kilometers an hour if anyone were to wander out there in thatwhy youd be erased in seconds provided you werent blown clean away first incredible said adjani he looked around at the superstructure of the building dont worry laughed packer these structure are windtunnel tested and the shields can withstand anything short of a direct nuclear attack were safe enough inside we just have to stay undercover until it blows itself out by night fall all the provisions and equipment frames were stored away and the barracks hummed with life the interior of the dome resembled an ant colony they ate a common meal and then split off into their work groups to begin mapping out the tasks for the following days spence and adjani without any direct assignment stole away to the directors lounge to relax and talk spence noticed that adjani had stuck close to him since they landed and even now regarded him with a watchful eye do you think the dream thief will try something tonight he asked as adjani came to stand beside him he gazed down at a holographic map of the martian landscape encompassing the region thirty kilometers in a circle around the installation i was thinking how great the mountain isolympus mons twice the size of everest why do you feel something no but youve been my shadow ever since we landed i wondered if there was a reason spence recalled the conversation between them and the plan they had agreed upon he was to alert adjani the moment he felt anything at all peculiar beginning to happen to him adjani would then take whatever steps were necessary to prevent spence from doing any bodily injury to himself it was a simple plan but it would have to do until they returned to gotham to begin tracking down the cause of spences troubles adjani gazed down at the holomap sinaithe desert of moses here we are wanderers in an alien wilderness searching for a home in a foreign land history repeats itself once more eh i wonder if this place has a god too spence adjani turned a solemn face to him you asked me if i thought the dream thief would come again tonight the answer is yes i do think so he has left you alone during the trip but i think it likely he will try to reach you we must presume he will try tonight it was true spence had not been bothered by the dreams or blackouts since leaving gotham he had begun to feel that by leaving he had escaped altogether adjanis mention of trouble struck a raw nerve you dont think im safe even here no my friend you will not be safe until the dream thief is stopped at least you believe he con be stopped i was never so certain of course he can be stopped but we must keep you safe until we find the way and remember if i am right in my assumptions yours is not the only life in danger others may depend on what happens to you we must keep you safe spence stumbled doggedly across a rocky alien landscape over his shoulder deimos a beautiful serene bluewhite globe rose full in the black sky spence winced in pain as needlelike shards of tiny cinders sliced the flesh from his knees blood bubbled from the minute tear in his surface suit he shivered and wrapped his arms across his chest for warmth staring down at his feet he saw that he stood on a barren ledge of rock red in the glow of the rising sun around him lay diamonds glittering with an icy glare with a shock he realized that they were his tears frozen where they had fallen upon the bare rock he raised his hands replaced his helmet once more and continued walking how long he walked or how far he did not know high overhead white wisps of clouds like tattered veils raced through a black sky blown on the winds of the coming storm to disappear beyond the rim of the horizon he heard the howl of the wind as it roared through the emptiness above he wanted to run to see where the fragile white clouds went but as he stirred himself a heaviness sapped his strength his legs would not obey he leaned into it felt himself pushed back as by a great hand and realized it was the wind each step dragged more slowly than the last he looked around him and saw red sand beginning to run in hissing snakes around him blown on the gusting wind he crawled to the top of a nearby dune and toppled over the other side into the wind shadow he felt himself sliding down and down he struggled to rise to his feet as the dry red sand sucked at his limbs the sand rattled down on him from the crest of the dune as the wind whipped it into a stinging fury he sank back too cold and tired to move the sand pelted down on him in a steady rain burying him beneath a fine red blanket he screamed and his voice rang hollow in his ears he looked and saw that he was trapped in a great glass bubblethe bubble of his helmet now beginning to frost over on the inside from the warmth of his breath the sand seemed to fall out of the black sky burying him alive he felt the gritty sting as it pelted against his surface suit he heard faintly the dry bristling hiss as it struck his helmet he screamed again and heard the awesome ring of silence and knew that his cries could not be heard beyond his helmet his teeth chattered with the cold which dragged him down into a lazy stupor he was drifting to sleep sleep his last great enemy had conquered him spence came to slowly by degrees his senses slug gish as if he had been drugged a bright light filled his eyes so that he squinted to keep it out when it did not go away he opened his eyes and looked around at first it did not occur to him where he was or in what condition he heard his own even breathing filling his ears with a steady rhythm and knew he wore his surface suit and helmet but his body was stiff and frozen into a fixed position he tried to raise one arm and found that it came free with difficulty he raised the other arm and pushed himself gradually into a sitting position with a jolt he realized where he was mars he had wandered out onto the surface alone his dream had been real his stumbling trek across the martian landscape was no nightmare it had happened what is more he remembered it though he remembered it as a dream before that however only blankness and unknowing another blackout spence rose to his feet scooping sand away from him he crawled to the top of the dune and looked out over the red desert fighting down the panic he felt rising within him nothing could be seen of the installation not a glimmer in any direction the winds had calmed but away toward the southat least he considered it a southerly directionthe sky bore a distinct brownishred smudge as if a prairie fire burned out of control just beyond the horizon overhead the sky was tinged with a pinkish cast which meant it was approaching noon or just passing it here was a problem clearly he could not sit by and wait for a search party to find him and he could not walk in every direction at once he glanced at his suits chronometer on his right forearm and set it on elapsed time mode figuring that at best he had only seven hours before the temperature dropped and he began to freeze he decided to start walking toward the mountain peak he saw rising into the clear air so close it looked as if he could touch it with an outstretched hand he remembered the holomap and the fact that olympus mons the tallest peak on mars stood some thirty kilometers distant from the installation if he could reach it there was a chance he could see the installation from its slopes it would be a race for it meant traveling fifty or sixty kilometers in seven hourseight hours at the most to even have a chance at making it back to the base in time he would have to travel at a pace of seven or eight kilometers an hour without wasting another second he turned himself toward the mountain and began marching off in long groundeating strides he walked for hours it seemed to him and the great flattened cone of olympus mons did not seem perceptively changed periodically he had stopped to look around him lest he miss some sign of a search party or some indication that he might be moving nearer to his goal on one of these reconnoitering stops he became aware of the fact that the brown smudge on the horizon to the south had grown considerably it nearly filled the southern quadrant towering several kilometers into the sky by his best estimation as he stood gauging the size of the disturbance he felt the horror of realization creep over himthe simoom the storm was sweeping in on wings of awesome fury racing toward him spence began to trot in an awkward bouncing gait doubling his pace he had to reach the mountain before the simoom struck it was his only chance the first gusts of wind pummeled spence like angry fists around his legs the sand sang away like steam escaping from a pipe the force of the coming storm impelled him on lifting his steps and blowing him forward he lurched ahead drunkenly exhausted sweating inside his surface suit his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth in thirst he stared at the dull brown overcast which crept over the sky like a discolored shade the sun burned through with a throbbing white glare as he dragged himself on he walked mechanically now not attending to his steps not caring whether he reached the mountain or not he despaired of ever seeing the installation through the thick clouds of red dust whipped up by the simooms winds spence walked now to keep from thinking of the grisly end waiting for him just a few hours away on and on he walked and the wind howled around him filling the sky with dust and blotting out the land tiny projectilesgrit sand and shards of rockthrew themselves into him slicing at him he could feel their sting through his surface suit and knew that it was only a matter of time before the steady blast tore the suit away from his body stripped it off like a second skin to leave him naked in a deadly rain packers grim forecast echoed in his ears youd be erased in seconds spence rehearsed the torturous details of such a death flesh stripped molecule by molecule from his bones and then the bones themselves battered to pieces and scattered still warm over the surface of the planet to be ground into powder the scene held a grisly fascination for him though he knew that it would likely be his own fate it was that or death by freezing those were his choices the sun was lowering in the sky and already the wind whistling around him held a chill soon the temperature would plummet and he would stop moving as his body heat evaporated this at least seemed preferable to the other death he stumbled blindly now the dust obscured everything beyond the plastic perimeter of his visor the rattle of tiny missiles filled his helmet like the crackle of static and his thoughts turned toward those who would mourn his death his father would take it hard of course and his sister adjani would feel badly but it was difficult for spence to imagine the brown genius actually grieving over him ari of all he could name alone embodied the sole regret of his heart she alone he cared for and he would never see her againnever see those bright blue eyes never see her golden hair shining in the sunlight or feel the cool touch of her long fingers as she brushed his facethe awful certainty of their separation saddened and frightened him more than death itself he hoped that in some small way he would leave a void in her life which would never be filled by another that she would remember him fondly and weep when she heard the sad news of his death itself he remembered the words she had said the night before he left he could hear her voice speaking to him once more be very careful spencer i will pray for you every day prayer cannot help me thought spence then reflected that probably very little else would help either at least prayer would not hurt the idea seemed somehow appropriate to him now and proper he wished that he had the right words to say so that his first and likely last prayer would not be the feeble simpering of a dying agnostic he felt a rush of emotion and the tears brimmed up in his eyes to roll down his cheeks inside the helmet he could not brush them away with the tears came the words im sorry im sorry which he repeated over and over again forgive me he whispered help me that was the prayer he prayed though why he was sorry and for what he should be forgiven his heart alone knew scarcely had the words crossed his lips when he felt himself slammed to the ground by a blast of cold wind with the force of a rocket thruster and the scream of a beast in agony he lay unmoving as pebbles and small stones tumbled over him he could not raise his head much inside his helmet but with the cold sweeping over him he knew he must keep moving to remain warm snakelike on his belly he inched forward he had not gone far when he felt the wind lessen he pushed himself to his knees and stood he tottered a few more steps and the wind hit him again this time tumbling him forward and rolling him in a ball he felt himself rolling and rolling as if all support had been yanked out from under him and he would go on forever but he did not stop rolling and it was then that the wind no longer assailed him he had fallen headlong into an arroyoone of the small canals which creased the surface of the planet here he was out of the wind and safe from the blast of windblown projectiles he could see only slightly better than before thick clouds of dust filled the arroyo rolling in on the wind spence put his head down and scuttled forward over the rocky terrain of the dry river bottom darkness increased rapidly and he could feel the cold increasing its hold with the setting of the sun gradually he became aware of the downward slope to his path the arroyo deepened and from what he could see when the dust clouds parted widened as it grew into a rift canal he walked woodenly on with no other thought than to keep walking until he dropped from hypothermia he knew that death would follow quickly and he would not feel it that at least was preferable to being blasted into particles by the wind the grade descended rapidly and then flattened out completely spence stopped and at the same instant the billowing clouds of red dust parted in the last glimmering light of day he saw before him a sight which made his mind reel his knees buckled as he made to draw away he had wandered to the very edge of the rift he now stood on the brink of a canyon stretching out before him hundreds of kilometers and carved deep into the crust of the planet another step would have sent him plunging to his death his reaction to this new danger was purely physical in his mind the prospect of falling to his doom held less significance for him than it might have at another time he was simply too exhausted and too benumbed by the cold to care anymore a fact he noted that indicated hypothermia was already beginning to affect him it would not be long now so this is what it is like to die he thought to feel the life force slipping away and to be acutely aware of it he wondered if he would find the release others talked about if he would meet his mother among the ranks of souls who had passed into the great beyondor whether those like so many other things were simply the superstitions of a fading age he had no particular thought about the moment he noticed how the shadows deepened to violet on the canyon walls and how the depths of the canyon were already sinking into darkness as black as any pit simoom wind above him shrieked like all the demons of hell released to vent their fury on the desolated land there came a rumble beneath his feet a vibration of the rock shelf on which he stood he turned to look behind him and his eye caught a glimpse of a churning mass moving down the rim of the rift toward him a rock outcropping eroded by the wind had broken free and started an avalanche that was now sweeping down the side of the canyon toward him spence had time only to throw himself to the ground before he was swept away in the sliding jumble of rocks and dirt the rock slide carried him tumbling far down into the canyon miraculously the grinding twirling thundering mass did not crush him outright when the slide stopped he lay panting on the topmost layer rocks and pebbles continued to pelt his body but he had neither strength nor will to move the cruel martian night closed its fist around him and he knew no more tso its no use adjani hes gone weve got to turn back packers big hand flipped a switch and he talked into his headset sandcat to sandcat we are returning to base repeat we are returning to base over just one more pass along the rift valley pleaded adjani his eyes did not leave the thermograph screen the sandcat swayed on its springs as the simoom screeched around them packer blue in the light of the thermoscreen turned his face toward his friend he placed a hand on his shoulder and gripped it firmly as if to establish a physical hold on reality in a voice deepened with fatigue and sadness he said it is twenty below out there and only an hour after sundown in another hour it will be fifty below the storm is bucking to full force by morningwe havent seen the worst of it yet we lost visual four hours ago and the thermograph shows a solid blue field if we dont head back now we wont make it he paused and added squeezing the shoulder once more its over i let him get away i am responsible protested adjani youre lucky he didnt injure you for life there was no stopping him god knows weve done everything humanly possible hes out there somewherealive i know it i feel it if he is still alive hes past help packer turned the sandcat and watched the instruments as he punched the return course into the onboard navigator he took his hands from the wheel and let the computer guide them home adjani buried his face in his hands and began rocking back and forth in his seat packer turned away neither one spoke for a long time they sat and listened to the rattle of the sand and rocks upon the shields the radio on the overhead panel squawked to life kalnikov at ibase mat units and return to ibase immediately acknowledge the message was repeated and packer responded giving their eta to the base there was a long pause static crackled over the speaker your loss is to be regrettedmore static i am sorry the transmission was lost once more to the storm packer reached up and switched the radio off i guess ill send a report as soon as we get back to base i dont exactly know the proper procedurethis has never happened before couldnt we wait a few days i want to look some more sure we can wait but it wont make any difference i would like to find the body at least adjani the storm is likely to blow for days by the time you are able to search again there would be nothing left to find it is the least i can do please all right i wont stop you they sat silent until the computer flashed the outline of the installation on the vidscreen were almost there sighed packer heavily adjani turned with an urgency laying a hand on the big mans arm please let us pray for him now before the others of course both men bowed their heads and adjani spoke a simple heartfelt prayer as the sandcat entered the installation compound safe from the storm spence lifted his throbbing head his limbs were numb he could no longer feel his hands or feet heavy vapors of sleep tugged at him luring him to slip lightly away on their easyflowing stream to oblivion for a moment he nearly gave in and let the stream take him where it would but something about giving in that easily rankled him with an effort he pushed himself up shifting the debris which had settled over him he placed his unfeeling hands on the ground and steadied himself gritting his teeth with jaw muscles stiff with cold he straightened and swayed unsteadily on his knees overhead the bright disk of deimos shone down on him the simoom had abated for the moment allowing the ghostly light to spill down into the rift canyon he looked around him as rattling shudders racked his body his muscles were contracting violently in their last effort to produce lifesaving warmth these contractions would pass soon he knew and then he would lie still spence did not want death to find him sitting down he stood on wooden unfeeling legs and tried to walk the loose debris shifted and he was thrown down the incline of the canyon still further his helmet struck a rock and he stopped he lay there exhausted staring up at the black sky of mars imagining that he was the first man and possibly the last to ever lie awake under a martian night sky the convulsions gradually lessened he felt a tingling warmth spread through his framethe illusion of warmth the last remnant of his bodys defenses exhausting itself a misty darkness closed around him narrowing his field of vision blurring the edges with a velvet softness but the stars above in the center of his sight still burned hard and bright untwinkling unmoving unlike stars at all it was as if the eyes of the universe watched him to see how a man died no he shouted hearing the empty ring of his voice in his helmet no he said again his voice was but a murmur watching the stars he saw a pale white mist pass over them like a diaphanous veil he thought it a trick of his failing eyesight then he saw it againjust the faintest trace of color against the night the frailest of silken threads odd he thought what could produce such a phenomenon his scientists brain turned over this bit of novelty he raised his head and saw a little below him on the slope a silver tracery on the rocks glowing in the light of the moon on nerves and determination alone he stirred his useless limbs and halfslid halfswam to the spot he touched a gloved hand to the faint white outline of the stuff on the rocks it gleamed in the clear light crystals he muttered to himself ice crystals frost all around the immediate area he noticed the white hoarfrost and below the wisps of mist rising out of the ground scarcely thinking or attending to what he was doing he scrambled further down the slope and found himself peering into a pitchdark hole a fissure in the canyon wall had opened up perhaps due to the rock slide earlier out of this fissure the slightest trace of pearly mist rose into the deathly cold martian atmosphere the crack was just large enough for a man to squeeze head and shoulder through without thinking a second time spence thrust himself into the opening he found the hole beyond somewhat wider as he wriggled awkwardly into the opening he inched forward into the blackness bit by bit and discovered the crevice dropped away at a sharp downward angle he sat down and used his heels to pull himself along sliding on his seat down and down he went i have chosen my own grave he thought my bones will not be blown to dust on the winds the thought strangely cheered him deeper into the brittle crust of the red planet he went sometimes sliding sometimes walking nearly upright calling on his will alone to move his body blind as a cave bat he moved abandoning himself to all else but the moving onward deeper and deeper still how long he walked how far he burrowed he did not know the blackness around him penetrated his mind covering it with itself removing all thought all memory leaving only the present moment and the raw will to move on when the first ghostly glimmer reached his eyes out of the darkness around him he thought it a trick of his failing mind his faltering brain cells firing off minute electrical charges and somehow producing light in the cortex or optic nerve but the faint greenish glow did not fade instead it grew stronger spence shuffling forward like a zombie willing his legs to carry him along stumbling over the uneven downward pathway stayed on his feet and moved toward the gleam he saw in the distance he reached a spot where the glow seemed brightest and found as he came upon it that the faint light was a reflection on a blank wall of stone he placed his hand upon the stone and saw the green cast on his glove he turned to see what produced the glow as one reeling in a dream what he saw rocked him back against the wall in disbelief a wide tunnel glowing with interlacing veins of living light stretched before him the thin green color glistened on the walls and roof of the gallery like a luminous dew spence tottered into the tunnel and pressed his face close to the rock surface as close as his helmet would allow the glowing stuff oozed from the rock clinging there like a slime he thought of the phosphorescent plankton and algae in the oceans of earth can it be he wondered have i discovered life on mars the tunnel glowing softly with the light of the tiny green organisms stretched beyond spences sight it was smooth and round and large enough for a man to walk erect without touching the top or sides its circular symmetry reminded him of a water conduit the notion occurred to him that the shaft had been formed long ago by the water which had once run in the arroyo above he stepped into the shaft and started walking not knowing or particularly caring where it led as he moved along he saw that the green light wavered as he passed as if his passing disturbed the tiny luminescent creatures the glow dimmed as he drew near and then flashed brighter behind him the creatures if creatures they were apprehended his presence he moved on it seemed like hours that he pursued the unbending downward course of the shaft before he noticed a slight curving of the tunnel walls ahead when he reached the place where the curve began he noticed a gap in the floor of the shaft not a large crackone he could jump across if he were careful about it but dark so that he could not see how far down it went spence reached out over the edge of the hole and after a few moments felt a tingling sensation in his fingers as warmth began to seep through his gloves the fissure was a natural vent which carried heat from a deep reservoir beneath the crust of the planet perhaps from some ancient volcanic source or reasoned spence from the molten core of the planet itself with shaking hands he grasped his helmet and gave it a sideways twist and lifted it off his head he felt the warmth drift out of the hole and wash over his frozen features this was perhaps the source of the fragile mist he had seen on the slope of the arroyo trough he replaced his helmet momentarily and took a lungful of air then stepping away from the crack he blew it out and watched the steam roll away in great billows clearly the tunnel was still desperately cold but by contrast with the surface it was tropic it was at least warm enough to keep the tin alive he doubted whether it was enough to keep himself a vlrtual any length of time without real warmth the c y glowing alive ally get to him if more slowly than it would at the surface spence balancing himself carefully leaped with extreme caution over the crack and trudged off feeling every weary deep in his bones he wondered how much longer he would be able to keep going and feared that if he stopped to sleep would not wake up the cold would overcome him pushing the thought aside he gritted his teeth and moved on he after a while he noticed that the green glow shining around him grew brighter looking at the walls of the tunnel he saw that the strange organisms grew in greater profusion perhaps it meant that the shaft was becoming warmer he continued on at soon he walked not in a faint glow but in the green ha light of a moonbright night the lightmaking creatures clustered in thick colonies over every available inch of surface radiating a steady green fluorescence which made him feel as if he walked inside a beam of light he welcomed the illumination but the floor of the tunnel was now so covered with the algaelike organisms that walking became a hazard his unsteady feet aching with the rigors of his ordeal slid as on glare ice while he propelled himself along the shaft he fell often each fall wearing him down further it took him longer to regain his feet each time he began to think that the next time he would not rise again but he did rise again something urged him on kept him climbing back onto legs wobbling with pain and fatigue again and again he rose sliding stumbling staggering ever downward into the bowels of the planet the tube twisted and turned like a snake it sank in sharp downward angles and he lay on his back and slid like a man on a sled he followed it without thinking where it would lead him where the tunnel walls pinched together he wormed his way through where crevices opened in the floor he found the strength to get across where the roof lowered he went on hands and knees he kept moving time lost significance he lost all comprehension of the passing hours his suits chronometer shattered in the fall into the arroyo presented only a fixed presenttime frozen as if his life had stopped at that moment past present and future merged into one mingling amorphous element through which he moved as through water once he came to himself as he felt the floor drop away beneath him his feet kicking out from under him he landed heavily on his back and glimpsed the shaft falling away in a nearvertical drop he had stepped over the brink without knowing it the tube was smooth beneath him and the lightemitting algae cushioned his slide somewhat as he picked up momentum sliding faster and faster riding the curving conduit deeper into the red planets heart the exhilaration of this wild ride burned the clouds from his mind he felt adrenaline pumping into his bloodstream rousing him from his torpor as the shaft raced by him blurring his vision it seemed to him that he was falling into a gleaming green infinity hurtling faster and faster whizzing into a radiant unknown the luminous algae tore away in flashing streamers from his hands and feet to splatter over him like foaming light covering his faceplate blinding him he wiped at the visor and cleared a small area just in time to see the shaft bottom out he braced himself for the impact and felt the tube curve and level out as he hit the bottom with a bonecracking thump he skidded out arms and legs flailing rolling over himself as if hed been tossed from a speeding vehicle when at last he raised his head to look around he saw that he was in an enormous cavern he pushed himself up on elbows and knees and winced from shooting pains in his head and back the cave was a vast bubbleshaped dome flattened on the bottom its roof arched at least a hundred meters above the floor the walls curved and smooth lifted upward gracefully he rose stiffly and feeling as if every bone in his body had been rearranged began walking the length of the domed vault the dim bluishgreen light bathed him in the illusion of walking on the bottom of the sea he fully expected schools of fish to swim by at any moment he reached the further wall and discovered that the cave had several smaller conduits leading out of it and large drainlike holes in the floor these smaller tubes were squat roughly half his height if he were to continue his journey it would have to be on hands and knees he quaked at the thought his muscles already drooped with exhaustion and strain he sank to the floor and lay down in front of one of the drain tubes in moments he was sound asleep two doors stood at the end of a long dark passage i shimmering with a cool blue light spence approached the doors and as he came nearer his heart began to race pounding his chest sweat rolled off his forehead and burned in his eyes he wiped his face with his sleeve and walked on now he stood before the two doors and it came to him that behind one of the doors ari waited to embrace him to soothe his troubled spirit and heal his wasted body behind the other door a monster with large yellow eyes hulked ready to pounce and devour him he wept with anguish over the decision he must make and cried out for someone to help him but his voice rang hollow in his ears he stepped forward placed his hand on the oldfashioned doorknob and turned the door creaked open on ancient hinges and he peered apprehensively into the room it was empty spence crept into the room and as he crossed the threshold the door closed behind him a mist came boiling out of the walls and floor rising in a cloud before him within the cloud lightning flashed in red streaks and he could see a shape dimly emerging as if it were being knit together out of the stuff of the vapors he watched as the shape took on human form then the clouds receded falling away in curling tendrils to reveal a creature remarkably manlike but born of a separate creation the child of an alien god he trembled in its presence as the thing motionless towered over him head and shoulders its smooth golden skin gleaming with beads of moisture he felt a tremor pass through him as the manbeing drew its first breath deep into its lungs spence sank to his knees before it transfixed with awe and fear then as he gazed through trembling fingers up at the stern spare features the eyelids flickered and raised slowly two great yellow eyes glared down at him and he shrank away from their terrible gaze he threw his arms over his head and tried to hide himself from their sight but the being saw him saw through him weighed his soul with its piercing sight and found it sadly wanting it raised one long multijointed arm toward him and opened its wide mouth to pronounce judgment spence screamed clamping his hands over his ears the tremor seeped through the rock floor of the cavern accompanied by a strange sighing roar spence still groggy from his exhausted sleep lay for some moments trying to remember where he was the rumble increased and the roar grew louder banishing the last traces of sleep from his brain the floor beneath him vibrated steadily he had never stood on the slope of an active volcano but that was the image that came to mind as he rolled up to kneel quivering with fear and uncertainty the thin air inside the cave convulsed as tremendous jets of water rushing out of the sinkholes in the floor erupted in gushers fifty meters high the explosion knocked spence sprawling as the floor rocked with the aftershock and tons of water rained down instantly he was swept into the narrow opening of the conduit kicking feebly against the swirling flood and slamming full force into every curve of the pipeline until he learned to relax and let the water take him on and on it carried him eventually it no longer filled the conduit he could see a bubble forming on the roof of the tunnel the bubble expanded until it covered a quarter of the pipe and then half and then it left him stranded on his stomach as it dwindled away he slipped off his helmet and cupped his hands to get a decent drink but succeeded only in wetting his gloves that he reasoned was better than nothing so he held up his hands and let the water drip off his fingers into his mouth he repeated the process several times managing only to arouse his thirst the more for whetting it on hands and knees he continued his trek and arrived at the junction of a larger tunnel just as his muscles every fiber screaming for relief threatened to give out this larger passageway stretched away on either hand into dark shadowy distance slanting upward on the right and downward on the left he tried the upward course but it proved too slippery and each attempt brought him sliding unceremoniously down a before he got a dozen paces he decided to stop before he lost his footing altogether and went skittering into the dark corridor behind him he was just about to resign himself to having to take that course in any event when he spied higher up in the tunnel wall a small aperture he had not noticed i before this opening suggested itself to him as an acceptable alternative and he decided to give it a try the decision nearly killed him twice he reached the edge of the opening and failed to get a proper handhold sliding back onto the floor both times the third time he managed to tear away some of the algae around the rim of the opening for a better grip he dug in and held on while he brought his feet beneath him hoping to use them to drive himself up and into the opening it nearly worked he gathered himself for the push and then let fly his head rose to the level of the bottom of the opening and he thrust an arm forward while his feet kicked against the smooth slick stone wall then he brought his other hand arround and grasped the lip of stone it was then he felt himself fallling backwards to the tunnel floor below the fall progressed in slow motion his hands raked the stone and then empty air as he twisted catlike in midfall sank backward and dropped in a heap to the floor the impact knocked the wind out of him for one horrible moment he could not breathe and then air rushed in in great windy gasps his ribs felt as if they hadbeen staved in and his shoulder throbbed where he landed on it what he failed to accomplish with strength and dexterity he achieved with patience and cunning using every inch of body surface to increase the amount of available traction he imagined himself a slug and oozed up the curving side of the tunnel toward the opening he felt his hand hold and pulled himself up centimeter by painful centimeter until he could lean into the opening and squirm in on his belly this new tubule also rose at a slight t upward grade which forced him to concentrate on every steleone misstep would send him sliding out into the main tunnel like something expelled from a cannon he doggedly placed one foot in front of the other and arms outspread like a man walking a tightrope labored up the passageway this tedious method of locomotion wore on him taxing already tired muscles to the limit he longed to sit and rest but the incline offered no advantage there he lowered his head and pressed on ignoring the pain shooting through his thighs like fire a kind of benumbed melancholy overtook him which he recognized as the sum of a number of factorsstress fatigue hunger and pain not the least of them each step was a struggle against creeping despair he longed to just sit down and let his fate roll over him like breakers upon a desolate shore but he did not give in he slept again and awoke still exhausted but clearheaded and with a gnawing emptiness in his stomach he was fiercely hungry but the prospects of doing anything significant about it appeared depressingly slim he resolved to push all thoughts of food and eating out of his mind the attempt proved largely unsuccessful like the tongue that has just discovered the still tender gap where a tooth used to be his mind returned again and again to probe the subject despite the pain it caused him under such extreme conditions hallucinations were perhaps to be expected still despite this knowledge and his training in the ways of the human brain the hallucination stopped him dead in his tracks unremarkable as hallucinations go it nevertheless hit him with a wounding impact as if the thing had exploded in his face he tottered on his heels for a moment and then stepped backwards into the wall behind him where he slid slowly to the floor eyes starting from his skull in shock and disbelief there before him glimmering faintly across the corridor stood a door no snarling hydraheaded monster could have alarmed him more than this simple architectural object at first he thought it must be an optical illusion a trick played by overtired eyes then he knew he was experiencing a hallucinationseeing doors where he desperately wanted them to be following this observation it dawned on him that persons undergoing hallucinations did not perceive them as such while in the very grip of them a door his mind reeled what could it mean indeed what else could it mean feverishly spence began tearing away the algae by handfuls digging it out with his gloved fingers from around the imagined threshold what emerged was an object of stone cut from the stuff as the surrounding walls with no external markings of any kind he would have considered it a novelty of nature the except its smoothness roundness and perfect symmetry against a natural artifact but he could not be sure argued he lifted off his helmet and smacked it into the slab he listened to the echo pinging away to the dim recess of the tunnel he also heard a hollow sound beyond the b overcome by a burning curiosity to see it lay beyond the supposed door he leapt at the slab and began pushing with all his might succeeding only in shoving his feet out from under him then he knelt before the door and tried to worm his fingers into the cracks at the sides he arched his back and strained until he thought his heart would burstand the slab began to move it slid a few centimeters and he felt a gush of warm air from behind the door the algae on the floor around him flushed brightly he smelled the stale dry air flowing out it had an odd taste which he could not placesweet yet rancid the air of a tomb once more he attacked the door with a fury he was rewarded for his labors when at last the stone rolled back another few centimeters and he was able to squeeze his shoulders through he forced himself through the narrow opening dizzy from the lack of oxygen and gasping for breath he collapsed on the floor and lay down panting while waves of nausea from his overexertion slammed into him a faint reddishgold radiance fell over him as he lay gazing upward though where this might come from he could not readily tell the walls around him were smooth stone and dull red in the ruddy twilight of the mysterious light after a while the wracking nausea subsided and he was able to raise his head and look around there was not much to see the passage bone dry and dusty continued upward at a steep angle directly ahead of him in order to find out more about his new surroundings he would have to haul himself back onto his weary legs and climb that incline shaking with fatigue he squirmed onto his side and made to push himself up his hand brushed something in the dusta small ridge of stone he looked down and saw between his hands the faintly outlined depression of a footprint the footprint lay squarely in his path outlined in the red dust thick upon the floor a trick of the light he thought some odd stone formation but he stared at it as if he expected it to disappear spence leaned down over the print and carefully as any archeologist would blew away the dust then with the tips of his fingers ever so lightly he brushed away the thicker silt that had accumulated the print remained inexplicably pressed firmly into the stonea print of an upright creature quasihuman narrower and longerit looked like someone had taken a mans foot and stretched it out of proportion and it had only four small toes on close inspection he decided that it was not missing any of its toes as from an accident it had been designed that way he looked around to see if there were any other prints nearby but there were none he did discover that the print lay in the bottom of a slight depression boundaries by two smooth banks as if at one time long ago an underground stream had trickled along this course spence sat in the dust his mind reeling this was the discovery of a lifetimeof several lifetimes probably the most important find in the last two hundred years in the last thousand life on mars he dr spencer reston had discovered life on mars beyond a shadow of a doubt mars had once been home to something more significant than glowing algae the thing that made that print walked upright like a man perhaps thought as a man was conscious of itself the implications of his discovery sorted themselves out only gradually once the dimensions of his find emerged in their immensity the finer details could be seen the print very clearly had been made ages past counting in order for it to have solidified into stone if other articles of martian civilization existed they would most likely be dust and ashes unless fossilized of course he argued the print need not necessarily belong to an inhabitant of mars at all it could just as well belong to an intruder like himself this did not diminish his enthusiasts in the least nor belittle his discovery the thing was extraordinary no matter how one viewed it but it did cause spence to slow somewhat and consider how little he knew about the print or how it had come to be there clearly he had pushed speculation beyond reasonable limits for a scientist he would have to have many more facts to substantiate his theories to even begin to develop any theories one print alone was not enough he needed more to go on one print alone was almost worthless what he needed were bones artifactsany of the normal archaeological building blocks deathly tired his mind beginning to wander he crossed his arms on his chest and fell asleep beside the footprint with thoughts of red martians crawling blithely over the landscape besmeared with chalky red dust like pygmies and himself towering over them saying something ridiculous like take me to your leader the ache in his gut was back when he awoke and his throat burned a thick gummy film had formed in his mouth foultasting and nasty his tongue felt large and uncooperative he had heard stories of men dying of thirst in the desert whose tongues had swelled turning black in their mouths and choking them in the end he wondered if this was how it started grimly he got to his feet swaying dizzily black spots swam before his eyes hunger had become a demanding force and thirst an everpresent fire he knew that he had little time left before he collapsed in a faint after several such collapses he would rise no more he considered returning to the tunnel behind the door where the algae grew in such lush profusion it occurred to him that he might be able to eat them and sustain himself the only drawback to this plan was that the algae could well be poisonous one mouthful could cause him to end his life retching out his entrails in a cold sweat or send him screaming in agony to crush his head against the stones to stop the pain these were the milder scenarios he imaginedless pleasant possibilities occurred to him which he did not care to entertain spence decided that if he had found no water by the time he slept once more he would return to the passage beyond the stone doorhe now considered it a door in every sense of the wordand eat the algae come what may he would by that time be on his last strength and it would not matter which way his life finally ceased at that point he would be willing to gamble but not before so he lurched off once more climbing up the passageway not more than a few meters up the tunnel ended and he stepped into a vast underground cavity of enormous proportions he began walking head down shoulders forward arms swinging loosely at his sides soon he was pleased to discover that his gnawing hunger had eased he felt clean lean purged of a heaviness that weighed on his body and spirit electrically alive spence knew this to be the sensation associated with a fast medically the effect was well recognized still he could not help feeling the intense emotional impact of the phenomenon he felt for lack of a better word spiritual at intervals along the routehe decided to move directly ahead keeping the tunnel at his backthick columns of stone rose from the floor like the trunks of trees he wondered at these but they like the slab door seemed to be natural formations such as one might find in any cave there was no reason to believe they were not exotic forms of stalagmites peculiar to the martian lithosphere and yet the sprout of suspicion had already woven its snaking fibrils deep into his consciousness what if they like the footprint were not natural the implications were too extraordinary to entertain for any length of time but increasingly the suggestion of trespassing occurred to him how he had struck upon that particular word he could not say but it seemed appropriate he felt like one trespassing on private ground a grave robber desecrating a pharaohs tomb he imagined that at any moment a whole phalanx of speartoting soldiers would come swinging into view from behind one of those strange columns he had visions of plumed horses and chariots dragging him through the village square while the screaming alien populace jeered thief graverobber desecrater these daydreams he knew to be associated with his deprivation he had begun to feel his thirst once morethe tiny amount of water he had scooped from the conduit floor was not enough to sustain him he needed a real drink badly he hoped that the flood which had washed him through the tunnel could be located again there was water on mars maybe not much but it existed he had navigated it finding it again was a project becoming uppermost in his mind gradually as he walked along the dull red cavern floor listening to his own footsteps pattering away into the darkness the roof of the cave sloped away and with it the rustcolored lichen clinging to its surface the lichen he discovered gave off a pale aura like the algae in the tunnels he made his way along through a dim and hazy light of ruddy gold which reached him as sunlight through the flaming canopy of autumn trees but here the trees were stone and no leaves scattered before his feet he fell into an easy rhythm of walking trying to maintain asteady course forward the tempo of his steps carried him alongafter a few hours of walking he slept again and then oncemore after thatstill unwilling to give in and return to the tunnel and the algae each time he slept less and woke less rested than before he supposed this to be the effect of his fast his body was beginning to turn on itself for nourishment he felt lightheaded airy spiritlike pure in his journey through the martian underground spences eyes turned inward and he gazed upon his life with the kind of aloof objectivity he usually reserved for his work with the same meticulous scrutiny and the same relentless curiosity only this time the subject was himself though considered a fastrising star by most he nevertheless knew himself to have fallen far short of the mark there were others he knew who had accomplished more received higher praise garnered more of the glittering prizes he sought whose names were better known and respected more than his own the resent ment he felt for those fortunate others had hardened into a burning almost ruthless ambition to surmount their achievements an ambition spence had always prided himself on thinking it a virtue and a means to his personal fulfillment now considering his circumstances and the shallowness of his inner being he viewed that ambition for what it wasa flame which had consumed nearly all his better qualities to fuel itself compassion generosity joy even lovethese had been given to the fire and it had all but consumed them and now what had he to show for his pains nothing of lasting value nothing that would live after him all had been directed inward feeding the flame that he had any redeeming qualities left at all seemed to him something of a miracle so much had been given to the allconsuming fire in this delicate suggestible state he felt the loss of all those years of determined selfdenialthe endless studying working striving the waste appalled him he had been convinced that the only success in life came through achievement as a scientist he trusted only what he could see and examine if it cannot be measured a professor had once told him it is not worth thinking about he had laughed at the time but now he saw clearly that the joke was on him he blindly bought that empty philosophy as did so many of his young colleagues though they called it by different names and dressed it in altruistic rhetoric of course he had told himself that his goals as a scientist were helpful to mankind and therefore worthy but a real concern for his fellowman never entered into it the goals were merely milestones on his private road to success the question he kept coming back to the one uppermost in his mind at the moment was a question of ultimates what ultimately had he done with his life had it been wisely spent sorrowfully no spence confronted with the naked facts was forced to conclude that his life had been pretty much one long selfaggrandizing binge and it had contributed nothing to anyone but to make him a dour selfish gloryhound in short it had been except for momentary lapses a life not worth living spence his logic cool and keen as a computers stared unblinking at the conclusion and marveled that he should have tried so hard to save such a sorry life as his own there came over him a feeling of shame of guilt so thick it clothed him like a garment never in his life had he felt guilty for anything that he should feel so now when there was absolutely nothing to be done about it was the final irony he dimly remembered a sort of prayer uttered out of the frustration of the moment as he had wandered in the wilderness desert of mars not so long ago that prayer came back to him now and mocked him as his own lack of faith in anything beyond human ingenuity mocked him see how the worm turns his ghostly accuser seemed to say faced squarely with its own mortality the creature grasps at arty straw where foolish one is your dignity where is respect do you not have courage enough even to end your life as your self you lived it what right do you have to call upon one you never worshipped never believed never acknowledged you lived by your beliefsdie by them spence felt a chill in his chest as if an icy hand had closed around his heart as much as he wanted it to be otherwise he had to admit the accuser was right for the first time in his life he saw himself for what he was the sight sickened him he desperately wished that somehow all that had happened could be reversed that he could be given a second chance the hope died stillborn in his breast he reflected sadly that there were no second chances and his plight was beyond reverse beyond help beyond hope in this way absorbed in his pitiless introspection spence came into the city that it was a city he had no doubt he had not noticed i that for the last four kilometers or so the roof of the cavern had been arching away gradually by the time he reached the outskirts of this alien habitation he could not see the ceiling he had been lumbering along oblivious to his surroundings when he saw something glimmering in front of him spence had raised his eyes and found himself standing before a weird assemblage of structures if pressed for a description spence would have said that the city appeared to him like a termite nest he recalled pictures of the inside of such a nest from an entomology textbook and looking upon the strange elongated and flowing structures brought back the same image to him on further inspection though the graceful interwoven cells looked like nothing at all that he had ever seen and they gave not a hint of what kind of resident might have inhabited them this discovery brought none of the heady rapture of the explorer who believes he has found eldorado at last nor of the paleontologist who chances upon an unnamed saurian he did not even feel the same elation experienced upon finding the footprint he just stood unmoving in his tracks shaking his head in disbelief and wonder it was simply too much to take in all at once he did not know how to react when he came to himself again he began threading through the winding pathways among the hivelike habitations under curving arches and over halfburied burrow hills he soon lost himself in the refined tangle of bending interlacing shapes as a small child in an enchanted forest his way was lit by the radiant lichen clinging to the sides of the dwellings it was as if he moved through an elven world sparkling with magic and whispering voices the voices were the swish of his steps as he passed hollow or curving shapely walls the more he saw of the cityformed of some kind of ado belike material such as ancient indian settlements but harder more durablethe further he walked the more beautiful it seemed to him and colorful the dwellings were of various subtle hues oranges reds violets and browns in various subdued tones deli cate earthen or rather martian hues of ocher and sepia madder and rust and buff softly shimmering in their own faint light there were apertures and openings which he took to be windows and doors these were of various shapes all in keeping with the surrounding curve of the wall or archway of which they were a part for this reason spence could get no precise impressions of what the residents themselves might have looked like he poked his head into the darkened interiors of several dwellings and saw nothing at all to further the identification process the rooms were the inner version of the outer structure molded and graceful and for all he could see cleanswept and empty in his reverent ramble through the interlacing forms he struck upon a wide meandering pathway between two ranks of towering structures this he took to be a central trafficway the domiciles on either side of this street rose to a considerable height above the smooth even surface he walked upon some of them branched over it in sinuous arches or tubes which wound snakelike to join a building on the other side the notion came to him that if he followed this trafficway he would end up in the center of the martian city he was not wrong within an hour of discovering the place he stood blinking in the center of a wide expanse surrounded on all sides by the queer architecture the sheer alien beauty of the place still overwhelmed him he had begun to think that the martians whatever their outward appearance had been an elegant peaceloving civilization such was the effect of the architecture on him he did not for a moment consider that there might be any martians still around everything he saw indicated a civilization which had long ago ceased to exist he sat down to rest on a smooth mushroomshaped projection one of many which randomly dotted the central clearing his vision blurred and wavered he knew he was seriously dehydrated now dizziness played over him and he felt suddenly weaker as if he were beginning to disintegrate he imagined an exploring party of the future wandering into the square and finding his bones and mistaking him for the last remaining martian as spence sat holding the last unraveling threads of his strength his gaze happened to fall on one of the hives across the square set apart from the others for some reason the structure took on an importance for himhe felt himself drawn to it though outwardly it did not differ from any around it it was roughly moundshaped with bulging sides rising upward to become bulbous compartments and chambers spence nodded in his remote inspection of the building his eyes closed and he slid from the mushroom pod and rolled onto his side and fell asleep he woke at once he would have sworn his head had barely touched the ground before his eyes snapped open again but the burning in his throat and the throbbing in his head told him differently he had perhaps been asleep for some time but the pain was not what awakened him someone called his name and it sounded as if it had come from the hive across the square the word had been so quickly spoken he could not say that he did not imagine it but unlike imagined voices this one hung in the air as a present thing spence slowly lifted off his helmet and put it down the air in this part of the cavern though dry and stale seemed more conducive to oxygen breathing for he found he did not gasp as before the deathly silence of the place alarmed him he heard nothing at all not even the suggestion of an echo at least inside his helmet he had heard the constant rhythmic pattern of his own breathing all at once it came to him that he had drifted off to sleep because his oxygen had run low in his helmetthe pellets had given out if not for the voice which had stirred him once more he would never have awakened again he would have suffocated in his sleep he stood looking down at his helmet with a mixture of relief and longing he did feel relieved to have escaped this subtle death after braving so many other greater dangers on the other hand it would have been a peaceful painless deathto sleep and not wake up again to the ache in his stomach and head and the stinging fire of his thirst as he stood contemplating whether or not to put on his helmet again and so end the game he heard his name again he heard it ring in his ears and register in his brain but it came from another place though where or how that could be he could not say the dying often hear voices he reminded himself such occurrences were well documented but spence felt an inner tug at him toward the hiveshaped dwelling across the quad he stepped forward hesitantly uncertain whether to give in to his hallucination so easily he shrugged remembering that he had nothing at all to lose though he knew he would find nothing of interest or of any possible value to him within all the other hives he had peered into had been uniformly barren still the inexplicable pull directed his steps and he gave himself over lacking the strength to fight it in a few moments he stood gaping at the exterior of the hive and at the darkened hole of the entrance spence swayed unsteadily on his feet as he shuffled in and knocked against something standing just inside the door it was hard and unyielding and he went down in a heap without the strength to fall gracefully darkness dwelt in the cool interior had dwelt there undisturbed for perhaps a thousand centuries he sank back on the floor and let the darkness cover him surrendering to it become a part of it he longed to just lay there panting and never stir again but his curiosity overcame him what had he bumped up against when he entered it was flat and hard and he still felt the chill of it against his side where he hit it what could it be if it was to be his last act so be it but at least he would know what he had found he dragged himself to his knees and lurched forward across the floor toward the unseen object his cheek struck a hard flat edge and he pressed his palms against a smooth surface and raised himself up now what he wondered i have found something here in this dark place now what he thought to try moving it with the idea that he might be able to take it out into the relative light of the cave but try as he might in his weakened state he could not budge the thing nor even find a place to grasp it he let his hands run over the surface of the object to give him some idea of its size and shape he felt like a blind man trying to guess the nature of an object he had never seen he discovered it to be uniformly smooth and rather boxlike its surface composed of flat planes joined at shallow angles like plates of armor or the facets of a gemstone spence brought his hands once more toward the top of the rectangular object and felt a long cylindrical portion rise from the plane of its surface following the cylinder up he discovered it was surmounted by a large sphere he found two more cylinders and spheres at either end of the rectangle now he was thoroughly intrigued he stood abruptlytoo quickly for his conditionand the dizziness flowed over him in a dark wave he staggered backward and fell against a smaller object directly behind him the thing caught him at the back of the legs just below the knees and he toppled over it the sound of a brittle crash filled his ears he was there in the darkness listening for there had been something else in that crash that he heard something he had been listening unconsciously for since he first entered the tunnel he recognized it now but it seemed out of place and almost eerie in the silence in the darkness somewhere close at hand he heard the wonderful liquid splash of water dripping on the floor just give me one more day just one more what does it matter you can send your report in the morning thats all i ask packer hunched in a formmolding chair at the radio console tilted back and looked at his friend their eyes met and held their gaze all right sighed packer i guess it doesnt matter that much youve managed to put it off a week already but you have to tell me whyi dont understand it this obsession of yours you must know theres nothing left it doesnt make sense adjani the slim brown man nodded thoughtfully and then spoke lowering his voice cautiously as if he feared he would be overheard i had a dream last night he whispered i saw him spence he was alive in some kind of cave or something he was hurt but he was alive and you believe this dream of yours adjani nodded slowly why tell me god sometimes speaks to his people in dreams and visions i believe this is a sign that i should keep on looking packer frowned he fingered the switches on the panel before him idly a sign arent you being a little melodramatic i dont know what you mean nothing really dont mind me packer swiveled away look you go on and do whatever it is you think you have to but ive got to tell them hes missing at least and i want you to be on call for some of the sessions okay the rest of the time its up to you you can even stay here while were planting the probes deal its a deal adjani remained slouched against the console smiling down at the burly physicist now what you want the keys to my car i was just thinking that youd like to believe too youd like to think that hes still alive wouldnt you surewho wouldnt to die like that thats not what i mean and you know it you would like to believe about the dream admit it a right i admit it yeah id like to believe that there was something out there watching over us i wish i could believe it well wanting to believe is just a step away from believing isnt it he turned and disappeared along the banks of telemetry equipment which formed the communications nook spooky injun muttered packer as he rose and pushed the chair back and shambled off to check on the progress of his boys who were assembling the probes for the next phase of the terraforming project hockings thin fingers fluttered over the tray of his chair brushing the tiny knurled impressions a whine like that of a dog in pain seemed to waver in the air rising rapidly out of audible range a circle of light appeared on the floor before him and the eggshaped chair glided into it and hung there in a moment the air around the chair crinkled with a tinkling sound like needles dancing or slivers of glass breaking then in a spot midway between ceiling and floor a dull glow appeared and spread into a gleaming blue halo the interior of the halo sparkled as shapes collided and shifted within it forming themselves out of pure light hocking waited as the shapes resolved themselves into the familiar features of his dreaded mentor ortu sat with his old head bowed the folds of his yellow skin hanging slack eyes closed unmoving he appeared wholly without life but hocking knew better slowly the hairless head rose and the eyelids opened two yellow eyes stared out with cold reptilian malice the thin lipless mouth drawn into a straight line frowned the edges bending down at slight angles nothing ortu did expended the merest fraction more than the absolute minimum of effort whether in thought or motion he would do only that which was necessary to accomplish his ends nothing more the broken man summons his master why the words were cut from ice you asked me to report to you following the latest attempt yes we located reston on mars at the last word hocking sensed a prickling of interest on the static features of his master the merest spark in the dull yellow eyes i attempted the mindlink as instructed it failedor at least i have not been able to reestablish contact he of course may be dead you bungled the procedure again ortu snapped i warned you hocking glared back i did as you instructed it was no fault of mine reston is resourceful but there is some sort of interference where he is concerned no one has survived three projections ortu hesitated something hocking had never before witnessed but when he spoke again his voice was flat and controlled once more there may be something in what you say an interference but we must make certain whether he is dead or alive find out and report to me i will do as you say the sparkling halo dimmed and faded from view hocking saw the ancient features dissolve once more into pools of diffuse light to vanish as the wreath melted away the pneumochair spun and whisked itself away hocking smiled darkly and muttered i think it is time to find out just how much miss zanderson knows spence lay sprawled on the floor of the hive with the brittle pieces of whatever he had fallen over scattered around him a hard mass of something pressed against his left legthe remains of the object that had tripped him from this source he heard the dripping sound he reached a trembling hand into the darkness and felt the jagged edge of an object near his elbow gingerly he traced the ragged rim with his hand careful not to cut his glove lest the liquid prove corrosive next he bent his head over the opening his glove had traced and sniffed the contents of what he imagined to be a jugshaped article of some size he smelled nothing at all so lowered a hand inside yes the receptacle did contain liquid of some sort he withdrew his hand and brought it close to his face and sniffed again and then cautiously knowing the peril touched a finger to his tongue it was water spence nearly jumped out of his surface suit shivering with excitement he removed his gloves and threw them aside hunkering over the top of the vessel he placed one hand inside and lifted a tiny sip to his lips the water tingled on his tongue like electricity he let it seep into his parched tissues and then cupped his hand for another drink in this way he eventually quenched his thirst it took some time for he was careful not to spill even the tiniest drop he did not know how long the water would have to last him and he wanted it to go as far as possible when he had finished he sat back and holding the vessel with one hand so that it would not tip over and spill out the remaining ration of water he fumbled on the floor for his gloves with the other hand his hand brushed over a raised platform set in the floor three oval objects decorated the surface of the platform they were smooth to the touch like glass and spence did what any child born on earth would have done he placed his fingers on the center oval and pushed it suddenly the interior of the hive blazed with white light and the air sang with a superhighpitched hum he threw his hand over his eyes and fell on his face he waited nothing happened he cautiously raised his head and saw before him on a low pedestal an oblong object shaped like a coffin and bearing three narrow cylinders topped with spheres the spheres were transparent and filled with liquid on the floor beside him sat his own broken sphere next to the low base on which sat the ovals one of which he had pushed and which apparently had illumined the place it was this low base or console of sorts he had stumbled over breaking off the sphere which may have been attached to it the light which had blazed so brightly emanated from beneath the pedestal of what looked more than anything like a translucent sarcophagus it gleamed darkly its facets like shining scales of a reptile showing gray as the light came through and around them he rose and went to it rubbing at one of the plates as he would have rubbed at a fogged window pane trying to peer inside a forbidden room the contents if any could not be clearly made out spence turned once more to the small console he had pushed the center oval with some effect now he chose the oval stone on the right and carefully pressed it again the highpitched hum and as he watched eyes riveted on the sarcophagus one of the three spheres of liquid slowly began trickling through the cylinder and into the murky depths of the mysterious box when the first sphere was empty the process was continued with the second sphere and likewise by the third in its turn spence tiptoed to the oblong box and pressed his face to the dim plates he saw an indistinct mass of intricately interwoven material it was fibrous and reedy shrunken and withered vaguely manshaped like a mummy but it was not a mummy the thing lay in about six centimeters of liquid on which floated as far as he could make out a thick film of dust he supposed the device to be some kind of machine for growing food it was the first thing that came into his mind for with the light and water and the floating nutrients the apparatus reminded him of a greenhouse in miniature though a greenhouse of a design he was sure no man on earth had ever seen he waited for the last of the liquid in the third globe to trickle into the greenhouse chamber and then he went back and pressed the third oval the hum which filled the room now made a deeper sound and he imagined the interior of the hive growing warmer almost immediately he went to the growing tank and placed his hands on the sides it did feel warmer to the touch but he could not be certain he waited for a little while and nothing else happened or seemed about to he decided to conduct a hivetohive search to see if he might turn up any more of the strange greenhouses this he did and was disappointed finding no more of the devices nor anything else of interest he returned somewhat dejected to the first dwelling during his search spence had puzzled over the voice that had beckoned him and thus brought him back from the brink twice he had heard itthe first time it had awakened him from the sleep of death just in time the second utterance had directed him to the hive which alone of all the others contained the growingmachine and the water this had also saved him spence had once seen a map of the world drawn by a sailor in the eighth century the map conceived of a flat world where known perils were clearly marked toward the edges of the world where the boundary between the known and the unknown had been drawn the mapmaker had written the words here be dragons anyone who spoke of the supernatural within spences hearing he summarily lumped into the same cast as the ignorant and superstitious byzantine sailor regarding religion spence had slightly more respect but only a shade more he considered it in its milder expressions a form of harmless dogoodism the refuge of weaker minds perplexed and frightened by the world they saw and their own inability to change it it was a psychological holdover from a time long past when men yearning for order but not knowing how to create it conjured up a supreme being who was not affected by the daily ebb and flow of change who was not part of the confusion because he stood outside it and if he did not help resolve the chaos of the world he at least did not add to it and so was conceived to be benevolent in his dealings with his creatures he allowed that faith in this godbeing was a minor virtue of sorts in the same way kindness to dumb animals or small children was a virtue he did not mock it as a rulesuch virtues had a place in the worldbut he did not find anything in it to recommend it for himself and yet he had prayedif one could call it a prayerto this same supreme being in his own moment of doubt and pain this he concluded had been the act of a drowning man one who might not have believed in life jackets but who was nevertheless willing to try one as a last resort before the waters closed over his head forever he had done it out of weakness and understandably so but the voicethat was something different he had heard it he could not argue it away its presence still lingered in his mind spence settled down in the room with the growingmachine to brood and wait for any new developments he would sleep and wait if nothing more seemed forthcoming he would take his water and retrace his route back through the tunnels or try to find another way back to the surface the latter plan seemed to offer more promise since he doubted he would be able to climb back up along those tunnels with any success the walls were too smooth and slippery and steep the tunnel glowing gently with a subtle blue green shimmer wound up and out of the planets interior spence clinging with fingers and toes to the slippery surface had by sheer strength of nerve and will dragged himself up to the very entrance of the underground shaft before him glimmering coolly stood two doors as he approached the doors he understood that one door led out onto the surface of the red planet and the other contained the answer to his dreams with this realization came a moment of dizzying indecision his heart began to race sweat beaded on his face and neck which one should he open which freedom did he desire more he raised himself and placed his hand on the knob of the door nearest him and stepped into an empty room at once his heart sankhe had been tricked there was nothing here to help him but as he stood blinking into the rooms dim interior a mist gathered boiling out of the floor in front of him rising in a dense cloud the vapors churned and he saw red sparks like lightning darting in thin streaks and he could see a shape dimly emerging as if it were being knit together out of the vapors he watched as the shape took on a vaguely human form the cloud receded falling away in curling tendrils to reveal a creature remarkably manlike but fashioned out of different stuff entirely the thing motionless towered over him its smooth hairless skin gleaming golden and wet with beads of moisture he felt a tremor pass through him as the manbeing drew its first breath he felt the urge to turn away to run and hide himself from its presence but he could not move he was held by an inescapable force he buried his face in his hands and peered through trembling fingers at the stern spare features the eyelids flickered and raised slowly and two great yellow eyes like those of a cat glared down on him he shrank away from their sight but the monster saw him and saw through him piercing him to the innermost recesses of his heart it raised one lanky arm and opened its mouth to speak he fell to his knees as if to beg for mercy from the creature but it stepped forward with surprising quickness for something so tall it scooped him up in strong arms and carried him into the darkened corner of the room which suddenly changed into a wide brightly lit corridor with an arched ceiling joined by other corridors which led away from it at regular intersections along the way the golden being carried spence effortlessly with long sure strides and at last came to a great domed room which was filled with exoticlooking machines and strange instruments he placed spence in a kind of bowlshaped chair and put a thin transparent shell of a helmet on his head the creature bent over a low bank of spheres mounted atop one another and spence felt a warm sensation sweep over him the creature looked at him and asked who are you why have you come the pain was a laserknife that sliced through his brain carving it neatly in half in one effortless stroke one moment spence had been standing atop one of the taller domed hives searching the underground cavescape for anything resembling an entrance or exit the next thing he knew he was lying on his side with the pain bursting in fireballs inside his head he had plunged through the thin shell of the structure when the portion he was standing on collapsed with a brittle crack under his weight he landed on his side and when he made an attempt to move the pain had exploded in dazzling colors he lay back panting for a long time until the pain subsided enough for him to roll over and put his hands on the floor to push himself up the effort left him head down retching with dry heaves he fell into a fit of coughing and tasted blood in his mouth when he was finished he looked down and saw flecks of blood in the thick dust with a stab of horror he realized that he had broken one or more ribs and that at least one of the broken ribs had punctured his lung he fell back and a long sobbing wail burst from his throat tears rolled down his cheeks as he rocked back and forth in the debris around him howling in despair and agony sometime later whimpering with pain at every step he dragged himself back to the first hive and lay down near the water sphere the hours blurred and ran the fire in his side increased unbelievably spence teetered on the brink of consciousness often tipping over the edge fever raged as he coughed and the lung filled with fluid threatening to suffocate him any but the smallest movement brought crescendos of pain booming through his body his chest felt as if it were clamped between whitehot pincers spence lay in a dream world half awake half swooning in his own sweat he roused himself periodically to sip water from the sphere and then fell back weakly following each exertion time passed he had no idea how much time the already confused hours merged together and he could not easily tell his waking moments from dreaming onesthey all fused and mingled like beads of wax on a heated plate it was during one of his rarer waking moments that he heard the pulsing hum of the machine next to him actually it occurred to him that he had been hearing it for some time he turned his head and shifted his body slightly to get a better view the gray translucent sides of the coffinlike box had grown murky as if clouds of vapor swirled within as he watched he saw tiny flashes like red lightning arcing from point to point within the plated box illuminating the interior stirred by this sight he inched himself closer and slowly painfully edged high enough to press his face against one of the lower plates to peer inside he saw a bubbling mass of gelatinous material glistening in the light of the tiny flashes the oozing stuff had covered the dry reedy material with a quivering layer that gave off a heavy vapor like a steam he noticed the dim outlines of a form beginning to take shapea form that was vaguely familiar spence drifted in and out of consciousness waking sleeping fainting weakened by hunger and the agony tearing at him like a ravenous beast he could not be certain of what he was seeing or when the room his thoughts the pain the machineall took on the airy illusory quality of one of his dreams reality dissolved around him he moaned howled and sang crude songs he laughed like one demented and wept like lost innocent rasps hand e long strange sounds sighs and gurglings g pt g quaking wheezes he could not be certain that all these did not emanate from himself but they seemed to come from within the growing box at some point the light from the sarcophaguss pedestal changed from white to a rosy pink bathing the room and spence in the ruddy illusion of vitality soon afterward the upper portion of the machine separated from the lower portion there was a rushing gasp of escaping vapors and the room was filled with an acrid smell like burnt rubber he lay with his head lolling on the floor choking and gagging but as the interior of the plated box cleared he raised him self feebly over the edge to look inside he saw a body stretched out in deathlike reposehumanoid with limbs and torso like a mans but remarkably elongated its features and the details of its body remained unformed as if it were made of clay and only partly finished there was no sign at all of lifethe thing could have been a statue whose sculptor had been called away before finishing his work twice more in lucid moments spence looked into the machine each time it seemed that the thing had become more developed though the exact changes were hard to pinpoint by the hour he became weaker and more unstable the pain in his chest was a constant piercing throb he lay curled around his water sphere without the power to raise his head he slept long and fitfully his sleep tortured by the torments of a broken body and troubled spirit he dreamed strange and fantastic dreams and saw things which terrified him in one of these frightening visions he ran down a stinking garbagefilled street pursued by shrieking black demons with flashing teeth and shining eyes nowhere could he hide or escape them they followed him in a pack like wolves snarling in evil rage in what might have been another dream he saw the form of a golden being rise from the grayplated coffin he saw the moisture glistening on the smooth hairless skin and he heard the swift and sudden inhalation of air drawn into its lungs he saw the eyelids slowly raise to reveal two large almost luminous yellow eyes which regarded him with a coldly reptilian stare then he was aware of smooth walls in the lighted corridor sliding past him and he thought he was back at gotham riding in one of the trams he turned his head and saw a long threefingered hand gripping his shoulder and he looked up into the huge yellow eyes when next he regained consciousness he was in a room filled with oddlooking devices and he was surrounded with a filmy substance which hung over him like a limp tent made of cobwebs the tent glittered and pulsed with energy he glanced down and saw a red ragged gash in his side surrounded by putrid greenblack flesh swollen and disfigured his flesh was skewered by two long white needlelike objects which caused a tingling sensation in his bones then he dreamed that he stood under a wide blue canopy atop a high mountain and felt the cool air whipping at his clothes he saw an ancient castle set on a peak just above him and black birds circling slowly in the air keening their sharp disapproval a voice formed words inside his head that danced and made sparkling images but the words had no meaning and the images were utterly foreign to any realm of his experience and then there was only darknessblessed darkness and release the message had been puzzling enough but the young man standing before her was no less cryptic ari regarded his smiling face suspiciously and answered slowly im not sure i know what youre talking about i havent seen dr reston for several weeks kurt nodded reassuringly i understand dr reston wished his whereabouts to be kept secret but he has communicated with us and wanted me to contact you you said you had a message from him ari stated firmly not giving away her sudden flourish of hope yes i was just getting to that he said that he was fine and to tell you that he missed you very much he was looking forward to getting back and seeing you is that all did he say anything about his work oh yes he said that his work was going very smoothly and that he was very glad hed goneapart from missing you that is i take it he likes you very much ari ignored the comment but the young man smiled so sincerely she felt like an ogre for suspecting him he obviously was telling the truth i think so ari admitted and you like himi can tell did you know he was going to mars certainly i ari paused glancing quickly at the cadets face he seemed genuinely interested that is i suppose i did he doesnt confide in anyone very much you know you can say that again i just figured he might have told youthat birthday gift and all we didnt even know hed gone dont you think that was odd of him to sneak off like that was it that big a secret then asked ari i assumed he told those who needed to know it must have slipped his mind kurt laughed well i better be going the panel slid open and the young man made to leave by the way is there anything you want me to tell him for youin case he contacts us again ari smiled and shook her head no nothing that cant wait just tell him to be careful and that im anxious to see him again will do goodbye miss zanderson see you around goodbye mr millen the portal slid shut the whole visit seemed innocent enough but she could not help feeling that something more something unspoken lay behind it after all this time why had he come why now furthermore something he said sounded suspicious to her what was it she hoped she had not given spences secret away perhaps she was just being overly protective perhaps spence had resolved his problem as he hoped he would and wanted to let her know he would have sent his cadet with a message it was plausible enough then why couldnt she accept it surely there was something more here than simple female vanity ari had had the impression that when spence decided to break silence she would be the first one he contacted she felt betrayed but told herself she was just being silly beside she should be happy that he was all right but was he all right why did she question it the thought nagged at her the rest of the day whereupon she decided that since she had no reason to doubt the sincerity of the young man or his message she should forget it spence viewed his surroundings with a kind of groggy halfawareness as if he had been drugged and then beaten senseless and left in a congealing heap what or who had done the beating he did not recall assuredly it had been something large and mechanical perhaps he had mixed it up with a shuttle scrubber oddly he felt no pain in fact he felt nothing at all it seemed as if he had been disconnected from his body and hovered somewhere very close to it but far enough away not to have to share its misery a thin gauzy veil separated him from his senses as if he were visiting a sick friend for whom he had only slightly more than the usual amount of empathy the sensations he felt seemed more properly to belong to someone else he was more than happy to let them go they had not held particularly pleasant associations a sound like a crystal chime reached his ears and he felt himself enveloped in a snowy white cloud which shut out all sight all sound all thought he knew himself to be conscious but beyond that he had no thought at alla state like sleep only brilliantly light rather than dark he floated in this feathery state of unknowing for an eternity then tinning in the distance far away he heard the chime again and the blazing white cloud which had held him for so long began to dissipate he was back in the strange room again covered with the filmy energy tent spence glanced down at his side and saw that the needles were gone and all that remained of his vaguely remembered injury was a rosy pink scar along his ribs he looked around the ovalshaped room for his surface suit but could not see it anywhere only then did the full impact of what had happened break in on him he had been carried to this place ministered over and nursed back to health the dreams of his delirium had not been dreams at all the creature from the growingmachine had cared for him he lifted the clinging web and was about to stir from the nest where he lay when he glanced up and saw a humanoid well over two meters tall watching him from a doorway the thing gazed at him steadily with keen interest its long triplejointed arms crossed over its narrow chest spence recognized the golden finely pebblegrained skin the huge yellow eyes and the elongated body as the being from his dreams he felt no fear of the creature only amazement that this meeting should actually be taking place the creature clothed in a loosefitting garment of a sandy color that glinted in the light came to him in graceful strides it stood towering over him its eyes burning as if it would devour him with its hungry look spence realized he was looking into the face of a martian feeling a little like a character out of a corny old sciencefiction movie he raised his hand in greeting the martian opened his wide thinlipped mouth and a sound like a sustained and fluid chirp issued forth ringing reverberating the liquid tones reminded him of a treeful of nightingales breaking into song at once the martian stared at him expecting some kind of response but before he could think of a suitable reply the martian still staring intensely made some physical adjustment in its speech organs and then said in a voice that trilled like bubbling water who are you why have you come spence passed a hand before his eyes in disbelief when he looked again the being still loomed over him its spare features almost sparkling with fierce intensity he decided that the harsh reptilian quality of the martians aspect was due to the fact that it had no hair that the face with its thin almost nonexistent nose was dominated by the huge brilliant eyes also he saw a narrow double row of gill slits along either side of the martians exposed chest they stared at one another for several minutes before spence realizing he had not answered managed to croak out i am spencer reston i am from earth he had almost forgotten how to speak the martian then turned with a dry rustle of his clothing and scooped something off a nearby pedestal table he turned back and held out the flat ovoid object spence took it and looked at it and saw that it was a threedimensional photograph of astonishing depth and clarity it showed a grouping of stars as viewed from ground level low brown hills showed on the horizon it could have been any grouping of stars in the galaxy but spence guessed it was a constellation viewed from mars still it meant nothing to him he shrugged and handed the object back the alien did not take it but pushed it at him once more and when spence looked the picture had changed to another scene this one he recognized easily in remarkably vivid holographics so lifelike it was as if he held a window which opened onto the universehe saw the sol system he nodded enthusiastically and pointed to the third planet from the sun earth he explained as he might to a dullwitted child immediately the scene shifted once more and he was peering at earths great blue globe with its swirls of frilly white cloud encircling it the alien loosed a low whistling word which rose at the end then with but a moments pause said earth spence realized he had just received his first lesson in martian he was mystified who are you how do you know my language he asked slowly i am kyr i have assimilated the word rolled out oddly your language skills while you were healing i hope this causes you no anxiety it is easier the creature as alien as anything spence could have imaginednot so much in appearance as in character and bearing stood conversing with him like a native it passed all comprehension you saved me why life is precious and must be conserved you had nearly ceased to be thank you i am grateful he hoped the alien understood him well enough for he meant it sincerely are there more like you the martian reflected for a moment and something like a smile flitted across the thin lips yes many seedings by now the creaturefor some reason spence considered it a male creatureallowed that this was not what spence wanted to know but that is not what you asked you wished to know if there are more of my kind here now no not for many earth years i am the only one i am the last why where are they where did they go there were so many questions he wanted to ask they gushed like a fountain into his mind he could not ask them all at once the alien handed him the picture generator and spence saw a bright array of stars slanting across the center of the field it could have been the further rim of the spiraling milky way galaxy to other stars yes the martian nodded why ovs could no longer support her people our atmosphere shrank the waters dried up to survive we built the underground cities and then when we became skilled enough to venture to nearby stars we left in search of other worlds migrated to the stars but why what caused your atmosphere to change kyr indicated the picture device and spence saw once more the solar system he had seen before but on a closer inspection he saw that it contained ten planets orbiting the sun in orderly fashion rather than the nine he knew our neighbor res was struck by a large mass that passed close by earth and ovs causing disturbances in the atmosphere and rotation of the planets debris rained down and clouds of dust from the explosion covered both planets for many earth years ovs suffered more serious damage where was this res here a long multijointed finger pointed to the fifth planet from the sun the asteroid belt said spence with some excitement weve long theorized a planet there we were struck by many of the pieces so was earth your planet has been struck many times in the past but luckily was not much populated during these events each time it has been recreated here it wasno human word seemed adequate catastrophe very much life was destroyedplants animals whole cities died ovs could not recover spences mind reeled this little bit of information could answer so many questions about the great upheavals and cataclysms in earths past he wondered what else the martian could tell him and what of martian lifephilosophy art and literature did they have these things did they know of their origin what kind of spaceships did they travel in what secrets had they possessed while men still roamed the earth in nomadic tribes there was so much to learn spence fell silent speechless the possibilities were awesome and he was hopelessly inadequate to the task you must sleep now kyr said we will talk again i would hear how you came here and how you knew to rebirth me without protest though his brain was reeling with excitement spence lay back in the oval nest and the alien lowered the energy net over him once more he slept at once blissfully and soundly what place is this spence stood on a sort of sky way overlooking a spreading underground metropolis undulating in graceful asymmetryhives hollows arches pinnacles and spikesstretching out as far as the eye could see under a great glimmering golden dome tso it is the largest of the underground cities built in the third epoch on ovs there have been four epochs vjarta kryn ovsen and soa in your words the water epoch dust epoch stone epoch and star epoch the underground city held an eerie beauty for spence though seeing it now reminded him of nothing so much as bones as if he were gazing into the fabled elephant graveyard in the last few daysspence called them days kyr had guided him through the ancient city and had instructed him in the culture of the vanished race each new bit of information struck him with the force of a mind explosion each new fact was a revelation spence had learned a great deal enough to know that to learn the rest would take a lifetimeah but what a lifetime he turned to his tall friend that had been one of the first things he had learned the docile peaceloving kindly beings were friends not enemies of man brothers under the sun he gazed at the form of the being beside him and felt a sadness for him why did you stay behind why didnt you go with your people kyr fixed him with an indecipherable look i am a guardian it is my life to preserve the memory of our kind in the solar system so that any who comeas you have comewill know and remember i was chosen among others to guard the secrets of our past lest anyone come after us and use our discoveries unwisely you see there was much we could not take with us and to destroy it would have been unthinkable the guardians were chosen to keep watch over all that was now i only am left sadness accompanied this last admission spence felt it and turned the conversation when did your people leave how long ago kyr pondered this for a moment several lifetimes he replied at last three or four thousand of your years maybe more i cannot be sure until i have visited the he paused and chirped a word that sounded to spence like krassil and then continued that i must do soon i must make certain no one has entered there then lets go id like to see it spence feeling remarkably fit thanks to kyrs healing care was eager to see all he could of martian wonders the krassil turned out to be part museum and part time capsule it was a huge coneshaped hive in the center of a cluster of smaller hives and it had been sealed long ages past against this very day kyr walked several times around the enormous structure while spence sat on one of the mushroomshaped objects which abounded throughout tso after his tour kyr stepped aside and tilted back his head loosing a long whining note that split the air like a knife spence clamped his hands over his ears and watched kyr waited for a few moments and then repeated the procedure this time in a slightly lower register the vibration of the martians voice shook the very ground beneath their feet spence realized then how powerful the beings were he watched as a sizable crack opened in the smooth shelllike surface of the hive kyr went to the crack and began pulling away chunks of material which concealed a door he stood before the door and in his whistling tongue chirped a few words to it the door magically slid aside a voiceimprinted lock thought spence such things were in experimental use on gotham now the martians then were not as far advanced technologically as he had first thought spence entertained this notion for a few seconds before remembering that he was seeing the state of their science four thousand years ago technology on mars had frozen the day they left he chided himself for the vanity that lay behind his mistaken observation and for presuming to compare two such different civilizations then kyr reemerged from the krassil and beckoned to him to follow spence entered through the oblong doorway and stepped into the interior of the krassil crammed to the ceiling with singular objects all looking as if they had been placed there only moments before and their owners would return to take them up again at any time there were things impossible to describemany of them looked like they had been grown according to some freakish horticultural method rather than manufactured most of the martian artifacts he saw possessed this natural rather organic quality this had caused spence to do some wild theorizing on the origins of the martian civilization man had belonged to the mammalian order on earth but it did not necessarily follow that that should be the regular course of things at all the martians might very well be part of the botanical branch of the martian life tree or the reptilianhe was not sure which they resembled the more maybe they came from some otherworldly synthesis of both while kyr busied himself with what appeared to be an inventory of sorts spence wandered among the strange assemblage of objectsobjects at once bizarre and eerily fascinating whose uses could only be supposed by the most astounding leaps of imaginative fancy his curious eyes devoured all he looked upon greedily like a man whose sight has just been restored after a long period of blindness he came after some time to a further part of the krassil where an arched opening led into a small alcove inside set on a rough base of stone stood a large graceful object which immediately captured his attention it looked like delicate interwoven semitransparent wings he stepped into the alcove and the sculptureif that is what it wasinstantly lit with a rosy light and began to slowly move spence watched as other colors gradually came into play along the sculptures transparent surface yellow blue and green these tones began to melt into each other in complex patterns as they swirled over the sculptures elegant form until the form itself and the color became one the hues mingled and blended forming more subtle shades now flashing boldly now subdued he was riveted to his place drinking in the astonishing beauty of the art piece he could not take his eyes from it the thing held him with a hypnotic power as it spun and resolved itself into endlessly intricate patterns of light and color each more graceful and lovely than the last he felt a welling up inside him of emotion a yearning so strong that it resembled a hungering paina pain that bordered on bliss it was a feeling he recognized as belonging to the apprehension of beauty but one he had rarely if ever felt presumably others were so moved when they looked upon a classic work of art or listened to a beloved symphony he had seldom had such experiences the feeling was foreign to him and perhaps therefore more powerful and bewildering he could not look away the light sculpture reached out to him binding him fast with threads of wonder he felt nearly faint with rapture this thought spence was what the poets felt the love that burns its victims in flames of ecstasy oh to be so consumedit was past enduring yet he longed to endure still more that he could be so affected by the sight of any created object he would have denied but that obstinacy melted away in the certainty that he was experiencing a work of consummate beauty tears formed in his eyes and his heart swelled nearly to bursting as the dry rivers of his soul began to flow with streams of joy the passions he felt unlocked within him could not be contained he wanted to leap to dance to weep and shout and exhaust himself in singing shudders of pleasure coursed through him he heard a strange music ringing in his ears and realized that it was his own voice giving free vent to his pleasure in spontaneous song the sculpture as if sensing his joyous outpouring moved more swiftly in response the brilliant shades spun and changed weaving themselves together and parting in intricacies beyond reckoning it seemed to live growing larger and more luminous throwing off flashes of light and filling his tearfilled eyes with shapes too wonderful to behold at last he could take no more he closed his eyes but still felt the shifting colors of light playing over him a voice nearby said this is soa lokiri spence turned to see kyr standing beside him he had not been aware of the martians presence it is beautiful he returned his gaze to the shimmering display at length he said what is soa lokiri it means starmaker it is an artwork in homage to dal elna made by the hand of one of our most revered artists bharat starmaker spence repeated the name nodding to himself it is aptly titled but who is dal elna kyr tilted his head sideways looking at spence closely dal elna the allbeing allbeing you mean god kyrs head began weaving from side to side that word does not communicate to me a pang of guilt squirmed inside spence possibly the word held no meaning for kyr because it held no particular meaning for him whatever means kyr had used to as he said assimilate spences language he had only received spences vocabulary and only the meanings spence himself attached to the various words at his command god for spence was an empty word it did not communicate the word god i think is what men call the allbeing kyr merely looked at him i have never been so moved by anything in my life bharat is a most extraordinary artist are there more of his works here no this was as many considered his greatest it alone survived the burning thats tragic i would like to have seen more he looked back at the sculpture he now imagined he could see the hot points of stars forming in starfields worlds bursting into creation and more there was a pattern to ita greater pattern than could be taken in all at once i feel as if i were always on the verge of apprehending it and yet not at all spence said that is the greatness of the work bharat has mirrored dal elnas mystery and given visual expression to the greatest single truth of our philosophers rhi sill dal kedu kree it means in the many there is one spence repeated the words with a slow shaking of his head youll have to explain that to me i dont get it at all many hundreds of lifetimes ago our philosophers reduced their theories to this one axiom it cannot be expressed more simply but i will think about it and find a way to explain it to you they left the alcove and the kinetic sculpture silently spence went on tiptoes like a priest leaving the holy of holies he was conscious of a sharp longing almost a loneliness as if he had left the presence of the deity himself he felt cut off he turned to view the sculpture a last time but the alcove was dark and the slender object still he wondered if he had imagined the patterns and color the ache in his heart told him that he had encountered a masterpiece and that as an onlooker at a miracle he too had been inwardly changed caroline zanderson called for a pen and paper something she had not done in the eleven years she had been at holyoke haven the request caused a sudden rush of the asylums staff as they tripped over one another to fulfill it mrs zanderson wife of the director of gm advancement center was a most perplexing case of all the patients she seemed the most normal and the most severely disturbed depending on the time one happened to see her she was often remarkably lucid and calm calling everyone by name and glowing with a genuine vibrant charm but her good days were separated by periods of extreme anguish and depression her highs were balanced by the lowest lows when her madness came upon her the charming sophisticate became a hunkering crone her personality disintegrated she neither knew who she was nor where she was she became fixated on the strange force she believed to be torturing her possessing her stealing her sanity that is why when she called for a pen and paper the staff fell over themselves in their haste to provide it the act signaled a beginning perhaps to one of her good periods and there had been few of those in the last year is that you belinda mrs zanderson heard a slight commotion at her door and turned toward it peering around her faded red chair at the door a whiteuniformed nurse was speaking to another patient a woman in a light blue flowered dress who strained ahead eagerly clutching a worn cloth suitcase the ship has not come today mrs mawser the nurse intoned gently the woman turned a suddenly stricken face to the nurse her eyes wild and fearful i havent missed it oh ohhh no no the nurse soothed placing her hand on the womans back you havent missed it we wont let you miss the ship when it comes now you go back to your room and unpack its almost time for lunch the woman shuffled away with the suitcase muttering as she went the nurse watched her go and then stepped lightly into the room caroline ive brought your paper and penand an envelope too an envelope the blue eyes were pools of lead in her face youll need an envelope if you are going to write a letter remember oh yes ill need an envelope may i have the paper and pen now please she took them and moved to the tiny antique writing desk that stood by the french doors without another word to the nurse she began after several strained attempts she wrote my dearest ari dont be alarmed at receiving a letter from your mother i have long wanted to write to you and thank you for all the wonderful letters and gifts you send but i have not been up to it for a very long time i do think of you often of coursewhen i am myself that is i am writing now to tell you something very important please listen to me and do as i ask you are in great danger my dear one the greatest possible danger the dream thief has turned his eyes on you and he wants you even now his hands are stretching after you be careful please be careful you must take steps to protect yourself come to me and i will tell you what to do i dare not put it in a letterhis eyes are everywhere but come soon my darling please before it is too late always my love mother when she had finished the letter she read it through several times and then folded it neatly and placed it in the envelope and addressed it she then called for the nurse again good belinda youre here take this letter and make sure it is trailed properly mail it yourself please its important of course i will caroline i would be happy to oh i see its to your daughter im sure ari will enjoy hearing from you its bee a long time since she has been here hasnt it ill mail the letter today right after lunch would you like to come down and eat now were having a nice chicken salad they say its very good i think i will have some tea in my room caroline said slumping back into her overstuffed chair facing the doors im a little tired right now maybe ill come down later the letter drained her as if the amount of concentration necessary to complete it had depleted an already scant reserve she closed her eyes and rested her head on the white crocheted doily of the chair her muscles went slack and she fell asleep at once thats right said the nurse she crossed the room and closed the doors you take a little nap and ill look in on you later she crept out of the room placing the letter on the top of a large bureau near the door spence sipped the broth a warm brown liquid that tasted of cinnamon he did not mind the thin soupundoubtedly it was very nourishingbut it did not fill him up as he would have liked he was hungry all the time kyr had explained that it would be some time before food could be grown and produced but that in time they would have something more substantial to eat that had brought up the subject of his leaving i should return to the surface soon remarked spence in a tone he hoped was casual kyr only peered at him intently and so spence launched into a full account of how he came to be there including the fact that he had friends waiting for him worrying about him back at the installation he did not know how long he had been underground but he reckoned it to be nearing the time when the work party would begin preparing to return to the transport for the journey back to gotham i understand but there is much i would show you still i will come back as soon as i can ill stay years if you like believe me i want to learn everything you can teach me and there are othershundreds of othersjust like me who will come kyr had not received this in the way spence intended he seemed to become restive and after a session of head waving sat back stoically with slender hands in his lap after he had finished sipping his ration of broth spence asked have i said something wrong tell me if i have not understood you at that the martian picked up his bowl of broth and drained it and stood hoisting spence to his feet with a strength that astounded him i must be patient you do not know what you are saying because you do not yet understand come i will show you kyr strode off on his long legs at a groundeating stride spence had to jog along behind just to keep up when they reached the krassil spence was wheezing and puffing and dizzy from the exertion in the oxygenweak atmosphere kyr entered the krassil and spence followed with a hand pressed to his side doubled over as if with a stomach ache sit down here instructed kyr and spence saw a semicircle of indented hollows shaped into a low bank before a flat portion of the curved wall of the hive he sat down in one of the hollows and waited almost at once the interior of the hive darkened and a sound eerily sweet like violins with the voices of birds or the songs of whales filled the chamber rising and falling in regular rhythm like breathing it was as spence had come to understand martian music and like their architecture and everything else of martian design it was freeflowing and organic in a moment the portion of the wall directly before him dissolved becoming transparent and he was gazing out a huge window into a lush tropical landscape beyond a soft breeze stirred the leaves of extremely tall spindly shrubs while a flock of storklike crimson birds flew overhead in a sky of shining blue low mountains glimmered in the distance and raised rounded peaks skyward everything he saw was tinged with a golden aura the light itself shimmered with a golden hue enriching all it touched then he saw a herd of longlegged grazing animals with giraffelike necks and small round heads moving as one across a vast open plain behind them carrying slender poles he saw martians tall and lithe and bronze in the sun running with the herd the amazingly lifelike images on the screen pulled spence immediately into the drama of this scene he realized that he had embarked upon a journey back through the ages of an alien planet and its vanished life the holoscreen spun out its stream of magic images in a sweeping pageant of color and beauty he could never have imagined he saw the formation of the first cities and the panorama of a civilization blossoming unhindered in a world of peace and harmony the cities grew and water vessels traversed the globe plying the great waterways the martian canals and linking the gleaming white cities in commerce later airships filled the sky and great colorful objects that looked like giant kites or winged dirigibles elegantly plowed the air next came a parade of the most fantastic creatures he had ever seen all strangely familiar bearing at least the rudimentary resemblance to the animal life on earth but unique and wholly different at the same time birds and fishes and mammals of an endless variety appeared in their natural habitats as the music swelled and sang and the procession continued spence saw the martians themselves in their cities and in their homesengaged in various inexplicable occupations which he guessed to be working playing and learning these were not separated or isolated tasks but apparently went on simultaneously children and adults together all the time he felt a tug of longing and a sharp regret that he had not known this mars though he knew he must be seeing it exactly as it had been millions of years ago then the sky darkened and the ground shook with violent explosions fire swept the planet as huge flaming meteorites rained down gradually the vegetation browned withered and blew away the broken cities crumbled to dust and the oncelush landscape was transformed to desert the great circling bands of water shrank away and dried leaving huge canyons and flat lake pans of cracked baked mud the birds and animals disappeared the scene shifted and he saw the excavations of the tunnels and the vast underground chambers which would house the cities he saw a job of construction on a scale he could not conceive he witnessed the rebirth of life beneath the surface of the planet and saw these cities flourish after their own fashion still he could not forget the stirring beauty of the planet that had been it haunted the soul with a felt presence at last he saw the gleaming starships rise like silver orbs from the dead flatlands of the red planet by the thousands they floated up like bubbles hung in momentary farewell and then streaked off into the black sky above and so they were gone the music a soft sight of mourning drifted away and spence sat staring at a blank wall once more he did not move or speak for a long time he let the memory of all he had seen wash over him and carry him in its flood how long had he been sitting there he wondered a few hours it seemed a lifetime spence heard a soft snuffling sound nearby and turned to see kyr kneeling on the floor behind him with his face raised upwards his eyes closed and damp trails of tears streaking his angular cheeks spence wanted to weep too he felt a sense of grief at the loss of what had been yet he had never known it i weep for the dead said kyr at last and for those who never saw our world as it was in its beauty did you see it i mean in the good time did you the martian shook his head no my fathers father may have lived through the time of the fire but most likely it was his father before him many great dynasties were wiped out the fire rain lasted for many earth years kyr how old are you the martian thought and said your question does not have a ready answer since we measure our lives differently than you but i think you would say two thousand earth years counting the sleep no only counting the time i have been alive you see a martian may live ten thousand of your years or longer perhaps you dont grow old and die i dont know what you mean we grow yes we develop all our lives not physicallythat takes only a little time several of your earth years but mentally and spiritually we grow always our vi grows with us vi i have not heard you speak of that before vi is our he paused searching spences vocabulary for the proper word our true selves our souls no one on ovs ever dies spences voice rose incredulously even granting the fact that the lower gravity on mars might have the effect of radically increasing the life span of its inhabitants in the same way it increased their stature spence could not believe they did not know death death no we can be killeddisease accidentthe burning killed entire cities or we may simply cease to be those who have grown great in wisdom may decide it is time to take up their viand join dal elna it is a choice everyone must eventually make then what happens i do not know i have not undergone the change but a wise one may call his friends around him to celebrate his decision and he then imparts all he has learned in his life to those he loves in a little while no one will see him anymore he becomes one with the dust and goes to be with dal elna the allbeing spence glared at the alien in disbelief then why didnt you join dal elna when you ceased to be when did i ever cease to be when you were in the growingmachine the emra yes that box of yours where i found you the martian made his laughing sound i had not ceased to be i was no word came sleeping no it is not the same thing dormant the creature waved his head and contemplated the meaning of the word yes dormant but i looked in there and saw nothing but dust and dry fibers the material of my body can be reborn many times spence could not fathom such a possibility but then reflected that there were plants on earth desert plants that possessed the same abilities several lower life forms also carried the seed of life with them even though they remained paperdry and dormant for years between cycles what happens to you while you are dormant i do not understand your question i exist but i do not exist in the same way as before i am not conscious but what keeps you from dying and why do you wake up knowing who you are if you are recreated why do you remember your past life kyr spread his hands wide in a gesture of great humility he said the questions you ask are questions for dal elna himself are all earthmen as inquisitive as you spence admitted that there were many things he had trouble accepting and that the allbeings role in creation was one of them so i have come to believe but i will find a way to help you see you have already shown me much he gestured toward the blank screen where only moments before the splendor of a glorious past had unfolded before his eyes i understand now why tso must remain a secret the sudden explosion of interest would destroy it one day when your world has regained the peace that it lost long ago tso will be revealed until then it is better that such secrets remain hidden and you trust me with this secret spence experienced a fleeting doubt that perhaps the martian had no intention of allowing him to return to tell the tale yes kyr reached out a long hand to him spence took it i must trust you for how can it be otherwise i cannot prevent you dal elna himself will hold or give as he sees fit kyr how much do you know of earth and its people have you ever been there no but others have in the days before the starships your planet was visited many times but when we discovered it inhabited by sentient beings not unlike ourselves we knew that we could not look for a home there no one ever went back after that it was forbidden forbidden why i would have thought friendly contact with a higher intelligence could have been very beneficial to primitive earth societies there were those among us who took that view but in the end the leader of the earth expeditions argued very persuasively against going back his name was ortu and he was one of the great leaders of his day it was his view that the primitive earthmen should be allowed to develop in their own time dal elna he said had not meant for us to interfere with others of his creations so no one ever went back never even the watcher ships were withdrawn ortu said that was necessary if we were ever to keep peace here on ovs otherwise the temptation to step in and save earthmen in times of distress would be too great they had to survive on their own if they were to become strong and then the migration began exactly with res destroyed we knew there to be no other inhabitable planets in this solar system the stars offered our only hope again ortu led the development of the starships and even led the first wave to leave ovs spence nodded slowly and now i too must think about leaving ovs kyr turned and led them out of the bout to show you before we talk of leaving come there is much to see ding spence followed his lanky host through the silent vacant pathways of tso and tried to imagine what it had been likeant the tall graceful martians had lived there and the narrow trafficways rang with the chirrup of their voices and the floating sounds of their eerily beautiful music he was immediately ov come with a heavy sense of loss and loneliness as if someone h loved very much had died the last three days had been a blur of activity to spence he felt as if he were a sponge that had absorbed ten times its weight he had seen and experienced so much of ancient martian culture now he and kyr stood looking at a large model of the red planet which had the area of the underground cities marked on its surface he frowned as he looked at the terrain i dont see anything i recognize the model of course had been made before the martians left it was several thousand years old the surface features have changed a lot they walked around the perimeter of the sculptured replica wait a minute said spence where is that great volcano kyr thought for a moment about what the word meant and then pointed a long finger to an area between two dry canal beds at the time of the burning several small volcanoes erupted in this area it is not far from tso could it have been active since then i mean really active it is possible yes then i think that is what we call olympus mons that is the mountain i was walking toward when i got lost he studied the model carefully noting the huge canyon directly to the west of the giant mariner valley a hole so big it could have swallowed the entire rocky mountain range and still have room for the grand canyon according to the model the outskirts of tso lay near one of the tributary troughs which fed into this canyon system i think this is where i came upon the tunnels right here since i didnt tumble into the canyon the installation must lie somewhere in this area he pointed to the smooth plain eastward kali said kyr what is that it is a smaller underground settlement which housed the workers building the starships it is not shown here the plain is where the starships were built and from there they left ovs forever spence had the picture in his mind of hundreds of shiping like silver balloons into the pink sky of mars to disappear like fragile bubbles into the void then this is where the last of the martians left and the first of the earthmen came because i miss my guess this is where the installation is kali is connected by tunnels with tso as are the cities i will take you there other spence had been feeling a greater and greater reluctance to leave tso and its lone inhabitant he wanted nothing more than to stay and learn all the secrets of the vanished race i wish i didnt have to go he said i would give everything i own just to stay here with you then you must return one day when you can stay i will come back i promise you that there are treasures here worth more than anyone on earth can imagine he meant the remark as a compliment but it seemed to have the opposite effect on kyr the alien began waving his head from side to side did i say something wrong your words remind me that i will be alone he turned away before finishing the thought what will you do when i leave go back to sleep no i will not sleep again contact has been made between our planets i must now begin the vigilance spence realized the sacrifice kyr had made to remain behind i will come back kyr he vowed somehow i will kyr looked at him closely and said no creature knows his destiny even rivers change their courses in time i will not hold you to your promise it is not yours to make the martian turned and placed his hand on a smooth globeshaped object and it opened revealing two small disks kyr handed one of them to spence who took it and turned it over in his hand it was a rather flat roundish thing which looked like nothing more than a seashell which had lost its grooves and fluted edges it had a warm feeling in his hand do you feel the power in it i feel a warmth from it what is it this is a he searched for the worda bneri a signal device i am a guardian now that you have awakened me i must guard you too if ever you have need of me you have only to hold this in the palm of your hand think about me and i will know of your need i will come to help you this mystified spence more than anything he had seen on mars since he arrived how is it possible i could explain the the science of the device to you but it would take time as for the othertraveling to earth is no problem the vehicles of the old explorers are preserved here i can travel anywhere i wish to go but why would you want to protect me he still could not believe it because you know the secret of ovs and of its cities and because you are my friend and the first to have joined our civilizations in time that will be an important thing to both of our worlds spence did not know what to say thank you kyr i will take this and use it if ever i have such need now we will eat together once more before you go i will prepare for you a real meal yes he replied to spences surprised look the first of the rhi has been grown we will eat our first real ovsin meal together but not our last said spence not our last the gleaming domes of the installation shimmered in the hard bright light of the sun overhead a rosy pink tinge crept into the sky the dull red dust lay powdery and still not a whisper of a breeze stirred so much as a particle anywhere nothing moved around the installation and for a moment he feared the workandresearch party had gone back to gotham the air on the surface had less oxygen than tso and spence felt himself growing lightheaded and decided to sit down and rest before continuing on toward the base only a kilometer further kyr had left him slightly less than three kilometers away spence had not wanted kyr to come too close lest they be seen and the secret exposed so after a sad parting he had begun walking alone he wished he had his helmet at once he had set off at too quick a pace and almost fainted after a brief rest he adjusted his stride accordingly and drew near the cluster of buildings in agonizing slow motion now he was almost there and he wondered why he saw no signs of activityrecent or otherwiseanywhere around the installation he climbed back to his feet and struck off again feeling tired for his short walk and very apprehensive as he came nearer he noticed a red plume of dust rising high into the air on the far side of the base it looked like a dust geyser or red smoke drifting on the wind but there was no breeze in a moment the plume had come near the cluster of domes and stopped there spence guessed a vehicle of some sort had driven up soon he saw a tiny figure moving among the buildings it disappeared inside someone is home thought spence he was not alone after all he turned and peered back behind him as if he would see kyr watching him urging him to go ahead and rejoin his own he saw nothing but the dull red rockstrewn pan of the desert in another hour he was stepping into the shadow of the first long greenhouse he had returned adjani had finished the days search and returned to the installation dejected and disappointed the high hopes with which he began the day evaporated like dew in the heat of the sun he had showeredone of the few genuine luxuries on marsand settled down to eat after a quick scan of the daily log the wafer screen showed no messages from packer and company since he had been gone he munched a handful of the tiny pelletlike nutribiscuits that they all ate and washed it down with cold fresh water he was thinking about tomorrows search the last he would be able to make before leaving mars in ten or twelve hours packer and the rest of the crew would be back and then they would secure the installation and make ready to leave there was one more pass he wanted to make along the rift valley to the west if he found nothing as he now feared he would allow that packer was right and that nothing would ever be found this was his thought when he heard the whoosh of the outer air lock he turned expecting to see packer and a dozen of his cadets standing in the lock instead he saw a lone figure without a helmet standing in the shadow at the far end of the glassedin chamber adjani moved quickly his senses pricked like a cats on the hunt a rush of excitement stirred him as he recognized the figure even before his mind could attach the name spence he gasped as the lock opened and his friend stepped unsteadily into the room adjani it was you spence was assailed by a strong out pouring of emotion he fell on his friends neck and hot tears of relief spattered the green of his jumpsuit in dark splotches adjani too cried and laughed and shouted for joy spence youre alive alive i knew itin my heart i knew it thank god youve come back the lithe indian fairly danced in circles around him spence threw off his gloves and wiped at his eyes with the heels of his hands looking boyish and embarrassed you missed me huh adjani threw his head back and laughed as if that were the funniest thing he had ever heard missed you no not at all i cant believe it youre alive he laughed again where is everybody i expected a bit more of a welcome than this they have all gone to the north polerather they should be on their way back from there now we are leaving tomorrow i thought we would have to leave you forever adjani fixed him with a firm look i know i have some explaining to do actually its better that its just you and me you can help me think through what to say to the others that has been on my mind since i found out i was coming back found out asked adjani with some surprise did you doubt it plenty said spence i never thought id see this place or any otherever again i was a dead man more times than i care to think about well come tell me everything are you hungry ill fix you something sit down restyou look like youve lost weight you look exhausted but you look better than ive ever seen you he paused standing over spence and grinning from ear to ear welcome back my friend welcome back to the land of the living dont believe it i dont believe it packer recited his litany once again he sat in the chair where he had collapsed upon entering the base and stared at spence as if he were seeing a ghost his mouth hung open and his eyes bulged slightly making him appear first cousin to a cod i just dont believe it you didnt think you had seen the end of me packer i paid for a roundtrip ticket i cant believe it spence gave adjani a conspiratorial smile thats packer always the keen conversationalist packer then leaped up and proceeded to give spences back such a pounding that spence wished he had stayed quite out of range of the burly giant reston you old fox how did you do it tell me that how did you ever do it look not a nip of frostbite on hint how did you do it spence then proceeded to give packer a version of the story he and adjani had carefully constructed between them he said that he had stumbled into a warmair shaft which kept him from freezing to death and also allowed him to distill a small amount of water vaporenough to keep him from dehydrationby using his helmet he told how he had walked every day to try and find his way back the trail having been obliterated by the storm he could only walk as far as he could return in the same day that way he could be back in his warm air vent by nightfall each day he had gone out a different way and on the last day had been fortunate enough to have been spotted by adjani and picked up adjani why didnt you radio us when you found him i started to but you were already on your way back we decided to let it be a surprise surprise well ill say it is spence i sure am glad to see you i thought youd bought your ticket that first night i was sure of it and then the storm and everything i dont believe it i never thought id see this place again either i had almost given up hope of finding it packer grew serious his eyes still twinkling regarded spence sharply what made you do it spence what made you run out into that sandblaster out there i cant figure it spence lowered his voice there were others gathered around that he did not wish to involve in his private affairs i think youre entitled to a full reading on that score packer i think id like to wait until we can sit down and talk it over i understand no pressurejust curious adjani tells me im back in time to help close up yes indeed you made it back just in time were leaving as soon as we can seal up this compound shouldnt take but a few hours you are fit to travel arent you you look like youve lost twenty pounds im fit enough ill have nothing to do but rest once were aboard thats another thing i have to radio back to gotham and let them know we found you im afraid i gave up on you spencer i told comcen you were missing presumed dead thats one mistake ill gladly correct pronto no i mean couldnt we let it wait for a few days packers eyes narrowed theres some trouble isnt there im dense but not that dense you want to tell me about it adjani spoke up again that would be better discussed in private between friends all right packer shrugged ill hold off sending the report but you two are going to have some explaining to do as soon as were under way he smiled his features relaxing into their normal benign smirk i dont care if youve nipped the crown jewels im just glad youre back olmstead packer turned to those gathered around and yelled lets get this show on the road i want everything stashed stowed and shipshape in three hours kalnikov is bringing the transport into alignment now personally i dont want to spend another night in this chicken coop lets go the cadets let out a whoop and the place swung into a ferment of activity adjani settled himself at a nearby computer terminal and reactivated the drone program which ran the installation in the absence of human caretakers spence went back to his bunk in the team leaders quarters and picked up his stillpacked frame from the bed he had never slept in it seemed like ages ago that he had wandered halfcrazed out into the cruel simoom and everything that had happened after that seemed like a dream but now as he stood looking belongings he was once more acutely aware that he was still vulnerable e to the mysterious blackouts and still no closer to solving the enigma of their causehis flight had been futile from that respect his sanity dangled by an alltooslender thread he did not know how much more he could take before that tenuous thread snapped ari sat up in bed with a start the dull ache that had driven her after weeks of dogged endurance at last to bed had finally disappeared the churning emptiness had gong and she felt almost herself once more the awful news about spence had been a shattering blow for days she had done nothing but sit in her room while the cruel words presumed dead tore at her heart she cried until tears refused to come and then entered a state of benumbed indifference to life her father at wits end summoned doctors who advised sedatives which she would not take but this morning she told herself that her vigil of grief was over that she would face the day with resolve and put her life back together the effect was like a cool wind rising in the night to blow away a long sultry hot spell this weather change in her brought with it renewed hope that somehow some way her life would resume even flourish it was this change so fresh so startling in its suddenness that brought her awake out of a leaden sleep and she had a feeling of waking to unfinished businessknowledge which seemed to dance just out of memory like a butterfly it flitted close but when she tried to capture it to hold it and remember it darted away again ari hummed with the feeling that she knew something very important though she could not remember what it was the feeling hounded her all day she rose and went about the morning routine with a lightness and cheer that would have delighted any who had seen her she filled her small room with a sunny radiance that splashed against the walls and chased the shadowsas if a window had been opened on a new spring morning full of golden sunlight and glowing promise she wondered what the change could mean an answer to prayer thankfully she accepted it as such and launched into her day relieved refreshed and revived daughter you look absolutely reborn her father shouted when she met him for breakfast the director always took breakfast in his own dining room while he skimmed the news of the world which comcen gathered from various satellite news services and patched together for him in a special viddisc edition of the gotham times i feel much better today daddy you look marvelous my dear simply wonderful oh i cant tell you how good it is to see you like this i was beginning to think that well never mind breakfast im starved i daresay you havent eaten a mouthful in two weeks not that it has hurt me any she laughed and her father watched the light sparkle in her deep blue eyes once more nonsense my dear youre but a whisper of a girl already he reached for her hand and kissed it gallantly i am glad you have come back ari i was deeply afraid id lose you she smiled and clasped his hand in both of hers i wont ever leave you daddy not like that both of them knew what lay behind the veiled reference mrs zanderson his wife her mother it was simply too painful a subject to be spoken about in open terms they had invented a code language to help them speak about it without stirring up old unwanted memories so sit down ill ring you up some breakfast what will it be ill have some of whatever youre having please and the sooner the better orange juice gallons she settled into her chair next to her fathers and some of those scrumptious croissantsif there are any left director zanderson rang the silver bell at his elbow and a pink jumpsuited kitchen attendant swished into the room with the crisp formal movements of a military conscript the director was the only person on gm to have his own serving staff and kitchen everyone else ate at the commissary he gave the man their breakfast order and sent him away oh and henry no croissants for me im meeting with the agdiv heads this morning he turned back to his daughter they say they have invented a new protein potato or some such thing and they want me to pass judgment on it ill probably have to eat my weight in potato steaks would you care to accompany me dearest i thought id go for a swim i havent been near the pool for ages i could use a little sun too quite right just the thing to put the roses back in you lovely cheeks but enjoy your new potato sounds promising oh im sure its fantastic its just that every other week or so they seem to come up with something bigger and better than the week before a bigger carrot better rabbitsi dont know what im afraid its getting harder and harder for me to work up enthusiasm like i used to and the smell down there would knock you over she smiled cheerily its the price of progress daddy just keep thinking maybe theyll come up with a way to make your nutristeak taste like real beef now thats something ill crow about by the wayhe paused his manner growing serious i meant to tell you before but what is it daddy the smile faded the gyrfalcon is due in sometime today or tomorrow i think thats what wermeyer told me yesterday i thought you should know so that if you heard it somewhere else it wouldnt come as a shock he patted her shoulder and gave her a kind fatherly look i hope i havent ruined your day im not going to let anything ruin my day yes the wound is still tender but i thank you for telling me dont worry ill be all right the servant brought in two large trays and set them before the diners ari true to her word tackled a cream cheese omelet with vigor her father drifted back to his perusal of the mornings news after seeing her father off to his office she went to her room and slipped on her bathing suit and made her way down to the garden level to walk in green solitude before going to the noisy kidridden pool the quiet pathways wending among the growing things and the clear unobstructed view of the garden sweeping before her in the distance to vanish around the curve of the station lifted her spirits once more to their previous level soon she was soaring again something is about to happen she told herself something good i know it hated lying to him like that i dont enjoy this at all i moaned half full cups of cold coffee f kalnikov acetoface making his galley final burn for home there was no other way you know that weve been over and over it why do you keep bringing it up im sorry adjani spence looked at his friends usually fresh untroubled face now he saw dark circles of fatigue under the black eyes and lines of concern pulling the edges of his mouth into a perpetual frown and im sorry for mixing you up in this i had no right i gave you the right when i asked you to be my friend dont ever question it spence never understand adjani lowered his voiceit seemed that they had talked in lowered voices the whole of the trip back i know what you think but you could not have held such a secret inside you for long it is too great for one man to bear you think packer is satisfied with the explanation i gave him he seemed skeptical leave packer to me ive known him for a long time ill talk to him again but dont you say any more stick by your story at least until we figure out what to do next will you promise me that much spence sighed and nodded slowly i promise i wont do anything rash or stupidat least not without asking you first but i didnt expect it to be this hard really i did you think you had returned from a sunday picnic your life has been changed you will never be the same spence you have seen things no man has ever seen and you know things now that can well change the world and you cant tell anyone spence stared dully ahead eyes unfocused remembering the long sessions he and adjani had put in during the fiveweek jour ney back to gotham now only a few hours more before docking they were rehearsing it all again he had told packer a story about his having a fight with adjani and how he had wanted only to get out of the installation for a few minutes to cool off he hadnt know adjani was hurt and hadnt meant to hurt him the storm blew up and he became disoriented and couldnt find his way back spence admitted to having violent spells of anger and frustration latelyprobably due to overwork and that something had touched him off adjani had had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time packer accepted this version of the events in much the same way he accepted spences version of his miraculous survival on the surface of an extremely hostile planethe nodded a good deal and puffed out his cheeks and rubbed his hand through his wiry thatch of coppercolored hair and at last said i see very interesting and that had been that packer had not questioned him further about either incident and that is why spence felt he had not been believedpacker had seen through the shabby lie and been too hurt to press the matter further he wanted to come clean and explain everything just the way it happened adjani counseled against this and was still of the same opinion wait and see youre right of course said spence at length its just that i ah i know i know you feel very alone right now dont worry im with you together well work this out spence wondered if adjani knew or guessed there was more to his story than tunnels and a lost city he had not told him about kyrpartly out of obligation to the martian and partly out of fear that he would not have been believed this too was eating at him he wondered if he should tell adjani about kyr now or wait for a better time he decided reluctantly to wait he looked glumly into the dark brown stain at the bottom of his cup as if peering into his future and not liking the color of what he saw you think im still in danger dont you he said at last yes i do i see no reason to think otherwise adjani leaned across the small table as soon as we get back im going to request data on the naga superstitions of northern india and run it through mira for a profile we may see something there that can help us all right what do i do in the meantime go on as if nothing had happened precisely nothing did you know all the while i was in tso i didnt dreami mean other than normal dreams and no blackouts either what do you make of that i dont know but it is another fact to be considered in our theory spence raised his eyes slowly im afraid adjani really afraid i dont want to go back there i feel as if hes waiting for methis dream thief of yoursand as soon as i set foot back in gotham im lost powerless far from it we will fight him spence and we will win how do you fight a dream god knows said adjani firmly and he will aid us the signal for return to weightlessness sounded and spence and adjani got up and replaced their cups in the covered bin for the remaining hours of the flight spence kept to himself for the most partthe only time he laughed was when a few of the cadets pooled their leftover water ration and created a floating swimming pool in one of the empty cargo holds then they all took turns diving through the hanging globule of water one of the favorite tricks was to immerse the body completely in the floating sphere withdrawing arms and legs carefully into the mass of water and then to swim inside it like fish in a bowl the effect was hilarious and brought gales of laughter whenever someone accomplished it spence along with nearly everyone else aboard stripped down to his undershorts and joined in the fun forgetting for a while his dark secrets the rest of the time he sat alone or lay in his safety webbing brooding on his problem it seemed to increase as they drew nearer the station he had succeeded in forgetting about it while on marsother things like bare survival helped him forget but now it all came back to him and the sense of hopelessness and dread ballooned as the transport streaked toward rendezvous surely even godif he existed which spence was not yet willing to admit despite what kyr and adjani believedeven their god could not help him now and if he did exist he would not have allowed him to get into such a mess in the first place that was how he thought about it case closed spence half expected the docking bay to be filled with wives and sweethearts and screaming children all waiting eagerly for their husbands and lovers to return from their voyage it surprised him to discover that aside from a few girlfriends of cadets and the docking crew the area was empty no cheering crowds no joyous welcomes the absolute routineness of their deboarding disappointed him but he knew that it was best if he was seen by as few people as possible on his return it was for that very reason he had donned a cadets uniform he also reminded himself that since he was supposed to be missing no one would be meeting him still as he disembarked and walked quickly through the milling cadets he found himself searching the faces for one in particular he hoped to see he hoped ari would be there though he felt foolish for even thinking it he also remembered with a shock that she most likely considered him dead what have i done to her what have i put her through he resolved to go to her at once and started off to find her but checked himself before running ten steps it would be dangerous to be seen too soon he would have to wait and arrange a meeting at a safe place feeling like a spy and not a particularly glamorous one he slunk away unobtrusively lugging his travel frame with him he regretted not thinking of a way to bind his flightmates to secrecy about his reappearance that if it could have been accomplished might have been a valuable card in his hand on further thought however it would have increased the interest in his case which would have spotlighted him the best course the one he was on was just to lay low and keep out of sight he at last reached his quarters after trying various means to determine whether anyone waited for him inside the lab he had pressed his ear against the panel and listened for a long time before punching the access plate the panel slid open at once there had been no entry code entered in his absence he went in the rooms dark and quiet seemed unusually so to spence no one waited for him the control booth was empty he guessed no one had been around for several weeks he had ignored adjanis protests to stay far away from the lab he wanted to see it to see if it was as he had left it he would not feel he had made it back until he saw his own room he would join adjani later he moved across the lab silently and went into his personal quarters to look around everything appeared exactly as he had left itthat is as far as he could remember that he left it yet the room looked strange and new everything was the same yet altered and different spence felt a telescoping of time upon entering like he had just left it but a few minutes before and now had returned to find it subtly changed all that happened since he lest stood in the room now belonged to a weird fantastic dream he awakened from the dream to find himself in his own room but a room he no longer knew it had not been a dream if he doubted its reality he had only to dip his hand into the inner breast pocket of his jumpsuit to pat the smooth shelllike object kyr gave him no it was no dream he slipped his travel frame under the bed without bothering to unpack and sat down in his chair to decide how best to reach ari he decided to leave a message for her to meet him in the garden near the fountain spence tapped the message into the comcen panel and signed it mary done of aris friends he hoped it would bring her without question then he lay on the bed and fell asleep he awoke in a better mood and shrugged off his clothes and stopped himself from putting them in the laundry chute instead he threw them under his bed and stepped into the sanibooth and just as quickly out to don a fresh blue and gold jumpsuit then he crept from his rooms into the main trafficway and hurried down to meet ari in the garden by the time he reached the garden level his heart was tripping along at an alarming rate he glanced guiltily around and then stepped off the pathway and into a shaded nook out of sight to wait for her he heard steps along the pathway and voices and peered from his seclusion to see two members of the secretarial section gaily flouncing along in full gossip he swallowed hard and noticed a lump in his throat he had not been so affected by meeting someone since fifth form when he asked beatrice mercer to the young astronauts annual dinner dance the absurd feeling that at any minute his onetime dancing partner would appear grew unbearable he shrank back further into the shadows he waited beads of perspiration formed on his forehead from the humidity and his hands grew clammy im falling to pieces im acting like a fourteenyearold on his first date he forced himself to take deep calming breaths and then felt woozy and mildly hyperventilated when he felt he could no longer stand the waiting he heard the crisp unmistakable footsteps of ari pattering along the pathway she had come he smelled the fresh scent of lemons a split second before he saw her and stepped from the bower it was to aris credit that she did not collapse in a dead faint on the spot her hands fluttered like frightened birds to her mouth her eyes grew round showing white all around her lovely jaw dropped open and a little pinched scream passed her lips eeee hello ari he had tried to think of something in some way appropriate for this meeting but that was the best he could come up with you how oh the next instant she was in his arms her trembling hands touching his face squeezing his flesh as if to make certain that it was solid alive he clung to her and filled his soul with her living breathing essence spence oh spence she said over and over he felt a wet spot on his neck and when he pulled her from him to look at her at arms length he saw the tears rolling down her cheeks forgive me he murmured drawing her to him once more there was no other way i had to shh dont talk dont say anything oh darling they said you wereoh youre not youre here im here i never thought id see you again she broke from him and expressions of pain anger and mingled joy crossed her face in complex patterns i never hoped never dreamed i cried for you how i cried for you for so long no word nothing she looked about to stomp off in anger at his thoughtlessness he groped for the words to tell her of his own sorrow at hurting her but there were no words he hung his head the next moment he felt her cool hand on his cheek and he raised his eyes to meet hers i never thought id see you again either he said iim sorry i love you ari pressed herself to him in a tight embrace i love you too spencer never leave me again we have to get away somewhere private where we can talk no one else on gotham knows ive returnedyet id like to keep it that way for a little while longer if i can come on i know a secret place here in the garden where we can be alone i discovered it when i first came here no one else seems to know about it she led him along his hand clamped tightly in her own to a place where one of the little artificial creeks bubbled out from a ferncovered bank she parted the ferns and jumped lightly across the water spence followed her and found himself in a cool green shade sweet with the smell of gardenias he looked around and saw bushes of the fragrant flowers luminous against their waxy dark green leaves ari pulled him down onto a soft bed of long grass for a moment all he heard was the burbling of the brook nearby and the rush of his own pulse in his ears then he was kissing her and nothing else in the world existed but the moment and the kiss when they parted ari looked at him drinking in his presence with dark blue eyes now sparkling with happy excitement now then she said drawing her knees to her chin and circling them in her arms tell me everything i want to hear it all it scarcely seems to matter anymore i dont care i want to hear it i need to hear it spence all right i wont leave out a single thing he said and then remembered that the most important part of his tale his ojourn in tso with the martian kyr the whole incredible miracle that was he could not tell her his heart sank at once ari must have seen what transpired mirrored in his features whats the matter love there is something i cant tell you right now she did not make it easier for him oh she said and looked hurt and disappointed at least not yet i understand she did not understand at all i promise youll know soon i dont want there to be any secrets between us ever for now though this is how it must be of course ari brightened at once you know best spence tell me all you can then i wont press you for details its just that youve been away so long i want to know what you were doing every minute since i saw you last spence took a deep breath and began relating to her all that had happened since he left starting with the journey and eventual landing on mars then on to that first night and the blackout that had sent him wandering lost on the surface with the stoma rising around him he told of the exhaustion of nearly freezing to death of his plunge into the rift valley and his discovery o f the crevice and tunnel then he stopped uncertain what to say next theres something in that tunnel you dont want me to know about he nodded thats right i shouldnt say any more right now ari stared upward into the leafy canopy overhead a ray of sunlight slanting through the branches caught her hair and set it ablaze with golden fire all right she said softly even though im dying with curiosity i wont make you it doesnt matter all that matters is that youre here with me and safe in the shelter of the hidden nook the two lovers held each other and talked in low intimate tones pledging themselves to one another again and again until the closing sunshields cast the garden into a semblance of twilight wed better go said spence drawing ari to her feet he held her close and kissed her once more thats until i see you again when will i see you again tomorrow i hope here well meet here at the same time as today if i need to get in touch with you before then mary d will leave a message youre not going back to the lab no ill be staying with adjani you two are the only ones i can trust right now you make it sound very dangerous well i think its best to assume so until we can figure out this whole thing my keeping out of sight for a while longer might be just the break we need ill do whatever you want me to you know that i know he drew her to him and kissed her lightly thats goodbye until tomorrow tomorrow she slowly turned away and parted the ferns closing the entrance to the shady alcove sleep well my love dont let the dream thief get you for a moment the words did not register then they began to burn themselves into his brain like a laserknife through soft butter an icy tingle crept up his scalp what did you say his voice had become a rasping whisper ari froze in place what is it spencer whats wrong what did you say just then say it again i said dont let the dream thief get you where did you hear that he stepped close to her and pulled her back into the deepening shadows i dont know weve always said it its her eyes shifted away its what tell me he gripped her arm tightly spence whats wrong youre scaring me its what spence persisted he lowered his voice and forced a calmer tone letting go of her arm tell me its important its just something my mother used to say thats all i must have heard it from her why what does it mean she gazed at him with troubled eyes her brow wrinkled in concern iim not sure he said at length avoiding her eyes it just seemed important somehow i dont know his tone softened and he smiled to reassure her im sorry if i frightened you it surprised me thats all ari nodded uncertainly the cloud still hung over her features all right if youre sure spence i dont think about it anymore im all right just let me think it over ill tell you if i come up with anything tomorrow good night spence she waved and was gone spence heard her footsteps recede along the pathway outside and then stepped out of their hiding place and left the garden by another route adjani sat crosslegged on his rumpled bed he was barefoot and appeared more than ever the wise allknowing guru dressed in his flowing white kaftan his hands placed palms together fingertips touching lightly he had been silent listening to spences recitation of the facts now spence waited for his verdict so here it is he said at last another fact to be connected how will we make the connection that is the primary question i cant see it myself offered spence maybe its just coincidence please there is no such thing as coincidence not in science not in the plans of god the connection must be made and perhaps it will be useful to us aris motherthe woman isnt even alive anymore how can she help us ari herself might know more than she thinks she knows we should find out i still dont see how i could possibly be connected with some weird superstition in the mountains of india somewhere and to a woman ive never even metwho has been dead i dont know how long stranger things are possible you yourself thought there was a connection or you wouldnt have reacted the way you did subconsciously you fastened on it how could i help it i mean first you mention it and then ariit gave me a jolt at first i thought it might be a clue but im not so sure now and i think youre just afraid to face what you might find afraid spence could not prevent the sneer that came what makes you say that if i was afraid i wouldnt have told you about it i think you might fear prying into your lovers past said adjani carefully was it that obvious that he and ari were in love i dont recall ever mentioning anything to you about that adjani laughed and the tension which had built up in the room floated away on his laughter you didnt need to say a word it is written all over you my friend anyone with eyes can see iti just happen to know her name thats all youre shrewd adjani ill give you that youd make a great spy what is a scientist but a spy were detectives all of us scratching for clues to the riddles of the universe what are we going to do about my riddle simple well ask ari she may be able to tell us more about it you know now that you mention it it is a little strange ari never talks about her mother i gather its still a painful subject her death i mean i wouldnt want to hurt her for anything then we must be very discreet and gentle in our inquiry that should not prove too difficult should it i guess not theres still something i dont like about this though it makes me nervous a warning perhaps warning we may be probing close to the heart of the matter the eggshaped chair spun in the air as hocking gazed upward at the clean blank ceiling as if he were searching for cracks or specks of dirt tickler and his assistant sat slumped in their own lessmobile seats gazing upward too in imitation of their leader but they had less on their minds the transport is back and reston has not turned up hocking repeated the facts of the case so far he shot a quick disapproving glance at tickler it would probably have been a good idea to have watched the docking and disembarkation of the passengers but that i suppose would never have occurred to you tickler grew sullen there was no reason to he has not been seen or heard from since the message and if he was here hed have to turn up sooner or later somewhere hes gone hockings eyes narrowed he disappearedbroke contact on the first night they landed yet the report of his disappearance did not come until a week later doesnt that strike you as odd i dont know i hadnt thought about it you dont think period exploded hocking i have to do all the thinking for all of us tickler looked away im getting sick of thisthis constant badgering just tell us what you want us to do will you i cant be responsible for dr restons whereabouts anymore hes gone most likely he fell over a rock and broke his neck possiblebut i dont think so i believe reston is very much alive and something tells me he has returned to gotham i think we had better check with that young bubblehead miss zanderson if he is alive he will have tried to contact her she may know his whereabouts kurt can go talk to her growled tickler but its a waste of time i say we should begin looking for a new subject right now hocking whirled to face him since when are you in charge here youll do as i say or do i have to remind you who holds the reins of power hmm i thought not we will begin looking for a new subject when i have satisfied myself that he is indeed gone but need i remind you that reston possesses certain highly refined qualitieshe is unique probably not one in a million like him we have searched long and hard to find him gentlemen and his contribution thus far has advanced our work enormously i do not intend to give up now until i know for a definite absolute undeniable fact that he is dead tickler muttered under his breath and avoided hockings eyes he did not wish to feel the terrible sting of the power hocking had referred to once had been enough for him it was enough for most people any further observations gentlemen no then report back to me as soon as you have questioned ariadne i want you to talk to some of the cadets on that trip too they can confirm our suspicions you may go the chair spun away from them and the two beleaguered underlings crept away hocking heard the sigh of the partition closing and then silently cruised to the panel himself perhaps another visit to miss zandersons father is in order he said to himself yes it is time we had a little chat adjani wake up spence jostled the arm of his sleeping friend a low murmur passed the indians lips as he rolled over adjani he persisted he went to the access panel and brought up the lights what is it adjani sat up rubbing his eyes and then snapped fully awake are you all right some watchdog yes im all right i remembered something in your sleep i dont sleep much anymore what difference does it make i remembered somethingit may be important when i first came here i met someone a very unusual personhe had a pneumochair those things arent cheap a quadriplegic i think his namei cant remember his name but he asked me about my dreams he did well he didnt come right out and ask me but he seemed to suggest that he knew about them he implied as much at least that was the feeling i got at the time what made you think of this now i dont know i was lying there thinking about what you said about there not being any coincidences and this just popped into my head here was a coincidence where there shouldnt be one i dont know youre the connection man you tell me a quadriplegic in a pneumochair will be easy enough to track down in any case well try to find him tomorrow he yawned and lay down again whats wrong with right now im sleeping right now besides if you havent noticed its third shift and everything is shut down we wouldnt get very far on his trail just now go back to bed and try to get some rest tomorrow may be a long day sorry if i interrupted your beauty sleep mahatma it is but the buzzing of a gnat my son it is nothing go to sleep director zanderson passed through the outer office and smiled warmly at the receptionist he entered his office and hurried by mr wermeyers empty desk glancing at the near corner as he went by to see if there were any messages for him he saw a small red light blinking on the comcen panel set in the desk he stopped and punched his code the wafer screen lit at once with the message it was a note from wermeyer it read brodine called to thank you for your support of their agen project i quote means so much to me and my boys to know the boss is behind us end quote theyre sending the first crate of spuds to you reply the director tapped a key and entered the words potato pan cakes he then cleared the display and proceeded to his office it was only when he reached his high handsome desk with its satiny walnut top that he noticed he was not alone he turned and jumped back a step i am sorry if i startled you director zanderson what are you doing here is that any way to greet a friend hocking smiled his grisly smile i hope you dont mind i had to see you and since no one was about i let myself in it occurred to the director that he would have to have the entry code changed at once what do you want i thought you said youd never come here again you said you had what you wanted and you wouldnt bother me any more somethings come up director i need some information thats all just a little information what makes you think you can just come sneaking in here any time you want and bully me around i can have you thrown out of here now now hocking clicked his tongue and chided you agreed to our little arrangement long ago didnt you it would be showing poor form to begin getting all indignant and officious at this late date weve kept our part of the bargain we expect you to keep yours what do you want zanderson scowled at his unwelcome guest want a modicum of consideration sniffed hocking i ha you wont get that from me i thought i made myself clear last time we talked hocking intoned menacingly you are a powerful man director with powerful enemies what they might do with the information i could give them well who knows what they might do there is of course one quick way to find out isnt there but you dont want me to use it do you zanderson closed his eyes and turned away i thought not hocking soothed i made a big mistake in letting you come here a big mistake i wouldnt worry about that it wasnt really your choice hocking smirked haughtily the chair rose higher in the air what do you want i want to know the whereabouts of a certain dr spencer reston zanderson gulped and stared blankly at his guest him why him lets just say he has become something of a topic of conversation lately i would like to know where he is hes missing said the director delicately im afraid thats want anyone can say right now do you expect to say more later no i mean i dont know we havent even notified his family yet and why is that do you think hes likely to turn up soon no i dont the director shook his head sadly dr reston is dead then why havent you notified his family and why has there been no announcement to this effect director zanderson touched fingertips to his temples and sank into his chair you dont understand he said wearily in the case of suicide we dont exactly like to rush to press with the news it isnt good for the center is that what you suspect suicide i am afraid so hocking watched his man intently and decided that he was telling the truth he assumed a bright reassuring tone see how easy that was not unpleasant at all i shall be going now the chair floated across the room toward the door i dont want to see you again zanderson said to the retreaing figure do you hear me stay away from here hocking did not answer and the chair kept right as the door panel slid closed the director thought on going grim ghostly laughter coming from the othe side he of that heard a motionless in his chair for a long time after the sound laughter had died away sat the two men slipped along the trafficways trying to be as invisible as possible the f gotham of technicians and construction workers the dark one keeping crowd wary watch ahead on all sides the light man keeping his face averted eyes on his feet when they were certain they were not being followed they slipped unnoticed into an empty axial and hurried on as they approached their destination they stopped and waited upon hearing a slight noise and voices speaking low as a portal slid open they dived into a nearby maintenance alcove and waited until the footsteps trailed away down the corridor before emerging to press the buzzer on the access plate ari having just gotten rid of one visitor hesitated before answering the door she expected to hurry off to meet spence soon and considered that probably it was best to ignore the buzzer and hope that whoever it was would go away but it buzzed again more insistent this time she thought so she went to the panel and lightly tapped the entry key the panel slid open and she saw a slight dark man and another behind him hidden in the shadow yes excuse me miss zanderson i oh its you dr rajwandhi she paused i uhwas just about to leave please i understand is your father here why no he is at his office i imagine or at a meeting somewhere if you need to see him i would suggest he cut her off thank you is anyone else here he answered her suspicious look saying please the purpose of my questions will immediately become clear she peered past adjani to the man lurking behind him a hint of worry glinted in her eyes no one else is here im alone at this the man behind adjani moved into the light and both men hurried through the door spence squeaked ari in surprise sorry for the charade i had to see you at once she saw a strange fire smoldering behind his dark eyes and stopped she had been about to greet him with a kiss instead she froze her hands halfway to him what is it something wrong spence took one of the outstretched hands and led her to the reading room where they all sat down together no he told her nothings wrong i remembered some details that might help us i couldnt wait im sorry if we frightened you they sat on the couch beneath the green abstract and adjani pulled up the low table and sat facing them now that he was here spence did not know where to begin adjani helped him our friend here has been awake all night pestering me with impossible questions for the sake of a restful sleep tonight i suggested we come to see you ari smiled for a sleep researcher he doesnt seem to do much of it does he and he makes sure no one else does either i assure you hes right i couldnt sleep last night i kept thinking about what you said yesterdayabout the dream thief i told adjani about it we think it might be important ari suddenly paled spence could see her withdraw a little into herself her tone became guarded certainly ill tell you anything you want to know who was with you just now asked adjani the change in subject came so abruptly both spence and ari looked at him sharply what they asked in unison when we came up a moment ago someone was just leaving your father perhaps spence frowned that doesnt concern us adjani anyway its none of our business but you are wrong my friend it might concern us entirely ari held up her hands its all right i was going to bring it up myself anyway because i thought it was a little odd spence it was that lab assistant of yours kurt millen he said the name as if it were a foreign word he did not know how to pronounce what did he want now that you ask i dont know he didnt say exactly thats what was odd about it she paused a look of deep con centration crossed her face when she looked up again her eyes glittered her tone was hushed excitement oh spence i remember somethingits been haunting me for weeks and i couldnt for the life of me think of what it was i think it important what is it what do you know i think i know whos out to get you clouds of incense colored the murky air a dull dirty brownish gray the pungent scents of sandalwood and patchouli mingled creating a single heavy dusky stench but the inhabitant of the closed chamber seemed not to mind the oppressive atmosphere he sat crosslegged his hands folded in his lap head erect eyes closed sight turned inward he appeared the very essence of the meditating guru with his paridhana yellowed with age wrapped in swaddling fashion around his wasted body his sunken chest and bony shoulders heaved only occasionally as if breathing were not so important to him that it needed regular attention the hairless head on its long slender neck floated on the clouds of incense filling the room a tiny brass bell sat on the grass mat before the ancient figure with a slow snakelike movement the guru slid a hand out to grasp the bell and ring it the hand had but three long fingers in a moment a whitehaired servant came running his thin sandals slapping his naked feet in mock applause the man dressed in muslin shirt and trousers entered the room bowing yes my master i am here ortu opened his eyes languidly and cast his dreadful yellow gaze upon the creature scraping before him i will eat now when i have finished i will see my disciples yes ortu the servant hurried away and shortly there sounded a bell clanging from some further recess of the gurus castle in a few moments the whitehaired servant returned with a tray of food in bowls rice and green tender shoots and a thick pungent broth these he laid at the feet of his master and retreated silently years of humble service had taught him that one did not linger in ortus presence unbidden pundi the servant hurried away to fetch ortus disciples every master had disciples pundi knew wise men always attracted sincere students who wished to learn the paths of wisdom from one whose feet treaded the higher paths he hi though now a servant had in his youth been a disciple of great seer who had become a brahman but the disciples of ortu were unlike any pundi had ever heard of they were not human they were not even alive ortus disciples were six hollow gems great black stones which contained only dust within their cleverly carved interiors these stones sat in six teak boxes which had been made to hold them the teak was very old and had words carved in the design which pundi did not recognize it had been years since ortu called for his disciples the last time pundi remembered there had been reports of demons loosed in the hills sacred cattle had been found dead and calves stillborn nursing mothers milk turned sour snakes mated in the village squares and the shrines of the gramadevata were overturned he shuddered to think what might happen this night after ortu met with his disciples but he did not hesitate a moment to fulfill his masters wish one did not hesitate before such a stern and powerful master he crept to the special room where the stones were kept and drew the key from the leather thong around his neck the treasure room contained many unusual objects which seemed both exceedingly old and yet new somehowas if their time of use had not yet come but he never dallied to wonder at these things it was enough to be allowed just to see them when he occasionally entered to fetch one or the other of them for ortu his eyes fell on the large gopher wood chest which contained the six smaller boxes of teak he picked it up by its brass handles and carried it away to his master ortus eyes flicked open when the last of the boxes had been placed before him with a twitch of his hand he sent pundi scurrying away he gazed at each of the black glittering gems as he opened each box in turn a sound like the hiss of a serpent drifted into the air he held his hands over the six black stones and with his head weaving back and forth began to speak in a strange chirping tongue his lids closed slowly over his enormous yellow eyes and his ancient head with its skin dry as old parchment sank to his chest the odd threefingered hands remained outstretched over the gemstones in their boxes the drifting brown haze of incense scattered as by a cool breeze entering the chamber a low moan or hum rose into the in ortus throat the thin air the s head the kastak from throb with a bright pulsing light one by one so softly beam of light hardly be ac facet here and there the six black gems began to glow you what i think i know whos out to get youthat is i think i have a pretty good idea spences stupid expression gave way to one of incredulity how it came to nun just now your question sort of triggered it lets have it said spence excitedly adjani leaned forward from his perch on the coffee table you asked who was here right but that wasnt the first time hes been here he came to see me one other time just after you had left aboard the transport no i remember clearly now it was several weeks after youd left what did he want im getting to that she said a little impatiently let me remember it exactly she closed her eyes and her lovely features scrunched themselves into a frown all right yes proceed said spence more calmly your mr millen came to me and said theyd just received a communication from you and youd given him a message to pass on to me what was the message asked adjani nothing really he said that youd told him to tell me that you missed me and youd be seeing me soonsomething like that seems pretty harmless to me said spence only i never sent any messages i thought it was a little odd but he seemed like such a nice guy and there was really nothing unusual about what he said it made me feel a little uncomfortable though uncomfortable how well i was under the impression when you left that if any messages were going to be sent theyd be sent to me youre absolutely right why was this asked adjani spence replied we had agreed before i sneaked aboard the transport that if anything happened id contact her and no one else actually there were to be no messages at all unless something important came up continued ari but kurt seemed so nonchalant about ithe knew all about the trip and everything and he knew that that you and i were seeing each other he knew that he seemed to know so much i figured youd told him i thought maybe you really had sent a message and explained everything to them why not it made sense after all he said youd told him your work was going smoothly and everything was fine i figured maybe you were you know feeling better so i just accepted what he said did you tell him anything ari gave spence a perturbed look i hope ive got more wits than that besides it wasnt like he was looking for information anyway he asked me if i knew you were going on the mars trip i told him i supposed i did but that you didnt confide in anyone very much its true spence you dont is that all apart from the fact that i never sent any message youd think it was all on the up and up youre right nothats not all heres the thing that i just remembered ari grew very intense the other two waited to hear what she would say spence they knew about the birthday gift that little paperweight i sent to my dad thats right i havent mentioned it but they caught me when i went to get it from your room remember you asked me to send it for you i remember what happened nothing really they came in as i was leaving i told them i was just looking for you good and then and then i left but they saw the paperweight so so thats just it they saw a paperweight but when kurt came to see me he said birthday gift spence i never told them that i called it what is was a paperweight i swear it spences eyes grew round with recognition youre right good lord youre right but how could they know they must have had it traced somehow put in adjani are you quite positive there was not another way they could have innocently received this information im positive i didnt tell them she said a little crossly well this is interesting said spence darkly very interesting murmured adjani for a moment they all sat ticking over the facts in their minds no one spoke finally the silence grew unbearable ari said what happens now spence shook his head slowly i wish i knew just dont get it muttered spence oh im not doubting your story it just doesnt make any sense why would lick ler and millen be out to get me the initial shock had worn off and the three were once again lost in conversation trying to untangle the deepening mystery you have to admit their behavior certainly seems suspicious said ari for a fact spence scratched his jaw absently but it seems beyond them somehowi mean ticklers not the kind of man to plot sabotage hes nothing but a fussy old grudger a drone what about the quadriplegic asked adjani i could believe anything of him said spence he gave me goosebumps what quadriplegic ill tell you said spence turning to ari but first id like to know why kurt came to see you again just now ari lifted her shoulders like before there didnt seem to be any particular reason at least he made it seem as if it was not at all important he just said hed heard you were missing from the mars expedition he stopped by to pay his respects thats all and to see if i knew any more about it it seems innocent enough of course they would want to give that illusion offered adjani what did you tell him i told him that i was very sorry and that i didnt really know any more about it either the whole thing being so sudden and all and the formal reports not being filed yet she glanced at the two men worriedly did i do right you did fine its hard to see what they could have learned from that spence reached and took her hand dont be too sure adjani raised a warning finger they may not have been after information at all but were looking for an emotional reaction to confirm what they already knew or suspected blazes adjani you seem to have quite a talent for this espionage stuff the indian smiled broadly it is part of the oriental mind sahib but from now on we are all going to have to adopt this way of thinking we must suspect everyone and trust no one do not accept anything at face value until you have probed below the surface we must become very sly dogs if we want to catch these foxes they fell to discussing various theories as to why anyone would want to meddle with spences work or with spence himself for that matter but the talk proved pointless since no one really had anything more than bare speculation to go on spence explained to ari about his chance encounter one day with a quadriplegic in a pneumochair at a lecture he finished by saying what id like you to do is check the records of personnel and visitors for anyone answering that description thats easy spence i can tell you right now there isnt anyone like that on gm ive been updating the personnel files for the furlough assignments for next year anyone with a special disability like that would have been in the primary groupthats the highstress group who must be considered every quarter regardless they can put in for furlough at any time and not wait for the rotation there are a few partially disabledbut no one that severely handicapped from what i saw of him he wasnt at all handicapped what about visitors asked adjani possibly but i dont think so any visitors like that would have to be cleared sometimes you know their devices interfere with certain radio frequencies and such you two would know more about that than i do but i know they have to get advance clearance from the directors office no one like that has come through since ive been here i usually handle daddys correspondence myselfthings of that nature anyway well could you check it out again just to be sure we need to be positive all right no problem ari smiled cryptically what im sorry i just couldnt help thinking that this really is a mystery isnt it an adventure not to me it isnt her glib tone offended spence oh i didnt mean anything by it spence you know that its just that ive never been involved in anything so exciting i hope the excitement doesnt prove fatal said adjani aris eyes grew round do you think theres a chance of that is it that serious spence nodded solemnly until we figure out whats going on well all be in danger we still dont have the slightest idea what this is all about not real in youre right im sorry adjani sitting back casually swiveled toward ari and abruptly asked ari was your mother ever in sikkim mmy mother she managed to stammer out spence was about to protest this illadvised and rough handling of an obviously delicate subject but adjani held up a hand and kept him silent sikkim is in india a small province in the north high in the foothills of the himalayas ari bent her head as if examining her fine long nails i know where it is oh not many people do yes my mother has been there you might say she grew up there tell us about it please is this spence started adjani cut him off with a sharp look how did you know you mentioned the dream thief to spence he told me you said it came from your mother and since it is a fairly obscure local legend i assumed she must have been there at some time or known someone who had my grandfather was a professor of hermeneutics at rangpo seminary they lived there for twelve years and left when he became dean of west coast seminary she was sixteen when they came back to the states do you know anything more about it not really she never really talked much about itits just something she said aris voice had become almost a whisper her tone strained spence wondered at the transformation in her it had happened so swiftly only a moment ago she had been her lighthearted enchanting self now she appeared pale and shaken under adjanis questioning adjani eyes intent watching her every move asked gently when did your mother pass away ari the girl was silent for a long time finally she raised her head slowly and looked at the two men cautiously as if trying to decide her blue eyes that told him she was fighting a bitter battle somewhere inside her she ari started and then stopped her head fell once more whichever side had won the battle it appeared to spence that ari had lost my mother isnt dead what spence could not help it the admission took him by surprise you told me she was i said she was no longer with usand she isnt i wanted you to think she was dead i admit it thats what i always say but why i dont understand she buried her face in her hands im so embarrassed spence was mystified he could never have believed this bright angelic creature capable of such duplicity about eight years ago my mother became illher mind started going she began having these attacks of insanity shed be perfectly calm and normal one moment and the next shed be screaming and crying and carrying on something terrible it was frightening ari avoiding spences eyes drew a long shaky breath and continued there was nothing to be done for her daddy took her to all the top doctors in the country no one could help her oh it was awful we never knew when another attack would come and they got worse and worse as time went on she would run away sometimes and it would be days before we found her again she wouldnt know where shed been or what shed been doing or anything gradually her good periods shrank away and we couldnt watch her anymore daddy was up for the promotion to director and wanted to accept the jobit was his lifes goal there was nothing to be done for mother but put her in an institution shes been there ever since but why let everyone think she was dead i dont know it just seemed easier at first telling people that then they dont ask questions it was daddys idea really think he couldnt stand the idea that mother would never be right again he preferred having the uncertainty settled one way or the other then after it got started we couldnt very well tell everyone that she was really alive so we kept it up i think daddy was a little afraid that if anyone on the board ever found out different thered be an investigation and the whole thing would come out would he lose his directorship i dont know maybeif someone wanted his blood badly enough and there was a scandal or something adjani eyes narrowed had listened to every word ari said without moving a muscle when did she tell you about the dream thief oh i dont know that was what she always told me when she wanted me to be good she said if i didnt behave the dream thief would get me like the bogeyman or something later when i was a little older shed put me to bed and say dont let the dream thief get you like that it was just something she said i didnt know where it came from one time i asked her about it she said shed heat i iiclipii she was a little girl in india there was some kind of superstition connected with it but she didnt know or remember what it was that was all she told you asked adjani he peered at her over his laced fingers thats all she ordinarily didnt talk much about india and growing up i gather she didnt like it there very much she was sick a lot as a little girlonce when she was twelve she almost died she was in a coma for a month how did this happen fever maybe she never said ari more at ease now that the secret was out glanced at her inquisitors and asked is this important do you think it may be said spence adjani nodded see when you mentioned those words to me in the garden yesterday something snappedlike a rubber band stretched too tight i had never heard of this dream thief and then here both my best friends were talking about him it seemed like too much of a coincidence ari cast a questioning look at adjani he answered it admitting yes i know about the dream thief but what i know goes beyond childrens tales of bogeymen and superstition he told ari the story he had heard on his visit to his homeland and related the things he had seen when he finished ari shook her head no wonder you nearly japed out of your skin i dont blame you i would have too you couldnt have known what you were saying spence soothed but it still doesnt add up at all instead of arriving at an answer we seem to be creating more questions more loose ends adjani shrugged that is to be expected difficult problems are not solved by easy answers very likely we will have to work very hard to penetrate this mystery where do we start it seems like were kind of out on a branch right now rue you cannot go back to your lab just yetnot with those two skulking around said ari perhaps it would be best to follow the thread ari has given us said adjani to see where it will lead where does it lead the only other person i can see that would know anything about any of this is aris mother you dont mean that we should adjani nodded precisely i believe we must pay mrs zanderson a visit olmstead packer sat heavily in his chair reading the latest findings of a battery of tests which had been carried out in his absence he grumbled and muttered into the bushy red beard regarding the material with sour muttered seemed that from the evidence nothing had gone right while he was away it would all have to be done over again he got up and poured himself another cup of coffee from a jug on a bookshelf overflowing with magcarts printouts and stacks of coded discs a chiming tone sounded from a wedgeshaped instrument in his desk and a clear crisp voice announced dr packer there is a gentleman waiting to see you hes from an investigation firm oh that sounded interesting send him in ive got nothing to hide almost before he could set the jug down and turn around the panel of the outer office slid open and a large eggshaped object glided into the room it was a pneumochair and in it sat a skeleton of a man grinning a deathly grin at him which chilled packer like a sudden icy blast professor packer said the skeleton as the chair came to hover a few inches from the edge of his desk yes id ask you to have a seat but i see you already have the skeleton laughed very good ill have to remember that one what can i do for you packer dropped back into his seat and folded his hands on the desk i am from the united federal insurance group investigation division packer raised his eyebrows oh something needs investigating that is what id like to find out the man in the chair tilted his head to one side studying the physicist behind the desk i believe you know dr spencer reston do you not why yes yes i do that is before the accident accident the skeleton mans eyes narrowed could you tell me about it please packer hesitated his large hands fumbling over one another on his desk the insurance investigator noticed the mans reluctance and said oh i assure you this is not a formal investigation i was merely making our quarterly audityou can understand that with an account this big well he rolled his eyes to include the whole of the space station and someone mentioned the loss of one of our insureds that is one of your staff members i merely thought that while i was here i might as well do a prelim and save some time later no doubt a claim will be filed in due course and our company will schedule a formal inquiry but im sure you understand packer nodded uncertainly he was not sure he should tell this investigator anything at all but figured a refusal would arouse undue suspicion where there was none to begin with besides something about the investigator made him nervous and a little suspicious he decided out of loyalty to adjani to stick to the story he and adjani had agreed upon packer cleared his throat well he wasnt one of my staff members oh he was on the research trip correct correct but he belonged to a different divisionbiopsych i believe but you were party leader were you not yes of course but that is not at all unusual often members of other divisions are invited along as many as transport space will allow i see do you know what happened to dr reston the question came so quick that packer did not have an answer ready he bluffed i suppose so dont you know for a certainty not really no packer lied and fell his stomach knot in tension then what do you suppose happened to him i suppose he froze to death would that not be extremely unlikely professor packer was beginning to feel as if he were a criminal under crossexamination perhaps talking to the investigator had not been such a good idea in the first place he took a deep breath not at all it would in fact be quite the oppositevery likely a fair certainty for one caught outside of shelter in the martian night inevitable i see is that what happened to dr reston ho caught outside of shelter yes thats what i find so unlikely professor packer i keep asking myself why would an intelligent man like dr reston allow that to happen to him it simply doesnt add up packer glanced at the desk as if he held a hand of cards and was trying to decide how to play them he sighed i will tell you something mrah hocking mr hocking this is off the record you understand i am not qualified to offer any kind of analysis of dr restons condition i understand continue dr reston was a very disturbed man it is my opinion that he did not know what he was doing when he went out that night could he not have found his way back he surely could not have wandered very far no you wouldnt think so but then with the storm and all who really knows what happened you never saw him again no not a trace we searched for eighteen hours before the storm brought a halt to the rescue operation it was three days before the wind let up enough to venture outside again and by that time he shrugged heavily there was no point i see all this is in my official report packer said gruffly if you want to know any more about the incident i suggest you look it up he felt he had said enough and that it was time his visitor left well i think thats all for now thank you for your help professor packer i appreciate it may i call on you again if any questions come up later of course his tone was even noninviting i will do that but i dont anticipate the need for a lengthy investigation most likely youll never see me again hockings chair backed away from the desk and whirred toward the door oh there is one other thing he fixed packer with a crafty gaze whats that do you think it was suicide who told you that director zanderson mentioned the word i believe well i wouldnt know i wouldnt like to comment on that just wondering the pneumochair half turned in the air i dont suppose there is a chance that dr reston could still be alive not the slightest packer rose and came around the desk good day mr hocking the interview was concluded packer wished he had terminated it a whole lot sooner he had a dark suspicion that hocking saw right through his flimsy answers ari felt unseen eyes upon her all day she imagined spies around every corner though she saw no one and nothing out of the ordinary as she walked along the winding pathway she nevertheless made doubly sure that no one followed her she paused looking both ways along the path and then skipped over the little brook and entered the green seclusion of the fern nook oh youre here already she said upon entering spence greeted her she saw by the look on his face that he was eager to learn what had been discovered from her detective work wheres adjani he couldnt make it he had to work but never mind that what did you find out good news and bad news the good news is that we can all make the jump down with the next shuttle theyre bringing up a dozen extra construction workers this next trip theyve added an extra row of seats in the cabin there are only twentyfive scheduled to go down this trip so those seats will be empty ive already obtained three travel vouchers were all set when does it get here the shuttle will get here on thursdaytwo days from now it leaves next morning all right itll have to do said spence ari could see he was deep in thought making rapid mental calculations have to do its blooming terrific do you have any idea how hard it would be to get aboard a shuttle any other time youd have to wait months for an extra seat the schedules are tight my dear impossibly tight im sorry spence smiled and looked at her as if he had not seen her before this moment i guess im a little preoccupied is that what you call it preoccupied i call it bossy her lip protruded in a pretty pout i said i was sorry oh youre no fun i was only teasing spence gave her a sharp look she hurried on the rest of my news isnt so terrific ive looked and looked but there is no record of anyone like you described on gm in the last six months he was here all right i saw him spence was fighting the belief that he dreamed up the mystery figure no one doubts that you did dearest but there is simply not record that anyone answering your description was here obviously he was here without authorization authorization who would have to authorize him gm ground base you see hed need clearance for that pneumochair of his because of its magnetic field or whatever he couldnt get aboard without it i dont see how the only other way would be for daddy to offer clearance he could do that certainly if he wanted to but he never has he got on board somehow well if he did someone else must have seen him he was in a whole room full of cadets wasnt he what class was it i dont know spence moaned i cant remember i wasnt there for the lecture anyway confirming his existence isnt the point i saw himso what if the whole colony saw him too i want to find out who he is are you sure its important i mean it wont change anything one way or the other will it i dont know whats important or whats not important any more everythings getting so confused but yes i feel its important in here he thumped his chest dont ask me why i just do ari stepped close and laid a cool hand against his cheek its all right spencer she soothed no need to get heated up over this were with you well work this out youll see spence calmed under the girls touch he peered deep into the cool blue eyes and brought his hands up behind her neck you are an angel spence cant we tell daddy about all this her look implored him and he understood how hard it was for her to keep secrets from her father soon very soon now well tell him everything i promise but right now id rather as few people know about any of this as possible there will be less chance of a slip up that way all right i do so hate to deceive him like this i feel so guilty youre not deceiving him anyway well tell him soon enough they kissed then and held each other for a moment ari broke away first ive got to get back to the office im watching mr wermeyers desk today hes conducting a tour for some plastics manufacturers theyve got a congressman or lobbyist or some sort of high muckymuck with them if you see any of them stay out of the way theyll talk your leg off i though that was your dads jobto entertain muckymucks usually it is but hes in seclusion today for some reason i havent even seen him she smiled brightly will i see you tonight yes tonight she blew him a kiss and vanished through the ferns spence watched her slim form blur as it merged with the green and gold of vegetation and sunlight beyond the shady hollow he sat down and began going over the new information once again he wanted to make sure he did not forget anything in order to give adjani a complete report hocking eyes lit with triumph twitched with excitement gentlemen he said his voice booming through the speakers at either side of his head his two henchmen looked at each other uncertain how to interpret their unpredictable masters mood i have great news our inquiries have borne fruit the tidings whatever they were had put their chief in a munificent frame of mind they grinned slyly at one another and waited for hocking to tell them what he had discovered dr restonhocking drew the name out in a long sibilant hissour wayward young genius has been found he is here on gm this instant and very much alive stay in here and dont move whispered adjani ill see who it is and get rid of them adjani had changed the access code to the door of his quarters and someone trying to punch in the old code had set off its signal spence going through the drill stepped inside the sanibooth and closed the panel to a crack so he could hear who it was in a moment he heard adjani sing out its all clear you can come out feeling like a burglar who had been discovered he opened the door and crept out the first thing he saw was packers fiery head bobbing excitedly i dont like it the big scientist was saying its getting out of hand whats up all we need is a little more time adjani explained packer addressed spence i had a visitor today an inquisitive fellow from the insurance company you were high on his agenda oh he was nosing around and found out about your disappearance thought hed check it out while he was in the neighborhood what did you tell him i told him youd joined a monasterywhat do you think i told him packers jaw thrust forward angrily his face was flushed and red hold on i know youve stretched your neck out as far as itll go on this but dont go turtle on us now a few days more is all we need were making great progress adjani offered the scowl on the big mans face dwindled away soon to be replaced by a slight impish smirk you know i do believe i twisted the old boys tail just a bit it wasnt really necessary but the guy acted like id made off with his precious dr reston he tried to give me a real professional crossexamination but i cut him off pretty quick adjani and spence looked at each other besides packer continued this guy gave me the willies him in that pneumochair and all shrunken up like that he looked like a skeleton packer stared at his listeners hey whats the matteri say something wrong two great curving hemispheres blue in the light of a silvery moon rose up like incandescent mountainssmooth pale and surrounded by a zigzagging wall which fell around them in a seamless black barrier spence looked and saw a tower a thin heavenpoised finger between the two domes shimmering darkly in the moonlight he sat on a stone ledge separated from the palace by a deep gorge between him and the palace swinging in the wind rushing out of the chasm hung an ancient bridge made of twisted rope and wood he could hear the wind singing through the ropes and saw the frayed ends blowing on the breezes like an old womans hair the frail structure creaked as it danced and the sound was a ghostly falling laughter which echoed away into the inky depths below in spences ears the sound became the voice of his enemy jeering at him daring him to cross the crevice on that bridge and come to the palace to face him he huddled with his hands around his knees shivering in the chill night air but then rose and went to the swaying bridge gripping the frayed ropes with his hands and placing one foot cautiously on the footboards at his first step the bridge bounced wildly spence drew back in a moment he worked up his courage again and stepped gingerly out onto the bridge the laughter seemed to well up from the chasm below as he heard the roar of a crashing cataract like the sound of an angry beast thrashing in its dark den he closed his ears to the sounds and kept his eyes on the far side and walked on step by cautious step he reached the middle of the bridge and felt the sharp winds buffeting him rustling his clothing then everything was still the night sounds faded and a gentle warmth seeped into the air a new sound reached his earsthe sobbing of a young woman he looked up and saw ari standing on the far side of the brink her tears fell in liquid gems and sparkled on her cheeks she was crying and lifting up her arms to him her long yell m hair was white in the moonlight and it drifted like moondust ari spence cried and heard the name repeated again and again far below him he raised his foot and put it down and felt himself step into the air his foot failed to touch wood and he fell plunging headlong down into the gorge spinning helplessly down and down he screamed in terror and anger and saw the form of his love turn into that of a wizened old man who peered over the edge and laughed at him the rocks rang with laughter and he shut his eyes and screamed to keep out the hideous sound then he was on his knees in a dirty stinking street narrow between the crumbling facades of buildings the moon shone between the buildings from above and he could see far down the canyonstreet to where it ended at a broad gray river he began walking toward the river and felt a pang of terror clutch at his heart he looked behind him and saw nothing though he heard the rush of muffled feet he started to run the feet ran with him and he saw on either side of him dark shapes flitting by to become lost in shadow he peered over his shoulder and saw a churning black mass sweeping ever nearer to him he came to a courtyard bounded on all sides by a high wall he stood in the center of the yard on crumbling stone one hand pressed to his side breathing hard and feeling the burning stab of pain in his side all at once he heard them his pursuers coming down the narrow street behind him he turned and saw hundreds of narrow yellow eyes and the curved white slivers of bared teeth he heard an enormous slavering growl tearing up out of a hundred throats as the dogs sprang on him their jaws snapping hackles raised ears flattened to their angular heads the dogs leapt as one and he felt himself sinking the stone was cool against his cheek and he heard the ripping of his clothing and flesh as the beasts lunged for him he felt their teeth in him and the whitehot searing pain spencer hear me now this is adjani if you can bear me say yes yes you are dreaming spence it is only a dream do you under stand a dream dont fight the dream let it come in a moment you will awaken and remember your dream i want you to remember it remember the word was soft and mushy spence was deep in his dream adjani knelt close beside him his lips to his ear he spoke slowly and with authority as a hypnotist would speak to his subject spence i want you to wake up now im going to count to three and when i reach that number i want you to wake up do you understand yes adjani counted off the numbers and spence awakened to see his friend standing over him adjani fear and relief mingled in his voice i was dreaming yes i know i heard you cry out in your sleep you woke me up adjani nodded it was terrible horrible oh spence made to rise up but adjani placed a hand on his chest and held him down tell me about it quickly before you forget i wont forget this one he proceeded to tell his dream in vivid detail yes very frightening murmured adjani when he had finished very i remembered adjani i remembered everything ive never been able to do that before i gave you a hypnotic suggestion i thought it might help us all at once the significance of what adjani was saying broke in on spences sleepdulled brain the dream thief adjani nodded slowly they know im alive theyre trying to get to me again was there anything in your dream that might give a clue to who they are or what they might want from you i dont knowit all seems rather bizarre dogs and castles and bridges it doesnt mean a thing to me he shuddered involuntarily as he remembered the flashing slashing teeth tearing into him and heard again the sickening crunch of his own bones but is was so real ive had lucid dreams before but they were nothing like this it was really happening maybe i shouldnt have awakened you so soon im glad you did they would have killed me adjani glanced at him sharply hold it spence protested you dont think they actually couldno its impossible you cant kill someone with a dream can you the snubnosed taser gun seemed very natural in ticklers hand he held it steadily and surely there was no hint of nervousness or jitters it occurred to spence that he had handled the weapon before under similar circumstances spence had been waiting in adjanis room for adjani to return ill fetch ari and be back in a few minutes and well go over our plans for the trip down tomorrow he had said and slipped out when he heard the signal spence answered the door and found not ari and adjani but kurt and tickler wearing the read and black jumpsuits and caps of the gm security force you you have led us a merry chase reston tickler smiled a thin snaky smile but now youre coming with us im doing no such thing said spence then tickler had drawn the taser a mean little gadget which expelled a tiny electrified dart instantly rendering its victim paralyzed and unconscious for two or three minutes generally speaking there was no escaping a man armed with a taser you will do as i say from now on reston tickler mouthed the words with special relish it was clear he enjoyed his role as tough guy put that thing away tickler are you crazy not crazy doctor concerned weve been very worried about you when you didnt return from mars we thought wed lost you it turns out that we were wrong happily so now that youre back we mean to hold onto you for a while what is this all about what do you want with me spence hoped to keep them occupied until adjani returned it was his only hope you are inquisitive arent you but we have no time for questions now theres someone waiting to meet you where are you taking me i demand to know spence shouted shrilly your demands mean nothing keep your voice down or well carry you out of here come on the taser waved him ahead get moving just a minute i need my shoes spence indicated his stockinged feet get his shoes for him said tickler only you wont really be needing them once we get where were going spence took the shoes and sat down at adjanis desk he placed both shoes deliberately on top of the computer keyboard he took the first shoe and put it on when he picked up the second shoe he deftly tapped the comcen key the monitor flashed on across the room neither of the intruders noticed their backs were to the screen spence stood and said so youre taking me down to the docking bay huh then where not back to mars i hope as he spoke he pushed the dictate key and hoped that adjani had the machine programmed the same way he did no place as far as all that answered tickler youll find the trip anything but boring i assure you he jeered the nose of the gun toward the door now get going and i warn you restondont try anything or i will make you very uncomfortable we have a vehicle waiting outside nothing but the best for the condemned man said spence he hoped the machine had picked up their conversation youre taking this very well said tickler i hope you have abandoned any notions of escape i will not hesitate to use this on you ive used it before i bet you have millen led the way into the corridor and took the drivers seat of a small electric car tickler and spence sat facing one another in the back as the open vehicle moved noiselessly away with its red light flashing to warn oncoming pedestrians to stand aside hes gone said adjani as soon as he entered the room somethings happened ari looked stricken you mean theyve taken him right but maybe we can still catch them look ari pointed to the comcen screen on the wall bravo he left us a message adjani leapt to the computer console and tapped in instructions for an audio replay this is what they heard far as all that youll find the trip anything but boring i assure you now get going and i warn you restondont try anything or i will make you very uncomfortable we have a vehicle waiting outside then they heard nothing but the best for the condemned man there was a rustle and the faraway sound of people moving in the room the first voice faded and indistinct as the party left the room said youre taking this very well i hope you have abandoned the rest was lost as the portal slid shut ari turned wide horrorfilled eyes upon adjani but her voice was calm and steady do they mean to kill him i dont think so not yet anyway his reference to the condemned man was to let us know that he was under armed guard i think where will they take him they mean to leave the station i would guessback to earth somewhere adjani bent over the computer keyboard and closed his eyes his fingers poised above the keys then he smiled and his hands began moving over the keys in swift precise movements come on he shouted jumping away from the desk lets hope that will hold them until we get there what are we going to do i dont know yet come on kurt nosed the security car into a recharging berth just outside the entrance to the docking bay tickler took the opportunity to warn his prisoner once more we are leaving gotham dr reston do not attempt to attract attention security has already been advised that we are transporting a seriously disturbed prisoner you think of everything shut up snapped tickler move and remember im right behind you kurt picked up a long bundle from the drivers seat of the car and led the way into the air lock red lights warned them that the outer doors were open spence was shoved forward to the long line of pressure suits hanging in their racks he squirmed into one under ticklers watchful eye and wondered whether the suit might stop a taser dart he decided that it probably would not but that if the right opportunity presented itself he might chance it while tickler donned his suit the cadet held the taser on him this will go down on your achievement report you know he quipped the young man spit on the floor not much for achievement i guess oh well theres always computer maintenance shut up kurt growled youve caused us enough trouble as it is i dont have to listen to your smart mouth its all part of being a kidnapper occupational hazard shut up i said so help me ill let you have it spence said no more figuring he had pushed his luck about as far as it would stretch for the moment tickler rejoined them looking like a deflated snowman in his suit whats the matter tickler didnt they have one your size put your helmet on he ordered and pushed the bleed switch he was still fumbling with the helmet when he heard the whoosh of escaping air his ears popped and his nose trickled a thin pink thread of foaming blood before he got the helmet secured tickler had popped the valve at once rather than wait for the air to bleed off slowly it was a dirty trick ready tickler leveled the taser on him again and shoved him forward they walked out of the air lock and into the cavernous docking bay ahead of them across a wide empty expanse of gleaming duralum two ships waited one the transport gyrfalcon dwarfed the smaller sixpassenger shuttlethe one used by the director for his trips back and forth to board meetings and other special occasions between them and the ships waiting at the end of the tether ramps only a few roboskids moved about on their programmed errands there was nothing to offer an escape theyve thought of everything they even picked a time when the maintenance crew is away and the outer doors open that meant of course that anyone entering the docking bay would have to don a pressure suit and thus be slowed down considerably most likely any attempt to save spence would come too latehe was not even sure if there was an attempt being made to save him tickler pushed him across the floor toward the small shuttle halfway to the vehicle spence saw a large figure emerge from the gyrfalcon and come toward them he thought the huge hulking form vaguely familiar closer the figure raised an arm to them and stepped into their path through the helmets wide face plate spence recognized the smiling goodnatured face ah dr reston it is good to see you again hello captain kalnikov its good seeing you again too kalnikov his manner easy and unconcerned looked at the two men with spence he smiled showing even rows of large white teeth are you and your friends going somewhere the russian asked his booming voice sounding tinny and distorted as it overpowered the helmets radio yes we are replied spence vaguely a little trip allow me to introduce you spence fastened on the stalling tactic which kalnikov offered him that wont be necessary said tickler sharply oh nonsense objected spence his mind raced for a way to let kalnikov know he was in trouble im sure we have time for a little chat captain id like you to meet my two former assistants dr tickler and cadet millen very thorough both of them charmed said tickler his eyes strayed to the shuttle have you ever been aboard the gyrfalcon gentlemen kalnikov asked thank you no said tickler perhaps some other time he moved as if to continue on his way kalnikov stopped him laying a big hand on his shoulder do not think that it would be an imposition please said kalnikov his smile remained but his eyes had grown cold i would be happy to show you around tickler hesitated spence saw the hesitation and pounced on it wed be delighted why dont you take us aboard as they moved toward the great transport he felt an electric charge of excitement run through him the game had been moved to neutral ground and now he had a chance to score a few points of his own he had just put his foot on the boarding ramp when he heard another familiar voice inside his helmet spence wait for us it was adjani he turned to see two bulky figures emerge from the air lock and dash across the floor a quick glance to ticklers face showed that his kidnappers were getting worried they waited while adjani and ari drew up weve been looking all over for you spence said adjani ari with a strange defiant scowl on her face pushed her way through the others and came to stand beside him you promised to take me to lunch today remember gosh i clean forgot said spence all right barked tickler his voice buzzed in their helmets enough of this charade get back all of you he drew the taser again and waved it at them kalnikov stepped forward thrusting spence and ari behind him that is such a little gun and it has only one sting how will you stop all of us i wonder tickler nodded to kurt who brought up the clothwrapped bundle he was carrying the cloth slid off to reveal a stun rifle does that answer your question now back off all of you reston step over here im sorry said spence nice try everybody he made to step around kalnikov and as he passed the russian pilot a strange thing happened kalnikov raised his arm and his glove suddenly shot off his hand and flew into ticklers face there was a muffled whoosh and tickler gasped as instantly a jet of white foam splashed over him before anyone could speak or move the foam jet was turned on the cadet and his face plate obliterated beneath the white mess spence saw his two antagonists reeling and heard their voices swearing into their microphones then kalnikov was herding everybody up the ramp into the transport spence reached the top of the ramp first and turned to pull ari through the portal adjani jumped through and then he ducked inside kalnikov was right behind him shouting close the hatch just as the russian reached the hatch he staggered his eyes rolling to the tops of his sockets and eyelids fluttering a strangling noise came from his throat his head snapped back and his arms flung themselves wide as a convulsion passed through his mighty frame he collapsed onto the ramp and spence saw the taser dart sticking out of his stilltwitching body he did not wait to see more but jumped through the hatch and ran into the interior of the ship he saw adjani motioning to him and he ducked after him into the next section i couldnt get the hatch closed said spence as they huddled together in the next compartment theyll be in here in a second ive got an idea said adjani follow me aware that their pursuers could hear every word in their own helmets adjani motioned for them to proceed aft inside the next compartment he pushed spence and ari into deck tubes and sent them and himself to the level below the three hurried further aft through the transport they could hear tickler and millen their rapid breathing and grunting loud inside their helmets it made it seem as if they were inside their suits with them stop where you are shouted tickler spence turned just in time to see the scientist level the stun rifle at him he threw himself to the deck and rolled into the next compartment adjani punched the access plate and the door slid shut spence looked aroundthey were in the hold of the transport along the sides of the hold were the hatches of the empty landing pods adjani gestured excitedly toward the first hatch ari dived into the pod with spence behind her adjani jumped through and spence threw the switch to seal the hatch they were now safe within their own spacecraft adjani pressurized the cabin with a flick of a switch and waited a few moments until the light on the switch changed from red to green then he grabbed his helmet and gave it a sideways tug now what asked spence they could hear tickler and kurt pounding on the hatch outside get strapped in said adjani hurry you cant be serious we wont get anywhere in this where do you want to go asked adjani heading for the small pilot console earth i guess wasnt that the plan he stared at his slim brown friend buckling himself into his seat this is a landing pod isnt it well were going to land it now get yourself strapped in it had not occurred to spence that the landing pods could make such a trip but they could at least get out of ticklers range and then figure something out okay he shouted when he had thrown the straps over him just one more thing you sure you know how to drive this bucket the question does not deserve an answer everybody ready hold on there was an immediate rumble as the pod jettisoned from the transport a pressure forced them back in their seats as if a giant hand had pressed on them id give a months pay to see ticklers face right now id hate to be in his shoes when he reports to his boss ari had been quiet since they entered the pod spence looked at her and she looked back forcing a small tentative smile im sorry ive mixed you up in all this you could have been hurt back there i was mixed up in this a long time agofrom the day i met you im all right you sure im fine i just havent had much in the way of combat training dont worry thats behind us now spence tried to sound assured but his tone fell short of persuasive the truth was he felt their troubles were only beginning hockings gaunt face had taken on the coloring of a ripe tomato he appeared ready to burst but when he spoke his voice was ice you let him get away fools idiots you let him escape ortu will hear about this oh yes he will and i hope he deals with you as you deserve i wont stop him this time please cried tickler his moleish face was contorted in fear and anguish it wasnt our fault that russian pilot kalnikovhe knew about it how could he know unless you were careless you gave reston an opportunity to warn them there was no way he could i swear it please believe me youve ruined everything reston will be that much harder to catch now that he knows were after him he wont be taken by force thats certain hocking swiveled away from his two quaking underlings he seemed to relax somewhat as he pondered the situation when he spoke again it was mostly it himself no it must be something subtle it would be better if he came of his own accord yes he must come of his own willthat way he can be guided more easily and he will be receptive to the stimulus tickler sensed a ray of hope in hockings change of demeanor that girlwe could get her would he follow her to the ends of the earth said tickler hes in love with her put in millen hockings eyes sparked with interest a thin skeletal smile drew his lips taut there may be something in what you say he mused perhaps this is precisely the opportunity weve been looking for then he snapped all right this wont be easywe dont even know where theyre headed yet so well have to improvise heres what well do the discussion that followed was brief it ended with tickler and millen bolting for the door and dashing away to carry out their new orders glad for the moment to have saved their skins as soon as they had gone hocking propelled himself to the comcen console across the room he tapped in a code and waited seconds later a voice said wermeyer here the takeover is begun you will put phase one into operation at once so soon but the voice was a whisper immediately this is the chance weve been waiting for they are to be held upon landing they have stolen a spacecraft they are fugitives you are the director of this station you can order their arrest you will do so director zanderson his round face pale with fear and worry fumbled for words ii dont know if thats ah possible oh it is possible in fact it is precisely what will happen i dont want ari involved in this shes not part of it she doesnt know anything leave her out of it were not interested in ari shell be turned loose immediately hocking could see he was finally getting through to the frightened man and so softened his tone to a persuasive coo of course she shall be spared any unpleasantness what about the others reston and rajwandhi what have they done to you they have stolen some very expensive secretsa kind of tech theft if you will we want them stopped before they seil what they know i still cant believe it of them are you sure positive why else would they run away like they did i lid not mention it before because i did not want to alarm you but i think it possible that they intend to use ari for ransom in case there is trouble this last remark drew a quick worried look from the director they wouldnt dare they are desperate men to think i trusted reston i grieved for himand to think he was alive all this time hiding here yes said hocking now send that order director zanderson pressed a button and leaned over his desk and spoke into the wedge mr wermeyer have comcen clear a signal for me to ground base in a few moments his assistants voice replied done the signals open channel two the director pushed another button and a tone code sounded over the speaker in the wedge and then a ladys voice said comcen gm ground base can i help you this is director zanderson get me head of security this is urgent thank you said the lilting voice he might have been ordering flowers a second later he was talking to head of security for the gm ground base he diplomatically described the situation and ordered the man to apprehend the two suspects and hold them his daughter he said was not to be touched he was to be notified as soon as they had been taken into custody the security chief offered his assurances of a clean and professional grab promising his utmost cooperation and that of his men and asked for details of the craft and its eta it should arrive at five oclock this afternoon your time thats fourteen hundred gmt ill notify you personally as soon as they are safely in hand director dont worry about a thing thanks chief tatum ill be waiting for your call hockings henchmen were waiting when he returned from his talk with zanderson i am an absolute genius crowed hocking as he swept into the chamber i was magnificent he bought it inquired tickler wringing his hands he took the bait like the big fish he is smirked hocking ah ha he laughed suddenly you should have been there it was priceless i have him convinced that they have kidnapped his precious daughter hes putty in our hands gentlemen when the time comes hell follow like a lamb tickler allowed himself a smile at their good fortune he turned to millen who beamed back at him hocking continued of course im not for a moment forgetting your failure in this matter but i will excuse it this time it seems to have brought about a turn of events even better than we could have hoped for now they are the ones with the gm ground force on their tails not us and zanderson is so confused he doesnt know what to believe their stealing that landing pod clinched it whats next asked tickler he was becoming caught up in his masters contagious good cheer we get ready to move out there wont be much time well have to strike and strike fast ground security has been notified but if we can find out where they intend to land we may be able to save ourselves a lot of trouble i will return to zandersons office to waiti dont want to let him out of my sight ill be there if any calls come through what about kalnikov asked kurt wont he talk he can say anything he chooses it wont matter i was able to convince zanderson that the taser belonged to reston and that kalnikov was in on the conspiracy he accidentally got shot by his own side and left behind whatever he says will be assumed to be a lie besides williams has him wetsheeted in one of his wards no one will be seeing him for some time then this is it the takeover has begun thats what ive been telling you gentlemen very soon now the station will be ours adjani nursed the landing pod along a precision course which allowed for no margin of error the fuel cells of the small craft had not been designed for extended flight but since they had no intention of returning to the station adjani figured with the help of the onboard navigation computer that there would be enough to get them down safely and with some speed spence and ari were trusting that he was right they will undoubtedly be waiting for us said spence theres no telling what hocking has been up to its four hours since we left theyve had time for almost anything i think we ought to call my father said ari we could let him know were okay and warn him about hocking and the others he could also get us landing clearance at the base i dont think it will be safe to land at that base well have to choose an alternate landing spot adjani bent over the computer monitor and tapped the keyboard quickly we can land anywhere within a radius of twentyfive kilometers from the base if we want to be on the safe side otherwise just pick your spot and ill do my best to put her down anywhere you say in other words you dont know where were going to land do you its a shot in the dark i wouldnt say that at all were safer in here than in the shuttle its just that the computer memory isnt charged with coordinates for landing in the continental usa oh said spence so what do we do i could put us into orbitwed have time to pick out a place on our first couple of passes before our orbit started to decay i take it big cities are out not at all this machine was designed to land almost anywhere we just wont have enough fuel to be picky anyway we wouldnt want to come down in pittsburgh rushhour traffic why what are you thinking its just that since wed planned to go to boston anyway why not try boston metro land on one of the old abandoned airstrips theyre running mostly rocketjets out of there now anyway daddy could get us clearance im positive put in ari he could get us our coordinates too while hes at it why didnt i think of that mused adjani you two arent the only ones with brains you know ari said with a flip of her head precisely adjani fiddled with the comcen pac and in a few moments raised the signal channel for the space station he matched the landing pods signal and then sent the id code a second later the clear calm tones of a comcen operator rang out hello daddy ari chirped as soon as the call had been put through to his office ari darling are you all right there was the concern of a distraught parent in the directors voice im fine daddy really i am you probably know all the details by now i know whats been going on my dear believe me ive taken steps to remedy the situation spence and adjani exchanged questioning glances perhaps tickler and millen had been caught the director continued it must have been awful for you my dear im fine dont worry about me where are they taking you do you know were going to try to set down at boston metro can you get us clearance we also need the coordinates daddy i think if you can get those two things for us nothing will go wrong ill do anything you ask dearest anything there was a long pause are they treating you all right of course dont be silly were going to see mother daddy are you still there another long pause ensued and then the director said in a voice shaken or surprised im here why ari its really too complicated to explain right now but ill call you when were through dont worry itll be all right just promise me you wont get your blood pressure up i promise dear and ill have the clearance and coordinates transmitted as soon as possible thanks she glanced at spence and adjani and then said i guess thats all for now ill call you after weve seen mother and ill tell you all about it ill wait for your call dear ari said goodbye to her father and turned to the others he didnt sound too good hes terribly worried i can tell he didnt even ask about either of you i suppose id worry too if my daughter was galloping all over the galaxy shooting it out with illtempered ruffians of course hes worried you know said adjani slowly i think he thought we had kidnapped you what makes you say that ari laughed he would never believe such a thing how could he how was that asked director zanderson perfect replied hocking you were perfect very convincing i guess ill call ground security and have them picked up at boston metro not so fast i have a better plan director i believe ill go down and apprehend them myself you but why not tut director i assume you would rather keep this thing as quiet as possible with your daughter involved you must consider the effect of such publicity i dont trust you hocking then come with me director yes thats splendid well go together to one wh had endured the artificial interiors of gotham and had left his footprints in the rockstrewn red dust of mars the sparkling white mansion with its threestory white columns and its red brick wall joining the white gravel drive across a lawn of smoothshaved green grass looked to spence inexpressibly old almost medieval holyoke haven only shouting distance from the sea had not changed at all in three hundred years once the home of a wealthy owner of sailing ships it now sheltered as a safe harborage the troubled souls who roamed its corridors and muttered along its hedgerows spence was surprised there was no fence they dont need one explained ari the patients here are very well looked after each one has an attendant with them virtually every minute of the day they are very exclusive they dont take violent or dangerous patients he would have been further surprised to learn that those stately walls housed the relatives of fine old families kings of commerce and politiciansweird sisters whose presence in public would have proven embarrassing and perhaps unsafe they walked quietly down cool hallways after registering at a small antique desk with a kindly elderly lady who wore a large purple orchid pinned neatly to her pink uniform your mother will be so glad to see you ari and your gentlemen friends too the old woman sent them off with a light flutter of her hands as if to cookies and milk in the parlor spence found the juxtaposition of the grand manner of the place against the grim insanity of its patients a little hard to bear he was haunted by the feeling that he had been and for all he knew still was very close to taking up permanent residence in such a place still it was far from the snake pits of fifty or a hundred years ago with a morbid interest he found himself reconnoitering the asylum with the air of a valueconscious consumer and feeling a little like a potential lodger on a rental tour then they were standing before a wooden door and ari was knocking gently the door opened and a round smiling face peeked out ari how good to see you the nurse glanced beyond her to the two young men youve come to see your mother of course of course belinda id like you to meet my friends she introduced spence and adjani and said is mother up to a visit shes been asking about you today the nurse opened the door wider and ushered them in her eyes round with animated disbelief she said and here you are i never would have believed it she said youd comeand here you are thank you belinda you may leave us ill call you when were finished i was just about to take her for a walk on the lawn perhaps you would like to do that with her yes well chat first and then a walk would be just the thing thank you the attendant clearly wanted to linger nearby but ari adroitly pushed her out of the room and closed the door so they would have privacy mother ari crept close to the old red chair the woman sitting in it had not so much as glanced at them all the time they had stood at the door now she turned toward them for the first time spence recognized the mother of his sweetheart they were as alike as mother and daughter could be as close as lookalike sisters the woman was trim and youthful though her hair had faded to a darker blonde and tiny lines creased the corners of her eyes and mouth her eyes were just as blue as aris but they were different wary furtive somehow sly this is what shocked him they were the eyes of a wild and hunted creature ari youve come oh at last youve come did you get my letter the woman reached out her hands and ari stepped in and hugged her mother it could have been a normal homecoming spence turned away and looked out the wide open french doors onto the placid lawn outside i didnt get your letter mother did you write me a letter i did she shook her head fiercely and then looked puzzled at least i think i did didnt i it doesnt matter im here now what did you want to tell me tell you what did you want to tell me in your letter ari spoke to the woman in calm patient tones as if she were a child a shy apprehensive child spence began to feel that their trip had been for nothing he could not imagine they would get any useful information how nice you look darling how pretty you are im going to make you a beautiful new dress youd like that of course id love it what did you want to tell me in the letter about the dream thief ari at this spence faced around at once maybe they would discover something after all what about the dream thief mother adjani who had been hanging back came to stand beside spence between the woman and the french doors who are these men do they work for him she shuddered as she said the word clearly she referred to the dream thief no theyre friends of mine but they want to know about the dream thief they want to know about him so they can stop him you would like that wouldnt you mother no one can stop him cried the woman its too late too late he is too powerful he was here you know he came to see me she suddenly adopted a sly conspiratorial tone he was here dream thief yes he came to see me and he said he would come back what did he wish to see you about to give me a present a beautiful little present where is the present i dont see it ari looked around the room he will bring it when he comes back he said he would i must wait and do as he says when was the dream thief here mrs zanderson asked spence i dont know you young man the woman replied as if spence were a stranger who had accosted her on the street this is spencer reston mother my friend remember and this is adjani hes my friend too theyve come to see you to ask you some questions the woman looked at them closely as if she wanted to remember them in order to describe them later im glad to know you gentlemen she offered her hand both men took it in turn how nice to meet you mrs zanderson said adjani there was not the slightest trace of condescension in his manner could you tell us about the dream thief id very much like to know slowly she came to herself as out of a daydream oh she sighed softly have i been carrying on again no mother replied ari her mother reached up and patted her hand absently i hope i havent embarassed you in front of your friends she smiled ruefully nonsense said spence wed like to help you if we can i wish i could believe that id very much like to be helped suppose you just tell us what you know about the dream thief adjani spoke normally but he seemed to radiate a warmth and spence thought a love which drew the woman out and settled her mind he had never witnessed anything like it adjanis influence was magical it was many years ago now the bright blue eyes held a faraway look as memory came flooding back across the years i was a little girl my father was a professor very stern very upright he was there was just me and my mother i used to play outside every day with the children we lived way up in the mountains maybe seventyfive miles from the city in a tiny village called rangpo it was beautiful there the seminary was an old monastery i think it had the most beautiful courtyards and gardens my father taught there and we had a little house nearby i can still see the little purple wildflowers that grew along the road passion flowers we called them i dont know what they were and safflowersred and yellow all over the hillside it was lovely there was an ancient palace nearby we used to go sometimes to look at it but only from a distance you couldnt go there it was too dangerous the bridge was very old and decrepit i used to wonder what kind of treasures lay inside it there was certain to be gold and rubiesall the children said so but they said the palace was guarded by the demons of the dream thief and they watched over the treasure and whoever dared to touch it would be stricken down dead one time i asked my father about the demons he said it was just backward superstition the kind we had come to wipe out but none of us ever went to the castle or even near it we were too afraid spence noticed that the womans voice had become softer higher she was experiencing her childhood again ari in rapt attention sat at her side with her hand clasped in her mothers very possibly she had never heard the story of her mothers childhood before but you did go there didnt you mrs zanderson adjani said the woman nodded yes but i never told anyone about it i was afraid her eyes showed the depths of that old fear what happened it was a few days after my twelfth birthday my mother told me that i was a young lady now and that i could start making up my own mind about things i decided that i wanted to go look inside the castle and see the treasure father had said there were no demons so i went i was grownup so i didnt tell anyone the castle was a long way by the time i got there it was late afternoon the shadows of the mountains were creeping into the valleys i went across the bridge and it held me up i went up to the castle and looked through the holes in the gates there was nothing there the courtyards were empty and full of dried leaves the stones were all mosscovered and rotting away it looked as if no one had ever lived there i began to believe that there were demonsi never really stopped believing in them despite what my father said i heard something strange like singing only not like any singing i have ever heard before coming from one of the buildings inside the walls it grew louder and i waited to see if someone would come i hid behind a bush outside the gates but no one came i could not get in the castlethe gates were locked and the walls were too high anyway i dont think i really wanted to go in at all i just wanted to look inside and see what i might see but i waited until the music stopped and when nothing else happened i started to leave i did not want to be out alone in the hills after dark that was when the dream thief came they said he was an evil god and a powerful one my father said there was only one god and he was love but my friends said that he was only for the christians so i started back i started to run and i ran toward the bridge the shadows had grown long across the path and i stepped into a hole and fell down twisting my leg it was not a bad injury it just hurt i sat down in the path and rubbed my leg knowing i would have to hurry back and hoping my leg would not hurt too much as i was sitting there i heard somethingnot music this time but something else a strange sound it came from the castle and it sounded like a great bird rustling to flight yet it crackled like fire i looked back over my shoulder to the castle and then i saw him the dream thief he was standing outside the gates and he was looking at me he was very thin and tall and he had long arms he turned his head and he saw me and i looked at his two great yellow eyes he didnt move or come near me but i could feel him calling to me i could feel it inside my head i dont know how this was but i heard him even though he did not say a word mrs zandersons voice had become a whisper then behind him i saw three great black thingsall hunched up like giant insects but they had wings folded over their bodies and they came out from the castle to stand beside the dream thief i felt him speak to them but i could not understand what he said it was just a feeling i got that he was talking to them two of them turned away and flew off and the other one came toward me i knew then that he meant to come and get me i jumped up and started to run i reached the bridge and without even stopping to think dashed across it i found the path on the other side and ran as fast as i could i looked back over my shoulder and the demon stood on the far side i kept running and when i looked back again he wasnt there i thought hed gone away but her voice pinched off suddenly what happened then mrs zanderson its all right we wont punish you said adjani he spoke as one would to a child who feared the wrath of a parent for some imagined transgression you can tell us what happened the womans eyes had gone empty she was no longer in the room with them she was reliving the past her face suddenly twisted into a contorted mask of terror her hands became claws which clutched the arms of her chair her body rigid when she spoke again it was a trembling whisper the others had to lean close to hear the words they held their breath a shadow came over me and i looked up and saw the most hideous faceright above me the demon stretched out his wings over me and reached for me i felt his hands tear at me as he scooped me up from the ground he clutched me in his armsthey were hard and brittle like insect arms his wings buzzed as he flew this was the sound i had heard coming from the castle he carried me back to the dream thief and put me down on the ground i was too scared to scream i scarcely knew what was happening the dream thief reached out a hand and touched me on the head and then all went black i dont remember anything at all just his hand reaching for me his fingers touching me the next thing i knew i was lying in the road just outside the town not far from where we lived i dont know how i got there but the sun was almost down it was a red glowing sunset and the whole sky burned red and orange as if it was on fire i got up and ran home and never said a word about what had happened to anyone i really could not remember it very well anyway not to tell about it just sometimes in my dreams it would come back to me and sometimes i would feel the dream thief trying to call to mei would feel his voice inside me no words at all just a feeling and thoughts i knew were not my own but i never went back about a week later i got sick and the fever came on me i could feel myself changing through the sickness i was a different girl but i kept it to myself and never told anyone about the changes i felt inside i stopped playing with the other children i stayed in my room and locked the door so the dream thief couldnt get me i had bad dreams and couldnt sleep sometimes for several nights and then during one of my fevers i slipped into a coma and slept for a long time although it didnt seem very long to me when i opened my eyes again i had forgotten all about the dream thief and his demons it was like it never happenedonly i knew it did inside i knew it although i could not remember it or think about it i just knew that something was theredeep in my mind deeper than any other memory i didnt get sick any more after a while we went home to america and i tried to forget all about living in india i tried to block it out of my mind when she finished the room was silent as a tomb no one moved or breathed no one wanted to break the spell that had grown but spence had a question that needed asking something the woman had said triggered an image in his mind mrs zanderson what was the castle like can you describe it yes she replied speaking in the same faraway voice as one in a trance it was a strange castle but it had a pretty name kalitiri it had a high stone wall which kind of weaved back and forth not straight inside the walls i couldnt see the main building very well but there were two large domes round like globes and a tower thin and tapering it was very tall the gates were wooden but old the wood was black and scarred as if by fire or battle i dont remember any more spence only nodded thank you that has helped me very much mrs zanderson seemed to come to herself then she slumped back in her chair and her head fell forward a long sigh came from her lips and she raised a shaking hand and rubbed her face she looked around at the three visitors and smiled wanly oh are you still here ari were still here mother youve been telling us about your girlhood in india oh i dont remember i hope i didnt ramble on you didnt let me ramble on did you no no i only hope we havent tired you out aris mother looked as if she could fall asleep at any moment her face was drained of color and her lids drooped heavily over her eyes adjani stood and motioned to spence ari well take a little walk out on the lawn you can be alone with your mother and join us when youre ready the two men left through the french doors and walked out onto the green expanse when they had moved away from the building a short distance spence touched adjani on the arm did you hear did you hear what she said he gripped adjanis arm hard in his excitement ive seen itthe castlein my dream it exists shes been there she knows its real adjani nodded and the dream thief adjani shes seen him too have you seen him adjani regarded him closely spence hesitated well theres something strange about that a womans scream cut him off ari cried spence come on the two raced back across the lawn and into the room it appeared nothing had happened mrs zanderson still sat in her chair but her head fell to one side and she breathed deeply and evenly she was sound asleep ari was nowhere in sight spence did not stop to look around he dashed through the room and into the corridor beyond he looked both ways up and down the long hallway but saw only a woman with a suitcase creeping along the far side of the wall he went to her did you see anyone run from this room he pointed to the room he had just come from the woman looked at him with wide unseeing eyes he knew then that his question was hopeless is the ship coming i must hurry to meet it i must not be late he ran to the entrance and asked the receptionist if she had seen anything no she told him no one has come in since your party what about before no one all day he raced back along the corridor to mrs zandersons room he looked in the open doors of the rooms he passed and saw the rooms were empty one door was closed he grabbed the doorknob and burst into the room an elderly lady turned to regard him with a motherly smile she held a potted plant in her hands and caressed the plants shiny leaves she was not wearing a stitch of clothing embarrassed he quickly closed the door and returned to where adjani was waiting for him i cant find her spence puffed no one has seen her you wont find her shes gone adjani held out his hand and spence saw a small black objecta little stone carving they meant for us to find this it is a clue to where they are taking her what is it im not sure but i know who can tell usmy father spence mystified looked at the carving and back at adjani the day seemed very dark and cold as if the sun had been blanketed in the sky he felt a sharp sting of fear pierce him like an icy chill weve got to find her adjani before anything happens to her weve got to find her the trip to london from boston left spence nervous irritable and upset heat fatigue and worry joined forces to make him even more uncomfortable than he already was on top of everything else he had a headache that wouldnt quit his head throbbed every time he moved and drummed with a steady pulsing rhythm of dull pain in short he was miserable the last twentyfour hours were a blurred scramble he and adjani had chased over half of metropolitan boston to catch a plane to london to meet adjanis parents and dine with them adjanis mother had insisted on fixing her son and his friend a meal they would both remember although neither one professed to being at all hungry they ate a chicken pilau which contained okra and some other vegetable spence could not identify over saffron rice a cool yogurt and cucumber sauce helped soothe the fire of the curry fish baked in tents of paper and served with dill peanuts and chutney highlighted the meal there were stacks of chapatis the traditional flat bread of india and endless cups of sweet milk tea spence enjoyed the meal enormously and ate his share with no additional urging after his first polite nibblings following dinner adjanis father took the two aside into his study the rajwandhis lived in spare almost ascetic style in a small four room apartment in an old building near the university the room which housed the professors library and served as a den when need occasioned it bore the stamp of a meticulous scholar books lined shelves floor to ceiling a small desk covered with a dyed yellow and green cotton cloth sat in one corner with papers stacked squarely in the center next to a great open dictionary a single large window looked out upon a dusky cityscape where street lights began to twinkle as stars in a firmament of gray cement professor chetti as his students affectionately called him settled into an armchair and waved spence and adjani to seats on either side facing him looking somewhat out of character he took up a pipe and filled it with tobacco and lit it savoring the first few puffs in silence it is my english vice he said at last with a happy chuckle he fished in his pocket and brought out the curiously carved stone charm adjani had found in mrs zandersons room you wish to know what this is he i will tell you it is very interesting i have not seen one of these in many years and never outside a museum he got up and walked to one of his bookshelves and scanned the rows of books for a moment he drew out a book and returned to his seat he thumbed the pages of the book and smoked his pipe and then said ah he turned the book around and offered it to them you see here he pointed to a picture on one of the pages spence looked at the picture and saw a carving of the exact figure adjani had found it was of smooth black stone and looked like a man with the body of an insect the one in the book had a tail like a snake and wings partly outstretched its arms were drawn up over its head and it held a circular object in its hands what is it asked spence it is an arca an icon a charm you might say answered the professor in many places in india it is believed that one keeps a demon away by wearing a charm such as this representing an even greater demon fighting fire with fire said adjani yes in a way this is a naga a snake spirit one of the older of the demons and this one is itself very old look at the fine detail you can see the eyes and eyelids the mouth and nostrils even though it is very small even the scales of the tail are individually carved yes this one is very old later carvings are simpler more stylized he turned it over in his hands regarding it with keen scrutiny where did you get it it was found in the room of a friend said adjani vaguely i seeyou do not wish me to know chetti shrugged all right but whatever you do dont lose this it is a very valuable piece tell us about the nagas suggested spence the scholars words had struck a responsive chord in him chetti settled back in his chair and laced his fingers together i would happily tell you all i know the problem is where to start it is a very long confusing story but i will try to make it understandable he launched in at once india is an ancient country of years beyond counting the peculiar cultures of many peoples have mingled together over time like the waters of streams flowing to a central river and have created what is india today but it is still possible to take short trips back along some of these tributaries although many of them are lost to us forever such are the nagas little is known now about where the belief came from it may have originated almost spontaneously among many of the hill tribes of northern india the mountains of the himalaya were looked upon by these ancient people as the homes of gods and demons and other strange beings they believed that in the high hills and among the snowcapped mountain peaks magic cities lay hidden from mortal eyes the gods lived in these cities and went about their own business for the most part staying away from men there were three main groups the nagas or snake spirits dwelt in an underground city called bhogavati and there guarded great treasures they were usually represented as at least half human they seemed to have special protective powers possibly owing to their function as guardians then there were the vidyadharas or heavenly magicians these created the magic cites of the high himalayas and could fly through the air and transform themselves at will little is known about them they had little to do with men but some were more approachable by human beings they were called the rsis or seers these were legendary wise men some say they were at one time mortals who became so wise that they were translated into heaven to become gods other accounts state that they were leaders of the vidyadharas who could be petitioned by men in times of trouble or who appeared during special times set aside for the purpose of teaching or instructing men in better ways of living there have been many rsis the word now applies to anyone who is thought to possess great powers of magic or psychic ability but the original seven rsis are thought to be the very ancestors of all the gods and men too they are mentioned by name marici atri angiras pulastya pulaha kratu and vasistha they came from heaven and built the magic cities to live in because they liked the earth having watched it from afar the leader of the wise ones was a rsi called brasputi he is a strange figure in the old legendsalmost never represented in carvings or painting and then in an odd misshapen way long arms and threefingered hands it was he who led the gods to the high mountainsthey came in the fantastic vimana that is their aerial carand who founded the philosophy of their civilization that is to say he handed down the laws of government among the gods he is the only one to be identified by a sign in the skyone of the planets probably jupiter or mars and brasputi it is who rules the demons of the hills although this was added perhaps much later spence sat spellbound as adjanis father talked the names fell to his ear with an exotic otherworldy ring he visualized a time back in the dim and misty past of a newborn world where these beings walked and held commerce with men who worshiped them as gods but there was also a strong suggestion of something else in his mind which chettis words called up from his own more recent past whats the matter asked adjani studying his friend closely you look like youve seen a ghost not a ghosta god spence shook himself out of his thought the next instant he was standing before them eyes burning with excitement it fits it all fits how could i have missed it missed what adjani i have something to tell you if i had told you sooner maybe we wouldnt be in this mess right now i havent told you all that happened to me on mars oh theres more adjani you havent heard the half of it kalitri spence felt as if he had entered the land that time forgot india apart from the glassy modern cities of the western coast and southern interior was largely a country where poverty and population had united to halt the wheels of progress and even rock them backward a few paces it was a land retreating back into the pastalmost as fast as the rest of the world advanced spence found the contrast between the crumbling cities and ragged people and his own ultraadvanced space station too hard to reconcile the foreignness astounded him numbed him he resented it resented the screaming populace that reeked of stale sweat urine and other basic human smells he resented their poverty and blamed them for their lack although intellectually he admitted that one could not blame the patient for the effects of his disease still his first reaction was a smoldering malice against a people who could allow themselves to sink so far in this reaction he was no different from the millions who had gone before him and millions more who still held the blight of india against india herself the rocketplane ride into calcutta had not prepared him for the scene that would greet him upon landing he had felt the thrust of the rocket engines and endured the gforces of takeoff the plane rose to its peak altitude within ten minutes and began its gliding descent out of the small round window he saw the blueblack sky devoid of clouds above him and the crisp crescent curve of the earths turquoise horizon he had placed his palm against the window and felt the heat from the friction of the air moving over the skin of the plane then they dropped out of the sky in the steep landing glide to roll to a stop outside a skyport like any other skyport the world over upon emerging from the boarding tube the shock of india hit him hard one moment spence had been comfortable amid familiar surroundings the next plunged into a churning mass of backward humanity the effect could not have been more startling if he stepped out of a time machine into the stone age what now he asked adjani in a bewildered tone are you all right my friend no but ill get used to it spence stared dully at the chaos around himdiminutive travelers scurried like cockroaches all over the dilapidated terminal the din was a muffled roar follow me instructed adjani he began plowing through the crush as a man wading through floodwaters ill get us out here in one piece i hope said spence his remark was lost in the havoc adjani hailed a rickshaw outside the terminal and bundled spence into it he yelled something unintelligible to the driver and with a creak and a sway and a clang of a bell they were off worming through the snarled traffic around the skyport if spences first glimpse of india shocked him the view from the rickshaw crawling along the rutted streets sickened him everywhere he looked he saw people an ocean of people dirty poor ragged flybitten naked staring grasping he turned his eyes from one dismal scene only to witness another still more miserable and there were animals white and brown cattle little more than ambulating bags of bones covered with hide roamed among the streets horses their large heads bobbing on bony necks pulled rude carts dogs yapping endlessly dashed between the wheels of careening vehicles crows and other birdseven vultureswatched the stinking pavements for any morsel to fall swooping down in an instant to seize the scrap in their beaks and make off with it before some dog or beggar could grab it at the corners of large intersections were piled great heaps of refuse and garbage containing every kind of filth imaginable and at least forty kinds of pestilence thought spence on these dung heaps it was commonplace to see a dozen or so of the populace defecating or relieving their bladders while keeping the rats at bay with flailing sticks once they saw a huge wagon piled high with carcasses of cattle and horsesthe dead scooped off the streets and destined for the rendering plant they passed by a railroad depot where nuns had set up a relief station for mothers with babies spence could see the sisters white scarves moving among a sea of black heads that threatened to overwhelm their feeble effort the cries of starving babies filled the air everywhere along the road on traffic islandsevery square centimeter of spacetrash huts were erected bamboo sticks for a framework covered with rags bricks pulled up from the street or from a nearby wall established a fireplace other dwellings consisted of nothing more than a grimy scrap of cloth or blanket with stones to hold down the corners on such a scrap a whole family might be encamped beside gutters running with raw sewage billboards depicting smart welldressed indians enjoying soft drinks or cigarettes or wearing the latest fashion creations sheltered masses of naked homeless who lay wrapped in rags beneath their cheerful slogans roving throngs of orphaned children ran after the buses and wagons and rickshaws chanting for coins or food or castoff objects the stench of all thisthe cooking rotting festering putrefyinghung over the city like a malodorous cloud reeking in the hot sun to spence it smelled like death the city of dreadful night said adjani look around you my friend you will never forget it no one who comes here ever does spence did look around him he could not help but look it seemed to him that he had left the world behind and descended into hell its a nightmare said spence they passed on through the murky air of calcuttas human quagmire past slums and openair mortuaries with corpses stacked like cordwood awaiting cremation past children bathing in the gutters past beggars collapsed on their haunches in the middle of busy streets past crumbling facades of oncestately buildings blackened by the cooking fires of the refugees of the streets past rusting hulks of old automobiles turned into brothels past squalid unwashed infested decaying habitations of meanest description spence felt that he had contracted some cancerous disease in his soul and would never be clean again he shut his eyes and lay back in his seat but he could not cut out the cries of misery around him they finally rocked to a stop outside a tumbledown tarnished building in the center of a commercial district spence surveyed the rotting structure its yellow paint flaking off in great patches like skin off a leper whats this asked spence the long tiring ride had madehim surly dr gitas home remember adjani jumped out of the taxi and spoke to the driver offering him coins and asking him questions in a rapid babble of hindi come on he called motioning for spence to follow as he strode into the disintegrating building spence followed without attending to his steps and walked into a pile of cow manure laying on the sidewalk he heard a snicker and scowled in the direction of the sound a swift movement caught his eye but he heard only the echo of small feet patter away fuming he cleaned his boot off as well as he could and made to enter the building just as he was about to disappear into the darkened interior a loud voice boomed out above him he looked up to see a dark brown face leaning out an upper window and beaming merrily down on him like an oriental sun a pudgy little hand waved a cheery greeting namastey spencer reston welcome to india despite the unpromising exterior and the decrepit stairs swarming with cockroaches and mice where a family of squatters had taken up residence dr sundar gitas rooms were clean and fresh and fairly gleamed with the shining presence of the little man who inhabited themalong with his wife and five daughters spence had expected a dingy grimecaked hovel of the kind he had seen on his trip through the decaying city in his foul mood he was a little disappointed to find the good doctors rooms light and airy he almost grumbled at the sight of freshcut flowers in a delicate handpainted vase which brightened the living room sit down my guests please sit we will drink tea the round man said as spence entered a square room which was dominated by a wide bed now you can come out called sundar and turning to his guests explained they have been waiting all day to meet you they have never seen visitors from america before there was a titter of female voices and a bead curtain parted and a parade of darkeyed beauties came into the room each one bearing a small tray with something to eat upon it they lined up in stairstep fashion before their guests and gita introduced his family this is indira my wife he said and my daughters sudhana premila moti chanti and baki as he called their names each bowed demurely and stepped forward with their trays spence soon had a plate full of sesame cakes date cookies and rice balls balanced precariously on the arm of his low bamboo chair while he held a hot cup of jasmine tea first in one hand and then the other their service completed the women disappeared into the next room where spence could hear their chippering whispers dr sundar gita was quite dark skinned much darker than adjani he was short coming only to spences shoulder and almost as broad as he was tall his full round face shone with constant good cheer as if he were lit from within by a warm inner glow his plump form was wrapped in an ivorycolored muslin suit and as if to emphasize his overall rotund shape a bulbous blue turban topped him off as spence was studying him there came a loud shout from outside in the street below dr gita put down his cup and saucer and trotted to the window and leaned out a quick conversation took place which ended with the doctor shouting no patients today come back tomorrow he returned to his guests with a apologetic smile a linguist must make a living he explained i am also the local dentist spence sipped the rest of the tea and placed his cup on the floor he felt a light tickle at his wrist and something cool and polished pressed against the inside of his hand he looked down and saw an enormous snake curled beside his chair the great gray and brown speckled creature was pushing its wide angular head into his hand ahk spence yelped jerking his hand away rikki you naughty girl come away from there and stop pestering our guests gita gave the snake an exasperated look and the reptile slowly uncoiled itself and slithered silently away behind spences chair leaving him with a prickly queasy sort of feeling he would almost have preferred having it beside his chair there at least he could have kept an eye on it now he did not know when it might jump out at him again rats dr gita was saying they are such a problem in the city but rikki is a remarkable hunter they do not bother me at all dr gita adjani began we are grateful that please i am only gita among you learned men and the pleasure is mine when your message came last night i was very much excited to hear of your visit and of course i will help in any way i can your father has been my dear friend all these many years adjani i remember our school days fondly now he spread his short hands on his round thigh what brings you to calcutta and to my humble home i think i will let spence tell you his story first and then will explain gita turned inquisitive black eyes upon his guest and nodded settling himself with a sigh onto the wide bed this piece of furniture took up fully a third of the room spence realized that the whole family probably slept in that bed what i am about to tell you may sound a bitwell incredible but i assure you it is true every word and i ask that what i say will never be repeated outside this room spence began nervously may i have your promise on that gita touched his forehead and nodded with an oriental bow of submission spence could see the excitement mirrored in the black eyes though his listeners face had lost all expression taking a deep breath spence began his tale he told once again of his dreams of his wandering lost into the deadly sandstorm on mars and his discovery of the tunnels leading ultimately to the city of tso he told of his thirst and hungerthis made his listener squirmand of the nightmarish illness he described the oblong box and his manipulation of the controls the strange sounds and sights that came from it and lastly his meeting with kyr the martian and all the wonderful things he had seen and heard when spence finished an hour had elapsed like the blink of an eye gita sat as one in a trance spellbound by the magic of his story truly fantastic gita said at last breaking the fragile silence which had enveloped the room i have never heard anything like it incredible he turned to adjani you said i would be amazed but that is not the half of it i am astonished beyond words after another long silence in which gita sat staring at spence and nodding muttering under his breath he leaned forward and said now then that is but half a tale remarkable though it is you did not travel halfway around the world to tell me that what is it you require of me no sooner had spence and adjani stepped out onto the lawn than a knock sounded at the door thinking it was the nurse ari had gone to tell her that her mother was a little tired and would not be coming down to lunch just yet as she opened the door she turned back into the room saying you take a little rest mother ill be back in a moment the next thing she knew she was jerked through the doorway an arm shot around her neck and a hand covered her mouthso quickly she did not even have time to scream dont struggle dont make a sound a voice whispered harshly in her ear we are going to walk down the hall if you try to escape you will be hurt with that she was dragged away another figure pushed past them and she recognized the mans pinched features and rounded shoulders as belonging to spences assistant tickler when they reached the end of the corridor they paused and turned to tickler who was still standing in the doorway to her mothers room some signal must have passed between the two men because tickler reached into his pocket and took out something which he tossed into the room he then closed the door and came running up the hall toward them ari was shoved out a side entrance marked with a red emergency exit only sign as the door swung open she heard a woman screamit might have been her mother it seemed to come from that end of the hall then she was hustled into the back seat of a latemodel triwheel which sped off with the man she now recognized as kurt millen behind the wheel she yelled and scratched at the windows end then at tickler sitting beside her in the cramped backseat you can scream all you want to it really wont do you any good said tickler no one can hear you now you might as well save your strength we have a long trip ahead of us aris eyes were blue fire she threw herself forward over the seat and tried to jerk the steering wheel from the driver t lurched to one side and skidded in the white gravel of the drive kurt swore and cuffed her with the back of his hand keep her back there shell kill us all tickler pulled her back into her seat and brought out a taser ari looked at the gun and slumped back thats better d tickler i assure you i will use this if there is another outburst i demand to know where you are taking me were taking you somewhere where you can talk to your father miss zanderson hes very worried about you worried about me why what have you been telling him nothing all that serious but you know how parents can get i wouldnt trouble myself over it theyll find me spence and adjani will know what happened theyll find me oh we hope so miss zanderson we hope they do indeed the sky glowed red with a gray angry look threatening rain before nightfall a chill shadowy dusk crept across the landcape as the car silently slid off the old highway and up a long narrow gravel drive lined with towering elm trees black in the failing light the angry sky and dark branches mirrored aris mood she seethed in a silent black rage someone was going to know how she felt and soon the car had passed up the regional headquarters of gm as well as every other opportunity of stopping within the city instead the driver had headed out on the expressway toward the country and hours later they were creeping up the road to an aging country house the house pale in the yellow beams of the cars headlights swung into view as the vehicle rounded a bend and pulled into a wide driveway a fallingdown barn loomed nearby the darkening sky showing through the spaces between its loose boards as through the ribs of a skeleton a light shone in a single window of the twostory frame house glowing behind a stained and tattered shade on the whole the scene which met aris eyes was best described as dismal but after riding in the car for the several long hours of their trip she was glad to get out no matter how bleak the surroundings she was careful not to let the relief she felt at out onto the crunchy gravel of the drive show in her face stepping she wanted to maintain a hard angry appearance or actionsis plan however was abandoned as soon as she set foot in the house daddy the next instant she was in his arms an he was hugging her as if she had been rescued from the sea after forty days in a lifeboat oh ari youre all right i was so worried about you she stepped back out of his embrace just what did you think had happened to me and what are we doing here her questions went unanswered for at that moment a large white ovoid object came gliding into the room it was a pneumochair and in it sat a sharpeyed skeleton of a man grimacing at them with a malicious twist of his thin lips so the wandering maiden has arrived i trust you had a pleasant trip ariadne yes you she shouted hands on hips in a show of defiance she turned quickly to her father who was wearing a sickly expression daddy who is this man ari please calm yourself her father placed a hand on her shoulder i demand to know what is going on here youre safe now thats all that matters dear safe i was safe before those two kidnapped me she threw an accusing finger at tickler and millen there must be some mistake daughter theres been a mistake all right daddy answer mewhats going on well go ahead said hocking tell her she has a right to know her father glanced dubiously at her and said mr hocking has been helping me rescue you i asked him to rescue me i didnt need rescuing for heavens sake daddy spence and adjani were not holding me we were escaping him she glared at tickler again they were trying to kidnap spence director zanderson seemed to shrink into himself somewhat he looked at hocking is that true answer me hockings lips twitched his eyes narrowed slyly it was clear he was savoring the moment fully well go on your daughters absolutely right its reston were after you just have the misfortune of being in a position of influence you might say director zandersons mouth dropped open im aghast youre more than that you old buffoon you are a hostage you cant do this mr wermeyer knows my whereabouts if im not back soon hell hell do nothing perhaps hell tell people youre vacationing or that youve embezzled the payrollit really doesnt matter you might say that from now on mr wermeyer takes his orders from me director zandersons face went gray ari scowled furiously and her eyes became blue lasers burning out at her captors hocking continued im afraid thats all the explanation we have time for i have made some traveling arrangements for us all come along please just then the old house was shaken by the vibration of a jet engine firing up and a low whine climbed to a scream hocking disappeared through the doorway tickler and millen followed pushing the zandersons before them out the back of the house where a small hoverjet was rolling across the grass in a clearing ringed with tall trees the plane turned and stopped a hatch popped open and steps were lowered the party boarded and the hatch resealed itself the whine of the engines increased and the plane rose vertically until it cleared the treetops then streaked off into the night supno kaa chor said adjani the afternoon light slanting in through the woven screen over the window cast a diamondstudded shadow on the walls gita sat nodding on the bed like a buddha he leaned forward and spence saw his dark face glistening with perspiration ah the dream thief whispered the little man it has been a long time since i heard of him we believe said adjani carefully choosing his words that he exists the dream thief is real gita did not burst out laughing nor did he show any outward signs of disbelieflike throwing up his hands or rolling on the floor which was what spence expected instead the linguist dentist flicked his quick eyes from adjani to spence and back again in an expression that said he was prepared to suspend all judgment until the facts were heard spence decided then and there that they had come to the right man he liked gita from that moment on i see the indian smoothed the folds of his trousers i suspect you are prepared to support that assertion we are said spence kyr told me that their race fled mars as soon as their technology made starships possible the martians went in search of new worlds to colonize finding none within our own solar system which could sustain life what about the earth i asked that too kyr said that they have known of earths lifesustaining capabilities for thousands of years some of them even visited our planet in times back but found it already inhabited by sentient creatures well on their way toward domination of the planet they elected not to interfere with human development their mere presence would have drastically changed the course of our history remarkable yes quite considering that they could have come and taken control of the entire planet at any time and no one could have stopped them i think they showed uncommon restraint it took them several thousand years to perfect interstellar travel meanwhile they lived in their underground cities and watched the wind and sand erode their planet to a dry red powder but what if all the martians did not leave the solar system as planned spence underscored his point with the thrust of his finger what if some of them came back to earth and established a colony here what form would it take how would their presence impact on the local civilization all very good questions spencer reston gita watched him through narrowed eyes his head thrown back do you have answers no answerssuppositions theories spence stood and began pacing as he talked the air of the himalayas is very thinmuch like the atmosphere of mars must have been before the martians left also those mountains are perhaps the most remote part of the whole planet except for the poles and ocean bottoms a colony settling there would never be bothered by curious homo sapiens but as the earth became more populated they perhaps would be noticed suppose also that as they came and went they encountered various tribes of human beings with which they developed some sort of commerce over time these interactions although rare would become the subject of speculation and wonderment among the primitive human beings they encountered and since the martians lived apart in places inaccessible to normal men and their ways were far above the ways of men they would be looked upon as godlike and their advanced technology would be regarded as magic we have seen this in the last century added adjani the aborigines of borneo considered airplanes magic and the white men who flew them were called gods any technology very far advanced beyond the accepted explanations of science is viewed as sorcery by the unenlightened true true replied gita most of my patients still believe my drill is a magic serpent whose bite is only too real spence stopped his pacing and came to stand in the center of the room in front of gita exactly you would expect all sorts of stories and legends to grow up regarding these gods and their civilizationand all with at least a grain of truth to them yes but after all these years surely you dont think there can be any left do you either they would have died out or become intermingled with human races or they would still be present and in such numbers that we would have known of them from long ago i cant answer that said spence i dont know but martians have incredibly long life spansthousands of our years suppose one is still alive and living here on earth i reawakened one of them what if another never slept gita sat very still for a long time only the rise and fall of his full round belly showed he was still with them physically then as one starting from a spell he said supno kaa chor eh the great thief of dreams still among us well why not it makes sense he fixed twinkling black eyes on spence i believe you what do you think of that spence wanted to hug the man what is more ill help you all i canthough i can see that will be far from easy good shouted spence thats terrific maybe not so terrific muttered gita before we are through you may well have reason to curse the day you ever set eyes on me olmstead packer sat with folded hands in the directors outer office he was well into his rehearsed speech when a tall stringbean of a fellow came out of the directors den im terribly sorry dr packer but the director has asked me to convey his regrets he has canceled your meeting for this afternoon i dont understand i talked with him only yesterday yes i know he was suddenly called away on an important matter he may be gone several days is there anything i can do until he returns wermeyer gazed officiously at the big physicist no i can wait olmstead turned to leave i only wish hed have let me know thats all accept my apologies he sometimes forgets these things the way he said it gave the impression that wermeyer was used to covering up for the director with a shrug packer walked out of the office this is strange he thought as he walked along gothams trafficways first adjani and spence disappearing and now the director a strong hunch told him the two incidents were connected but how as he walked along he became more and more determined to get to the bottom of things as he saw them and i know just where to start packer said to himself making an abrupt aboutface in the center of the trafficway kalnikov he arrived at the infirmary and stood tapping his fingers on the spotless white counter until the young woman looked up yes may i help you id like to see captain kalnikov please i understand hes still here yes of course the whiteclad nurse disappeared into another room behind the nurses station she was back in a moment looking at a chart of some sort im sorryshe smiled up at packerbut your friend cannot receive visitors at this time when then can i come back later im sorry we dont discuss our patients cases with outsiders she said packer felt a touch of frost in the air youll have to ask the doctor bring the doctor said packer flatly he was starting to resent the womans tone im sorry hes not in at the moment she gave him an icy smile was there anything else packer increased his drumming on the counter no youve been a world of help he said and stepped away from the station he walked to the door and then paused his hand reached out for the access plate but he suddenly grabbed his side and moaned oh no packer groaned help he toppled to the floor in a heap whats wrong cried the nurse rushing out from behind the counter are you having an attack its my stomach wheezed packer he squeezed his eyes up and contorted his face oww help me well have to get you off the floor said the nurse can you get up i think so panted packer oww he grabbed his middle and rolled on the floor there there easy now well get you into bed and get some tests started youll be all right she laid a hand on his forehead youre not feverish thats a good sign shall we try it again she put her hands under his shoulders and rolled him up into a sitting position with some effort they got him back up on his feet where he swayed precariously and moaned at intervals like a wounded bull moose she led him into the next room containing three beds and packer dropped into the first one dont move ill be right back the nurse told him and ran out of the room packer waited until the door slid shut again and jumped up out of the bed he approached the figure laying in the last bed kalnikov his voice was a harsh whisper can you hear me the man rolled over and opened his eyes slowly his stare was dull and glassy youre not kalnikov he told the man fearing he would be discovered packer jumped back into his own bed and waited for the nurse to return she came back in an instant and brought with her another nurse who carried a flat triangular object which she placed on his chest here put this under your tongue the second nurse instructed pulling a small probe from the instrument packer did as he was told and sighed now and again to add to the effectas if he did not expect to tarry much longer in this world and did not greatly mind leaving normal just as i thought next he felt a prick on the inside of his arm just above the wrist the nurse studied the machine on his chest and fiddled with a few knobs no trace of salmonella how do you feel now a little weak he said weakly but the pain is gone probably it was gas replied the first nurse ill bring the doctor in when he returns thank you youre both kind if i could just rest here for a moment im sure ill be feeling better in a little while of course the nurse packed up her instrument ill check back shortly she nodded to the first nurse she will stay with you for a few minutes youre too kind said packer benignly nonsense the nurse smiled prettily thats what were here for packer lay back and closed his eyes the nurse sat on the edge of the bed and looked at him this will never do thought packer ive got to get rid of her he belched loudly and allowed his eyelids to flutter open could i have an antacid he asked i think it was gas just as i thought sometimes it can be very painful yes i have a little heartburn now ill go get you something ill be right back as soon as the nurse left he was out of bed and heading for the door to the next ward the wards were clustered around the central nurses station and could be entered by interconnecting doors without going through the station the next ward was empty and the next contained three young women who stopped talking and giggled when he tiptoed through the third ward he looked into appeared empty at first too then he saw a lone figure in the far bed wrapped head to toe in a white sheet packer fearing the worst crept up to the bed and pulled back the sheet kalnikov lay flat on his back his face the color of putty kalnikov he shook the man by the shoulder there was no response he reached out a hand and placed it against the side of the pilots neck the body was warm and a pulse beat regularly in the throat he jostled the man again kalnikov can you hear me there was a slight murmur wake up kalnikov i have to talk to you wake up please packer glanced around quickly and went on trying to rouse the russian when he looked back kalnikovs eyes were half open and bore the glazed expression of one heavily sedated listen whispered packer i know you can hear me dont try to talk just blink your eyes if you understand me okay the pilot raised and lowered his eyelids slowly and heavily like the curtain at a russian opera all right here we go one blink for yes no blinks for no got it there came a slow blink packer thought he had never seen a slower one he wasted no time in getting right to the heart of his interrogation kalnikov now listen carefully rumor has it that you were jumped by reston and rajwandhiis that true no blink were you trying to help them one blink hmmm were you injured in the fight no blink what did you understand my question one blink then why are you here to keep you quiet one blink suddenly a voice called out behind packer a mans voice and he was angry just what do you think youre doing stop packer turned to see dr williams striding toward him behind him were two security guards with tasers in their hands the guards were frowning and the tasers were aimed at him they started out at first light spence had not slept at all well if not because of the hungry dogs that roamed in packs barking through the night it was the sudden chilling expectation that rikki the ratcatching python would mistake him for a rodent and strangle him he was up and ready to be off as soon as dawn broke over the ironblue smoky skyline of calcutta gita had been up long before dawn making arrangements and seeing to lastminute details he returned huffing excitedly and talking in gibberish his round dark moon face glowing with pride and good cheer i have secured our passage he announced it sounded as if they were attempting a hazardous ocean crossing how long will it take to reach darjeeling spence asked a week maybe two if it rains to spences look of amazement he hurriedly added you do not understand our roads in the rain they dissolve and run away they become rivers it would take you a long time to swim to darjeeling and all uphill gita scampered around his apartment throwing provisions and personal belongings into sacks and bundling them together one bundle for each he explained that way if we must walk part of the way it will not cause too much strain gita looked like a man who had lived most of his life investing in strainavoidance schemes and had become wealthy collecting the dividends is it really as bad as all that spence asked hardly keeping the naive bumpkin out of his voice traveling to darjeeling will be like traveling back in time gita warned he had arranged for them to join a group of merchants camped about half a mile from his house these men banded together to travel under the protection of armed soldiers hired to defend them against the goondas and dakoos bandits and outlaws living in the hill country they would be moving at a snails pace in rusty old gasburning cars over oncesmooth roads that had crumbled into little more than cattle tracks spence and the others set out walking the few blocks to the caravan in the early morning light tinged an oily brown from the smoke of ten million cooking fires throughout the city they stepped carefully over the sleeping bodies of calcuttas homeless who lined the streets like human pavement mangeridden dogs ran yapping poking here and there among mounds of putrefying garbage for morsels to eat a humpbacked cow stood gazing at them with deep melancholy over a dead body where two crows perched on a stiffened arm clucking their beaks in anticipation small children already awake and crying clung to their stillsleeping mothers becoming quiet as the men passed the buildings lining the streets wore iron bars at windows and doors though it seemed on the whole a useless gesture since by spences estimation anyone with little more than a strong resolve could have toppled them they looked so tentative the three rounded a corner a few blocks away from gitas house and saw the caravan their convoy consisted of five clanking sedans a small bus loaded with objects of trade and a jeep carrying three soldiers with oldfashioned ms leading the procession it was already lined up and the various merchants involved in the enterprise darted here and there to store their goods and pack just one more item on the bus the soldiers came strolling down the street at a leisurely pace eating their breakfasts wrapped in paper with their fingers their rifles were slung on their backs and they laughed heartily among themselves this is our protection spence wondered the whole troop would have been comical if not for the fear spence saw in the faces of the merchants to them it was a life or death proposition with death an alltoopossible outcome he found it hard to believe such conditions still existed in a world that was quickly hurtling itself toward the stars he himself had walked on mars and these frightened merchants could not even conceive of such a thing his world was as far from theirs as well as far as kyrs was from his when they had walked the length of the caravan a tall gaunt indian with the pursed expression of a man perpetually sucking lemons hailed gita and met them this is gurjara marjumdar leader of the merchants making this trip the man bowed low placing his hands together in the classic greeting your presence among us strengthens our purpose he smiled a puckery smile later gita told spence that with the money they had paid gurjara to join the convoy the merchant had already made a profit i have arranged for you to travel in my car gurjara said with some pride i hope you will be very comfortable it was all spence could do to keep from remarking that perhaps they would be more comfortable if the car had springs he could already see that the junker rode low to the ground and as yet no passengers were aboard after a few more minutes of frenzied packing and tearful heartrending goodbyes among the merchants and their families the caravan asthmatic engines gasping and sputtering rumbled off gawking street sleepers staggered out of the way as the odd train of vehicles rattled past children and dogs ran beside as they wound through the streets hoping for trinkets and shouting at the drivers to honk their hornsa request the drivers obliged with childlike persistence spence marked their passage through the decaying city with numbed wonder it was repulsive and yet somehow fascinating in its lazy sprawling decadence he had never experienced anything like it behind the train a small army of ragged wayfarers walked or rode bicycles they too were making the trip to darjeeling though lacking the money to hire a car or other transportation they were nevertheless anxious to benefit from the presence of the soldiers at the outskirts of calcutta they came to a greasy noisome river where they stopped though spence could not determine why he and adjani got out to give their legs a last stretch before the train headed into open country walking to the head of the convoy they saw the reason for the delay a family had set up housekeeping on the bridge during the nightnot only one family but severaland were having to be removed in order to let the cars pass by the people repacked their baggage and belongingswhich seemed to spence to consist mostly of broken bamboo chairs rags and hackedup oil drumswith a sullen slowness under the urgings of the soldiers why would anybody homestead a bridge he asked as he watched the unusual scene look around youwhere else is there for them to go besides its close to the water for bathing and drinkingthats why most of them try it they may even get to stay there a day or two if no one moves them spence looked down at the buffcolored water and grimaced they surely dont try to drink that stuff adjani didnt say anything but pointed down along the banks below them every square meter of available space was taken up by crude brush leantos and cardboard huts right down to the waters edge the hooghly river was both sewer and reservoir to the clamoring masses that crowded its bare earth shores in the murky light of a new day as far along the shore as he could see thousands of river dwellers were going about their daily business men women and children stood naked in the shallows and splashed the foul water over themselves to wash away the previous days filth near a group of bathers a starving dog worried a floppy white rubbery object which spence at first could not identify then with a sick churning feeling he recognized the thing as a human corpse bleached white by the river and deposited on the shore spence turned away from the scene with a hollowness in his chest in a short while the journey resumed he avoided the accusing stares of the displaced bridge settlers as the car passed them along the side of the road for a long time after that he did not say anything at midday though only a few kilometers out of the city they stopped to eat fruit sellers materialized with baskets full of produce to sell to the travelers spence was not particularly hungry but bought two bananas from an old man with a stump leg mostly out of pity adjani and gita had gone to confer with gurjara about the route they would take spence sat on the ground in the shade of the car and peeled one of the bananas and munched it thoughtfully the air was clearer away from the city and the land green with tropical foliage except for the crumbled pavement underfoot they might have been a safari from long ago exploring an uncharted territorythe sense of the new unknown was strong in spence to the north the foothills rose in even steps leading to the high mountains which showed as little more than a faint purplish smudge in the sky behind the hills somewhere up ahead in those hills was darjeeling jewel of the mountains six days seven maybe more away rangpo was further still spence sighed perhaps they were on a wild goose chase perhaps ari was nowhere within a million kilometers of those superstitionbreeding hills thinking of her wondering about her worrying over her had made him sick at heart he kept telling himself and anyone else who would listen that he should have done something to help her adjani had pointed out time and again that her kidnapping had been carefully arranged and that she was probably out of the building before they had entered the room what about the scream that was her scream i know it how do you know we both heard what we were meant to hear we were summoned when our presence was required and not until then do you really think that if there had been a struggle we would not have heard it we were but a few steps from the door and could have rescued her easily if she had been there to rescue no they knew where to find her they were watching her waiting for a chance to act but why what is she in all of this why didnt they take me adjani shook his head i dont know but were doing the right thing well just have to trust god to show us what to do when the time comes how can you be so sure i dont see that we have any other choicedo you we were meant to follow so be it we follow spence felt he had betrayed his beloved it frustrated him to have to sit in the road eating bananas while she waited for him to rescue her he finished the banana and tossed the peel away at once there was a flurry of motion at the roadside where he had tossed the peel two childrena girl about eight years old and wrapped in a ragged faded sari and her brother of about five who wore only a mans sleeveless shirtdived after the banana skin they had been watching spence from a distance and when he threw the peeling they pounced the girl brushed the dirt away from the peeling and pulled a small square of frayed cloth from the folds of her sari she spread out the cloth neatly and she and her brother sat down with patience and care she began pulling the long stringy soft portion of the inner peel away from the skin when she was done she discarded the outer skin and divided the remains with the boy they ate them slowly and with deliberation as if they were munching a great delicacy best enjoyed at leisure spence was so moved by the sight that he went to the children and held out the other banana the girls eyes grew big and round and the little boy cowered at his sisters shoulder spence smiled and offered the banana more insistently he could tell by the way they looked at it that both wanted it very much they were simply too shy to accept it so spence put the banana down on the dirty square of cloth and walked back to the car and sat down as soon as his back was turned the girl snatched up the banana peeled it and broke it in half both were slowly chewing the fruit when spence returned to the car adjani and gita returned and they began discussing their plans for the immediate future they heard the soldiers call out and the pop of the jeep firing as they were climbing back into the car spence felt a tug at his elbow he turned to see the little girl and her brother he started to gesture to them that he had no more bananas when the girl smiled prettily and with some ceremony presented him with his banana peel spence grinned and gave the peel back both looked at each other as if unable to believe their good fortune and then scampered off to devour the rest of their prize the happy look in the childrens eyes warmed spence the rest of the day its just a little thing he replied to adjanis knowing glance its nothing its more than you think my friend thereafter he always made it a point to buy three bananas youre in alt of trouble packer care to tell me what this is all about elliot ramm gotham security chief crossed his long legs and leaned on the edge of his desk a penitent olmstead packer sat facing him with his hands between his knees and his face long and unhappy there was a note of smoldering indignation in his voice when he spoke to tell you the truth chief ramm i dont know myself he jerked a thumb toward the two guards who stood watching him with cool disinterest maybe you should ask your men i was just talking to a friend when they came in and grabbed me the security chief nodded to his men dismissing them i have your report you can return to duty he turned to packer i also have a statement from dr williams he says that you obtained entrance to his infirmary under false pretenses after you were told you could not see the patient kalnikov he claims you were endangering the life of his patient packer grinned sheepishly i guess i may have overdramatized a bit hmph chief ramm picked up a white folder from his desk hes pressing charges against you hes what packer suddenly became very red hes nuts this is all crazy let me talk to him i didnt mean any harm it was that nurse of hisshe acted too snippy and fresh i just decided to take matters into my own hands a faint smile crossed ramms lips he nodded and shoved a lock of his black hair away from his forehead all right i believe you you scientists hate to be told no to anything then i can go packer asked hopefully he had been in detention for over three hours and was getting tired im afraid its not that simple whether i believe you or not doesnt really make a lot of difference you see williams has filed a formal complaint its up to the director to review it and decide what to do director zandersons gone no telling when hell be back im sorry youll have to stay here until he gets back or or what if theres another way to settle this im all for it or dr williams could agree to drop the charges then lets talk to him by all means im sure hell listen to reason ramm held up a hand not so fast he was pretty steamed up over this id let him cool off a little first but ive got to get out of here im a busy man ive got an experiment running itll just have to run without you for a while you should have thought of that before your performance of swan lake in the sick bay all right i guess i had that coming ill talk to williams after a bit and see what i can do id appreciate it chief ramm packer rose and shuffled to the portal you know theres something funny about this whole thing i never knew anyone to have to be sedated after getting buzzed by a taser i thought those things were fairly safe if you know what i mean im sure theres an explanation ill check into it in the meantime you can wait in the outer office until i get this cleared up i wont put you in the tank packer nodded and left security chief ramm returned to the chair behind his desk and picked up his officers report and glanced over it he tossed it down on the desk laced his hands behind his head and leaned back in his chair he frowned as if deep in thought and then shoved his chair back rose put on his red and black cap with its gold emblem and went in search of the physician ari had never seen her father so shaken he sat slumped in the seat beside her face white as the pale sliver of moon that shone in the jets small oval window his eyes were closed though she knew he was not asleep he was shutting out the reality of what was happening around him the plane was not large their captors sat all around them and watched them incessantly although they had not forbidden them to talk to one another their close proximity tended to limit the exchanges between father and daughter to mere whispers and nods she knew there was more to what was happening than she had as yet been told more than their kidnapping and the trouble with spence though he was certainly central to the whole escapade her father seemed to know more than he let on and the way it had affected him was not explainable in terms of his normal behavior ari was seeing a new side of her father and it scared her she went to sleep wondering what it was that he knew and would not or could not tell her the plane flew on through the night stopping only once for refueling at a hoverport in germany ari roused herself and peered sleepily out the window she saw a goldengray dawn sky and a ground crew of men in blue overalls wheeling orange machines around the wings of the jet across the field she saw a building with signs on the roof in german and guessed they were somewhere in the middle of europe at least when she woke again the blue sky held a fierce white sun above a lumpy landscape of gray and white clouds she could not see the earth below and had no idea where they were or which direction they were heading not that it mattered at all shortly after that she and her father were given a simple breakfast orange juice and a dry roll no one else seemed to be eating so ari thought they were at least being shown some small courtesy she hadnt eaten in almost a day and wolfed down the food in several large bites then turned to her father daddy youre not eating im not very hungry dear you may have my roll if you like no you eat something and drink your juice you have to keep your strength up no telling when we might eat again and anyway we want to be alert for any chance of escape her father did not say anything but his expression gave her to know that he considered any thought of escape pure foolishness the jet dropped down through the clouds and landed on a square of concrete near a small town on the edge of a desert ari could see brown desolate hills in the distance and the white stucco buildings of the town like bleached bones in the sun squat bushytopped palm trees and low dusty shrubs stood off away from the landing field like forlorn travelers awaiting transportation that never arrives there were no human passengers or greeting committee that ari could see on her side of the plane someone popped the hatch and the cool interior of the craft was assaulted by warm dry air from the desert then one by one all of the occupants disembarked ari and her father stayed in their seats until tickler came back and told them to get out they emerged from the plane and walked a few paces along the concrete landing pad stay in sight tickler called but other than that admonition no one seemed to pay the least attention to them hocking and his assistants withdrew to the far side of the pad to confer with a group of five or six men in black and white kaftans fuel smugglers no doubt ari thought she saw a camels head moving among the shrubbery a little way off i wonder where we are ari whispered to her father and whats going on does it matter the resignation was so strong in her fathers voice that ari spun around and faced him gripping him by the arms daddy tell me youre hiding something and i have a right to know its my neck too dont think youre protecting me by not talking its too late for that and besidesim a big girl now her words brought him back he looked at her and blinked as if recognizing her for the first time since the ordeal started of course my dear he said gently he looked around and saw that they were unobserved ill tell you all i know and what i guess he paused and looked at her once again is it about spence tell me i wont be spared the details no matter how it hurts spence oh no i mean yesit started there at first it was him but not anymore he doesnt matter anymore not really doesnt matter they told me hed kidnapped you that he and adjani were stealing advanced technology secrets to sell and i dont know what all i thought i was helping you ari i never dreamed i dont understand why did you believe them didnt you know no her father said curtly i i had to believe them i had no choice daddy who are these people what do they want from us he turned sad and bitter eyes on her it started almost a year ago he came to mea jerk of the head indicated hockingand said that there were people who would pay handsomely to know the truth about your mother i was afraidi couldnt let that information out it might have ruined my career the board elections were only a few weeks away there had been some mumblings of dissatisfaction among the more conservative board members my reappointment was by no means assured what did he want that was the odd thing only to come aboard gotham and observe he said we made a deal i would let him come on boardno questions askedin exchange for his silence about caroline i didnt see him after that he stayed out of sight didnt you wonder what he was up to i didnt want to know after the elections i forgot about him put him out of my mind he was there all the time spence was right spence knew about him spence saw him once and had me try to find out who he was of course i couldnt there was no record of him anywhere director zanderson passed a hand in front of his eyes ive been such a fool now everythings gone what do you mean were not finished yet not by a long shot what difference does it make he returned to his whining tone he looked at her again with eyes showing white all around dont you understand they are taking over control of the center the space station will be theirs impossible far from it gotham is totally selfsufficient now its quite possible no one would even know but gm would find out eventually and theyd put a stop to it by then it would be too late with only a slight modification of the thrusters the station could be moved anywhere in the solar systemthe whole galaxy theyd go after it they wouldnt just let it go the elder zanderson shook his head wearily remember the only craft capable of traveling that far is the transport gyrfalcon and its based at the station it could be years before another craft of that kind could be readied by that time the station could be hidden somewhere in the asteroid belt or beyond why gotham would be a true space colony it could conceivably go anywhere the thought of a thing so huge hiding out in plain sight in the empty openness of space seemed ludicrous to ari but then the universe was a very big place what will they do with us i dont know i suppose well be useful to them until they have secured control of the center then who knows weve got to do something we cant just give up hope there is no hope daddy we cant just let all those people up there become slaves to this madman weve got to do something weve got to try its too late its already happening it is not too late ari said harshly she took her fathers arm and shook it hard spence is still out there and free he knows about them hell try to find us and free us its too late he wont know where to start lookingwe dont even know where theyre taking us hell find us she gave her father a knowing look spence has as much at stake in this as anyone else maybe more and i have a pretty good hunch where were headed and where hell start looking the gunshots did not wake spence it was the bullets themselvesrattling through the rusted hulk of the sedan like lethal hailthat snapped him to attention the moon was nearly downthe darkest part of the night several hours before dawnand perfect for an ambush the goondas had been waiting for the sentries to slip off to sleep before creeping out from hiding in the jungled hills the attack swift and professional caught everyone off guard merchants ran screaming into the night the horde of barefoot followers scattered in every direction not knowing where the shooting was coming from the soldiers fired off quick bursts with their ms and someoneperhaps one of the merchants more likely one of the outlawsblazed away with a submachine gun the scene erupted in such confusion spence could not be sure who was shooting at whom when he dived out of the back seat of the car onto the road he collided with the crouching figure of adjani ooof he said as he went down stay down adjani pressed his shoulder to the ground wheres gita i dont know when i woke up he was gone the shooting seems to be coming from those trees across the road spence looked and saw that adjani was probably right a thin white trace of smoke drifted from the tops of a stand of tall trees about thirty meters away a running line of bullets kicked up little clouds of dust as they ripped along the length of the caravan a few bodies lay motionless between the trees and the line of vehicles but whether these were dead wounded or just keeping down and out of sight he could not tell he feared the worst all at once the shooting stopped they heard shouts from the trees and then saw the three soldiers walking across the road with their empty hands in the air so much for our protection said adjani what happens now they will take what they want andwe would do well to praythey will go their own way the voice was gitas spence and adjani turned around and saw the turbaned head sticking out from beneath the car how he had squeezed his bulk under there was a mystery all around them the groans of the wounded rose from the earth and the foliage on the far side of the road began to waver and shake as the bandits stepped into the open there were a dozen or more of them and probably others still hidden in the trees they were dressed in dark clothing making them almost impossible to see as they fanned off along the caravans lengththey were dark shadows against a darker night the feeble moonlight struck the bare metal of their old guns and glinted with a cold luster letting any remaining doubters know that they did indeed mean business we have nothing of value said spence what can they do kill us replied gita it would be better if we had something to give them our provisions suggested adjani theyll take those anyway they want more well lets not stick around to haggle about it lets get out of here now spence still on his stomach beside adjani began squirming backward behind the car adjani flattened himself and followed spences lead gita wedged between the car chassis and the dirt road hissed like a snake stop stop wait for me in a moment he had disengaged himself from his hiding place and was rolling into the ditch after his friends they had not run three steps toward the cover of the jungle when a shout and the glint of the moonlight on the long barrel of a rifle halted them directly into their path stepped a large dark figure his teeth and the whites of his eyes shone in the darkness and he turned the gun toward them and shouted again more insistently without waiting for a translation spence turned slowly and putting his hands in the air walked back to the car there they saw that all the merchants were standing in front of their vehicles while teams of bandits unloaded the cargo from the whining chatter which filled the air spence guessed they were pleading with the robbers not to wipe them out completely the goondas seemed oblivious to this racket and went about their business wholly unconcerned with the pitiful wheedling of the tradesmen then two bandits were standing before them with rifles leveled one of them spoke a rapid question to gita the little man quaking with fear stepped forward he wants to know what we have to give him whispered adjani out of the side of his mouth gita was speaking quickly with fearinspired eloquence the palms of his hands could be seen waving ecstatically before him in wild gesticulations whats he saying now gita is telling him that we are doctors on our way to darjeeling to help a friend that we have no money or possessions with us he is praying that we be allowed to continue for the sake of our friend the bandit looked long at gita and then at adjani and spence in turn he came to stand directly before them and peered into their faces spence could smell the reek of puyati the strong homebrewed liquor made from fermented palm sap on the thiefs breath his face was greasy in the fading moonlight all at once the bandit whirled on his heel and barked out a short sentence in a moment a very large outlaw with a huge white turban and a flowing striped coat came striding up with a goonda on either side spence guessed this was the leader the two bandits conferred with one another briefly and then the leader turned with a flourish of his coattails and left spence thought for an instant that they would be left alone but the first bandit roared a command at gita which almost sent the little man rolling on his backside gita scrambled for the car and came out with the sacks bearing their provisions he turned to spence and adjani with eyes wide and fearful we are to follow him said adjani nodding in the direction of the retreating bandit what if we dont then he hopes we have lived good lives and thought pure thoughts for tonight we will have the opportunity of joining the world soul in nirvana id rather not said spence lets go olmstead packer crossed and recrossed his legs folded and refolded his hands alternately and regularly he was bored with waiting and apprehensive that security chief ramm should be taking so long to iron out the difficulty between him and dr williams a sense of doom had settled over the big physicist as he waited he saw his future growing dim before his eyes and the hobbling shackles of a prison record snaking out to claim him and yet the offense was so small so trivial so insignificant he wanted to laugh this extreme ambivalence of feeling created in the redbearded man a curious tension as if a tugofwar was being waged inside him with first one side gaining the advantage and then the other and to make matters worse packer did not know which side to cheer for at any moment depending upon the swing of mood either side seemed capable of carrying the day so he sat and tried to keep himself calm while inwardly the battle for the control of his emotional outlook and disposition raged unabated he shook his red shaggy head how had he ever gotten himself mixed up in anything like this it had all started out so innocently or had it wasnt it true that there had been something peculiar right from the beginning right from the very first moment he had laid eyes on spence reston didnt all this have to do with him packer was certain that beyond anything else spence was the cause of his particular problems and very likely the rest as well certainly kalnikov had gotten where he was because of restonthere was a mystery that begged investigation where it all would end and what it was all about he could only guess physicists did not like to guess presently the outer door slid open and he heard someone speak in the next room in a moment chief ramm was standing over him packer jumped up like an eager lap dog and all but barked to be let out well did you talk to him can i go now ramm frowned an official frown im afraid it wont be that simple im going to have to lock you up for a couple daysuntil the director gets back anyway packers face fell youre not serious im afraid i am come with me please the command was cold and left no room for argument the security head led the malefactor into an octagonal room with transparent doors set in each of the seven facing walls these were the doors to the cells all were empty crime was not a problem on gotham ramm took his prisoner to the cell directly opposite the entrance to the room in here he said punching in the access code the door slid open and ramm stepped aside so packer could enter i think youll be comfortable here try not to worry ill notify your wife dont bother packer responded dully my wifes visiting her sister earthside just tell my assistant whats happened he looked around at his cell a small square room with padded walls and a low cav couch built on a ledge that was it he turned back and was surprised to see ramm had joined him in the cell ramm indicated the couch and said sit down i want to talk to you packer did as he was told this is the only quiet room in the detention centerall the rest are bugged ramm explained packer kept quiet and waited for what would follow something squirrelly is going on here i mean to find out what it is youd better give me the whole story packer from the beginning packer stared back blankly the chiefs frown had deepened to a formidable scowl he guessed the tall policeman could eat his weight in wildcats and decided not to play any games you talked to williams i talked to him it was like talking to a clam hes scared of something and he wont open up and let it out i thought i might see if you could enlighten me ill try said packer and began telling him about what he knew of spence and adjanis disappearancewhich was not much because he had only heard the same rumors as everyone else yes said ramm ive got a couple of men working on that one nothing much has turned up so far thats why i went to kalnikov reston and rajwandhi are friends of mine adjanis on my staff i couldnt believe the rumors about them and i wanted to find out what happened i figured kalnikov was the one person who might know would it surprise you if i told you that it was my order that kalnikov receive no visitors it was it was he was an eyewitness and i didnt want anyone talking to him before i could when you turned up in bed next to him i figured you were mixed up in it either you knew a lot more than you were telling or you had stumbled into something innocently i didnt know which but it gave me a chance to go back and talk to williams again well you tell me i cant make heads or tails of this all i know is that it doesnt take fifteen hours for a man to recover from a taser jolt usually only a few minutes williams claims the taser dartstruck kalnikov in the spine and pierced the spinal column grazing the spinal cord he says kalnikov may be paralyzed hes not paralyzedhes sedated are you sure positive kalnikov told me himself rather i got him to tell mehe cant talk so we used an answer code i found out that kalnikov was trying to help reston and rajwandhi escapefrom what i dont know he wasnt injured by the taser youre right there he thinks he was pumped full of sedative and muscle relaxant to keep him quiet thats all i could get from him before i was interrupted hmm curiouser and curiouser thats all i know honestly what about this reston and the other guy whats with them who were they escaping from i dont know kalnikov might he saw them chief ramm stood im inclined to believe you packer im going to check this out i could release you on your own recognizance but i think youd better stay here for a while packer moaned oh no i was hoping you wouldnt say that look its more for your own protection than anything else until we find out whats going on here i dont want to lose any witnesses you know as much as kalnikov now i dont want you to turn up missing they wouldnt do anything to me bluffed packer dont be too sure ive got one man sedated and two others flying around in a stolen landing pod and i dont know why im not so sure whoevers behind this would balk at killing off their witnesses if this gets any messier to packers disbelieving look he said it happens so just sit tight and ill get you out of here as soon as possible in the meantime relax ill have some statmags brought in for you to read and well be having dinner in an hour or so its on me chief ramm smiled goodnaturedly and went out leaving packer to fume in frustration just one thing chief the prisoner called through the faceplate in the door yeah dont you go getting into trouble the chief laughed dont worry its all in a days work maybe so but i have a feeling these guys work mostly at night the hoverjet dropped once more below the scattered cloud cover and ari saw the ground for the first time in several hours she viewed a lush green terrain that looked like emerald velvet rolled out in puckered wrinkles she could see the shining silver threads of rivers winding along the deep gorges white birds soared over the verdant landscape in veeformed squadrons seeing them from above with the noonday sun gleaming on their wings they looked like strands of diamonds suspended between the blue sky and the green earth flashing white fire as their wings sliced the misty air ahead and a little to the left of the plane she could see the sharp hills rise to a promontory surrounded on three sides by jungled slopes and by a lake on the fourth further ahead and blue in the hazy distance the white peaks of mountains rose creating a jagged line on the horizon as far as she could see the hoverjet made a long descent passing over the promontory with its cluster of villages crowded at the summit and descending in tiers like stairsteps ari felt she recognized the place though she had never seen it before daddy where are we she whispered her father was not asleep though he had his eyes closed and his head rested on his chest hmmm he had sunk into black depression and would make only grunting answers to her attempts at conversation could that be india down there i think it must be this brought her father upright in his seat as his eyes snapped open india did you say he leaned across her and peered out the window its hard to tell it might be anywhere no thats darjeeling down there i know it could be he admitted regarding his daughter carefully what makes you so sure i just know thats all mother told me about it described growing up there just then as her mind leaped ahead it came to her exactly who it was that awaited them at their destination oh daddy she said gripping his hand if we are in india it can only mean one thing were going to see the dream thief a short while later the jets forward progress slowed and then halted as it dropped to a landing below the vegetation was so dense and the trees so closeshe might have reached out and pulled leaves from their branchesshe could not see the ground directly below the plane they seemed to be landing in the forest some distance east of darjeeling how far east she could not tell but the terrain glimpsed through the tall trees as the jet came down gave the impression of rising into mountains all around then the plane bumped gently down and the engines ceased their droning whine at the same instant warm humid air flooded the cabin as the hatch popped open ari heard voices from outside speaking in the rapid birdsong of hindi this confirmed her suspicion that they were indeed in the land of the dream thief she blinked as she emerged from the cabin the sunlight fell hot and bright from directly overhead the moist air seemed to shimmer in waves before her eyes and the green walls of the broadleafed forest screeched with the calls of alarmed birds and angry monkeys she lifted her eyes to take in her surroundings and saw a scene out of the pages of an archaeological text before her rose walls of massive crumbling stone black with age and mildew further along the wall a large gate stood open and beyond it a narrow tower struck out into the azure clouded sky they seemed to have landed in a courtyard of sorts inside the walls of a castle ari remembered her mothers description of the dream thiefs palace and knew that she was there she looked around with eyes filled with wonder what had been only a dream was real the buried memory of an unhappy little girl was fact it had been true all alongnot the imaginings of a disturbed and frightened child three men approached wearing military tunics and trousers of linen their dark almost black skins glistened in the sun and their black almond eyes watched the newcomers warily one of the men wore a holster on his hip hocking and the others stood in consultation with the men for a moment and then tickler came and said these men will take you to your quarters he made it sound as if they were checking into a hotel the men without a word led the captives off toward the gate and into a further courtyard beyond this inner yard was smaller its walls were draped in heavy vines growing out from between the stones of the yard cracking them and prying them apart heaving them up at angles to each other the vines had covered everythingstunted trees standing statues stone benches an ancient dry fountainsmothering all beneath a thick green blanket of glossy leaves like the sheets thrown over the furniture of a house closed for the summer ari got the impression that if she stood very long in the courtyard she too would soon be covered to become one of the standing objects she saw around her the men marched them across the decaying stones of the yard to a lowroofed portico then under this to a tier of steps leading up into a darkened entrance ari reached her hand out to her father as she tripped going up the stairs one of the guards caught her in a steely grasp and righted her his hand lingered on her cool flesh she jerked her arm away quickly they entered a room dim and cool and quiet as a tomb light entered from small clovershaped windows around a shallow domed ceiling dust lay thick and undisturbed on the tile floor of the hallexcept for the meandering trails of insects their footprints in the dust gave testimony to the fact that no one had visited the place in a very long time they might have been the first visitors in a thousand years they were whisked across the hall and into a dark corridor which ended in a long spiraling flight of stairs other lighter passageways joined the main one at the foot of the stairs but they went up the spiral which wound round and round and narrowed as it ascended at the top of these dark steps they entered a small landing with a circular hole in the vaulted roof overhead at one end of the landing stood a large wooden door which appeared much newer than its surrounding posts and lintel with black iron bands forming a large x across its surface her first look at the interior of their cell did not dismay ari it was a spacious room round with lofty pointed windows and a wide balcony closed only by a curtain of woven wooden beads there were oriental couches and rattan chairs and several beds piled high with cushions of red blue and yellow silk a toilet stall was concealed behind a silk curtain for the privacy of its occupants there was a marble table with carved ivory chessmen arranged neatly on its polished surface nearby a great glass bowl with a crystal dipper held fresh water next to it a smaller bowl offered fruit small wild grapes bananas oranges and several large greenishyellow pulpy things she could not identify it appeared as if the room had been newly scoured and furnished for their arrival with all the amenities one might find in a charming old hotel but when the great wooden door slammed shut behind them she knew that they were prisoners and not guests well here we are she said trying to sound optimistic director zanderson stirred himself out of his staring reverie to gaze about the room with tired eyes yes here we are a gilded cage for the captive birds look theres a balcony said ari running to it at once daddy come out here you can see the mountains the himalayas he said joining her yes we are northeast of darjeeling in the foothills of the himalayas somewhere near the old bhutan border in sikkim i didnt know you knew so much geography ari turned a fresh enthusiastic face to her father the sun lit her hair with golden fire she was trying very hard to draw her father out and cheer him up in the hope that he would abandon his moody despondency to see him sunk so deep in his depression hurt her more than anything their abductors could have done to her tell me more i dont know much more i was only here brieflywith your mother before you were born i never knew that you said i know what i said he smiled devilishly there is a lot parents dont talk about in front of their children they lead double lives my dear really i always suspected as much but now the truth comes out youve got to tell me all about it her father sighed as if sifting through the various recollections of a long and burdensome life for one remnant of a memory saved from some longago time theres not much to tell he said at last it was not much of a trip i dont believe that two peopleyoung and in love frolicking in these secret hills a faint smile touched his lips as he warmed to the memory yes there was something of that but there was a sadness too your mother wanted so very much to show me the town where they had lived and the seminary where her father had taught all those years she wanted me to see where she had come from she said but when we reached darjeeling something happened to her she became moody and unhappy we stayed only a few days and looked around but she couldnt bring herself to show me all she had planned it was like she couldnt bear to be here she became very depressedthat was the first hint of her trouble after we left we never spoke of the trip again though i could tell that it was often on her mind she seemed to regard the trip as a fiasco but i didnt feel that way at all it was years later of course before i began to suspect there was more to it than a holiday ruined by unpleasant memories ari remembered the story her mother had toldit seemed years ago now but only one day by the clockand how she sat at her elbow as one in a trance drinking in every word did she never tell you about the dream thief her father gave her an odd look what do you know about it ari described her visit to the asylum with spence and adjani and how her mother had rallied during the visit and had in one flash of lucidity described what happened to her in the wild hills ari told the story word for word the way her mother had told it while her father sat with a look of rapt attention on his face yes he said when she had finished ive never heard it quite that way but thats pretty much the way ive pieced it together over the yearsfrom little things shed say not that she every really tried to hide it i dont think she was aware of it she had blocked it out completely but sometimes shed slip her subconscious would send out a plea for understanding he turned to look at the faraway line of mountains heaving their mighty shoulders skyward an expression of deepest grief came over his features tears gathered at the corners of his eyes and trickled down his broad cheeks ari took his hand and pressed it hard she lifted her other hand to his face he took the hand and kissed the palm and held it against his lips for a moment when he spoke again his voice was thick with sorrow all these years i thought it was the fantasy of a troubled mind i never dreamed it could be real the best doctors in the world agreed with methe treatments the drugs the horrible nights of pain when shed cry out in terror but it was real ari and it drove her insane the air suddenly seemed colder and ari wrapped her arms around herself and stepped away from the balcony yes it was real and it had turned its attention to her and had brought her within these walls a prisoner would she be able to withstand she wondered thinking of the one who had escaped yet the memory of it had eaten away at her sanity until nothing remained but the shell of a formerly beautiful woman daddy im scared ari said trembling he took his daughter in his arms and held her tightly i know dearest i know what are we going to do there is not much we can do ari only pray ive never stopped praying daddy but pray for us now and for spence too i think he may need it more than we do spences held the flame in his hands it burned lightly fluttering yellow in the soft night breeze he brought the candle made of woven cloth and plant fibers dipped in wax close to his face and felt its warmth lick him beyond the small circle of his light he could see nothing the night sat like an impenetrable wall all around him above no star gleamed no moon shed its lightall was dark and spence was alone in the darkness the only thing holding the awful smothering blackness at bay was the little crudely formed torch in his hand that a light so small could keep out the dark seemed a miracle he had never thought about it before had never seen this miracle performed but he witnessed it now and he marveled at it even the tiniest spark was stronger than all the mighty forces of the night strange he thought that it should be that way suddenly a quick gust of wind whipped at the flame and though spence cupped his hand around it at almost the same instant it was too late he saw the flame wink out as the darkness it had been holding back leaped in to devour him like some immense amorphous creature the darkness absorbed him into itself he could sense its exultation at conquering hima thrill of excitement seemed to course through it as it tightened its grasp on him he knew with a horror that exceeded any he had ever felt that it meant to crush him into nothingness already he could feel the suffocating blackness clamped like an iron fist over him beginning to squeeze him the mind that controlled the darkness that was itself the heart and soul of darkness reached out toward him he recoiled from the contact as if from the slithering touch of a reptiles polished skin his blood ran cold he had touched a mind of utter chaos and depravity and it made him feel weak and insignificant in its presence it meant to kill him but for no better reason than that it meant to kill all things that possessed even the faintest glimmer of light in them a long aching cry tore from his throat full of helplessness and bleak despair in that cry he heard all the bitter disappointment and hate and injustice he had ever experiencedthe sum total of all his deepest fears and failures and he heard the cry lose itself in the darkness becoming part of it strengthening it spence knew then that the despair and the hate and all the other black nameless fears belonged not to himselfalthough he had held them and nourished them in his innermost being they belonged instead to the darkness that covered him now were part of it were one with it long had they fought within him to extinguish his spark that portion of light that was his now they had gone back to strengthen the darkness from which they were sprung now it would at last crush him spence felt his strength to resist slacken running away like water that the darkness should prevail over him was the most monstrous insanity he could conceive to be snuffed out like his poor candle flame seemed to him the final unanswerable injustice and for what for possessing a tiny gleam of light that he had never asked for nor sought no the shout was defiance no no no he heard his cries die in the darkness then he heard a sound that pierced him like an ice dagger it seemed to hollow him out disemboweling him slashing at his heart the sound was laughter originating from within the cruel mocking heart of darkness he would be annihilated with the insolent laughter still booming in his brain his last thoughts would be of the utter senseless waste of his life echoed in each note god spence cried save me he felt a shudder run through the darkness as if he had wounded it with a blow and then a single beam of light finer than a single hair struck down through the darkness to stand shimmering before him spence reached out and touched his finger to the light and felt it sing within him it was alive this tiny laser point of light in a way that the darkness was never alive it had power beyond all the power of the darkness and it awakened in him a corresponding power as it infused his own inner spark with new brilliance in the light he heard a voice speak to him why do you search in darkness for your life it asked spence could not answer it he could not speak come into the light said the voice and you will find what you are searching for spence looked up at the shining thread of light and far above him he heard a tremendous tearing sound as if the sky itself were being torn in two he clamped his hands over his ears to save them from the deafening sound far above him he saw a crack in the darkness and light began to spill in it seemed to him for a moment that he was inside an enormous egg and light from a greater world outside was pouring in through a crack in the shell he heard above the tearing sound the agonizing shriek of the darkness as it was riven apart and burned away by the light then he was standing in a pool of light that fell down upon hint from above he raised his face to it and filled his eyes with it with a terrific roar the darkness dissolved and ran away and a brilliant white light brighter than ten thousand suns blazed he felt its power and its vibrant living energy as it danced over him tingling every pore every square centimeter of his skin now it was inside him penetrating his flesh and bones and burning into the fibers of his soul he could feel it like fire cunsuming all impurities devouring any remaining shreds of darkness which clung to his inner self cleansing the very atoms of his being spence then knew that he and the light were one it had done its work in him and he was transformed into a living beam of light he felt himself expanding and growing without limits a creature of infinity without beginning or end and yet he knew the true living light to be as far above him and brighter as he was himself above and brighter than the darkness it had saved him from he had touched the source of life and it flowed within him and through him and always would it was eternal and so now was he he knew that he was born to be part of it and to live forever in it the thought was a song inside him but there were no words only a melody which soared endlessly up and up ever higher ever more pure spence bent over the sleeping form of adjani the forest sounds were hushed it was an hour yet to daylight though through the trees above he could see a dull blue showing crickets in the tall grass and among the branches of nearby bushes trilled musically filling the night with their peaceful sound adjani wake up he heard the slow rhythmic breathing of his friend and hated to wake him but his news would not wait it had to be told adjani what is it adjani sat up at oncewary like a cat has something happened he looked around quickly but saw no signs of alarm a bandit sentry watched them from a distance his rifle rested on his knees clearly they were in the same predicament as before nothing had changed adjani ive seen him spences hands were shaking and his voice trembled seen who adjani came fully upright and peered into spences face he saw a peculiar light in his friends eyes the creator of all this he waved a hand vaguely at the jungle around them of you and me of the universe what the allbeinggod he spoke to me spence put an unsteady hand on adjanis shoulder until he had said the words aloud he had not consciously named his vision the full meaning of what he said broke in on him jarring him he lapsed into a stunned silence spence are you all right adjani shook his elbow im fine recognition came back into spences eyes he lowered his head and grinned sheepishly it was only a dream tell me about it said adjani i have learned to respect your dreams i am here ortu hocking looked at the motionless figure before him it had been some time since he had been in the palace and hocking thought his master appeared even more shrunken and wasted than ever why are you here ortu did not raise his head he spoke to hocking as one asleep hocking knew ortu never slept you said you wanted reston hocking began then why is he not here the voice was cold the tone menacing he is coming ortu he is on his way here now how do you know this ortu raised his head slowly his almost luminous eyes glared out at hocking with loathing it was not easy ortu ive had to to make other arrangements silence remember who i am you have failed again to carry out my commands what do you have to say for yourself it was my fault reston escapedhe tricked us but who are the people you have brought with you why have you brought them they are hostages ortu i thought it best to you thought i am your master you act according to my will or have you forgotten no ortu i have not forgotten but the girlthe girl is restons girlfriend thats how i know he will come with the tanti we can bring him thats what you want isnt it ortu seemed to consider this and then said fazluls men are here instruct them that the governor is to intercept reston on the road and bring him here at once i will not risk losing him again ortus head sank once more his eyes closed as you wish ortu and the othersyour hostages you will eliminate them at once it was foolish to bring them here we have no use for them yes ortu i will do as you say the incense rose in gray billows filling the chamber where ortu sat like a statue hocking almost choking on the fumes gazed around the room he knew so well as always it held a fearful fascination for him this was the room where his master livedortu had not stirred in forty or fifty yearsand from this room he directed his will hocking again regarded the wizened body before him and felt the heat of anger leap up in him ortu was patient beyond all human patience he had waited a thousand years for his plans to begin to grow he would wait a thousand more for them to bear fruit i cannot wait that long thought hocking to himself we have a chance now we must not wait hocking had his own plans for the new world order which ortu had designed and which would soon commence it seemed ludicrous that one man the stubborn spencer reston should singlehandedly halt their progress and so close to the realization of their dreams what was so important about reston anyway he was nothinga worm to be crushed underfoot someone had to be eliminated hocking saw that clearly but it would not be ari and her father they would be needed until the station was secured it was reston who should be eliminated hocking withdrew silently his chair floated out on the clouds of incense and away it was so simple he did not know why he had not thought of it before perhaps he had been afraid but not now very well he would give fazluls men their instructions reston must never reach kalitiri yes it was nearly ready things were falling together nicely he went away almost humming to himself his features had assumed that gruesome deathshead leer packer was not asleep when the intruder entered the darkened cell block he had been lying on his couch staring up into the inky blankness when he heard the outer door slip open when the lights remained off he knew something was amiss as quietly as he could he slid out of the couch and onto the floor of the cell he rolled to the far wall and lay there waiting to see what would happen he waited so long that he began to think that he had only magined the door opening he was about to get back in bed hen there came a distinct click followed by the slight rustling and of clothing he froze every sense was awake tingling with anticipation the hairs on the back of his neck stood up as he peered into the darkness and tried to see any movement at all he held his breath there came another click and a pencilthin shaft of blue light jabbed out and seared into the couch the pulse lasted less than a nanosecond and was followed by two more in rapid succession packer could smell the fumes of the composite fabric and the gel of the cav couch where the laser pulse had incinerated it he feared that whoever blasted his couch would now switch on the lights to view their handiwork for a long agonizing moment packer lay with his face to the floor hoping against hope that the wouldbe assassin would leave then he heard the quiet swish of the outer panel opening and the intruder went away a trembling packer lay motionless and waited for someone to come and rescue him praying that the killer would not return time seemed to slow each minute dragged away painfully each second expanded to fill an eternity he waited at last packer decided that the danger had passed he stood warily and crept to the couch fumbling for the light plate near the head the light winked on and he stared down at the neat charred holes in the couch green gel from the support chambers bubbled out onto the orange fabric the pulses had been calculated to burn through him no doubt about that three black rings in the couchone where his head had been one at his heart and one at his midsectionany one of them would have killed him he was still standing over the couch acrid wisps of smoke stinging his nostrils when he heard a voice behind him he whirled around ready to dive for the floor then recognized ramm standing there watching him you look a little shook up friend said the chief you okay oh its you yeah im all right someone tried to kill me tried to what he punched in the access code and stepped through the door are you joking i dont find this very funny said packer he pointed down at the damaged couch ramm let out a low whistle and turned to packer apologetically man youre lucky to be alive if youd been asleep they would have drilled you i wasnt asleep thank god he looked down at the three holes oozing gel from the depression of his body still outlined in the couch he shivered i want out of here ramm the game has changed these guys whoever they are want to play rough next time i wont be so lucky maybe ramm raised a hand and stroked his jaw i dont know what do you mean you dont know look this was supposed to be for my protection remember thats what you said i wasnt protected very much was i i want out now where will you go back to your quarters to the lab theyll be waiting for you packer had not thought of that he threw his hands out to ramm and said whats going on here this is getting crazy you dont know the half of it come with me well talk in my office packer followed the security chief out of the cell block and into his private office ramm sat down on the edge of the desk and folded his arms across his chest packer sat down in one of the visitors chairs and ran his hands through his red bush of hair you want some coffee something to eat thanks maybe later he waited for ramm to begin i found out a few things this afternoon that strike me as extremely odd i think kalnikov has disappearedi cant seem to locate him anywhere williams is saying that due to kalnikovs condition he was shipped out on the shuttle for medical assistance earthside i dont buy it theres been one shuttle down in the past two days and no injured personnel aboard it according to the records then where is he whats happened to him i dont know i think hes still aboard here somewhere they could have stashed him anywhere packer got a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach he seemed to be riding a swift elevator down trouble is it would take me a couple hundred manhours to find him and then the search would alert whoever it is that has him to move him somewhere else what about the guy who tried to kill me a few minutes ago its between shifts my secondshift crew hasnt signed on yet no one saw anything im afraid what kind of place do you run here packer was quickly losing his temper he had been cooped up in his cell for a day and a night and no one was on duty when the assassins struck ramm dismissed his anger with a swipe of his hand i dont blame you for getting steamed but you have to remember were not a police forcei mean in a way we are but this isnt a high crime area it isnt like a real city mostly we just make sure that people stay out of construction areas and watch the locks on the restaurant pantries after hours that sort of thing we werent expecting a strike youve got to consider that a place like gotham isnt exactly equipped to handle an armed insurrection it isnt in the blueprints nobody planned on that ever happening well grumbled packer maybe its time that somebody started planning for itif it isnt already too late the camp of the bandits looked less like a camp and more like a gypsy village than anything spence had ever seen tents of scrap cloth and tarp sewn together draped over branches or supported with poles scavenged in the jungle gave the place a wild fanciful appearance small children scampered half naked to see the oddlooking visitors old men sat around the ashes of the previous nights fire nodding and pointing and clacking toothless gums as the raiding party returned with the booty women came running to see what their men had brought home for them over all an air of whimsical gaiety prevailed it was hard for spence to imagine that these peaceful happy people made their living killing the unlucky and robbing the unwary he had expected the outlaws hideaway to be a snake pit dark and hateful full of desperate men whose way of life made them vicious and unruly that these thieves had families that ran laughing to meet them amused him quite a picture spence whispered to adjani as they moved down a wide avenue between tents and shelters made from empty cargo crates children ran along beside them giggling and pointing in the manner of excited children everywhere dont let it fool you spencer adjani spoke softly and peered with narrowed eyes at the leader of the bandits walking just ahead of them the cheerful highwayman is the more dangerous believe me these men will not hesitate to disembowel us in front of their wives and children if it pleases them spence thought adjani was being melodramatic about their situation but gita whose tongue had not stirred the whole of the trek into the jungle rolled his eyes and quivered saying adjani knows of what he speaks spence reston listen to him these men are cutthroats for all their easy ways but you cant think theyd harm us now we have nothing of value dont you see they have lived too long above the law they have become secure fearing nothing such men do not shrink from the worst deeds imaginable gita nodded his agreement readily so spence said no more about it still he found himself smiling at the children and gawking around the camp as if he were a tourist on holiday they had marched all night and rested only a few hours before striking off again now the sun stood high in the sky filtering down through the leafy green canopy above the prisoners were paraded through the camp and brought to the biggest tent and made to sit down under a large patchwork awning between two guards while the bandits proceeded to divide up the nights harvest of merchandise piled in the center of the settlement the shouting of the men and shrieking of the women was still in full chorus when the leader disengaged himself from the swarm around the goods and came to stand before them the guards prodded the prisoners to their feet with their rifle muzzles the bandit leader a huge hulk of a man with a spreading belly concealed beneath his flowing kaftan eyed them with interest and then spoke rapidly to gita gita touched his forehead and bowed low the leader pushed through them and went into his tent his name is watti and he wants us to follow him explained gita after you said spence and the three went into the leaders dwelling though the interior was dark the patchwork let in irregular splotches of light decorating the inside with a speckled pattern that lifted and flowed as the tent breathed in the jungle breeze the goonda chief led them to a far corner and opened a flap in the side of the tent sunlight streamed in upon a bed of cushions on which a young boy rested so still that spence thought at first he was dead here was the reason they had been brought the chief of the brigands wanted them to heal his sonthat much at least needed no words the look of the thiefs face told as much as he gazed upon the boys limp form likewise his curt order to them left no doubt about their fate should their combined medical art fall short of curing the boy a leisurely painfully protracted death would commence immediately that spence also gathered without an interpreter gita fell to his knees and began untying his linen sacks and rummaging through them there were bags within bags but he found one he wanted and opened it and drew out an oldfashioned stethoscope which he put on and immediately displayed his best doctorly manner hovering over the boy and listening through the obsolete instrument chief watti seemed pleased and left them to their business i hope we have enough medicine between us to do some good remarked spence when they were once again alone it seems we have no choice replied adjani his breathing is shallow and very light gita frowned he may be beyond help adjani knelt over the patient and placed a hand on his forehead hes on fire the boy is burning up with fever what else do you have in your sack gita any drugs medicine nothing much novocaine aspirin a few antibiotics im a dentist remember the antibiotics might be some help said adjani if we could only figure out whats wrong with him we can try to get his temperature down in any case said spence lets have the aspirin gita reached his hand in and fished around and withdrew a small plastic bottle here sixty tablets maybe enough eh lets give him some antibiotics too and a sponge bath and see if that will help to spences amazed look adjani replied yes antibiotics are still quite useful in this part of the world now then gita go and tell watti we need some water in a basin and clean cloths gita gave him a pleading look yes you for all they know youre the only one that speaks hindi youll be our spokesman gita went out and came back in a few moments they sat looking at the boy helplessly desperately trying to recall the medical knowledge they possessed their lives depended upon such stray information now in a while a young woman in a yellow and orange sari entered the tent with a large bowl of water and several washcloths and towels she spoke to gita shyly and then withdrew a few paces to watch with folded hands she is wattis wife the boys mother at least i think watti has more than one wife she will get us anything we need adjani moistened a cloth and proceeded to bathe the boys fevered limbs spence took four of the aspirin tablets and crushed them while adjani opened several blue and white capsules get us some drinking water and make sure its clean said spence gita relayed the request to the woman who disappeared into the speckled shadows he took up a small cup and poured a swallow of the water into it and stirred in the powdered mixture adjani administered the medicine lifting the boys head and pouring it gently down his throat spence saw the boys ribs poking out of his flesh and wondered how long it had been since he had eaten weve got to get that fever down and get some food into him or were sunk he hasnt eaten anything in weeks by the look of him very likely said adjani and he went back to bathing the unconscious boy the day progressed with aching slowness the three impromptu physicians took turns administering tepid baths and dosed their patient with aspirin at proper intervals they dozed and checked the sick boy for signs of improvement and encouraged one another that they were doing the right things by evening the youngster seemed a little better though it was hard to tell precisely his temperature seemed to have fallen somewhat and he moaned slightly when adjani started the baths again should we try to feed him wondered spence i dont know said adjani with a worried look i think tonight will tell meaning if he makes it through the night hell get better if not hes that bad do you think spence looked again at the prostrate form the boy was pale and sunkeneyed death did indeed seem to hover at his shoulder gita rose from listening with his stethoscope i fear adjani is right his heartbeat is but a flutter we may lose him if we lose him we lose our ticket out of here spence turned and knelt over the boy as if to shake him awake and reason with him come on said adjani well take a walk if the guards will let us i could use some fresh air they stepped from the tent and were met by the stern faces of the guards adjani motioned that they wanted to walk and one of the guards nodded and pushed the other one to his feet to accompany the prisoners on their stroll the people of the bandit village eyed them curiously clearly white men were a novelty to the younger ones and a darkskinned man dressed as a white man was perhaps equally unique the pair drew long unguarded stares wherever they went neither spoke for a while they just walked side by side among the crazyquilt tents and listened to the raucous clatter of brilliant scarletandyellow birds flitting among the treetops and swooping down from time to time in bold slashes of color what are our chances adjani spence broke the silence at last saying what they both had on their minds i dont know it depends on the boy whats he gotsome kind of paratyphoid thats my guess wed need a lab setup to know for sure the point is we cant do much for him the fever is in its third week at least spence was suddenly angry why didnt they get help sooner whats wrong with these people they are backward ignorant the same with poor people the world over it is the way they have lived for centuries they are not likely to change over the death of one small boy on gotham we would have had him cured and on his feet in less time than it takes his father to plunder a caravan but here what can we do it isnt fair fair or not this is the way it isthe way it always will be they had reached the extent of the village and the jungle stood before them a green wall their guard grunted and motioned them with the rifle to turn and start back the slanting rays of the afternoon light shone amber through the trees the tops of the trees glinted gold among the green blue smoke from cooking fires began to thread into the air and the smells of strong spices scented their passage back through the bandit hideaway the men most of whom had slept all day recovering from their nights work stirred from their tents to gather in groups talking loudly evil has many faces does it not said adjani gazing around him this one is not particularly frightening but it is evil nonetheless just then a shout from the far end of the camp reached them spence saw gita standing in front of the chiefs tent waving to them and calling come quickly he speaks come spence and adjani raced to the tent and found the boy eyes hard and black in a face the color of old parchment lolling his head from side to side moaning in weak delirium is he awake asked spence the boys eyes though open had a dullglazed shallow look he is slipping into coma weve got to do something spence said frantically he fell to his knees beside the thin body placing his hand on the frail chest the fevers worse he looked at gita and then adjani with urgent expectation weve got to do something he repeated what would you have us do said adjani anything is better than letting him die like this gita get your pills what are you going to do the only thing we can megadose him with the antibiotics hes dying before our eyes at least this way he may have a chance gita handed him an assortment of plastic bottles containing various drugs spence selected the antibiotics and emptied the contents of a handful of capsules into a small bowl gita find the boys mother instructed adjani tell her to bring us honey or sugar wateranything sweet to drink lots of it and hurry dont die yet whispered spence as he worked hang on kid hang on gita returned and handed spence a vessel of liquid spence smelled it and said smells like flowers what is it jasmine water they drink it like tea it is heavily sugared very sweet good thats what we want he poured some into a bowl with the crushed pills im no medic or i would have thought of this hours ago the glucose will boost his metabolism hes got to fight that fever the boys mother entered and brought a jug of liquid which she handed to spence he smelled it and coughed phew what is that gita sniffed the jug and diffidently placed a tip of his little finger in the liquid and brought it to his tongue mmm it is puyatinectar of the gods fermented palm sap one develops a taste for it yeah well we cant give him this why not undoubtedly he drinks it already and the alcohol might do him some good youre quite a country doctor gita but i have a better idea spence grabbed the basin adjani was using to bathe the boy and dashed the water out of it he poured it full again with the palm liquor now we have an alcohol bath that ought to cool him off quicker adjani nodded and dipped the cloth into the reeking brew when he had finished he turned to spence and took the cup from his hands swishing the liquid around the rim several times he lifted the boys head and administered the medicine then he turned to the others well thats done now we wait well take turns watching him and bathing him round the clock spence looked at the weak pathetic figure wasted painfully thin by fever their lives hung by the slenderest of threads as fine as the breath which raised the little chest slowly and regularly and all but imperceptibly will any of us live to see another morning spence wondered the next few hours would tell what are you doing here ari had become aware of unseen eyes on her she whirled around and met hocking gazing at her with an unhealthy leer on his bony face she had not heard him enter her father was asleep on one of the couches across the room and she thought of waking him but decided not to i have only come to see how my charges are getting along hocking said with oily civility have you everything you need let us go you cant hope to gain anything by keeping us letting you go would be somewhat awkward at this point im afraid weve gone to an enormous amount of trouble to get you here but maybe we can strike a bargain there was a slight whirring noise and the pneumochair slid closer hocking dropped his voice and his obsequious manner i want to talk to you if you cooperate i might be able to help you i have a plan a plan for what for resolving this messy affair once and for all whispered hocking slyly he glanced around as if to make certain no one overheard him how do i know youll live up to your part of the bargain you dont but youd be foolish to pass up any chance you might have to secure your freedom ill tell you something miss zanderson there are forces at work here that stagger the imaginationfar beyond your comprehension you are but an infinitesimal part of a design greater than men dare dream that i am offering you a chance to save yourself should be enough for you as much as she distrusted the loathsome being before her she wanted to believe there might be a way to influence him to release them i dont know if i should listen you little fool ortu wants you dead youre a nuisance to him but if you help me ill get you out of here safely you have no choice i wont ask again hocking glared at her fiercely well all right what do you want me to do come with me now and be quiet ortu has eyes all over the place ari slipped after the floating chair as it flew along darkened corridors and down spiraling stone steps deeper and deeper into the bowels of the palace it was all she could do to keep pace with the egg gliding before her finally they reached a large wooden door at the bottom of a flight of steps hocking paused before the door and it swung magically open before them closing on them again once they had entered the room was large and dark rank with the musty smell of age and silent as a tomb there was a soft hum and a click and instantly the room was washed in white light ari blinked and threw a hand to shield her eyes in a moment she lowered her arm and saw that they were in a room with stone walls at the very roots of the palace the light came from two huge lamps set in the ceiling but otherwise the room had no distinguishing featuressave one the enormous apparatus glinting coldly before them what it looked like she could not describe it seemed insect like to heras if it were a construction of nature rather than human engineeringbut it had a strong metallic appearance the gleaming black thing stood on tall legs over a small platform with a sling chair on it the chair she recognized as being a more or less common variety but it was strangely out of place among the protruding knobs and convolutions of the sleek machine altogether the thing had a vague spidery appearance what is it she asked her voice quavered giving away her anxiety this is merely a simple communication devicea sort of radio you might say it amplifies and projects brain waves it wont bite you my dear ive used it myself many times its quite harmless i assure you ari was not assured she liked her collaboration with the enemy less and less with every passing second youre going to put me in that arent you she stated im going to ask you to assist me yes that is after all why you came shall we begin hocking indicated that she was to take her place in the chair ari mounted the platform uncertainly and settled herself in the chair perching on the edge of the fabric seat you may as well make yourself comfortable said hocking as he went about readying the machine this will take some time what are you going to do hocking could not resist a smirk at her weakness humans he thought were all alike scared children in the presence of things too vast for their puny intellectual powers you will not feel a thing there will be no sensation whatever see we are already beginning hocking lied there was an immediate sensation and an unpleasant one ari suddenly felt dizzy as if the room had shifted and the feeling in her fingerswhich she held clasped together in her lapfaded away for a long moment she could not focus her eyes but the feeling diminished and she felt rather than heard a deep vibrant thrum moving up through the platform through the chair and into her very bones she clamped her teeth shut to keep them from vibrating two long pincerlike claws came down over her head ari closed her eyes so she would not have to look when she opened them again she was bathed in a shimmering blue aura it covered her like a gossamer gown the light in the room had dimmed and hocking was nowhere to be seen she sat motionless and gazed into the flowing light it seemed a part of her and she thought she had never seen anything so beautiful it sparkled with unearthly radiance flecked through with silver beams which burst like tiny comets as they played over her form she relaxed and centered her mind on the dancing light as she did a numbness overtook her starting at the base of her neck and working upward over her scalp the feeling was unusual but not unpleasant she let it creep over her until it seemed that her head had become isolated from her bodythere was no longer any connection between the two that she could feel but at the same time this did not alarm her she accepted it calmly and noted it somewhere in the back of her mind aris breathing slowed and she felt herself drifting it reminded her of those last waking moments just before sleep overtook herthat delicious nether region between wakefulness and sleep when the body relaxed and the waking mind gave itself over to the subconscious in a moment with eyes wide open as if stargazing on a starfilled night ari began to dream she heard a voice nearby it was the voice of her father and she was a little girl playing with her doll on the porch of an old house the voice said ari where are you im here daddy she replied she looked around but her father was not there she continued playing with the dolls frilly pink dress and heard again her fathers call this time she rose from her play and looked out across a green lawn the lawn was newly mown and smelled of cut grass a light summer breeze blew clippings across the walk her father stood out on the grass and she saw him and waved to him come along ari follow me he said but he did not look at her he seemed instead to look beyond her this frightened ari she could not think why her father would not look at her im coming daddy she called as her short little legs scrambled down the porch steps her father turned away and was walking quickly across the lawn in long strides toward a dark wood which grew near the house daddy the young girl cried wait for me the figure of her father reached the wood and stopped he looked back and motioned her onward and then stepped in among the trees ari reached the place a moment later and stood outside hesitant and frightened daddy come out i cant see you she shouted her tiny voice fell away among the trees no answer came from the dark wood the afternoon sun stretched the shadow of the old house across the lawn and ari drew away from it she stepped lightly into the forest and was immediately immersed in deep blue shade and black shadow this way ari she heard her father say the voice came from just ahead of her she ran forward stumbled picked herself up and ran on she caught a fleeting glimpse of her fathers back as he moved through the tangle of branches wait she called i cant keep up but the figure of her father moved on never looking back little ari began to cry the tears streamed down her face and she sat down on the ground and wailed why are you crying ari the voice was warm and gentle the little frightened girl sensed in it a friendliness and understanding she turned and saw a tall man standing in the light of the fading afternoon sun golden and serene he was unlike any man she had ever seen he seemed to exude peace and kindness lie large yellow eyes looked down on her with benevolence my daddy left me she sniffed her fear dissolving here was someone who would help her i tried to follow him but i got lost im scared dont be afraid i will help you i am your friend the figure reached out a hand and ari took it noticing with a childs curiosity that the hand had but three exceptionally long fingers come with me ari and the tall being turned and walked out of the wood and back onto the lawn toward the house but as they neared the old structure it began to change the walls melted and rearranged themselves the roof slid away the porch became a great courtyardthe house transformed itself into a palace of shimmering gold is this your house asked ari her eyes sparkled at the scene yes answered the being but now it is your house as well you will live with me forever they drew nearer and entered the palace through a magnificent gate of scrolled silver a group of people were waiting for them and when these people saw ari they all cheered and made sounds of welcome they moved across the courtyard ari heard beautiful music playing inside she saw a wide gallery lit from within by glittering lights and heard laughter echoing through the palace a wide bank of stairs led to the gallery and she ran to the foot of the stairs ari someone called she looked up and saw her father surrounded by many others standing on the stairs waiting for her daddy you came back never leave mepromise look whos here said her father he raised his arm and stepped aside at the same moment the people gathered around him parted and a beautiful woman dressed in white stepped forward the woman came down the steps holding out her arms for ari the little girl looked and at first did not know who the woman was she looked again and saw that it was her mother mama ari squealed instantly she was swept up in her mothers arms and cradled to her breast ari my beautiful beautiful child murmured the woman ive missed you so much ill never leave you again ari overcome with happiness pressed her head against her mothers neck and wept for joy she heard the voice of the golden being saying today your dreams have become real you dont need them anymore give them to me and you can live here forever when ari awoke she was back in the closed room with her father ari ive been terribly worried about you where have you been you were unconscious when they brought you in are you all right she sat up and grabbed her throbbing head im okayi think oww my head hurts ive been asleep for nearly two hours where did they take you ari looked at her father his words puzzled her take me she dimly remembered hocking coming for her and going somewhere dark and unpleasant but nothing more i dont think they took me anywhere yes they did you were gone when i woke up you should have told me where you were going i was worriedyou were gone so long was i she rubbed her head and closed her eyes it made no sense nothing did really she had a vague picture of talking to someone and a warm pleasant feeling associated with the picture but who she had talked to what they had said anything at all about the meeting she could not remember it was as if a piece of her mind her memory had been taken from her wiped clean she could not remember but the warm pleasant feeling lingered and she smiled as it flowed over her like a gentle breath of air wherever i was it was the best place i have ever been she said i feel like i was in paradise packer disliked escaping from chief rammit made him feel like a low criminal but he had no other alter native he simply could not stand the thought of remaining in the cell another minute waiting to be picked off like a rat in a basket whoever had tried to kill him would try again he felt certain of that and certain that this time they would succeed probably last time they had been scared away by ramms coming back to the block next time they would be more thorough ramm for all his help had demonstrated that he could not protect his prisoner and though the security chief still main tained that the safest place for packer was locked up in his protective cell packer disagreed he had tried it ramms way now he wanted to try it his way on his own he would be able to put some distance between himself and his assassins so he had escaped finding the opportunity when he was left alone outside the cell for a few moments while men from housekeeping installed a new couch in his cell he simply had tapped in a new access codeone that required a single digit then he had taken a length of stiff wire from one of the housekeepers tool carts and slipped it up the sleeve of his jumpsuit he waited for the end of the shiftthe exact time when his first attack had comeand when he was certain no one was around he produced the wire and went to work on the access panel bending the wire through the vent holes in the upper portion of the plastic portal the burly physicist had been rewarded with success a half hour later when the door slid open he walked out of the cell block and through the security station like a cat on hot coals but he had not been seen or challenged now he hurried toward his own quarters in the hien section changing levels and taking the tube tram partway and getting off two stops before his own to backtrack and see if he was being followed he reached the hien section and went directly to his quarters while he took precautions against being followed it never occurred to his trusting heart that his office and living mod would be watched he entered with the flood of relief which all hunted creatures experience upon reaching the safety of their lairs his relief proved shortlived as his hand moved toward the access plate a voice said dont do that my friendif you want to live a little longer packer froze in the darkness he withdrew his hand and whirled around to face the unseen speaker he heard a slight creak and a click and a light struck him in the face he blinked and put up his hand who is it what are you doing here his questioner demanded the voice was unmistakable kalnikov kalnikovwho else packer saw a hand reach out of the darkness and push the shade of the desk lamp down the face of the big russian leaned into the pool of light grinning i am sorry olmstead i had to make sure it was you what are you doing here the pilot shrugged i heard you were being held and i came to the only place they would not likely searchthe room of one of their own prisoners one of their prisonerswhat do you mean i was under protective custody voluntarily oh i see they gained your cooperation at a very cheap price then kalnikov what are you talking about ramm and the others how many others i do not know yet but they mean to take over gotham ramm kalnikov nodded slightly didnt you guess they fooled you completely i guess they did packer switched on the lights and crossed the room collapsing in a chair kalnikov settled back at the desk and rested his long arms on the desktop he looked boyish and bemused a sly smile jerking the corners of his wide mouth whats so funny you soviet sausage were both in big trouble i was just thinking how surprised you looked just now im glad it was me that met you rather than someone else you scared me i wasnt expecting a welcoming committee your trouble is that in your country you do not have a sufficient tradition of deception to make you naturally suspicious it is very helpful in situations like this one it allows you to view your position with a certain amount of objectivity well then comrade skeptic what does your naturally suspicious nature tell us we should do it tells me we should do what freedom fighters in my country have always donego underground brilliant snorted packer on a donuteven a big tin donut like this onetheyll find us sooner or later there is no underground my unbelieving friend there is always an underground you will be amazed at what we will find come nowthe russian giant got to his feetgather up your things from this moment on we are invisible spence had never heard an authentic death rattle before but when he heard it now he had no doubt what it was terrible and appalling these were the last fighting gasps of a human life he had been sitting halfasleep beside the boys sickbed nodding through the third watch the boys mother crouched at the foot of the bed dozing fitfully adjani and gita lay sound asleep in a far corner of the tent gita snored softly like a slumbering buffalo mired in his favorite wallow at first spence thought that the rattle like the gurgle of a broken water pipe came from outside the tent nearby he roused himself to look around the sound came again and he stared in horror at the boys bluetinged body the pale lips parted the eyes sunken head tipped back the young face aged beyond its years by the illness and the glowing fire of fever the eyelids snapped open and unseeing eyes burned out like black coals the hideous sound bubbled forth from his young throat he watched in mute terror as death grappled handtohand with life for the body of the youngster death was winning the contest spence called out in the darkness to gita and adjani fearing to leave the boys side for an instant lest the inevitable happen no sound came from his friends they slept on then suddenly the gasp was cut short and an expiring hiss escaped from between the boys teeth spence stared down helplessly that was it he was gone the boys mother now fully awake her eyes wide with terror sprang forward in a sudden rush of grief clutching at her childs legs burying her face in them for a moment she lay there as though stricken dead herself then she raised herself up and looked at spence with eyes full of sorrow and reproach and rushed out of the tent spence was alone with the body no he cried you cant die he grabbed the small fragile body in his hands and shook it as an angry child would shake a rag doll then thinking more clearly he placed his mouth over the boys nose and mouth and blew gently he laid the body down and placed the heels of his hands over the boys heart and gave a quick downward thrust he blew into the open mouth again and alternated with quick blows to the chest god dont let this boy die spence prayed beating on the little chest with the heel of his hand please god save him please spence was only partially conscious of the prayer but he offered it over and over again as he worked transforming the words into an urgent litany sweating and quivering at the same time head quivering at the same time he worked like a robot gone berserk performing his ritual over and over again and mumbling under his breath the plaintive prayer for god to spare the boys life he labored this way for many minutes without response from the child at last muscles aching sweat stinging his eyes spence collapsed lightheaded over the still body and began to cry god in this stinking land of death is it too much to ask you to save one life where are you dont you care he sobbed more out of anger and frustration than sorrow where are you it was no use god did not intervene in his creation anymoreif he ever did his eyes and ears were elsewhere attending the birth or death of a galaxy perhaps but not to be bothered with the passing of an insignificant goonda boy spence sat up drying his eyes he looked sadly at the small body pale and still in the lamplight he groaned i could have believed in you god i almost did he shook his head a stirring of regret as much for his own broken faithso tentative and unformedas for the death of the child passed through him i almost believed he placed a hand on the boys forehead and felt the warmth of the fever diminish as the body cooled it made no sense this stupid waste the sights of the last days flooded back on him he saw a horde of stumplegged hunchbacked beggars and starving children pressing gaunt faces toward him he saw whitened corpses bobbing in the rancid river like so many thousand buoys he saw the teeming darkness spreading over the city and knew this to be mankinds ancient enemy seeking to destroy the hapless victims cowering beneath its shadow god why spence pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes why why why the challenge went unanswered spence looked at the young corpse lying so still and light upon the bed it almost seemed that the slightest breeze would blow the small shell away like a leaf in the wind as if in answer to the mental image spence felt a slight movement in the air and heard the rustle of the wind iii the leaves outside the tent he raised his head and listened to the night sounds in the jungle all had become deathly still spence fancied he heard footsteps outside the tent and then heard the bark of a camp dog the breeze stirred again becoming stronger he felt its coolness on his damp skin the walls of the tent rippled under it the lamp flickered and brightened and then everything became quiet the wind stopped the tent fell into flat folds again the lamp flame still and dimmed the world seemed for a moment to hang balanced on the edge of a thin knife blade one breath would send it toppling off on one side or the other spence held his breath to keep it balanced he stared down at the dead boy in that moment eternities were born time evaporated spence felt its barriers dissolve and flow away he saw everything in crystalline clarity hardedged and in microscopic detail the dead boys pale almost translucent skin the tiny black sweep of his eyelashes the fine rounded curve of his nostrils the delicate line of his thin bloodless lips the silken shaft of each black hair brushing his templesall this and more spence saw in a marvel of dumbstruck awe each object in his gaze had taken on a fierce almost painful beauty he was overwhelmed he wanted to look away to close his eyes to keep the sight from burning out his eyes but dared not he was held by a power stronger than his own and knew he could not escape it then as his eyes took in the terrible wonder of the dead boys body he saw a tiny flutter just inside the tender hollow of the throat he heard a sound which seemed to thunder inside his brain though it must have been barely audible it was the long shuddering whisper of breath being drawn into the nostrils and filling the lungs it was the sound of life reentering the young boys body the breath stoppedspence wanted to gasp for air himselfand then it was released the small chest sank it seemed like an age before the chest rose again slowly the breathing continued becoming steadier stronger and more regular spences mind reeled as he saw color seeping back into the boys cheeks and the pulse in the throat beating rhythmically he knew then that the boy would live and not die the miracle was complete spence threw himself on the frail body and hugged it to him he placed a hand on the boys forehead and felt the warmth of life returning but the fever was gone when spence raised himself up dashing tears from his eyes once again two dark eyes were watching him with curiosity they blinked at him and then a little hand reached out for his spence grabbed it and held it tightly he was sitting there looking into those bemused young eyes clutching the small hand when a commotion arose outside the tent he heard voices shouts halfangry cries and then suddenly the tent was filled with people foremost among them was the goonda chief spence glanced around as the crowd tumbled in with a rush by the expression on chief wattis face spence knew the moment should have been his lastthe man held a long dagger in his hand ready to strike the mother of the boy crouched at his elbow biting the back of her hand the others hung backmostly women already raising a lamentation for the dead boy and other goondas with their rifles at the ready but the bandit leader took one look at his son lying there with a feeble smile on his lips holding the hand of his physician and let out a whoop of jubilation the dagger spun from his hand his wife leaped to her son and cradled his thin figure to herself spence stood slowly and looked around adjani and gita staring and blinking at the confusion around them rose up and came to stand beside spence what happened said gita eyeing the rifletoting goondas warily these stared back at the prisoners and shook their heads incredulously you wouldnt believe me said spence i scarcely believe it myself did we miss something asked adjani spence turned to regard the boy now completely enveloped in the embrace of his father no nothing much ari sat on the small balcony of her room in the tower the sunlight bathed her upturned face with its warm light and touched her golden hair transforming it into spun sunbeams she looked an angel wearing a mortal cloak but dreaming of its celestial home her thoughts were far from angelic she had in the days since hocking first enlisted her aid begun to fall into reverie and melancholy her father watched her withdraw into herself by degrees until she hardly spoke at all and sat daydreaming for hours at a time on the balcony when he ventured to move her from these fits of solitary introspection she would smile wistfully and say oh dont worry about me daddy i was just thinking though what she was thinking about she would never say the elder zanderson had begun to believe that she herself did not know he also believed and rightly so that it had to do with the visits hocking paid her and their trips to who knew where to do who knew what she did not speak to him of what went on and increasingly she resented his continued asking about those secret sessions so he had become a silent worrier he held his tongue though it crushed him to see his daughters spirit withering before his eyes to fend off the growing sense of dread and doom he felt encircling them he had begun a course of conversation designed to keep her mind occupied and centered on the present but even his ebullient monologue failed to prevent the girls odd moodiness she would get up in the middle of a sentence and go out on the balcony to sit and stare out into the courtyard or as she sat now with her face toward the sun in an attitude of reverence his worst fears of a lifetime were taking flesh before his eyes his daughter seemed to be slipping into the same strange malady that had claimed her mother and that was almost too much to bear ari he said gently coming to stand beside her on the balcony what are you thinking about dear oh hi daddy i didnt hear you come out i asked what you are thinking about oh nothing really i dont know it must be something youve been out here a long time a sad smile played on her lips have i im sorry i left you sitting alone again didnt i oh well ari look at me the girl rolled large languid eyes toward him i dont want you to go with him when he comes who daddy hocking hes putting you under some kind of spell hes stealing your mind nonsense she laughed and the sound pattered down like light rain into the courtyard below why would anyone want to do that its impossible besides im not so sure anything is impossible anymore but if he hasnt put you under a spell you tell me what he has been doing where do you go what do you do we dont go anywhere really a room i think we dont do anything honestly i have to go i am helping the last was added almost as an afterthought zanderson pounced on it like a hungry cat helping who are you helping ari turned her eyes away and gazed out across the wall to the green hills beyond im helping she could not say more ari look at me dont you see whats happening to you you dont remember why youre doing it youre not helping ari youre being used hes using your mindyoure becoming a a vegetable the outburst brought a wispy smile to aris lips she raised her hand to her face and rubbed her cheek distractedly i do feel a little funny sometimes its so strange she turned away again her father brought her back taking her shoulders and turning her around what is strange what do you remember tell me its so strangei feel so sleepy inside like my head is stuffed with cotton arihe took her hands and pressed them in his own promise me you wont go with him any more you have to stop now before theres nothing left will you promise all right daddy if you like no darling its not for me its for youdo it for your own sake hes destroying you dont let him resist she looked at him vaguely he wondered if she heard him at all he decided to try a new approach to make her understand remember when you said that wed be rescued soon i believe it now i do rescued you said that spence knew where we were and hed come and free us well i think you were right i think hes coming now hell be here soon whos coming daddy spence thats what im telling you spence is coming ari regarded her father with blank uncomprehending eyes as if he suddenly started speaking a foreign language i dont think i know who youre talking about spence your spencedr reston dont you remember i dont know him she replied slowly and turned away again closing her beautiful blue eyesnow the color of shallow ice poolsand turning her face once more toward the sun her father staggered back into their room like a man stunned by a blow he collapsed dazed on a bed of cushions then he raised clenched fists to his temples and began to weep the sun rose a liery red gong above a green hillscape three tired travelers witnessed the sunrise with burning eyes they had been marching through thick forest undergrowth all night and were exhausted and hungry not having eaten anything substantial for nearly two dayssince being expelled from the goonda camp as sorcerers the spectacle of the red sun casting its bloodly glare over the thickly forested steeply undulating hills brought but little cheer to the party the relatively commonplace sight of the hard beaten rockstrewn crumbling road did however improve their spirits somewhat there it is shouted gita i see it through those trees there the fat little man dashed through the thinning brush and rushed out onto the old highway he fell on his knees and kissed its sunbaked surface in a show of heartfelt gratitude like a primitive seafarer making a successful landfall at last old toothless friend we meet again crowed gita adjani and spence standing over him watched with amusement i do not think i have ever seen a sight so wonderful or welcome he continued gazing ahead into the distance a road is a marvelous thing it beats scratching through jungle thats for sure offered spence he too turned his eyes toward the north and saw the wall of mountains purple and hazy in the distance their faces still cloaked in nights gloom how far do you think it is adjani cocked his head and said we cant be sure but id say siliguri is still a hundred kilometers to the north and dar jeeling is half again as far yes and all uphill from here said gita any chance of hitching a ride very doubtful merchants are the only ones with vehicles our caravan undoubtedly turned back anyway that was three days ago even if they decided to go on they would be there by now spence squinted his eyes into the distance well then we have no other choice we walk gita let out a small whimpering noise and said it seems the road and i are destined to become very good friends but he added on a more optimistic note i have always wanted to see the mountains they turned toward the mountains and began walking along the road easily falling into stride spence noticed that the air seemed lighter less dense and humid he took it as a sign that they were beginning to climb ever so slightly up the grade toward the rarefied heights of the mountains the freshness revived him somewhat clearing his tired mind and inflating his sagging spirits with nothing but the rolling road before him he let his mind wander where it would as it had often in the gloomy hours when they traveled by night the prospect of the impending clash with the dream thief intruded on his thoughts what would happen when they reached their destination he did not know and hardly dared guess for now it was enough that some distance still lay between himself and his enemy he felt in a way securealthough why this should be he could not say since the dream thief had shown himself able to cross astronomical distances to touch those he wished to touch no barrier seemed able to stop him and where he was not physically present his underlings were knowing what he knew it seemed surpassingly strange to spence that he should be pointing his feet toward the dream thiefs secret home on a path of certain destruction but that is exactly what he was doing in the end he knew it was the only thing he could do spence wondered if he were being drawn to his fate by the dream thief himself it often appeared to be the casehe felt an impulse within him that did not come entirely from his own heart could the dream thief manipulate his thoughts and if so how did he know when his thoughts were being manipulated which were his own and which belonged to the other he pondered these things and he had pondered them often since leaving calcutta he was deep in thought when he felt a nudge at his elbow you look lost sahib adjani fell into step beside him studying him i was just thinking how foolish we are to be rushing like lemmings to our own destruction he swiveled his head around and took in adjanis reaction to these words and then turned again to his feet shuffling along you and gitayou dont have to go you could turn back gita should at any rate he has a family to think about yes thats one way to look at it is there another way of course there is always another way lets hear it then it seems to me that we are three illequipped insignificant hardheaded dogooders who havent got the sense to get out of trouble when they have the chance were fools for thinking we can face up to the dream thiefwhoever or whatever he is its sheer lunacy how can we even dream wed make a difference you know that the rise and fall of empires the fates of whole nations often hinge on the will of a single human being one man of firm dedication can stand against an army i dont know how this is going to end any more than you do but i believe that the light that is in you and in mein all of us is greater than all the darkness in the universe god is working in you spence he has marked you for his own and who can stand against god spence could think of no one offhand does that make you uncomfortable to be chosen sure it does anyway why me that is precisely the question you cannot ask i know his ways are not our ways and all that precisely spence continued walking im not buying it what difference does it make if i believe in him or not what possible difference could it make in the outcome you believe and look where its got you youre staggering down some godforsaken road on a death march for heavens sake and for what to a believer no place is godforsaken the indian continued you dont fool me reston this protest is the last gasp of a dying agnostic youre running swiftly away from godright into his arms but to answer your question id say it makes every difference in the world what you believe belief is the sense organ of faith as your eyes are the sense organ of sight with sight you see the world with faith you see god belief has the power to shape reality imagined reality your personal perception of reality no reality itself as it iscold hard factual reality spences scowl deepened over his face he was in no mood for listening to a lecture on the philosophy of reality from professor rajwandhi but it appeared he had no vote the tack adjani chose next however surprised him look at that mountain peak out there which one i see several the center one with the white cap do you see it yes i see it spence said flatly lets be scientific about it and call it the point of observation the focal point now does it exist or doesnt it of course it exists are you sure prove itbetter still show me the focal point can you pick it up smell it taste it does it take up space or have any dimensions no answer no of course not a focal point is not a physical thing at all and yet it exists we can prove that it exists because of the things we can do with it we can use it to gauge distance and height we can direct radio waves to it to accomplish any number of things in other words the focal point exists because it produces effects we can perceive but cannot account for in any other way if you were to stand on that mountaintop right at the focal point i could view you with a telescope but you would feel nothing at all while being observed you would not in any way be able to detect the point of observation and yet with it i could learn a great deal about you ah but where does it go when im not thinking about it or believing in it it doesnt exist at all then precisely are you trying to tell me god is like that not at all im trying to tell you that belief shapes reality in unexpected ways your belief in the point of observation enables you to do things you couldnt do if you didnt believe in it get it spence scratched his head his scowl was lifting being replaced by a look of puzzlement adjani continued pushing home his point look at it like this because you believe in the focal point you react to it in certain waysit is real for you and it shapes the world as you see it believing in it even affects your behavior if you looked through a telescope and saw a lion running toward you down the road what would you do climb a tree spence had become absorbed in adjanis argument of course you might do any number of things but you would not say to yourself the focal point does not exist therefore the lion does not exist only a fool would react that way oh well it might surprise you to know that is exactly how youve been reacting toward god i dont see it that way explain it to me then if you can the remark drew no response from spence he glared ahead stubbornly shall i explain it to you go aheadits your nickel you seem to have all the answers adjani ignored the jab and went on as if he had not heard it how clear does it have to be for you god is meeting you at every turn spence think about it back there in the camp you prayed for a little boy who died and he lived again on mars you yourself should have died and yet you survivedagainst all odds you survived and what is more a creature from an alien civilization awoke from a sleep of five thousand years to tell you himself about god and you insist you cannot see it adjani threw back his head and gave a little laugh what must he do to get through to you what will it take before you believe must these stones rise up and shout he waved a hand over the rough rocky path before them although he posed as the antagonist in these discussions with adjani he actually agreed more than he admitted spence had reached the same conclusions the night the boy had been revived it had affected him more deeply than he could express to another person he had thought about very little else since that moment he relived it constantly still savoring the strangeness the awful vividness of it here was a reality that surpassed all previously known realities he had ever experienced it was as if the source of all life had passed through him for one blinding instant and in that moment he had seen himself and the world as he had never seen it before the memory of it left him weak perhaps that was why he was fighting so hard not to believe adjani was rightif he believed it would change him he was merely clinging to the last shreds of his tattered naturalistic world view giving it up was not easy and not a thing done capriciously much of who he was the person he knew himself to be was wrapped up in that cold concise computergenerated view of the universe adjanis question still rang in his ears he turned to answer not knowing what he would say but feeling it in his heart he opened his mouth to speak suddenly like a blast of hot wind which shrivels the tender leaves of grass a wilting sensation passed through spence he tottered a few steps threw down his bundle and clutched his head he turned and looked at adjani eyes wide and staring ari ari he cried and dropped unconscious to the ground when spence came to gita was holding his head between his pudgy hands leaning over him adjani held a tin filled with water up to his mouth here drink this slowly thats right spence moved to sit up his head throbbed wildly but other than that he felt all right how long was i out he rubbed his head and rolled it around on his shoulders as if to see if it was still in good working order not long a couple of minutes maybe it is too hot to be traveling on foot in the daytime said gita he had been saying that ever since they struck out on the road without stopping that morning i think we should rest no we go on replied spence firmly maybe well find some transportation gaur is just ahead didnt you say sunstroke is nothing to sneer at spencer reston gitas dark complexion had taken on a distinct ruddy tint the exertion of their trip was telling on him we should rest a while anyway gita is right it is getting too hot to be tramping around in the middle of the day we can move on at dusk spence squinted up his eyes and gazed skyward the white hot ball of the sun seemed to strike down at them with a fury perhaps it had been a touch of sunstroke which had felled him perhaps but there was something else too he remembered calling out for ari when it had struck and he still vaguely felt that sheor someone elsewas trying to get in touch with him in some way he lowered his gaze to regard gita and adjani black spots swam before his eyes and he reeled unsteadily sunstroke repeated gita it is not good wed better rest spence for a couple of hours at least spence nodded and they moved up the road a few meters to a huge spreading banyan tree there to recline in the shade among the snaking branches and hanging trunks he sipped some more water and sat for a while with his head in his hands the landscape far to the north wavered like a projection on a fluttering screen as waves of heat rose up from the land he had not noticed the heat before but was acutely aware of it now gitas bulbous blue turbanned head found a rock to prop itself on and soon his snores filled the air with a sleepy sound flies buzzing among the interwoven limbs of the tree droned on and spence felt the strain and tension melt away he lay back against the cool bark of one of the trees innumerable trunks and stretched his legs out before him at once he felt more relaxed he sat for a time listening to the snores and the flies and the occasional bird call and let sleep steal over him the sun was orange and already reaching toward the horizon when spence woke up again gita still snored and he could hear the slow regular rhythm of adjanis breath rising and falling in the shade nearby the flies still buzzed around their heads and the birds still chattered in the upper boughs of the tree but there was something else too and that something else whatever it was had brought him out of his nap he listened straining into the silence of the forest around them not moving a muscle it came again almost in answer to his searcha muffled snort and a low rustling sound as if something big was moving through the underbrush the sound trailed off as he listened and it sounded further off than he remembered though he could not be surehe had first heard it in his sleep spence got to his feet and stepped back out onto the road he paused to listen again and then began walking along the roadside in the direction they had been traveling his senses were pricked sharp and he had an unaccountable feeling of being directed to seek out the source of the sound which he could not explain he glanced back toward the tree where adjani and gita still slept and then hurried away on his chase the road dipped just ahead into a narrow valley as spence reached the crown of the hill and started down into the valley he thought he saw something dart away into the brush at the side of the road there was just a blur of movement as he swung his eyes to the spot and then the quiver of roadside branches where the thing had entered although he did not know what it was that he followed he strongly suspected that it was not human he had ceased to think about the possibility of encountering another band of goondas although the likelihood of meeting them on the road was just as great as before closer spence slowed and crouched moving with as much stealth as he could manage the inner voice which had roused him said go on quietly he obeyed he slid to the side of the road where the bushes grew thick and nearly impenetrable he could hear the sound of leaves rustling and branches snapping a hollow snuffling like the wheeze of an expiring engine came filtering through the brush and then the noise stopped spence did not move a hair he remained halfcrouched and halfstanding peering into the dense growth and he had the uncanny sensation of being examined by someone or something unknown there was a muffled footfall slow and deliberate moving toward him the bushes right before him shook their leaves gently and then he saw something long and thin moving out snakelike from the wall of hedge instinctively he jumped back the thing withdrew in the same instant but he had seen something even as he jumped that told him what he wanted to knowa small pink lip and two nostrils he stooped down and pulled up a handful of long grass by the roots and moved back out onto the road he lifted his voice and called out simba come simba now he waited and nothing happened though he could sense the thing waiting for him he repeated his odd summons extending the grass in his hand then came a soft snort and the bushes shook and parted and out stepped a great gray elephant the beast advanced on spence slowly warily trunk wavering reaching out scenting him it stepped closer with ponderous grace and shook its huge head from side to side ears flapping as it tried to make up its mind about him then it saw the grass he held and the trunk swung down and nuzzled the offering spence flattened his palm and the elephant took the gift in with a facile movement of the tip of the flexible appendage and swung it up into its mouth nice simba said spence softly steady girl nobody is going to hurt you he continued speaking softly and reassuringly as he looked the creature over from a distance that the elephant was in distress he noticed at once for as soon as it had stepped free of the surrounding brush he saw the empty howdah on its broad back clearly it had run away after becoming separated from its mahout then he saw the reasonblood trickled down from the animals shoulder and there was a ragged raw piece missing from its ear there was blood on the ear as well goondas thought spence they had attacked the driver and his passengers and the elephant had escaped he did not know whether elephants were at all common in that part of india but very little surprised him about the country anymore he could as easily imagine a caravan of elephants as a convoy of clanking antique sedans the elephant having accepted the peace offering from the nonaggressive human decided to accept the man as well it stepped closer he remained rock still the trunk swung out and began examining him thoroughly poking at the pockets of his jumpsuit and snuffling at his neck and wrists he endured the scrutiny with dignity and selfcontrol marveling that a beast so large could move so deftly he called it gently raising his hand to caress its trunk feeling the quivering warmth of the creature simba easy now im your friend im going to take care of you good girl good simba the trunk curled around his hand and pressed its pink lip against his palm he stroked the trunk and then stepped closer to pat the huge cheek would you like to come home with me huh you would all right then follow me come along he stepped away from the animal and turned his back he walked slowly and deliberately restraining the impulse to stop and look back to see if the elephant were following he wanted to act as if he expected the animal to obey him as it would obey its proper master spence was rewarded when he felt a slight tug at his arm and looked down to see the tip of the trunk curl around his wrist he patted the trunk and walked on when they reached the banyan tree the two stopped and spence called out wake up guys i found us some transportation adjani was the first one on his feet hey he shouted in amazement where did you get that he advanced slowly and came to stand in front of the beast and a little apart from it letting it get used to him careful youll hurt her feelings this is simba and shes agreed to take us the rest of the way to darjeeling adjani wrinkled his face and peered at spence askance you pretend to know this animal not at all admitted spence i thought all elephants were named simba i found her just up the road shes been hurt gita hearing the commotion rose up slowly rubbing his eyes he took one look at the great creature and let out a shriek save us he cried throwing his hands in the air but seeing that everything seemed to be in order and that the elephant was munching proffered grass not attacking adjani he got up and joined his friends a real elephant he said proudly over and over as he looked at it from every angle i knew there were still some of these magnificent animals in the north country but i never dreamed id see one are they so rare then wondered spence oh yes very rare indeed no one is allowed to own one but the high government officials they are much protected and used as official vehicles by the regional governorsjust as in the time of the maharajahs better than a motor car well this one wasnt protected enough said spence shes been shot go get your bundle of medicine and well see what we can do for her at this gita threw up his hands once more shot oh merciful heaven who would shoot a governors elephant who would do such a thing goondas is my guess if thats true said adjani we might find the rest of the party up the road at the scene of the ambush i hadnt thought of that do you think any goondas are still around not if they attacked a government carrier theyd have hit and run pretty fast theyd be far away from here by now reprisals in such instances are fairly swift and bloody gita came back with his medical sack and laid it on the ground i dont have enough medicine to treat an elephant he lamented dont worry i dont think shes hurt very bad here take a look yourself spence pointed out the torn ear and the wound in the shoulder behind it gita probed the wound with his fingers while adjani kept her busy with bunches of grass the bullet did not enter the flesh announced doctor city after his inspection it was deflected off the hide probably due to the angle of the shot and an inferior bulletthey often load them from used casings you know we will rub some sulfa into the wound and smear on some mud to keep the flies out of it and keep it from getting infected in a few days shell be beautiful again will she trust us to ride her do you think gitas eyes grew round you intend to ride this animal certainly all the way to darjeeling you shouldnt act so surprised i said wed need some transportation and here it is gita went away muttering to himself in an incomprehensible babble adjani laughed and spence patted the animal on the jaw and looked into simbas calm bluebrown eye and said youll have to help us girl this is our first time show us what to do when the time comes all right the elephant seemed to wink at him and encircled his neck with her trunk good girl good simba were going to be all right gita came back with a pile of mud on a large leaf he sprinkled sulfa from a brown bottle into his hand and gently worked it into the wound in the elephants side that done he smeared the mud over it as a bandage well we have done what we can then lets go do you know how to drive this thing asked adjani no but it cant be too hard ive seen it in old movies lets see spence walked to the head of the elephant and said down girl down simba nothing happened mehrbani se simba said adjani the elephant lifted its trunk and nodded sinking down on its knees laboriously i thought you didnt know anything about elephants said spence he doesnt gita quipped it just means please in hindi adjani smiled and spread his hands it worked didnt it well who first asked spence it is your elephant sahib you go first adjani patted him on the shoulder all right cowards i will all you do is grab an ear and spence stepped up on the elephants knee and took hold of its right ear and swung himself up behind the head nothing to it adjani followed and climbed into the howdah then it was gitas turn he stood trembling on the ground well come on you cant walk all the way with us and we cant leave you behind for the goondas you might as well get it over with it is easy for you spencer reston but i have a wife and five beautiful daughters a man must think of his family come on gita were wasting time already the shadows of the forest were moving across the road and in among the trees deepening in shades of blue spence reached down his hand come on your people have been doing this for a million years at least gita bit his lower lip and handed up his bundles then he clasped spences hand and scrambled up he did not stop scrambling until he was in the howdah clutching the sides all aboard called spence here we go whats the word adjani mehrhani se at the command the elephant rose up and began walking spence found that she was easily steered with a gentle kick behind the earwith the right foot to turn right with the left foot for left a kick with both feet simultaneously made the elephant go faster off they trundled swaying like kings of old aboard their fabled mounts with tusks sheathed in gold spence found the ride exciting this is what i call going in style he shouted over his shoulder to his passengers now do you believe adjani yelled back im beginning to spence said to himself i think im beginning to toward morning spence was awakened by the sound of thunder in the hills as the sun came up a leaden rain started leaning out of low murky clouds the three stirred themselves and sat huddled under the banyan tree that had sheltered them through the night they munched soft overripe mm goes and sweet pears gita had bought for them in the let marketplace and waited for the rain to stop it might go all day remarked gita sagely it often does this time of year we are nearing the rainy season if it doesnt stop soon well have to go on anyway said spence he had begun feeling more and more uncomfortable about aria feeling somehow connected with his fainting speil the day before he had a strong sense of danger where she was concerned and this sense made him impatient to reach hers soon as possible they waited half an hour more spence leaning first against one of the trees trunks and then another was soon pacing like caged bear it isnt going to stop he announced arriving at the end of his patience lets go on gita made a face like a man smelling rotten eggs he heaved his round shoulders and shuffled to his feet dont worry gita remarked adjani the bath will do us all good they stepped out into the sullen rain and untethered simba who also had been crushing the pulpy pears in her massive jaws the elephant greeted her new masters with a rousing trump and examined each one and his pockets as she knelt and let them board her then they were off heading northward climbing slowly upward toward the mountains spence saw the land through the hanging white mists and noted that it had changed a great deal since calcutta the jungle had become forest of a different type the greens were deeper tending more toward blue in the misty rain sown in among lower trees he spotted tall pines shooting up out of the foliage around them and he could smell their scent in the air spence tough used they had risen several thousand feet in altitude already the climb had been so gradual as not to be noticed nevertheless he sensed a difference in the airit seemed hasher and last night had been a little cooler than he remembered since coming to india they rode at a good pace for nearly an hour each one cloaked in his own thoughts like gita wrapped in his turban trying to keep out the rain which slowly seeped into everything anyway they came upon a small stream running across the road simba waded into it and then stopped and drank she stood splashing her trunk in the water and blowing bubbles before squirting water into her mouth spence let her have her fun he did not know when they would be able to stop for a drink again as the elephant stepped out of the stream he felt a quiver run through the animal like an electric shock and she froze instantly in midstep trunk reaching out wavering as she sifted the air for a scent up ahead the road wound sharply around a bend and was hidden behind a wall of forest spence could sense nothing that would make her react in such a way but he knew better than to doubt an elephants instinct what is it why have we stopped asked gita his soggy turban dropped around his ears and eyebrows making him look like a waif wearing his fathers clothes shhh hissed spence he gave a chop with his hand to cut off further discussion he nudged simba gently with his feet and she went slowly forward with a ponderous silent grace he marveled at how smoothly and quietly the creature could move when she wanted to they crept toward the bend in the road spence lay down on the elephants head and peered ahead as far as he could as they came around the trees he saw in thead few objects of undetermined nature and then he looked down and saw something he recognized well a severed human arm thumb missing lay directly in the middle of the road bloody and pale it had been washed clean by the rain white bone gleamed painfully from the torn end and the arm itself seemed to indicate a warning halt it said go no further lifting his eyes from the grizzly memento he saw the lions there were two of thema male and a female both wet and draggled by the rain the big male was tearing at a carcass splayed in the center of the road while the female sat on her haunches waiting her turn to feed the carcass had been worried beyond recognitionas had the others he now saw littering the areabut spence with a sudden sickness in his stomach knew what they were the shreds of clothing the shoes and sandals hat and gun told him all the lion sensing the intruders for the first time glared up defiantly and loosed a snarl that turned blood to water simba stood her ground raising her trunk high overhead and in a tight curl the lion growled more fiercely and then seized up the carcass with a snap of its jaws and dragged it off across the road into the forest the tawny lioness followed with the miffed air of snubbed royalty that was close said spence he grimly looked around the scene of carnage i thought they were going to challenge us lions are cowards remarked gita though i was feeling none too brave myself still not many will go against an elephant we must be near jaldapara whats that many many years ago there was a great wildlife sanctuary called jaldapara i have heard that there are still lions there apparently they abound this is what is left of the governors party observed adjani i dont see anything to save well have to report this to the authorities in darjeeling i wonder if there were any survivors spence urged the elephant onward stopping only once to direct her to retrieve an official cap which had been worn by one of the governors aides the goondas probably did not leave any survivors said gita the only reason they allow the merchants to live is because they want them to go back and amass their goods so they can rob them another time but this words failed him he shivered merciful father protect us they resumed their trek through the scene of ambush spence saw things lying in among the bushes on either side of the road but he did not peer too intently lest he discover what they were he had seen enough the next days were indistinguishable one front anothermuch as the towns and villages they passed through they rose to swollen skies and rain soon after dawn the rain continued until midday whereupon the sky cleared and the sun burned with vigor to turn the road and surrounding forest into a steamy smothering welter the landscape changed little offering only hills and more hills some with spectacular gorges and deeply cleft valleys between but after so many of these impressive sights the travelers grew numb to such profligate magnificence india the country of too manytoo many people too many languages too many religions too many customs too many problemshad too many wonderful sights as well the effect was to deaden as all the rest deadened too in this strange land but as they began to ascend the final climb up to the high hills of darjeeling spence noticed that the forest thinned and became scrubby the trees were shorter and the hills more pronounced and steeper twice they crossed ancient suspension bridges whose cables had rustedmany had snapped and now dangled uselessly into the cataract belowand the missing steel plates formed open trapdoors to be cautiously avoided once they met a dozen or so pilgrims buddhist priests who were making a pilgrimage to buddhgaya to the south they wore bright yellow dhotis bedecked with garlands of white magra flowers that looked like little bells and waved their prayer flags at the elephant as it passed murmuring and chanting as they went along not more than fifty meters away from where they passed the happy pilgrims they encountered a beggar squatting in the road spence could see the mans leg outstretched beside him and he whined piteously as the elephant approached flinching away from it but making no move to scuttle out of its path the wretch raised imploring eyes to the travelers and spence looked down as the elephant deftly stepped around the human lump in the road then spence saw the mans leg curled beside him in a grotesque and inhuman curve he stopped simba and slid down from his perch adjani and gita quickly followed the beggar seeing this response went into wild and fearful lamentations afraid that the travelers would beat him and steal his pittance yet wanting their help anyway oh said gita looking at the mans leg it is not good at all it is very far gone he lifted the filthy rainsoaked rag that covered the mans frame and spence saw the hideous sight the leg was a festering mass of greenblack flesh ulcerated and oozing pus and blood what can we do for him asked spence turning away nothing said adjani he is beyond our ability to help hes dying the cloudy eyes the listlessness spence beheld in the beg gars slack features confirmed adjanis diagnosis but he refused to accept the injustice of such a hopeless pronouncement were going to help him he said tersely if not to live then well at least help him die like a human being adjani gazed at his friend with wonder you are right spence it is the least we can do spence turned to view the chanting pilgrims as they hurried away their song still hanging in the air is your god deaf and blind he shouted after them venting his outrage doesnt he care is he even there at all spence picked the man uphe seemed to weigh nothing at allhe could feel his bones hard through their paperthin covering of skin and rags adjani held the injured leg gently as they moved him to the side of the road the beggar regarded them with scared feverish eyes and whimpered with pain at being moved he has probably been sitting there for days muttered adjani spence looked at the place in the road where the man had sat it was dry and the footprints of the buddhist priests in the mud passed mere inches away from where he had been gita produced his medicine sack and began assembling some articles which might be of some help he also brought the man a drink of water and some of their store of mangoes and pears the man drank thirstily but refused to eat a bite of the fresh fruit he continued to watch them with mute suspicion as they exposed his leg and set about cleaning it the sight was almost more than spence could stand and the stink of it brought tears to his eyes the foul limb had rotted away to nothing resembling a human appendage using a collapsible canvas bucket they found in simbas howdah he fetched water from a nearby ditch running with clean rainwater a few curious crows who had been watching the beggar from a distance now assembled on the branches of a nearby tree for a closer look gita and adjani delicately picked up the leg which by the look of it had been crushed in an accidentperhaps when he had dived in front of an oncoming vehicle for some scrap of refuse someone had tossed to the ground spence began pouring the water over it bathing it and washing away the filth and ooze this exertion started the blood flowing freely again over the gangrenous flesh and the gentle flooding of the water dissolved the decaying skin and muscle flesh and bones dropped from the leg as the water splashed down the limb split and the stench of putrid flesh overcame spence the bucket dropped from his hand and he turned aside as the contents of his stomach came surging up spence wiped his mouth on his sleeve and grimly picked up the bucket but before he could begin again a crow from the tree above fluttered down and seized a small bone with a morsel of flesh still clinging to it the bird snatched up its prize in its yellow beak and jumped back into the air and away theyre hungry too said gita do not blame them spence tears brimming in his eyes raised the bucket and poured the rest of the water over the leg they then tore up one of gitas muslin sacks to use as a bandage they wrapped what was left of the limb carefully and neatly in the dry cloth they started to strip the sopping coverings from the beggar to clean him up but he clutched at them so furiously that they let him keep his rags gita offered more fruit speaking softly in the mans tongue explaining that they were not going to hurt him and did not expect to be paid for their kindness the beggar gingerly accepted the fruit and opened his mouth full of blackened rotting teeth to eat he took two or three mouthfuls and then lay back still watching them as if he expected them to pounce on him at any moment he closed his eyes and with a long whimper and a violent shake of his bones he died spence could not understand why the beggar died so suddenly and so quietly he looked at the still body in amazement and then turned abruptly away spence its all right said adjani coming close to him we did the right thing we did what we could spence shook his head sadly it was not enough gita standing over the body with outstretched arms said see how he died spencer reston this one of the streets who in his life never knew a moment of compassion or concern knew both at the moment of death he ate and drank and was bandaged and someone knew of his passing spence looked at the body for a long time trying to comprehend the life this discarded bit of human litter must have known he could notany more than he could imagine exchanging places with a jellyfish the gulf between their respective worlds was just too greatlightyears apart but spence in an effort of pure selfless compassion had tried they wrapped the body with the governors flag which they found rolled into the howdah and carried it a few meters into the trees beside the road they laid it in a hollow beneath a tree and with their hands covered it with raindamp earth father said adjani as they stood over the grave receive one of your own they climbed silently back onto the elephant once more and rode on into siliguri every time august zanderson looked at his daughter he saw the image of his insane wife ari had grown by degrees more listless and confused as the days passed and she continued to follow hocking to their secret rendezvous each time she returned just a little more forgetful a little more vague a little less ari she did not eat well and had grown pale and hollowcheeked she now slept a great deal and even when awake seemed lost to the material world it was as if the young woman was turning into a ghost before his eyes he had argued in vain for her to stop meeting hocking but he had no control over her every time hocking came she was ready and waiting for him though he came at odd times of the day and night zanderson had threatened hockingalso in vainand had offered himself in his daughters place this had brought nothing but mocking laughter and derision but seeing his daughter wither before his eyes made him determined not to let her go without a fight he planned to confront hocking next time he came he had broken a chair leg and hidden it close to hand in case his point needed driving home with extra persuasion now as ari slept like one of nights children he paced before the door waiting for the summons he knew would come in time when he heard the rattle of the bolt in the lock of the huge heavy wooden door zanderson squared his shoulders and took his place just inside the entrance hocking swept into the room and at first did not see that his way was barred by the form of the director but their eyes met and flocking seemed taken aback somewhat though he recovered instantly saying get out of my way get back aris staying here hocking leave her alone get away you fool im warning you and im telling you its over youre not taking her away from here any more i wont let you hockings features sharpened at the challenge what will you do director how will you stop me dont force me to defend myself i will zandersons voice rose with anger im warning you get out of here and leave her alone stay out of this you dont know what youre doing im only trying to help you help me ha look at her zanderson waved his hand wildly toward aris form shes been sleeping all day shesexhausted if this keeps up youll kill her hocking glared at the man before him his hand flattened onhe tray of the pneumochair im telling you for the last time to yet out of my way the director stepped slowly aside hocking moved forward to pass him and quick as a flash zandersons hand snaked out and matched up the club he swung it full force at hockings skull the move was not fast enough hockings finger twitched on his knurled tray at the same instant and the improvised club bounced in the air a bare centimeter from his head and fell away stunned amazement blossomed on the directors face as he watched his wellaimed blow go awry hockings eyes narrowed and his lips drew back in a snarl of rage how dare you assault me his voice crackled over the chairs audio system zanderson his determination evaporating raised his weapon once more and brought it down he felt the chair leg meet a resistant force which deflected it from its target at the same moment he felt his fingers tingle and his hand grow numb the club grew heavy and fell from his hand the next thing the director knew he was on his knees his hands clamped over his ears as a highfrequency sound burst through his brain the sound drained all strength from his body and he toppled heavily to the floor i would have expected better of you director imbecile i should squash you like the insect you are hocking moved a finger on the tray and the directors eyes screwed shut with pain and then he rolled on his side and lay still eyes staring vacantly at the great vaulted ceiling above the white ovoid chair spun in the air and hocking glanced up ari stood in front of him with a gentle almost whimsical expression on her face her deep blue eyes seemed soft and unfocused she looked like a little girl daydreaming hocking noticed that though she must have seen what had happened ari seemed not at all disturbed by her fathers demise he quickly recovered himself are you ready ariadne yes she said in a voice furred with sleep im ready take me to the dream machine you know the way you lead this time said hocking ill follow darjeeling was as different from calcutta as sea from sewer fresh clean sparkling with quickened vitality it perched on a steep crown of hill at an elevation that made the visitor lightheaded it was so far from the india spence had thus far experienced that it might have been on another planet surrounded by imperial mountainstwinpeaked kanchenjunga the foremost of these kingsand purified by the thin sundrenched air darjeeling glimmered like a rare gem in spences eye a vast shell of blazing blue sky spread over all like a silk canopy and everywhere he looked tiny blue birds flitted from rooftop to street to rooftop the people of darjeelingnepalese tibetans bhutias lepchas and others of obscure originseemed sturdy and healthy and glowing with friendliness spence found the city nearly as intoxicating as the altitude especially after the long string of lowland towns indistinguishable in their filth and misery darjeelingjewel of the himalayas crowed gita i never hoped to see it they climbed the nearly vertical streets of the carefully terraced city drawing long gapes and shouts from the colorful inhabitants many of whom wore centuriesold tribal costumes of silk and feathers and ornamental silver jewelry children seeing the elephant scampered after them laughing and pointing their ascent through the lower portions of the city to the upper brought them and their unofficial procession to the seat of the government climbing short flights of steps and landings which seemed to go on without end they at last came to the handsome goldendomed raj bhavan the governors palace immaculate emerald grounds were enclosed within white brick walls sparkling in the sun with flecks of mica handpruned miniature trees lined the broad drive leading to the palace itself a living relic of the british colonial era when the elephant arrived in the street before the palace the guards at the iron gates took one look at the animal and the noisy crowd behind and ran to apprehend them with rifles lowered they met them yammering and gesturing excitedly gita yammered back at them and kept pointing at the palace after a quick consultation one of the guards ran away to fetch his captain while this was going on spence looked around him as one in a daze the mountains so close they seemed within reach towered up on every side so that wherever he looked he saw a new and striking vista from this spot on bicth hill the government district the rooftops of darjeeling slanted away in descending ranks giving the impression that one stood on the very roof of the world the citys busy inhabitants went purposefully about their business with rolling exuberance and toothy smiles in their broad faces spence was enchanted by all he saw and was content lust to stare and drink it in the governor will see you now the words brought him out of his daydream he turned around to see a shortall the people of this place were of small staturebut wellbuilt man in a crisp green uniform standing before them he smiled showing a row of neat white teeth but his snapping black eyes spoke of the turmoil their visit had plunged his staff into follow me please the scrolled iron gates creaked open and with the captain at the elephants head they began moving up the treelined drive at the wide palace steps they dismounted and were ushered in through two huge bronze doors spence heard a loud trumpet behind him turned and saw simba trunk waving in the air being led away in the care of two keepers with goads goodbye old girl said spence and thanks for the ride i had forgotten that we would have to give her up said adjani sadly i was growing fond of her spence sighed and nodded the governor by contrast with his subjects was a tall man of princely bearing spence found it easy to imagine that he had somehow been transported back in time and sat in the presence of indian royalty in the time of the moghuls white marble gleamed at every turn some of it covered with rich oriental carpets potted palms sat in great beaten brass jars and the almondcolored walls were hung with animal skins and carvings of jade and alabaster ivory and teak the ceiling also carved with the intricate stylized designs of elephants lions and dancing maidens glittered with gilt and was supported with large serpentine columns of green marble in one of the palaces many audience rooms they sat in an alcove formed by a screen that had been carved from thin slabs of yellow marble in the figure of thousands of intertwined roses red silk cushions on great rattan chairs made the travelers feel like members of nobility as they sat sipping tea and conversing with the governor a hamal of the governors serving staff hovered nearby with silver plates of small nut cakes and sweetmeats i am very distraught over the attack on my ministers party nevertheless i am pleased to have ambooli my elephant returned and to learn of this outrage against my authority i am grateful to you for this kindness it shall be rewarded is there anything else which i may do to show my gratitude you have but to speak thank you governor but your hospitality has been proof enough replied adjani it is nothing it would please me to know that while you remain in darjeeling you will make my home your own we seldom receive such auspicious guests and i would enjoy the pleasure of your company a quick flick of his wrist with fingers extended sent the hamal scurrying away you see it has already been arranged governor began spence please enough of titles to you i am simply fazlul his smile was gracious charming and unaccountably reservedas if he were playing a game which required him to smile but obviously felt it an imposition upon his true feelings spence noticed that the governors eyes kept darting to the screens around them as if he expected at any moment to leap up and surprise an eavesdropping assassin on the whole fazlul had about him an air of subtle crafty meanness which he held in check by diplomacy and refined manners their host looked every inch the ruler of old capable of presenting his guests with a fair daughters hand or sewing them up in goatskin bags with wildcatswhichever fancy happened to strike him at the moment yes fazlul repeated spence we have heard that there are ruins of an old palace somewhere in the hills near here would there be someone who could direct us do you think oh you are an archaeologist i thought so the moment i laid eyes on you of course you know that these hills hold many secrets there are many such sites which might interest you palaces temples cave tombs shrines this was once the center of the world you know and i would like to believe it will be again however i will assign our state historian to confer with you and advise you he will provide you with a guide and am sure will wish to accompany you himself as you will see you shall all become very popular visitors i hope your stay is a long one because i think you will not have time to accept every invitation which is sure to come your way but tonight you will be my guests at a banquet which commemorates the celebration of naag brasputi it is a local festival very colorful i am sure you will find it amusing the governor rose and placed his palms together and raised them to his chin namastey gentlemen until tonight the three guests stood and bid the governor good day and watched him walk awayshoulders high back straight and hands held close to his sides as if wearing the crown and carrying the scepter of his office i feel like i have just had an audience with the king of siam said spence you are not far wrong said adjani his is an imperial line that goes back centuries he is a proud and ruthless man remarked gita even in calcutta we have heard stories about him it would be better for us that he did not esteem our company so highly the governor had contrived to impress his guests he could not have succeeded more ompletely they were called from their rooms at duskafter they had napped bathed and changed into new muslin clothesand were conducted to a great banquet hall which opened at one end onto a vast lawn people of all typesofficials servants other guests and dignitaries were assembling in the hall and on the lawn a circus appeared to be swinging into action walking out onto the broad green lawn in the fiery violetandorange sunset which lit the mountain peaks around them with cool flame the three saw jugglers fireeaters snake charmers and acrobats a man hanging by his heels from a rope swung round and round on a long pole whirling as he went other performers walked tightropes and everywhere dancers displayed intricate and facile movements to groups of applauding onlookers laughing youngsters threw flower petals and splashed perfumed water on all the guests and strains of exotic music filled the air people from the city poured into other palace lawns and soon the noise and revel reached the threshold of chaos though a gay sort of chaos spence adjani and gita moved among the crowds and gawked first at one strange sighta man who drew wide acclaim by swallowing live snakes and then drawing them back out an inch at a timeand then at anothera man who pushed long steel needles through his cheeks and eyelids and the skin of his throat spence found the festive atmosphere exciting and repulsive at the same time he felt like a country rube who had come to town to see the freak show it fascinated and amazed but left a queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach all of it was utterly beyond his experience foreign and inexplicably odd nothing in his world of books and instruments hinted at the existence of this world he was seeing he had nothing to compare it to adjani hovered at spences shoulder watching him with keen interest and explaining when he could what they were seeing and something of the significance behind it gita also sup plied helpful explanations but he was too caught up in the spectacle as a participant himself to count on as a guide his round form could be seen darting here and there in the crush to join a dance or thrust into the forefront of an audience he was soon decked in layers of flower garlands his face shone with boyish enthusiasm clearly anyone would have thought that the entire show had been produced for his enjoyment alone as the first of the evening stars came out adding their bright light to the color below spence and his companions were shepherded back into the banquet hall where they were seated at an enormous table at the open end overlooking the roistering scene of the celebration they and other dignitaries and ministers at the table were given bowls of rose water and hot lemonscented towels to freshen themselves from their exertion then hamals began circulating with trays of delicate iced cakes and other appetizers the governor appeared at a balcony just above the lawn in full view of his guests at the table and the festival crowd a thunderous chorus of acclamation greeted his arrival the guests at the table stood and were no less enthusiastic in their welcome than the populace on the lawn fazlul resplendent in gleaming white tunic and trousers a long flowing white mantle edged in silver and a white turban with a huge sparkling gemstone on his brow raised his hands to the adoring revelers and silence descended over them in a hush he spoke a few words which spence could not understand and then raised his hands once more and the celebration erupted into life spence guessed that their beloved leader had given his blessing to the occasion and commanded that the night be enjoyed to the full obviously the order was immensely popular with all who heard it they threw themselves into its execution in all haste the governor and his wife a statuesque darkhaired beauty clothed in shimmering pale green descended the broad staircase that joined the balcony with the terrace and moved among their honored guests they stopped at each place and spoke with each guest briefly before moving on soon they were standing before spence adjani and gita the three stood uncertainly as the governor announced to his wife these are the men i told you about who saved ambooli gentlemen my wife sarala with a smile of warmth and cheer the lovely lady raised her pressed palms together and inclined her head toward them namastey my friends thank you for saving ambooli she is as you may have guessed my husbands favorite it was a regrettable tragedy but we are glad that you have come to us please enjoy yourselves i hope that i will have the pleasure of an audience with you alone very soon news of the world comes so seldom to the mountains she smiled again and spence saw the hint of a wink and visitors even more rarely we must sit down and have a long talk the pleasure would be ours replied adjani smoothly the governor nodded stiffly and moved away saying enjoy the evening it will be quite fantastic i assure you he was certainly restrained whispered spence to adjani when fazlul and sarala had gone did you notice he didnt look at us all the time his wife was speaking yes strange adjani shrugged perhaps our stay here should be a short one i would feel better if we werent imposing on one so powerful is he so powerful do you think i dont know what to make of him adjani shrugged again im sure were making more of this than we should i can think of no reason why we should come under his suspicion maybe not but i have felt danger from him both times we met all at once a rattle and a clatter broke out just in front of the terrace musicians in costume with drums and tambalas and native flutes struck up an eerie otherworldly music and a score of dancing girls came running the floor show said spence dancing is a way of life in india everyone dances and the various dances have special meanings this is a festive dance a dance of joy the girls costumes are handed down from mother to daughter over many generations to dance well is to please the gods though intricate the steps and hand movements performed to the rhythm of the drums seemed to spence to be more strutting and posing than dancing but he drank in the sight of the lithe supple bodies in their colorful red green and gold shifts with gold bodices and bare midriffs gold necklaces and earrings and noserings glittered in the light as the girls danced slowly at first but with ever increasing tempo one dance was followed by another and anothersome times with male dancers sometimes with female and sometimes mixed food on steaming platters arrived and adjani supervised the filling of spences plates providing a running commentary on what each dish was and its relative spiciness toddy flowed freely and spence drank the sweettasting liquor in great gulps chasing the food with little regard for its potency in a short while he was gazing on all around him with glittering eyes and a beaming if hazy disposition a troupe of actors took the improvised stage as the dishes were cleared away spence watched the incomprehensible dramawhich seemed to him to center on the discovery of ants in one of the characters items of clothingand slipped into melancholy perhaps it was a reaction to the strong drink or to the events of the past several days at any rate he felt himself sliding deeper and deeper into a bleak and cheerless frame of mind heightened by the noise and gaiety surging all around him adjani noticed his friends pensive demeanor and regarded him carefully he was not surprised whenduring a parade of floats in honor of brasputispence rudely got up from his chair and walked out onto the lawn without saying a word to anyone the other guests at the long table were already mingling among the celebrants once more so no one noticed spences odd behavior he moved into the throng dancing around a gigantic effigy of the greenskinned sixarmed brasputi and was swept away in the flood of torchbearing dancers he was not actually aware of his depressed emotional out look to him it merely seemed that he lost interest in the revel around him and sought a quiet corner to himself he brushed past leering papiermache statues wearing garlands and grinning with lusty smirks on their green faces and shook flower petals out of his hair as he moved through the jostling crowd he took no notice of these things or of any of the other thousand sights before him his eyes were turned inward for he had begun to brood upon the object of his affection ari she had not been entirely out of his mind for more than a minute at any time since they had parted company at the asylum near boston in all that had happened to him since his uppermost thought had been of her that something very wrong was happening to her he felt in his heart it seemed to come in waves striking at odd moments like the time on the roadas if he were being summoned the feeling had come strong upon him as he sat over his dinner he felt it like he felt an ache in his soul she was in trouble and needed his help now as he moved across the lawn in blind retreat from the raucous festivities he felt the pangs stronger than ever he knew he was close to hersomewhere in these green hills she waited he could feel her closeness as if she were beckoning to him across the distance in a silent call only his soul could hear he began to run blindly recklessly he jogged across the lawn and found an open gate in the wall and ran out into the swarming streets of darjeeling in his mind he heard a voice urging him on run find her she needs you hurry every second counts run and he obeyed the streets of the city were alive with the festival crowds moving their floats toward the raj bhavan later the images would be taken to the lake nearby and set ablaze and pushed out into the lake on their small barges while fireworks lit the night sky symbolizing the victory of naag brasputi over his enemies but now the parade was in full procession and the dancing chanting townspeople vied for the favor of the governor in presenting the biggest or most richly adorned effigy like a salmon running against the stream he fought the current of people moving toward the palace one thought and one thought only drummed in his brain find ari find her before its too late he dodged here and there among the mobs and at last came upon a dark and quiet side street he stood for a moment looking down its steep decline go the voice said hurry he went when he reached the bottom of the street he found himself on another level of the city this one somewhat poorer and less well kept than the government section the streets were narrower and the houses thrust up against one another and towered overhead they were for the most part vacant their inhabitants having joined the main celebration elsewhere in the city spence listened to the sound of his own footsteps as he ran along pausing only at intervals to find some new path without his knowing he was quickly moving out of darjeeling proper toward chaurastha the citys ancient nucleus he did not notice that he crossed several bridges nor did he hear the swift splash of the icy water below these bridges marked the boundaries of darjeeling when he crossed them he moved into old chaurasthacity of dreams the streets fell away steeply in terraced flights and steps flashed darkly beneath his feet but he continued driven by the urging he heard within him he seemed directed toward a place he did not know but believed he would recognize when he found it he let his legs carry him where they would the moon gleamed full overhead in the city above he could hear the merrymaking of the multitudes but here in the old city silence remained undisturbed he could see the orange glow of thousands of torches in the sky but here it was dark he stopped to look around him and heard the rasp of his own breathing echoing among the dark walls and passages of the sacred city and the occasional bark of a dog he went more slowly walking among the oddshaped houses and shops in the deserted town and came to a narrow old foot bridge he crossed it and found himself before a temple the wide wooden gate was open so he went in he moved like a shadow across the temple yard toward the small stupa in the center the stupa was hiveshaped like all the others he had seen but different he entered the shrine and felt the cool breath of the evening on his face and neck as he slipped into the darkness the shrine was lit for the most part by moonlight falling through the hole in the center of the dome but two torches burned before the deitys stone altar spence moved toward the altar it was a plain stone slab with words carved in it which he could not read he stood gazing at it for some time blinking in the flickering torchlight the feeling of having been directed to this place ran strong in him he looked around and shook his head as one coming out of a dream in which he finds that his dream has come true how had he come to he here where were adjani and gita why had he come spence passed a hand before his eves had he blacked out again no he did remember certain things running down darkened streets pushing through crowds garish idols grinning at him it was all there and yet it must have happened to someone else along with the feeling of waking from a dream overlaying all other sensations was the unaccountable certainty that he had been here before he would have sworn his life on it the shape of the stupa its interior the design of the altar and the words carved upon itthey all seemed very familiar and yet very strange if he had been here before he told himself it must have been in another life or on some other planet it had been on another planet mars all at once it came flooding back on him and spence staggered under the weight of the memory the stupa was an exact replica of the krassil he had visited in tso the ancient city of the vanished martians he moved toward the idol standing in its niche behind the altar and raised his eyes the stone gleamed with the oil libations that had been poured out upon it by the priests but there was no mistaking the figure of the deity naag brasputi with his oddly elongated limbs and narrow body and huge staring allseeing eyes was the very image of kyr he let his eyes travel down the long arms to the wrist and the folded hands and saw what he knew he would see naag brasputi had but three fingers spence stumbled backwards and fell against something soft that clutched at him he whirled around to see two eyes in a face floating in the darkness behind him spence cringed back and a voice spoke to him had the very devil of a time following you adjani said bloodhounds couldnt have tracked you better adjani its youwhat are you doing here spence fell back and raised his hands to his head which had begun to throb like a tambourine in the hands of a firedancer why did you slug me so hard i didnt slug you but i should have running out of the governors party like that what were you thinking of spence glanced up at his friend with a sickly scared expression adjani saw it and knew what it meant another blackout not a blackout it was different it was like someone telling me what to do i remember everything but its all sort of hazy the details of his flight through the city came swimming back to his pulsing head lastly he remembered his discovery adjani look he made to turn around but had to grip the sides of the altar flaming arrows of pain stabbed through his brain do you see spence pointed to the idol watching them smugly from its niche i see what is it old naag brasputi i gather spence grabbed adjanis sleeve and shook it no look again adjani looked at the tall thin image in gray stone more closely he turned and said it is unusual and very old but its kyr or someone very much like him its a martian i swear it are you sure this isnt the toddy talking or im positive its the very image of a martian dont you see its all true heres the proof one of their ships came here they settled in these mountains adjani eyes narrowed and hand cupping his chin stepped close to the idol and examined it carefully so this is what martian looks like i will admit that it looks remarkably like you description of kyr complete down to the threefingered hands and look how tall he is it certainly doesnt look like any of the other gods at all and i know why this one is very old carved long before the idols took on their classical stylized fore after a while the priests started making the gods appear more human man made god in his own image is that it more or less but this one is an example of what they must have looked like before that happened do you think this is the dream thief its hard to say dream thief is more a demon spirit he takes many shapes adjani looked at the carving on the altar and ran his hands over it i cant read the writing here its a dialect i dont know gita might know it yes he might well bring him here tomorrow right now we had better get back to the celebration before were missed they left the shrine and darted back across the teeple yard in the moonlight their shapes became those of spirits springing up out of the stones of the shrine and escaping into the night they hurried back across the footbridge and through the old town upon reaching the ancient bazaar spence stopped wait his voice was a stiff tense whisper adjani froze in his tracks listen both men trained their senses into the darkness around them far away they could hear the sounds of the celebration still reverberating into the stillness the salutes of fireworks rang like distant gunshots of goondas in the hills i dont hear any adjani began shh spence cut him off then he heard what had stopped him though for a moment he did not know why it was a mere rustling of leaves upon the paving stones a whisper of a sound like the echo of the days traffic seeping back up out of the cracks that had absorbed it adjani heard it too what is it at first spence did not know what to say then it came to him it was a sound he had heard in a dreamthe sound of death on rushing feet dogs come on they ran down the narrow street between crumbling facades of the aged buildings the moon shone between the buildings from above and he could see far down the street as if he were looking at a canyon whose ridges of stone rose in towering banks on either hand adjani ran at his side and they heard the muffled rush of the feet behind them spences lungs burned in his chest he was not used to such exertion at high altitude yet he ignored the pain and ran on through one street and then another he threw a quick look over his shoulder and saw the glint of eyes in a churning black mass formless in the shadows sweeping ever nearer to them then they were in a courtyard bounded on three sides by a high wall and open to the street it was a marketplace he smelled the sweet stench of rotting fruit and meat the paving stones beneath his feet were slippery with filth refuse piles formed dark mounds across the market square a rat scuttling across the square stopped raised up on his hind legs and sniffed the air then jumped away and disappeared down a drain hole adjani leaped to an empty stall and came back with two long objects he thrust one of them into spences hand herejust in case spence looked at his hand and saw he had been given a heavy length of wood he glanced from it to the street behind and saw the moonlight ripple on the backs of the dogs as on a swiftly running stream glinting on the curved white slivers of their teeth its too late said spence even as he spoke he heard an enormous slavering growl as the dogs sprang into the deserted marketplace pouring in through the narrow gate of the street and spreading over the stones in a flood toward them jaws snapping hackles raised ears flattened to their angular heads just like in his dream throw down your club a voice said inside him throw it down its over god help us cried spence shaking himself out of the numbing lethargy he felt stealing over him it was as if a dream were trying to swallow him whole the dogs more than two dozen of them scattered across the marketplace ringing them in the pack leader a huge black animal with a broad snout and long fangs leapt forward with a throaty growl spence raised his club and swung it down the dog dodged aside and another jumped up from nearby he swung at it too adjani was already busy on his side the dogs ran around them barking and snarling and dashing in to slash at them with their teeth as yet not daring to close in for the kill they would try to wear down their prey first spence and adjani stood shoulder to shoulder fending off these feinting attacks with their clubs how long they could hold out like this spence could not sayalready he felt the strength in his arms fading the run through the streets had tired him the dogs edged closer and the black leader ran yapping around the pack whipping his mongrel soldiers into a foaming frenzy jumping on his hind legs and clacking his jaws in the air as he shook his head the dogs were all around them now within striking distance at any moment they would rush in the first would fall with battered skulls but the humans would not be able to get all of them spence could almost feel their teeth in his flesh tearing and tearing stand back to back said adjani we can protect each other they moved to take up this position and as if on signal the dogs charged them at the same instant spence heard a flurry above them a rustle in the air as of leather wings out of the corner of his eye he saw a strange shape descending the dogs saw it too and a few of them turned to snap at it he saw a flash of silver in the moonlight and all at once the air vibrated with a sound that seemed to bore through him the foremost of the dogs fell to the ground as if they had been slain with a single unseen blow they rolled whining and biting themselves he felt the air vibrate again though he could not hear the sound it was above the human threshold this sent the rest of the animals yelping those felled by the sound lay as if beaten breathing heavily heads resting on the ground the strange creature touched lightly down in the square a short distance away in the moonlight it was hard to make out a distinct shape but spence thought he saw a creature of about a meter or more in height with two locustlike wings on its back its lower legs were furred like a goats but it had the tail of a scorpion that curved up in a backward arch its arms were long and emaciated its hands and fingers little more than sticks the thing held in its hands a shining silver ball it was this object that had emitted the highpitched tone that drove the dogs away spence stood spellbound as the creature turned to regard him with a cold alien stare its face and this was by far the most frightening thing about it bore an intelligent distinctly human look it gazed unblinking at him with pale green eyes that glowed in the moonlight and spence staring into those eerie otherworldly eyes suddenly understood that it was trying to communicate with him the idea filled him with such repulsion that he cringed the urge to run out and smash the creature flooded through him as if sensing his mood the thing hopped back in uneasy jerky movements and its wings rustled in the air like dry leaves on a dead tree and it flew away spence followed it with his eyes until it disappeared over the rooftops did you see that he asked disbelief making his voice small and uncertain i saw it but i dont believe it whatever it was it tried to communicate with me spence turned wide eyes to his friend and a shudder passed through him adjani it was a demon a nagaa snake spirit here and now we saw it without another word the two ran from the square lightly stepping over the panting bodies of stricken dogs once out of the marketplace they raced through empty streets back to the governors palace overhead red and gold glittering starburts lit their passage as fireworks blossomed in the sky they reached the palace walls out of breath and sweating despite the cool evening breeze coming down from the mountains they moved along the straggling knots of merrymakers still milling in the streets around the palace the greater number of celebrants having departed for the lake to witness the burning barges but several of the effigies had been set on fire and were being paraded through the streets on long poles to the chants of ecstatic worshipers they ducked in the stillopen gate and proceeded across the closecropped lawn toward the terrace threading among the throngs watching the fireworks a worried handwringing gita met them as they mounted the steps of the terrace you disappeared i could not find you there was trouble yes oh i knew there would be were exhausted gita said adjani well go to our rooms spence only nodded but as they turned to leave they were met by fazlul who seemed to appear from nowhere you have had enough my guests so soon he smiled warmly but his eyes were dead in his face in any event i hope this evenings entertainment offered you a taste of the exotic and perhaps an unusual diversion we enjoyed it immensely governor gita turned on his most unctious ingratiating manner it was a night to remember always i of course could go on all night but alasmy poor western friends are not accustomed to such strenuous celebrations we beg your indulgence for a nights sleep weighs heavy after our travels spence and adjani muttered suitable excuses for retiring smiled and nodded of course replied fazlul i am sure the exertions of your day are telling on you now very well youll find your beds waiting good night gentlemen and pleasant dreams namastey governor the three said in chorus good night the governor moved away the smile still on his lips they watched him go and as soon as he was out of earshot spence turned to the others and whispered the sly devil knows what happened tonight so help me he knows the sky was pink long before the sun rose above kanchenjunga to banish night from the city but spence had been up before sunrise he had not slept much of the night lying in bed thinking about the creature with the glowing green eyes finally as the night lifted her dark veil and morning showed dull iron in the east he rose and went to adjanis room weve got to get out of here he said adjani was not asleep either thats just what i was thinking we should make some excuse and leave after breakfast no i mean right away now adjani cocked his head to one side and looked at spence closely really you expect some trouble i dont know maybe ive been awake all night thinking about what happenedthe dogs and that creature the idol and everything and fazluls knowing that we would go there he paused adjani we werent meant to return last night adjani sat crosslegged in bed nodding gently staring at a point just above spences head spence recognized his friends manner of concentration and let him turn over the facts in his mind yes perhaps you are right adjani said at last we will go get dressed ill fetch gita well leave at once spence returned to his room and donned his newly cleaned and pressed jumpsuit and stuffed his feet into his boots when he returned to adjanis room a very sleepy gita was rubbing his sleepswollen eyes and scratching his belly as he finished dressing to miss breakfast in this house would be a crime gita lamented i wonder if you would feel that way if it were your last breakfast on this earth so gitas eyes grew round as grapefruits then there was trouble last night i knew it though you never tell gita anythingi must always find out for myself stop pouting and put your turban on said spence we didnt tell you because well because there was no time we didnt want you to worry and anyway we werent too sure about what happened last night ourselves you think i wouldnt understand said gita dolefully winding the long strip of thin blue muslin around his head i dont think i understand snapped spence we werent keeping anything from you explained adjani we will tell you everything as soon as we are away from here we must go now im ready gita sniffed let us fly if fly we must spence crept to the door and opened it looked both ways and motioned for the others to follow they stole down a long corridor and down the wide marble staircase to the great entrance hall of the palace not a sound could be heard in all the palace not a soul was seen stirring in the gray morning halflight moving as quickly and stealthily as burglars they crossed the cool marble hall darting between the great green spiral pillars just as they reached the big bronze outer doors a voice bold and clear and challenging in the silent hall said leaving so soon my guests i had hoped you would have deigned to stay a little longer the three froze and out from behind a pillar stepped fazlul he was accompanied by palace guards with oldstyle combat rifles which looked in excellent condition despite their age the governor approached wearing that same crafty smirk they had seen at their first meeting how ironic that you should choose to leave just as i was about to arrange a journey for you into the hills we have done nothing governor said adjani let us go in peace oh i have no intention of keeping you none at all he turned to spence i believe you asked about seeing some of the local architecturetemples palaces and such my instructions state that you shall have your wish fazlul raised his hand and snapped his fingers and the guards stepped forward and took them by the arms take them to kalitiri and make sure our visitors have a pleasant journey they were hustled out of the palace and into an antiquated troop carrier of a bygone era the trucks engine coughed to life as they were bundled roughly in two guards sat at the end of the benches with them and two others inside the cab they sputtered down the broad avenue to the gates spence looked back at the palace and saw the governor standing on the steps watching after them he felt betrayed and useda dupe and a fooland outraged by the sly rulers easy way with them he watched the tall white figure of fazlul until they were out of the gate and past the walls where it gradually came to him that they were at any rate speeding on their way to meet the dream thief i would have preferred our visit to be more of a surprise but at least we wont have to walk he mumbled to adjani for that we can be thankful it would have been an arduous trip on foot who knows perhaps this is gods way of smoothing the path for us in that case said spence settling back for the trip would hate to think what it would be like if it were rough olmstead packer tried to send a message to his wife and almost lost his life and at the same time jeopardized all the carefully woven plans of the gotham underground knowing that she was expecting to hear from him and that she had probably been trying to reach him herself with news of her return to gotham he coded a message and sent it to her little thinking that the mutineers might have put a bloodhound program into the system chief ramms men were waiting for him as he stepped fro the public booth on the broadway axial are you olmstead packer who packer asked feigning stupidity come with us please wed like to ask you some questions one of the men stepped forward and took his arm since the axial was crowded with shift traffic the guards had no doubt counted on the full cooperation of their prisonermost people do not care to make a scene of their public disgrace but packer having imposed upon the benefits of ramms protective custody once already did not relish the thought of another stay he shook off the guards hand and yelled that he was being accosted immediately they were surrounded by curious onlookers the confused guards told the crowd to move along and when they refused the guards got angry somebody said something and someone else yelledall the while packer was hollering that his rights were being violatedand when the guards went for their tasers packer dived through the crowd and ran the security men followed him but lost him in the crush around one of the radial tubes a breathless packer described the scene to a gravely nodding kalnikov when he reached the safety of their hidden nest kalnikov then informed him that the guards had orders to kill are you certain packer asked incredulously his eyes showed white all around the big russian chuckled mirthlessly we are both considered dangerous we are marked men you my friend will not be so stupid next time you can tell your wife all about it when it is over until then dont worry there wont be any next time im not that much of a fool to get caught in the same trap twice youre learning friend soon ill make a real freedom fighter out of you a big hand clapped the physicist on the back did i ever tell you that my greatgrandfather fought with vyenkotrovitch in the war of the commissars he was one of the original moscow saboteurs there was a real freedom fighter youve mentioned him only about fifty times well then how about grandfather nikko and how he saved the presidents life on the eve of the first election did i tell you that one packer was not quick enough to pretend he had heard it no ahh now theres a story packer had grown used to kalnikovs interminable stories and was even beginning to enjoy them they had after all a lot of time on their hands while waiting for this or that corridor to clear or for one or another contact to appear with information the two men had become very good friends and wily conspirators as kalnikov warmed to his tale packer sat thinking of their future as fugitives their cramped hideout beneath the docking bay in the hydraulics service area had become a prison packer longed for the run of his lab again and vowed that he would never complain about his small office again when are we getting out of here eh whats that kalnikov was lost in his narrative when is all this going to be over you are getting anxious my friend who wouldnt be im tired of all this sneaking around do not be impatient we will find out more at the second shift meeting i am expecting a report from our contact inside the directors office we already have all these reports they tell us nothing i disagree they tell us a great deal they tell us that the mutineers are doing nothing they are waiting in the meantime they are trying to maintain the illusion that everything is running smoothly and normally though of course we know differentlywe could disrupt that illusion we couldand we will but not yet the time is not ripe when moaned packer he did not have kalnikovs disposition for waiting soon very soon when the mutineers openly make their bid for taking control of the stationthen we act the citizens of gotham will know which side to come in on we will let the momentum of their own actions fuel their undoing a lot of people could get hurt kalnikov lifted his great shoulders yes some may be hurt freedom is a costly thing it exacts a heavy toll always but fewer will be hurt this way than if we acted too soon we must not let the mutineers think there is any reason to act sooner than they wish to let their plans harden with certainty of success then when we arise to oppose them they will have to abandon their plans and improvise that is always a great disadvantage in struggles such as this and in the meantime in the meantime there is always mira yes always mira but that is a long shot we need proper equipment to even begin the equipment is coming it is coming trust me packer sometimes feared that kalnikov mouthed his revolutionary rhetoric the way a parrot mouthed saucy endearments full of the bravado and dash but utterly lacking in the ability to follow through that the russian pilot was a romantic dreamer he already knew whether kalnikov could back up what he so ardently espoused remained to be seen still packer had no better plan himself so he clung to kalnikovs ideas like a man dangling from a tightrope and prayed the drop wouldnt kill him theres no question about itadjanithis is what we saw last night it could not have been anything else spence turned the charm over in his hands studying it closely but it doesnt do justice to the genuine article by half you saw a naga spirit spencer reston i cannot believe it though a great many unbelievable things seem to be happening to me of late do you also say you saw this creature he looked at adjani with a halfskeptical halfawed expression i saw it gita and i agree it is undoubtedly what this charm represents but spence is right the creature far surpasses this trinket for strangeness they were huddled together in the shade of the troop carrier while the governors palace guards ate a leisurely midday meal the thin mountain air was cool on their faces the sun was hot and they were grateful for a brief respite from the backbreaking ride over the wretched road and not only that spence continued we found a temple with an image of the dream thief the real dream thief undoubtedly it was brasputithe ruler of the rsis and vidyadharas you will find his image all over darjeeling this one was in the old section and it looked just like a martian i wish i could have seen it in that case dont worry gita were all going to see the real live brasputi very soon what are we going to do moaned gita to be delivered into our enemies hands like chickens for the plucking ahh his round face convulsed in an expression of deepest grief for their impending plight were not there yet soothed adjani far from it said spence i have something up my sleeve here ive never told you abouteither of you he reached into a zippered pocket of his jumpsuit and pulled out a small flattened shelllike disk he held it in his hand and felt its strange power quicken to his touch what is it its called bneri its some sort of signaling device kyr gave t to me he said that if i ever needed him i was to take this and cold it while thinking about him and he would know i was in rouble and hed come to help let me see it said adjani a psychoactive instrument fascinating why didnt you show me this sooner i dont know maybe theres still a part of me that thinks im going to wake up and find this has all been one grand absurd dream but thisthis tangible object reminds me its realtoo horribly real i dont like to dwell on it try it said gita excitedly oh please try it now spence looked at the disk in his hand and felt its warmth filling his palm he closed his eyes and began to concentrate but before he could even frame a single thought he felt it snatched from him his eyes flew open and he stared into the barrel of a rifle one of the guards watching them closely had come up vile they were talking he held the bneri in his hand and turned t over frowning gita tell him it is nothinga shell ask him to give it back please spence smiled at the guard as he spoke but his voiceeras taut as drawn wire gita rapidly conveyed the message to the guard he looked it the object and at spence and then took the device and flung it into the brush at the side of the road the last spence saw of his valuable gift it was skimming through the bushtops down the ride of the mountain no he cried jumping up the soldier shoved him back with the butt of his rifle andpence fell against the side of the truck the leader of the guards called his men to him and there was a short secretive conference i dont like the look of this said gita what are they planning spence horrified ignored the comment and stared at thelace where he had last seen their only hope sailing away and moaned well thats that were in it now he turned to his fiends im sorry i never should have gotten you mixed up in any of this its my fault spence for the last time stop apologizing do you have such a monumental ego that you believe this to be all your doing this is just one more battle in the ageold struggle between the powers of light and darkness spence could take no comfort from this speech he still thought of his trouble as his trouble the thought that it might indeed have some larger significance did not console him at all the truck rumbled up a winding mountain track and rounded a curve cut in the side of the mountain a tiny village swung into view there it is said adjani rangpothat is where the seminary of aris grandfather is located you can see the walls of the old monastery just off over there see them despite his black mood spence looked eagerly at the village it was much as he had imagined it why a seminary in such a small backward place why not darjeeling who knows perhaps rangpo was more receptive to christianity it is often the way of god to choose the least among us to do his will it did not make sense to spence but he was learning that little about god made sense in the normal rational way it isnt much of a place just then gita who had been gazing at the scenery looked up and said with a shout what was that did you see it see what spence looked in the direction gitas wiggling finger pointedbehind them and skyward he saw nothing it was a flash of light very bright just there lightning most likely replied spence watching the gray clouds flowing down from the mountains the sun had become a dim hazy dirty yellow ball without much warmth or light looks like its going to rain it was like no lightning i ever saw gita maintained though he offered no other explanation all three searched the sky from the back of the open truck but saw nothing out of the ordinary they settled back as the truck bumped along the steep rutted road they passed through rangpo barely slowing down and reached the mountain road when the truck slowed and then stopped why are we stopping asked gita jumping up as the truck rolled to a halt spence looked around they were hemmed in on every side by tall trees and brush he could neither see the mountain ahead nor the town behind one of the guards came around the side of the truck and motioned them out with his rifle do as he says said adjani i dont think this was in the plan what are they doing whined gita oh something is very wrong quiet snapped spence keep your wits about you adjani ask him whats going on adjani spoke to the guard who seemed to be in charge and received no answer two of the guards hung back as if fearing what was about to happen the three prisoners were shoved to the side of the road and the leader cried halt he raised his rifle the other guards stood close by but did nothing their faces were pale and their eyes were afraid they mean to kill us said spence he glanced at adjani tell them well pay them to let us go talk to them adjani raised his hands and called to the soldiers spence could not understand what he said but it seemed to have little effect on the menthey still stood indecisively hanging back waiting for the deed to be over the leader gave a curt reply its no use said adjani he says he has his orders then lets run for it but it was too late the leader of the guards spoke a stern order to his men and they reluctantly raised their guns and aimed at the prisoners god have mercy cried gita covering his face with his hands run screamed spence he heard a sound and realized that it was the click of a trigger he saw the glint of sunlight on the steel barrel of the gun and looked into the black bore from which issued a tiny projectile he threw himself to the ground and rolled toward the shelter of the trees behind them then he heard the report of the rifle exploding into the silence shaking the leaves on the trees and spence glanced back even as he rolled and saw an amazing thing the bullet cleared the barrel of the gun and drifted toward him leisurely it moved with aching slowness and appeared to lose power and sink back to earth the missile tumbled end over end and dropped in a lazy arc to land before him in the road in a little puff of dust it lay there gleaming and spent a look of wonder appeared on the faces of the guards they glanced at one another nervously look yelled adjani he pointed ahead of them up the road there stood a tall thin figure clothed in a radiant blue skintight garment his arms outstretched holding a long glowing rod behind this figure stood a squat roundish bellshaped object that shimmered as if through waves of heat the soldiers too saw the figure they drew back one of them fired his rifle and all watched his bullet sink feebly into the dirt at his feet at this the soldier threw down his gun and backed away the others turned and fled with him leaving only the leader who mumbled something under his breath and then turned and ran after his men spence was on his feet running toward the strange figure adjani and gita came on more cautiously behind him when they reached their friend they found him embracing an extremely tall humanoid who gazed at them with great round amber eyes kyr shouted spence almost beside himself with relief you came you saved our lives adjanis jaw dropped and gita rubbed his eyes adjani gita said spence turning to the astonished men kyr these are my friends the martian regarded them with a long unblinking gaze as if reading their thoughts men of earth he said at last i am happy to meet you with that he slowly extended his long threefingered hand should melt your flesh where you sit i should blast your shriveled body to atoms how dare you defy me the ancient eyes flashed fire and the voice croaked with murderous rage hocking for once appeared at a loss for words i i did not defy you ortu ththere must be some mistake there is a mistake and you made it when you gave heed to your own overreaching ambition you will pay for this error but first i want to know if you have any notion at all of what you have done do you have the slightest idea what you have ruined with your trifling puny efforts no answer hocking had never seen his master so angry he thought it best to keep his mouth shut and weather the blast if he could no well then i will tell you ortu spat he raised himself up and sat on his cushions erect and commanding though he had not moved from his place his hairless head gleamed like a polished knob the hanging folds of skin around his neck jerked with every venomous word the gleaming circlet across his forehead glowed hotly and the great yellow eyes burning out of their enormous sockets undimmed by age pierced the object of their focus like laser beams hocking shrank even deeper into the yielding cushions of the pneumochair your meddling has jeopardized the work of a thousand years centuries of cultural and social conditioning have brought us to the precise moment of maximum vulnerability the tanti is at last attuned to the exact mental frequency of the collective human mind mankind trembles on the threshold of our new world order and does not even guess what is about to happen like dogs they await the coming of a master to lead them how has anything changed ortu it is still as it was nothing has been lost silence a great deal has been lost i thought you were smarter than others of your kind use that miserable brain o yours thenthink what you have done try as he might hocking could not think what had gone wrong he did not even know exactly how ortu had found out about his plan to eliminate spencer reston does your tongue fail you well it might since you do not fathom even the tiniest fraction of the whole the tanti is ready is it not it has been tested relentlessly for many years ortu sank back into himself and glared dully at hocking its power has been increased a billionfold correct hockings mouth was dry and he croaked with the tanti we possess the ability to control the universal subconscious and thereby control the behavior of every human being on earth with it we can literally rule the world control a mans dreams and you control his mind said hocking he had heard the maxim often enough and yet in the final calibration experiment what happens unexpectedly we discover a man capable of resisting complete domination how is this possible ortu crossed his long thin arms across his narrow chest answer me i dont know snapped hocking obviously if i knew it would not have happened well said but do you not even now perceive your error did it never occur to you that where one man resists there may lie the secret of all mens resistance that is why i wanted him brought hereto learn the secret of his ability to withstand control instead you seek to eliminate him to destroy him if you had succeeded we would never know you saved him didnt you hocking fought down the twinge of fear that coursed through him as he remembered his unsuccessful attempts to kill reston i fail to see how i have seriously harmed our plans let alone damaged our overall contingencies then allow me to illumine you oh wise one mocked ortu hocking colored under the scorn reston has contacted a member of my race impossible it is beyond current physics it is not impossible i have just said it has happened it is a fact he did not travel to distant galaxies no he has awakened one of the guardians and has summoned him here i dont believe it you will believe it long ago when we on ovs migrated we left behind in each city one of our own to guard all that we left behind against the day when others would come that the knowledge gained should be wisely used and our treasures respected reston could not have discovered thisno one on earth believes martians exist much less martian cities you who believe nothinghow do you know what men believe in their innermost hearts and why do you keep telling me these things are not possible when indeed they have happened men believe that their salvation will come from the stars from benevolent beings who will show them the way that is what men believe today have i not spent hundreds of years nurturing that belief creating wonders in the sky strange and unexplained events on the ground all to prepare the way for this final stage for the willingness of humankind to accept a savior from beyond their world it has all been part of the social and mental conditioning men speak of ufos and watch the sky by night for a sign that their space brothers are coming and why because i have willed it so i ortu have programmed it to be so how can one man even a very stubborn man like reston change that ortu sighed because within him is the force to withstand and to undo all i have done and the guardian who is with him now will not allow our work to continuehe will see it stopped gita whose wide round eyes never for a moment left the alien kept hopping up and down in a kind of ecstatic dance first on one foot and then on the other he was beside himself almost literally and though he did not enter into the conversation with the others he did not miss a word spence and adjani were endeavoring to explain their present situation to kyr who listened intently it was a marvel to gita that the martian could speak so well spence had explained the beings remarkable facility but that did not diminish gitas sense of wonder that the first words he heard from the mouth of an extraterrestrial were in plain english spence explained we have very good reason to believe that one of your ownan ovsian came to earth during the time of the great migration he has lived for thousands of years somewhere in these mountainsa place called kalitiri the soldiers in the truck were supposed to be taking us to him but they evidently changed their minds kyr pondered this information his eyes narrowed and he looked away toward the mountains if one of my race is here he will be found he must be convinced to return to ovs it is forbidden to interfere with an alien culture unfortunately that appears to be just what he has been doing here said adjani we think he is somehow connected with spences blackouts and the dreams that is he is responsible for them on at least one occasion what spence had dreamed has come true the tantidream maker said kyr it is a devicea transmitter capable of influencing brain functions and inducing mental imagery it was used on ovs as a medical instrument for treating those suffering from acute mental disorders im afraid it has been put to a very different use here on earth replied adjani then the tanti must be destroyed those who would use it must be stopped our thoughts exactly spence glanced around at the late afternoon sky but it will be getting dark soon perhaps we should find shelter before nightfallat least before the soldiers work up enough nerve to come back come with me said kyr we will use my vehicle a long arm swept up to indicate the stillglowing object sitting in the center of the dirt road why because he must it is his lifesworn duty then they must all be destroyed said hocking for the first time speaking with anything approaching hope i was right after all ortus head began weaving back and forth you still do not understand perhaps you are unable to comprehend what i have been telling you i understand that if our work is in danger we must take any steps necessary to eliminate that danger we must stop them how do you propose to do that ortu scowled thinking fast he said your disciples could do it send them out to destroy our enemies you have left us no choice i will summon them ortus head sank for once he seemed to wear the full weight of his years his voice sank into a rasping whisper go now hocking swept out of the swirling cloudchoked chamber and found pundi lurking in the hallway nearby bring his disciples at once he ordered the servant hurried off on pattering feet to retrieve the chest of gopherwood containing the six teak boxes a flying saucer said gita im going to ride in a flying saucer vimana said kyr it is called a vimana sky car he is right exclaimed gita the word is exactly the same in our language why not chuckled spence no doubt thats where it came from in the first place then it is really true and the myths of my people gita began and stopped stricken with the implications of this revelation are myths just the same finished adjani though with a grain of truth behind them a mountain of truth sahib said gita shaking his head when i said before that i believed your story i never dreamed to think they have been worshiping martians all these years it staggers the mind spence listened to this exchange and smiled as they started toward the vimana he said kyr how did you know to come here your bneri summoned me no it was taken from me before i could use it one of the soldiers grabbed it just as i was about to send you the signal i received the signal and i answered it but how how could you have come so quickly only a few minutes passed before you arrived does your spacecraft travel so fast i do not know what you mean earthfriend i was aware of your presence on this road i watched the truck from before your entry into the village when you were stopped on the road now spence was completely confused that cant bei had not tried to signal yet you would have had to receive my summons before i sent it he shook his head and looked to adjani for help just when did you receive the signal asked adjani your question has no meaning i cannot answer the martian shrugged his narrow shoulders in a human display of ignorance no meaning are you saying that time is irrelevant to the working of the bneri it works outside of time as thought is outside of time therefore you cannot ask when of it i dont get it at all muttered spence do you i think so said adjani prayer often works the same way we sometimes see that the seeds of the answer to our prayer have been sown before we even knew to pray this is possible because god is not confined to time as we are past present futurehe moves through each as he will kyr made a low whistling sound and translated it for them this god you speak of he is the allbeingthe source yes replied adjani you know him you worship him worship it means to revere to hold worthy to adore to praise and love kyr shrugged again this i believe is implied in living before him we know him and feel his presence with us at all times it isnt that way on earth said adjani men must choose to know him and worship him of their free will it is the same with us but who would choose not to know him kyr gave spence a quick ironic look youd be surprised said spence i told you once that i would find a way to explain the ways of the allbeing to you but i see now that there is a barrier between us which i cannot cross it was placed there by dal elna who made you different from us my explanations would not satisfy you i believe you kyr for an earthman nothing will do unless he finds the allbeing by himself in his own way just then gita who had been silent during this exchange broke in with look the townspeople from rangpo are coming they have seen your vimana we must hurry away now or we may be here all night we will talk of these things at greater length when time is not important now we have work to do said kyr he turned and headed toward his craft at his approach a red line appeared at the top of the object and slid down along the side slicing it in two a brilliant light flooded over them as the two halves parted to receive them spence adjani and gita stepped hesitantly into the light and followed kyr into the craft the people of rangpo saw four figures disappear inside a red beam of light and then a loud whirring sound filled the air as the unidentified flying object grew suddenly bright orange and then flashed over their heads in an instant moving over the town toward the mountains to vanish in the clouds the gentle evening closed around them like a soft and loving hand the cool air brightened the fire as it crackled under gitas deft fingers the deep blue shadows darkened in the forest of green bamboo and the rustlings of monkeys and birds in the trees quieted kyrs spacecraft rested a few meters away in a clearing it gave off a dim bluish glimmer now its systems shut down for the present gita hovered near the tall aliens shouldershyly nervously like a schoolboy in the presence of a high dignitary a schoolboy who did not dream of contributing to the conversation of the adults yet desired above anything to remain within the charmed circle of their words adjani had not stopped asking questions since they entered the vimana ideas between the two were exchanged at such a rapid rate it made the head buzz to think of it spence lay back and smiled with a kind of dreamy indulgence as if to say he is my friend after all but i gladly share him with you it was enough for him to sit basking in the warm friendship of the group a thing he had not grown overly used to in the course of his stoic life he reclined and let the high words and ideas roll over him like the warm breakers on a sunlit beach rising to a swell and then lapping over him filling him with happiness and good cheer it seemed he had been waiting for many years for this special time there in the clearing on the mountainside before the rustic campfire spence felt the approach of something he had longed for all his adult life it was a thing that went by various names depending upon his frame of mind at the time he felt the longing most often he called it certainty and what he meant by that was the assurance of something absolute and unchangeable in a universe of change as a scientist he had long ago given up ever trying to find that immutable absolute the only law of the universe he knew that could be counted on was change hot things lost their heat cold things grew colder solid objects became vapor and vice versa speeding particles slowed orbits decayed matter decayed flesh decayed entropy reigned nothing remained changeless and unchangeable that the immutable absolute he sought might be the divine being had never occurred to him but it came to him now what is more he felt a distinct presence drawing inexorably closer for some reasonperhaps because he was in indiahe imagined it in the shape of a great tiger he felt as if he was being stalked by the fiery ferocious creature the hair at the base of his skull prickled a chill wavered along his spine then kyr stood in the firelight towering over the group huddled in the yellow circle of light the conversation had stopped all spence heard was the snap of the fire and the evening sounds of the forest kyr looked at each of them in turn gazing with his great piercing eyes what he was thinking could not be guessedthe look seemed filled with an emotion beyond spences stock catalog of responses kyr began speaking slowly quietly in my world of long ago it was our custom when meeting one another after a long absence or when leaving for a time to share a special meal the essila on the evening of our first meeting before we face what may soon overtake us i would like to share it with you my new friends with that kyr went to his spacecraft and entered it returning a moment later carrying a globe in each hand these he sat down near the edge of the circle of light and settled his large frame beside them the earthmen crept closer kyr took one of the globes and raised it in our leaving and arriving we are one when apart and when together we are one in the many there is one spence recognized that last phrase as one kyr had once used in referring to the allbeing the globe in kyrs hands opened from a center seam and the top hemisphere parted to reveal the contents of the interior a kind of whitish fluffy diaphanous substance that looked very much like clouds a body is made of many cells yet it is one body a life is made of many days and yet it is one life each mans body and each mans life is a reflection of the one who gave it in the many there is one kyr held his long hands before the fire and his eyes closed his voice became almost a chant spence knew that if kyr had been speaking his own tongue the litany would be a song what kyr must have been doing to translate it bordered on the miraculous if we mount to the stars dal elna is there if we descend to the dust of death dal elna is there dal elna is in all things the stars the dust the stones the fire yet these things do not contain dal elna in the many there is one stars are born and stars die and dal elna knows their passing in the deeps of space dal elnas ways are known on created worlds and worlds yet to be created dal elnas name is sung dal elna calls forth light out of darkness and sets the planets in their orbits nothing exists that does not exist in dal elna in the many there is one before time began dal elna was when time is gone dal elna will remain soon time will cease and the curtains of our minds will be parted and we will see dal elna all living souls will know dal elna in the many there is one kyr lowered his hands and raised the bowl and offered it to each of the men sitting near him spence reached his hand in and took some of the wispy stuff it tore away in a long shred pink in the firelight then kyr took some and set the bowl aside saying to eat of the essila is to mingle souls to know another as you are known therefore let no one eat of it who does not love the other spence looked at each of the others he had not put it into words before but yes he did love adjani and gita they had risked their lives to follow him to help him and he loved them for it he could think of no other friends he trusted more kyr seemed to be waiting while each made up his own mind and then seeing that all were of one accord he said taste the sweetness of your love for each other in the many there is one kyr raised his fingers to his lips and the others followed his example their eyes shining in the dancing light spence felt the essila melt as it touched his tongue and suddenly his mouth was full of the sweetest tasting substance he could have imagineda sweetness beyond simple description but it did not cloy or sicken in its sweetness though it overwhelmed all other senses he swallowed and felt a spreading warmth surge through his midsection tingling even to his extremities he suddenly felt a closeness a warmth he had never felt among others before he looked across at adjani and the slim indian seemed to shine his face glowing with a kind of subtle radiance he glanced at gita and saw a wide grin of undiluted happiness gleaming on his round face two big teardrops slid slowly down his cheeks as he looked from one to the other of those around him spence felt his own heart swell inside him until he thought it must burst he felt himself higher nobler and more true than he had ever known himself to be in his life he too felt radiant absolutely glowing with kindness and compassion part of this he knew to be emanating from the others as much as from himself it was true their very hearts and souls were mingling like rare and precious oils each one increasing the worth of the other yet losing nothing of its own value spence felt himself lifted out of himself and he knew each of his friends as he knew himself in that moment he knew their weaknesses and failings yet loved them in spite of any shortcomings forgiving them as he forgave them in himself there was another presence he could not describe it was utterly foreign to his frame of human reference though it shared many of the same basic essences this presence inside him he knew to be kyr and he loved the martian for his utter alien uniqueness and his freely flowing compassion he drank in these impressions and savored them treasured them cherished them he wanted the moment to last forever and to have that incredible unutterable sweetness on his tongue but kyr raised the second globe and it opened before him he took the upper part of the globe and handed it to adjani and then handed one to gita and in turn to spence spence saw that there were several of these bowls nestled inside one another and kyr withdrew one for himself then he poured from the lower half of the globe a liquid that sparkled in the firelight when each bowl had been filled with the liquid kyr raised his own bowl and began to speak once more all rivers run to the sea all roads reach their destination in every beginning lies the seed of the end but in dal elna there is only beginning in the many there is one kyr brought the bowl to his lips and drank spence and the others followed his example the strange liquid had no taste that spence could describe not sweet at least not as sweet as the first substance had been but not bitter either it touched his lips with a tingle like a mild current of electricity applied to his skin he rolled the effervescent drink on his tongue and felt as if he had tasted cool firethe stuff seemed almost alive he swallowed it and felt its playful sting all the way down he drank again more deeply this time and let the cool fire dance on his tongue the effect made him want to laugh out loud or burst into song he felt the inner fire seeping into his veins quickening his heart suddenly he was more alert more conscious than ever in his life he looked through new eyes at the world and what a world he saw though it was night and dark he could see the tall slender ranks of bamboo all around saw the firelight dancing on their thin shafts he saw narrow tapering shapes of the leaves with the delicate sawtoothed edge individually and precisely drawn and duplicated each was a thing of exquisite inexplicable beauty above the leaping flames of the fire he saw an insect in his heightened vision it became suspended in motion moving in slow graceful sweeps as its tiny transparent wings beat the air he could see the glitter of light scatter across its multicelled eyes and the iridescent gleam of its carapace he saw its legs dangling as fine threads beneath its sectioned body and the gentle curl of its antennae along its back raising his eyes he saw the heavens at first dark now almost bursting with the light of countless starseach star shining with clear crystalline light hardedged and fine with beams piercing as needles everywhere he looked he saw some new wonder some commonplace revealed in a way he had never seen it before the ordinary had been transformed into the extraordinary the normal into the supernormal his friends still sat in the same positions as before but he saw them wholly changed he saw not their outward appearance only but now he saw their inner selves unmasked and each was larger more fair and strong in every way they sat wrapped in shimmering auras of gold and violet as if clothed in living fire in their faces he glimpsed unfathomable tenderness and something he could only call wisdom burned out from their eyes but a wisdom purer and finer than any born of earth spence looked at kyr and saw not the elongated martian but a creature not unlike himself and the others resembling them and yet slightly different in subtle ways he could not name and where before spence had felt radiant he felt now as if he were throwing off sparks he caught fleeting glimpses of the colored rays as they streamed from him to blend with the light of the others spence felt full to overflowing with the joyous scintillating reverberating love he felt for his friends he felt the power of their love for him and for one another and it was a mingling of deep strong water which flowed out in all directions from the center like a fountain or a spring with an endless source but he sensed another subtle yet still distinct presence too this presence interwove all the others and even his own to hold them and to overlay them at the same time without losing its own distinction in that heightened awareness he sent out the fingers of his mind to examine this presence he extended his mind toward it and tentatively touched it instantly his mind recoiled staggered as if by a blazing bolt of lightning he knew then that he had touched the source itself he felt dizzy and intoxicated completely shattered by that single brief encounter then his mind began to fill with thoughts strange and wonderful and terrifying in their clarity and force he saw galaxies swinging in the frozen deeps of space flung like pebbles on an endless beach he heard the roar of silence drowned by the music of the galactic movement the song of the starsall heaven was filled with it he saw worlds upon worlds springing into existence before nameless suns on each world life leaped up sprung from the voice that had awakened it plants of every variety animals of every description human creatures as different as could be imagined yet all possessing the divine inner spark that was the immutable stamp of the maker he saw his own world as one minute fleck against the darkness and knew that his life and the lives of every man who had ever lived was but a single faltering step in the great dance of heaven the dance flowed and ebbed according to the will of the maker and all moved with him as he moved there was not a solitary figure in the dance that was not in his planfrom the seemingly random shuttling of atoms colliding with one another through the limitless reaches of empty night to the aimless scrabblings of an insect in the dust to the directionless meandering of a river of molten iron on a world no human eye would ever see all was embraced upheld encompassed by the great dance in the many there is one at last spence understood one dance but it took all space and time to describe it one life but it took all living things to define it one mind but it took all thought to know it and still it could not be described defined or known in its entirety he knew why kyr and his kind called it the allbeing for it transcended all that it touched even as it stooped to create it and though it spawned a billion worlds gave voice to a trillion celestial lights directed the course of a quintillion lives the allbeing was one inseparable indivisible indissoluble immutable allwise allmerciful allholy allknowing infinite and eternal the rest went spinning by spence in a dizzying flood of thoughts and feelings and images of power and grandeur untold he was left gasping and breathless by his single fleeting contact with the god he had long denied but could deny no longer spence bowed down before the presence in all humility and surrender acknowledging it as the first spontaneous act of worship he had ever performed as he did so he knew that it knew him as a friend and that he had nothing to fear from it now or ever he felt loads of guilt and shame roll away from him and he heard a voice inside his mind say hear me son of dust why have you run so long and so hard what were you trying to escape your running is over enter into my rest yes yes yes spence heard his heart reply please tell me how trust me look for me and then follow spence felt a rushing tide rise within himself flowing out toward the presence but still he knew the choice to be his alone one word would halt the surge and stay it or it would be released to flow forever without end yes said spence i will follow lead on ramm strode purposefully into the room where his men were assembled and waiting the talk in the room died as the chief of security glared coolly around him all right he said this wont take long i have just received orders to proceed to phase two of operation clean sweep therefore the escapees must be apprehended at once squad leaders you are to double your efforts i want every sector doublechecked work around the clock if you have to i want them found nowbefore they have a chance to stir up any trouble got it there was a grumble of assent what are you waiting for move out said ramm the security force rose at once and proceeded to file out of the briefing room in the guardroom beyond he could hear the squad leaders calling their groups together and organizing for a renewed search he glanced around the empty room and then left by a side door when he arrived at adsec he pushed his way past the receptionist and went directly into the directors office wermeyers puzzled face glanced up from the wafer screen he had been gazing into well the former assistant asked leaning back in his bosss chair we havent caught them yet but we will its only a matter of time after all they cant go far yes well see that you take care of it i can handle it dont worry how are things going on your end running like clockwork i was just looking over the projections for the completion of construction on the engine installation were right on schedule hocking thinks of everything lets hope so wermeyer gave him a quick questioning look whats that supposed to mean nothing im just a little nervous about this you know taking over an entire space station i mean its never been done relax and do your job and everything will go as planned did you get your orders right phase two is in operation ive already told my men any word when the machine will arrive not yet hocking said to stand by thats what were doing how about the new master program ready and waiting mira wont know what hit her all communication and operation functions will be under our control as soon as we are given the word if anyone has any thoughts about signaling for help there wont be a thing they can do about it as for resistance ill handle any resistance i dont expect there will be much its awful cold and lonely out there he nodded past wermeyer toward the huge observation bubble and the stars glowing brightly beyond yes well lets hope it wont come to that ramm turned to leave before he reached the door he stopped and said let me know the minute hocking checks in well want to secure the docking bay in case packer and his pilot friend have any ideas you let me know the minute you find them returned wermeyer tartly this has gone on long enough how long the vision lasted spence did not know when he came to himself again the fire had died down to glowing embers and the moon had lowered in the treetops crickets chirped their trilling nightsong and the breeze down from the mountain slopes had freshened to a chill gita lay curled near the remains of the campfire sound asleep his turban resting on his outstretched arm adjani sat with his knees drawn up head nodding on his chest kyr his long thin legs crossed and his long arms wrapped around his narrow chest sat gazing into the glowing coals which reflected in his great yellow eyes the effects of the essila still tingled in spences limbs and pulsed in his brain he still tasted a trace of sweetness on his lips but the mingled rush of thoughts and emotions of shared essences and spirits was gone it is over said spence quietly the martian turned his head to regard him intently yes earthbrother all that remains is to thank the one who gave us the essila that we might know each other more perfectly i will thank him the rest of my days said spence the memory of all that had taken place still burned within him and he knew he would carry it with him always does it always have such power sometimes more than others the first time is the most overwhelming but each time is different kyr ran out of words to explain and fell silent spence understood that it was not a thing discussed and analyzed only experienced and accepted he wondered if the others had undergone the same thing he had the wind shifted then and spence heard a sound that tripped a warning in his mind did you hear that the alien cocked his head to one side the nightsong continued to ripple through the forest undisturbed i hear a great many thingsall of which are new to me replied kyr at length perhaps it was nothing but the wind began spence but he heard the sound again this time more distinctly a faint whirring buzz like the rustle of dead leaves on a tree he knew what it was he had heard it before no not again he shouted leaping up he stared up at the sky through the opening in the trees overhead and saw the outline of several black shapes sliding over them as the sound of those vibrating wings reached them with a dry hiss weve got to get out of here cried spence the dream thief has found us what is it whats happened adjani sprang up at once the demon is backthe dream thiefs demon i think theres more than one this time lets get out of here spence turned to rouse gita but kyr scooped him up in one effortless motion and began striding off into the clearing toward the spacecraft spence and adjani hurried after him through the tall grass glancing skyward as the sound of the dreadful buzzing increased they reached the vehicle as the first of ortus disciples swooped down a voice in spences head said stop dont run spence stopped and turned to see a creature touching down a few meters away it looked at him with glowing green eyes and he saw its horrid manlike face grimacing in the moonlight it had huge membraned wings like a bats attached to a humanlooking torso that sprouted four arms the lower half of the body resembled a serpentsthe thing looked exactly like the small charm adjani had found immediately another dark form came down behind it and another just off to one side all stared at him malevolently with their hideous luminous eyes get in quickly spence felt a touch on his shoulder and felt himself jerked around spence adjani cried move adjani appeared before him shouting at him it seemed from a great distance he felt himself drawn toward the gruesome creatures with the glowing eyes he wheeled around and started walking toward them he could feel a will outside his own directing his steps what am i doing he wondered come here directed the voices spence shrieked adjani come back spence stopped and shook his head he was almost upon the wicked creatures when he felt himself lifted off the ground and carried bodily back toward the waiting vimana now glowing bright redorange he twisted in the steely grasp and saw kyr looking over his shoulder at the demons they had almost reached the spacecraft when he saw a glimmer out of the corner of his eye one of the demons held a glittering thing in his hands which he aimed at them in the same instant a mighty sound ripped through hima sound which seemed to melt his bones and turn his bowels to jelly kyr stumbled and fell and spence in his grasp was thrown to the ground before he could think or move he felt icy fingers on him he saw a thin stickfingered hand reach out for him and the cold touch of those hideous hands on his flesh sent ripples of revulsion through him spence struggled weakly but his will had abandoned him and he could not break the grasp at the same moment he sensed his consciousness leaving him dark clouds seemed to gather before his eyes and it was as if his skull was being opened and his brain plucked from its cavity he was powerless to stop it he teetered on the edge of consciousness and saw kyr laying next to him eyes open and staring up at the starspattered sky then a grotesque face was peering into his own and spence looked into the cold green eyes of one of the creatures in its hands it held a silver sphere which it lowered toward him spence sensed that when the sphere touched his head he would be completely under their control the sphere came nearer bare centimeters away from him now he squirmed on the ground but the effort was futile and absurd he lay still and closed his eyes even as he did so a piercing ruby light flashed out and struck the sphere the object shattered in the creatures grasp and disintegrated he was released from the spell he jumped to his feet and tore the clutching hands of the awful creature from him lashing out at it with his feet he heard a shout and saw adjani rushing up beside him with a long rod in his handthe thing flashed in the moonlight and spence recognized it as the weapon kyr had used to save them on the road earlier that afternoon the air smelled of scorched metal and spences head throbbed with a booming ache his ears roared with the sound of a distant ocean but he was free adjani took the end of the object in his hands and swung into the foremost of the creatures they all lurched away out of range and adjani grabbed spence by the sleeve of his jumpsuit and pulled him back toward the spacecraft wait kyr is hurt said spence weve got to get him on board gita lend a hand hurry they bent over the aliens body and lifted it slinging it between them as they made for the ship spence heard the air buzz above his head and saw one of the demons dart past him n o more stood between them and the martian spacecraft theyve got us cut off the airborne naga swooped at them from above adjani spun and raised the rod in his hand and once more the ruby beam split the night the shot hit the monster in the chest as it swung down toward them grotesque hands outstretched and grasping there was a bright flash and spence saw the being jerked back through the air as if it had been yanked by an attached wire an agonizing scream gurgled from its inhuman throat and the thing fell to earth but to everyones surprise the creature climbed back onto its legs and rejoined the others we cant stay here weve got to run for it spence looked at the stillunconscious body of the alien at his feet ill carry him you cover our retreat lets go gita his whole frame shaking with fright helped lift the stricken kyr onto spences shoulders while adjani kept the naga demons at bay brandishing the rod the jolt to the first demon seemed to have made them cautious but they had regrouped and were closing in gita you lead the way were right behind you there shouted spence shoving gita ahead toward the forest get going the demons saw what was happening and began shrieking in rage they leapt into the air to pursue the chase spence with kyr slung across his shoulders stumbled on as fast as he could slamming now and again into branches and trunks of trees as they gained the forest adjani stayed at his elbow steadying him and guiding him through the thick tangle occasionally he turned to loose a shot at the beings darting after them they ran on a downward course that grew steeper as they went along to spence it seemed that they had traveled for hours but it must have been only a few minutes before his lungs began to burn and his legs tired but he kept moving the forest began to thin out and the undergrowth became sparse he imagined he saw lights through the trees ahead i think i see something cried gita yes it is the village rangpo is ahead can you make it asked adjani let me take him no i can make it lets keep going spence allowed him self a quick backward look where are they theyre right behind but they seem to be keeping their distance theyre afraid of your weapon there or theyre waiting for us to run out into the open i hadnt thought of that the thought made spences heart sink once more the way became steeper and rocky spence fell several times over rocks and landed on his knees each time adjani hauled him to his feet and they hurried on then they were standing at the edge of the forest looking down at the village on the hillside below they could hear the obscene buzzing of the demons wings growing louder and more ominous as the creatures closed in spence his heart pounding wildly his breath coming hard leaned heavily on gitas arm well its now or never lets go gita muttered a prayer and dashed out from the shelter of the trees spence followed on his heels instantly there was a shriek above as one of the creatures streaked down upon them down cried adjani spence threw himself to the ground and heard a raking claw whisper by his head he glanced up just in time to see adjani running toward him look out he shouted but it was too late adjani watching the sky behind did not see the fallen tree trunk lying directly in his path and went down hard the weapon in his hand was thrown out and sailed through the air to land midway between them adjani squirmed back onto his feet and dived for the alien weapon there was a whir in the air and a dark shape swooped down and snatched the instrument away spence helpless under kyrs weight watched all this happen oh no he groaned look here exclaimed gita the lord be praised spence swiveled his head in the direction of gitas voice and saw smooth high stone walls shining faintly in the moonlight adjani was instantly beside him lifting kyr they slung the martian between them and made for the wall this way hurry the seminary run quickly they reached the wall and ran alongside it looking for an opening to duck inside gita disappeared around a corner and they heard his voice call back to them here is a gate hurry my friends a gate when they caught up with him he was hammering on the gate with his bare hands a single lamp burned in a lantern over the entrance they huddled in the pool of light as if it might offer some protection against the terrors of the night spence leaned kyr against the archway a moan came from the aliens throat i think hes coming out of it can you see them adjani eyes to the sky replied no but im sure theyre out there strange i dont think they followed us i dont know why i dont care why just as long as they leave us alone i hear someone coming said gita still pounding on the wooden gate with his hands in a moment they heard a voice from behind the door speaking rapid hindi gita answered and then said please open up we need help there was a grating sound as of a bolt being drawn back and then the door creaked open and a face appeared in the crack who disturbs our rest at this late hour black eyes glittering in the light glanced quickly at each of them in turn please sir we seek refuge behind your walls our friend is hurt may we come in there was a slight hesitation and then the door was thrown open wide revealing a small man with a smooth bald head which gleamed in the moonlight you are welcome friends how can i help you as soon as kyr was moved inside adjani whirled to the door and shut it throwing the bolt their host narrowed his eyes and looked sharply at his guests spence saw the look and said we mean you no harm sir we wont trouble you further i am devi dean of the seminary i was just on my way to my quarters when i heard you knocking on the gate are you in trouble we were traveling on the road earlier said adjani we camped in the forest wild animals found us and pursued us said gita his eyes big with fright we came here your eminence devi laughed you have had a time of it yes i can see that now about your friend he bent to examine the martian spence quickly turned to hide the aliens features hell be all right he fell we had to carry him i think hes coming out of it devi nodded i wont pry your secrets are safe with me wild animals have been known to wander nearby in these forests though it has been a long time since anyone saw a lion or tiger but well let that keep for now he smiled and spence saw his bald head bob now youll want to lie down and rest i think we dont want to put you to any trouble sir said adjani oh no trouble i am only sorry i do not have beds to offer you they are all full but follow mei will find something he turned and led them across the courtyard toward the main building of the complex their steps echoed faintly on the stone walk they moved cautiously peering into the sky for the dreaded shapes but the sky was clear and bright and the moon fair not a sign of the demons could be seen kvalnikov lowered himself carefully through the mansized hole in the lower deck beneath the docking bay staging area the hole was made for more standardsized spacemen not russian giants and kalnikov was a husky giant at that so he had to squeeze his shoulders through carefully in order to keep from getting stuck once through he dropped down a short ladder and made his way through a junction tube to the maintenance room that he and packer had made their home war room and base of operations for the coming revolution he entered the room filled with cylinders and hydraulic hoses and the electronic servo boxes which operated them packer sat hunched over a small console at a tiny table in the cramped room his face green in the reflected light from the screen he stared into how goes it friend progress hmph its enough that you give me obsolete tools to work withyou expect progress too you are getting to be a very disagreeable fellow packer but i dont mind the russian said cheerily packer looked away from the screen at his companion and noticed a definite change in the mans appearancehe seemed buoyant full of smiles and winks have you been drinking no i have news what is it first you must tell me how you are coming on your little project there packer frowned in the last several daysor was it weekshe had not stirred out of their prison for most of that time he had been sitting before the small screen staring at green phosphorescent blips and scrambled letters and numbers mira was a tough old girl to crack and he had only the tools of a fourthform schoolboy to do it with they had decided to risk tapping miras data bank to monitor the flow of information between the administration and security officesbetween wermeyer and ramm to do that they needed a terminal and a hookin that would not be noticed when engaged kalnikov had scrounged an old manual keyboard model from a dusty corner somewhere and put packer to work he had been working constantly ever since i am becoming permanently hunchbacked said packer thats how im coming as for the project well who knows tomorrow or maybe the next day its too early to tell miras got a thick shell tough as armor and theres only so much this kiddie computer can do he paused and dismissed the machine with a wave of his hand and then continued but ive organized fifteen of my best thirdyear men into teams weve split the program into five parts and each team is working on a portion of the key right now im merely trying to juice up our system here to handle the sneak feed once were on line then we are in not yet soon though ive been able to worm in using the autohydraulic servo connect lines and ive reversed a couple of them without anyone noticing so far there may be a red light blinking somewhere that someone may notice but well have to chance it theres still a way to go yet when asked kalnikov crossing his great arms across his wide chest like i said soontomorrow or the next day maybe longer the problem is that the best program engineers in the world put in stateoftheart worm traps sliding into the data core means outsmarting the traps and thats next to impossible it would probably be easier to put your ear to the keyhole and listen that way the russian was unimpressed it can be done anything one man can do another can undo thanks for the encouragement but it must be done by tonight what now wait a minute packer leaped from his seat and sent his chair crashing backwards to the floor restrain yourself please we need to be on line by tonight i have received word through the network that messages have been received this morning messages from who it is all in code we dont know but the effect has been to increase the effort to find us and to expose the network oh great time is growing short something is about to happen and they want us safely out of the way before it does we need all the advance warning we can get we must get into miras datafiles and read those signalsand any more that come through theyre really upset huh packer raised his eyes upward they are even sniffling out the ventilation systemsthey say there is a chemical leak from sanitation and traces of cyanide were found in the air it is just an excuse of course so people will not become alarmed then its only a matter of time before they flush us out of here i am taking care of that i am in contact with my secondincommand he is with us he will either disrupt the search of the docking bay or he will obstruct it in some way we dont need to worry yet anyway he will be able to warn us but about tonight packer sighed ill do what i can were all exhausted weve been working at this round the clock do your best comrade soon your work will be rewarded kalnikov turned to leave its coming down soon isnt it how long do we have within the next fortyeight hours perhaps sooner take heart my friend soon you will be a free man again the big pilot stomped off humming a vaguely martial melody yes muttered packer one way or another ill be a free man then he returned to his keyboard and tapped in an exhortation to his team of codecracking worm masters and asked for a progress report that done he settled himself back to work once more august zanderson stood in the dark evening had deepened around him as he waited motionless like a stone image of a man awaiting the summons that would call it to life nearby he heard the gentle rise and fall of aris breathing sounding like the shallow wash of sea upon the sand heard from afar upon returning from her last encounter with hocking drowsy and incoherent she had lapsed into a deathlike sleep her father had stood over her watching until darkness removed her from his sight now he listened to her breathing clenching and unclenching his fists while alternately cursing and praying for her recovery after a while he became aware of voices in the courtyard below the hushed sounds drifted up through the open balcony doorway stirring himself he stepped woodenly onto the balcony to peer into the darkened space below he heard the rush of feet hurrying away to some other part of the palace and then all was still again he turned to go back to his sentinels post near his daughter and as he did so he glimpsed black against a lighter sky the passing of several large illdefined shapes winging over the palace toward the lower slopes a feeling of dread accompanied the passing of the eerie shapes zanderson shivered involuntarily and moved back inside all we want is a bed for the night said spence well be gone in the morning please you may stay as long as you wish until you are rested and your friend is able to travel again do not even think of leaving you are safe here and most welcome we are a poor seminary and our students are poor but we are rich in the spirit and a great wealth of grace is ours what we have we will share with you gladly spence was about to protest but adjani cut him off saying we are most honored dean devi of course we will stay as long as is necessary your hospitality is most welcome devis smile was warm and pleased he turned to the door of the chapel and opened it and led them in it was dark and warm inside and smelled slightly musty with agelike an old library or museum thought spence the scent was not disagreeable at all rather it made him feel secure as if he had stepped into a safe harborage well out of reach of the worlds blasts and alarms this then was what the ancients meant by sanctuary here on this holy ground nothing could harm him he was safe and at peace at once he felt the weight of care roll off his shoulders he looked around at the highvaulted ceilings barely outlined in the soft light of candles burning in great iron holders in the front of the sanctuary yes this place is very old and most holy devi spoke in hushed tones as he spoke spence became aware of the presence of others in the chapel he had thought they were alone but realized as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light that there were several figures silently bent over something at the front of the chapel are we disturbing something he indicated the figures not at all let us make your friend comfortable and i will tell you about them he nodded toward the figures outlined in candlelight kyr had recovered enough to move under his own power but still seemed not to know where he was or what was happening to him adjani who had been supporting him laid him down in a nearby pew propped his head on a cushion and spread the blanket over him which devi had provided gita lay down at the other end of the pew and both were soon sleeping peacefully i think hes going to be all right whispered adjani as he joined devi and spence both spence and adjani had been careful to keep kyr in the shadows as much as possible so as not to alarm their host with the aliens presenceit would have been very difficult to explain after all with him now resting safely in the pew both men breathed a sigh of relief their secret was safe a little while longer devi motioned them away to a place where they could talk more freely without disturbing the sleeping men spence looked at the kneeling figures he could see them clearly now bowed over the image of a cross set in white stones in a mosaic on the floor they are the friends of intercession said devi they are observing their office of prayer friends of intercession a holy order yes but not the way you mean it is a society but anyone may join we are all members here at the seminary it was given its modern name by a professor we had here many years agoan american like yourself he had a daughter a little girl who was taken ill and nearly died i believe they held a prayer vigil for many weeks and she eventually recovered he attributed her deliverance to our intercession and gave us the name though that as i say was before my time theyve been praying ever since oh yes and beforelong before the practice goes back many centuries i told you this place was very old tradition has it that it is founded on the exact spot of the first christian church ill india this chapel rests on the foundations of that first church st timothy himself is said to have visited this place it is that old the apostles spread the new faith to the ends of the earth in accordance with the lords great commission their seed found fertile soil here and took root from the beginning this has been a place of prayer we observe this most venerable and holy rite in our turn as the others did in theirs it stretches back through time in an unbroken chain spanning the years joining us to the very first believers as devi spoke the door to the chapel opened and a lone figure slipped in and took its place at the front of the sanctuary replacing one of the members of the little group who then got up and left just as quietly so it goes on observed devi sometimes in large groups or small sometimes a lone student or faculty member kneeling silently they come to pray and stay until someone else comes to take their place the chain stretches onforged a link at a time spence was overwhelmed by the enduring devotion of the society he had never heard of such a thing and could scarcely comprehend such selfless pity the quiet fierce discipline of the friends of intercession left him almost speechless what do they pray for he asked embarrassed at once by the crudeness of his question they pray for whatever the spirit lays upon their hearts but always for love wisdom and the strength to do gods will and also for his presence to be manifest in the world we pray that the lord will come in glory and for the father to deliver all men from the evil one as the name suggests we intercede for all mankind before the throne of light they talked a little longer and then devi left them to their rest spence crawled into his berth in a nearby pew one thought uppermost in his mind it must have been aris mother that sick child whose illness had galvanized the seminary into organizing the society that continued its vigil of prayer even to this day indeed who else could it have been had she paid some price with her broken life had her suffering purchased some measure of grace that he now could draw on in his time of need even as he held the thought he remembered one whose sacrifice had paid an ultimate price for all of them strange the economy of heaven thought spence he had the undeniable feeling that somehow beyond mortal reckoning an order a fine symmetry reigned that counted him and the mad caroline zanderson in its balance and linked them in its accounting together with the allbutforgotten seminary with its humble students kneeling obediently in endless prayer against what the dream thief perhaps unknowingly but also against the greater darkness of evil that gathered over the face of the earth the vast unreason that threatened always to extinguish the light but could not and why not because a tiny society together with all the other small and seemingly insignificant ones the world over held fast to the flame keeping it safe within the strong fortress of its devotioneven in the midst of the enemys own camp strange the economy of heaven they left early the next morning before anyone else was astir no one not even the three kneeling over the inlaid cross at the front of the sanctuary saw them go kyr appeared to have fully recovered from the aftereffects of the sonic blast that had stunned him he walked across the seminary courtyard in the silver light of dawn easily and swiftly with gita a short pudgy shadow by his side spence lifted the wooden latch pushed open the gate and stepped out to face the world once more he felt rested and calm as if he had been given some deep assurance that his restless groping in the darkness was not in vain he sensed within him the tiny pricking sensation that quickened the heart and keened the senses that told of a new awareness of purpose the night spent in the seminary had been a healing interlude a blessed convalescence that he badly needed without speaking they retraced their hurried steps of the night before working back to the place where they had camped by the time the sun had risen in the treetops they were standing once more at the site of their campfire now cold ashes in a blackened ring there was silence all around as they stared across the nearby forest clearing kyrs spacecraft was gone hocking swept noiselessly into the murky chamber clouds of incense rolled before him and scuttled away as he passed ortu sat immobile on his platform of cushions head upon his chest long arms resting on his knees it was the same energypreserving position hocking had always seen him in as long as he could remember the ancient martian rarely moved but the old head rose as hocking drew nearer what is it demanded ortu what do you want i have not summoned you i saw the naga return what news did they bring there was an edge to his underlings voice that ortu had not heard before he glared back at hocking and said i will tell you when i choose you will tell me now said hocking evenly the great yellow eyes flared open and focused intently on the object before them you dare to question me i am tired of playing the obedient servant ortu from now on we will act as equals equals never as equals ortu i have suffered your caprices long enough for years i have waited in your shadow but no more get out of here you fool remove yourself from my sight you are drunk on your own dreams of power i alone say what will be and when the kastak flared and subsided into a steady purple glow not any more ortu i have dreams of power yes and ambitions of my own that you know nothing about some of then i have already begun to put into action while you sit by and do nothing oh what are these puny plans wise one tell me what happenedwhat did the naga find they escaped how what happened what difference does it make they escaped and the guardian it and the guardian with them they are on the way here now then we must be ready for them when they arrive ortu sank back into himself do what you will we are no match for a guardian i am too old ortu cried hocking listen to me i need you if we are to crush them i need your power the martian withdrew further into his normal trancelike state you cannot defeat them it is too late we have failed no screamed hocking the pneumochair swung closer to the rigid figure before him ortu did not move hocking glanced at the lowered head of his master and saw the circlet the kastak now throbbing irregularly his own thin hand shaking slightly reached out toward it in an instant the source of ortus power was in his grasp ortus eyes snapped open what he gasped a startled expression appeared on his face give it to me no ortu drew back his head but hockings skeletal fingers held tight he felt ortu tugging away and was amazed at how weak his master was with a quick snap he jerked the circlet and the kastak was his with this i am in control he held the kastak before ortus stricken face the power is mine give it back cried ortu you cant know what it means i know enough to save us if you wont no need it it is mine now ortu the alien made a lunge toward hocking to snatch the band out of his hands a finger twitched on hockings tray and ortu was flung back against his cushions in a heap i am in control now ortu i say what will be ortu did not move from where he lay his eyes watched hocking dully give it back to me he pleaded i will die without it then lie hocking backed away from the squirming alien you are no longer any use to me ortu i have endured you long enough ahhh ortu raised a hand and rolled weakly forward as if to prevent hockings retreat but he lacked the strength to rise and so lay quivering as if chills assailed his frail body hocking left the room and did not look back already he was naming a plan in his mind he would let them come to him and then destroy them allexcept reston reston too would be crushed but first that stubborn will of his must be broken completely before he was finished with him reston would beg for death and would die with hockings name on his lips hockings features contorted in a leer of pleasure at the image of spencer reston groveling before him pleading for release and he would give it oh yes he would give it on foot the travelers pushed through sparsely forested hills upward higher and higher toward kalitiri the way was well known and well marked they could see the mountain itself serene and majestic trailing white wisps of clouds from its slopes standing before them remote and aloof from the world of men they climbed through terraced fields of millet and rice cut in the sides of the hills like the wide stair steps of giants they passed the hillfolk working the fields with their buffalo or repairing the breaks where rain had carved out gullies in the terraces and washed the soil away others burdened like pack animals hauled firewood from the forests above the villages over all hung an air of quiet industry which seemed peaceful and good the peasants with their baskets of woven twigs went about their work pausing only to glance at the three newcomers and their tall companion in silence or to hail them with a wave and a shout as they passed spence watching the toil around him began to feel as if he had been there beforesome time ago it was the same sense of deja vu pricked before at various times along the way he felt he really did recognize the place but this time the scene carried with it none of the strange panic that used to seize him in his dreams of course that was it his dreamshe had been here in his dreams spence stopped and looked around as if he were lost in a place that nevertheless seemed extraordinarily familiar these hills were the hills he had seen in his dreams and these were the ragged peasants who labored so hard to pull the stones from the ground and haul them away it was as if he had stepped back inside his own dream for a moment the world was frozen and unreal the feeling passed and everything around him took on its normal appearance the strange flashback receded leaving behind only a residue of mild disorientation which he shook off what is it shence arc you okay adjani was beside him with a look of concern wrinkling his brow spence forced a smile and said its nothing i seem to think i remembered this place for a moment it was in one of my dreams and and nothingreally its all right it just kind of gave me a funny feeling he laughed maybe somebodys trying to tell me something adjani only nodded and said come on but let me know if you have any more flashbacks this may be dangerous territory for you spence had not considered that he might be especially vulnerable the nearer he got to the dream thief the idea made him feel that every step closer to kalitiri drove another nail into his coffin it unnerved him making him feel small and weak at last they reached the place where the gorge separated the mountain from the winding mountain pathway the palace was still some distance away but could be seen its dark walls showing between the trees that had grown up high around it there it is said gita pointing and here we are he looked at his friends with an anxious expression what are we going to do there is no bridge gita was right at the place where the bridge had been all that remained were two huge posts dangling great fibrous ropes swinging in the winds that raced through the chasm what are we going to do echoed spence is there another bridge gita shook his head slowly no sahib it is not likely these hillpeople use the same pathways for generations the only time they make new ones is when a landslide carries away an old one it is certain that this is the only way that the bridge has fallen away shows what little use the people have for this path kalitiri is not a place they care to go kyr looked into the deep gorge compared to the rift valleys of ovs it is nothing you arent suggesting we try to climb down there and back up the other side are you spence was incredulous he gazed down into the dizzying depths to the swirling water below and then back up the sheer jagged rock face of the other side the gap was a good twenty or thirty meters across without a good rope i wouldnt dare try it gita rolled his eyes in mute terror at the thought and threw up his hands adjani looked from one to the other of the group well theres only one way to find out i suppose we can buy some rope from the villagers perhaps theyll even help get us across spence swallowed hard kyr and i will stay here you and gita go and see what you can find well scout out the best place to climb and meet you back here gita left with adjani protesting that it was no use that he would not mind being left behind in the least that climbing always made him sick to his stomach his protests diminished as he and adjani returned back along the winding path and were soon out of sight spence stood looking at the patch of forest which for the most part hid the palace from viewall but the gleaming hemisphere of the domed stupa in the center and the spike of the thin tower beside it nothing stirred that he could see the place looked overgrown and deserted a habitation of monkeys and parrotsthe same fate suffered by ruins the world over but he also sensed a power in that place which exerted a hold on him he could feel it drawing him its pull almost a palpable force was it outright foolishness to presume that they could accomplish anything by going therethe four of them weaponless and very much at disadvantage was this a fools errand was it part of the dream thiefs plan from the beginning as if reading spences dark thoughts kyr turned to him and said do not allow despair to eat at your heart earthfriend im afraid kyr what can we do against him do not be afraid dal elna has not brought us this far only to fail im not so sure why did he let any of this happen in the first place why that no one can knowthe answer is beyond our highest thoughts we have no weapons nothing to fight with we are far from helpless you had nothing when you were lost on ovs yet you survived more you increased in strength and wisdom that was different how was it different kyr looked at him intently with his great yellow eyes spence had no answer and so turned away he began walking along the edge of the precipice in search of a likely spot to descend he tried to shrug off the feeling of deep foreboding that had begun to swarm over himas if the close proximity of the palace and its occupant increased his sense of helplessness and dread but the oppression would not be shaken off if anything its grip on spence was tightening the fact that ari also was held in its graspa thought which was never far from his mindmade it that much more potent after searching along both sides of the pathway for some distance they found no better place to make a crossing than the spot where the bridge used to be so they returned to wait for adjani and gita to come back they did not have long to wait no sooner had they settled themselves beside the old bridge post than they heard a commotion coming up the hillside soon gitas blue knob was seen bobbing toward them with adjanis slim form beside him but behind them marched what appeared to be the entire population of rangpo and surrounding countryside all were babbling at once and shouting as if they were on their way to a major sporting event which they were they were coming to see the foreigners cheat death on the rocks bets were laid and wagers had already been made on the improbable outcome of success spence looked aghast as adjani and gita came strolling up he glanced quickly at kyrthere was no way to hide him now no way to disguise his alien appearance sorry said adjani we tried to discourage them but he gestured to the crowd around him who had fallen strangely silent in kyrs presence they had to come were stuck with them im afraid black eyes sparkled whispers buzzed through the throng as the villagers beheld the alien kyr gazed back at them calmly and the awestruck hillfolk became reverently quiet apparently believing themselves to be in the presence of a god or at least a very powerful spirit of some order unknown to them they watched in wonder as he stood and came forward to take the ropes they carried gita turned to the crowd and said something quickly i told them not to be afraid that he is our friend and theirs kyr took a coil of handwoven hemp rope and slung it over his shoulder kyr what are you doing said spence watch and you will see he stepped to the edge of the gorge and lowered himself over wait said adjani let us tie a safety rope around you gita closed his eyes oh merciful heaven there is no need this is one skill all on ovs possess from the time they are very young it is a game with that he threw himself over the edge much to the chagrin of the onlookers the crowd rushed forward most expecting to see his tumbling body smash against the stones instead they saw the strange being lightly skittering down the face of the chasm as deftly as a spider his long arms and legs spread wide gripping the rock in impossible handholds down and down he went as easily as a man descending a staircase spence and all the rest marveled at kyrs swift sure movements in no time the martian reached the bottom of the chasm and began propelling himself across the surface of the thrashing cataract like some kind of great gangly waterbug the alien skipped across the churning waves in a manner that defied description once across he raised his head to regard his audience crowded over the edge of the precipice and then reached up and started climbing the opposite face as swiftly as any lizard scaling his favorite sunning rock then he was standing across from them weaving his head from side to side smirking as if to say its easy just do what i did well done cried adjani and immediately the crowd went wild with shouts and cheers spence just shook his head in disbelief and grinned kyr proceeded to tie one end of the rope to one of the bridgeposts on the other side of the gorge he then heaved the coil back across to the other side it took several attempts but they finally caught it and made it fast to the opposite bridgepost the villagers then took over another rope was passed across and tied to the second bridgepost they then had two parallel lines stretched taut across thechasm spence didnt see how that could possibly help them buthe kept quiet and let the men from the region work he and gitasat down on a rock nearby and watched the new bridge take shapethe sun was a murky yellow ball low in the sky when thethird rope was tied off this one was actually made up of fourseparate lines braided together and slung between the first twothere were workers on both sides of the gorge now a group having shimmied over on the first lines pulling themselves across hand over hand with their legs entwining the rope next more ropes were woven from the two upper strands to the bottom one to form a veeshaped trough and though the work went quickly enough spence was acutely conscious of the passing of timethe day was almost gone night came on quickly in the high hills once the sun had slipped behind the curtain of mountains darkness crawled across the high places and valleys though the sky might stay light for hours the suns last rays were already shining on the peaks turning their snowy caps into golden crowns and spence felt the night chill seeping into the air when the new bridge was finished and even though he had witnessed its construction from the first moment to the last the rope bridge still appeared a thing of miraculous invention as if it had suddenly appeared and spun itself across the void like a magical spider web well whos first asked adjani spence looked at him for a moment not quite understanding the meaning of his question then it struck himit was time to cross oh uhyou go first adjani you have more experience in these things me he looked around the hillpeople watching them eagerly smiled and pointed at him you see adjani they want you to be first to inaugurate the new bridge you dont want to disappoint them adjani took a deep breath and said i suppose not all right here goes he fixed his gaze on the bridge and stepped up to it clutching the parallel ropes one in either hand a cheer went up from the crowd i feel like a tightrope walker in a circus he called back over his shoulder and with a look of deep concentration on his face he began to walk across placing one foot carefully in front of the other gripping the sides and not stopping until he was on the other side beaming back at his friends come on its easy he called gita youre next said spence lets go but sahib i dont worry ill be right behind you just do what adjani did you wont have any trouble he led the sputtering gita to the bridge and placed his hands on the lines gita gulped and gaped and stared into the darkening depths of the chasm below dont look down gita keep your eyes on the other side watch adjani hell help you gita his face ashen and his hands trembling put one hesitant foot on the footline and tested its strength he carefully positioned his weight on the rope and then moved out a centimeter at a time keep coming hollered adjani from the opposite side dont stop and dont look down gita inched his way across in agonizing slowness swaying violently from side to side with each step he reached the middle and then stopped afraid to go any farther dont stop cried spence go on you can do it youre doing fine just keep moving dear god in heaven cried gita helplessly come on gita you can do it coaxed adjani but gita eyes shut tight hands clamped on the swaying rope could not move dont panic said spence youre doing fine stay calm im coming to get you without a second thought spence stepped on the footline and began working his way out to where gita remained frozen in the center of the bridge he kept up a reassuring banter as he went and adjani offered soothing words from the other side were going to make it gita just stay calm dont make any sudden moves the bridge swayed and bounced as spence moved out the breeze whistled in the rocks below and the ropes creaked with the combined weight of the two men it was then that spence knew gitas fear to be real for he felt it too he swallowed hard and willed himself to go on gita was right ahead of him he had stopped in the center of the bridge and his weight made the angle of descent somewhat sharper for spence this combined with the natural tendency of the bridge to swing and bounce made the footing even more hazardous gita im right behind you im coming up on you now dont move spence did not want to frighten him further by surprising him he could see gitas hands like claws clutching the hand lines his knuckles white im here gita now were going to move together soothed spence when he came within two paces a sound like a sob drifted back to him from the indians throat spence realized it was the beginning of the lords prayer repeated rapidly over and over i want you to start moving again gita ready move when i tell you well go together left hand first okay move gita slid his hand along the rope and took a step good thats it now the right they moved a few more steps together and then spence stopped to help steady the bouncing bridge gita went on and reached the other side there was a burst of acclaim as gitas feet touched solid ground once more spence made to follow gita but was watching gitas reception rather than attending to his feet he lifted his foot the bridge swung and spence his eyes still on the scene before him felt the awful sensation of treading out into empty air unbalanced the bridge pitched further and spence felt his other foot slip off the footlines his right hand lost its grasp and scratched for a hold he saw the darkness below him and heard the rush of the river below it all seemed to come flying up toward him to pull him down and swallow him he heard someone yell his name even as it was happening spence knew that it had happened once before in a dream the thin line between his dream and the terrible reality that now engulfed him blurred in that instant and melted together that he would fall he knew knew it with rocksolid certainty he would be crushed on the rocks below and his body swept away in the river it was all foretold in the dream the world spun around him the sky above the bridge his friends the villagers the greedy darkness belowall revolved in kaleidoscopic fashion he felt his grip on the handline slipping and a fuzzy confusion passed over him he shook his head to clear it and cried out for help the echo of his own voice rang sharply in his ears and died away in peals of laughter his fingers burning with pain slackened and he felt the rope twist in his hands as it slipped away i dont like it its getting too dangerous packer stood with his arms folded across his chest and his back to his listener his red hair uncombed for many days stood out in all directions like a shaken red mop his normally fresh jumpsuit was rumpled and sweatstained and his face gray with fatigue bristled with long red stubble what would you have us do about it friend it is dangerous yes we are not playing a childs game kalnikov slumped back roundshouldered in his chair and frowned at the ceiling he too showed the strain of the passing days we could try to get him out suggested packer too risky besides just the attempt would tell them they have captured an important prisoner it would also tell them that we have a good network of spies reporting their every move in cases like this unfortunately it is better to wait and do nothing we must not endanger the network just leave him its my chief assistant were talking about you know head of our glorious network all the more reason to remain calm he must not be made to appear at all valuable otherwise they will think they are in a position to bargain with us they must never think that they must remain uncertain on that score we must keep them guessing silence is better and it is better for jones too you will see packer ran his hands through his hair and sat down with a flop in a chair opposite the russian pilot a deep frown creased his unhappy face i suppose youre right but i still hate it i know it is most unfortunate but there is yet hope we do not know what he may have told them he may have convinced them he knows nothing of our whereabouts and unless they are very desperate they will have to believe him i dont imagine even ramm is bold enough to begin arresting people wholesale the mutineers must still maintain some semblance of orderat least for a little longer so perhaps they will release jones eh packer nodded slowly kalnikov continued now then how are we coming on the breakin miras shields tumbled a few hours ago thats good news yes fantastic that is something to cheer about at least well yes and no without getting too technical lets just say were only sixty percent home theres still a long way to go miras a tricky gal shes state of the art and her data blanks are all biochip components theyre a lot tougher to manipulate at arms length more complex we can roam around inside her circuits and sample bits and pieces of stuff we run across but that way it would take years to find what were looking for and theres a good chance that wed stumble over an internal tripwire of some kind and give ourselves awaytheyd know they had a worm theyd start shuffling the stuff around and wed never find it we need to know where the information we want is stored and we also have to find which lines theyre using for communication in short we need a master key to the system layout a road map were working on it now well keep working on it let me know as soon as we have something kalnikov got up and brushed the bags out of his uniform ive got to go and pick up the last shift report from my secondincommand there is one thing though packer called after him we could order a shutdown of certain onboard systems throughout gotham oh how would we do that its simple we merely introduce false information into the matrixsay splice in a signal for a faulty blower fan or something mira would shut down the ventilator in order to check it out or shed signal someone to go fix it anyway it would be shut down while all that was taking place it might be useful oh yes kalnikov smiled broadly you never know what might be useful ramm paced back and forth in front of the directors desk wermeyer sat watching him drumming his fingers on the wooden desktop its not good i have to let him go soon i cant keep hint indefinitelywe havent charged him with anything people are asking questions well then charge him think up something if we let him loose now hell know we dont have a clue where they are and if he is in contact with the others theyll know it too any word from hocking for the third timeno not yet relax will you getting nervous wont help everythings going as planned the takeover is right on schedule ramm shook his head and glared at wermeyer i wont relax until this place is buttoned down tight right now there are too many variables too much can go wrong youre a worrier ramm ive already told you nothing can go wrong why dont you stay here and have a drink with me you look as if you could use one no thanks im still on duty replied ramm coldly he turned to walk out of the room still i wonder what can be keeping hocking he was supposed to have been here by now wermeyer only shrugged and turned away ramm was a worriera good soldier but a worrier and a stickler for detail but soon it would all be over and then the station would be theirs and after that well who could tell anything was possible anything at all spence felt the rope twist in his grip as his fingers let go he saw it slide sideways his hand clawed the air it seemed that he hung motionless for a fraction of a second before sinking backward into the chasm he heard the screams of horrified onlookers and recognized his own name among unintelligible shouts he twisted in the air even as he fell and managed to snag a piece of the sidewebbing of the bridge with one hand he caught the length of rope and held on then blood pounding in his temples so hard that he could hardly see he managed to get his other hand on the rope and haul himself back up a few centimeters the rope as a weak lifeline it served only to prolong the agony for as he clung to the rope kicking his feet to maintain his grasp the strand snapped and he plummeted into the chasm belowto the renewed shrieks of those watching on the banks above spence saw the darkness rushing up toward him and the gray brown rock face slipping past him only an arms length away then something struck him at first he thought he must have collided with a rock jutting out from the stone wall there was a tearing soundas if he had snagged his clothing on the rocks in the same instant he felt a sharp pain between his shoulder blades he caught and spun arms and legs jerking uselessly his head snapped forward driving his chin into his chest he was dangling in midair he turned his head to see what had saved him and looked up into kyrs two huge eyes the blow spence felt between his shoulder blades was kyrs lightningfast grab at his clothing the martian now held him with one hand clinging precariously to some nearinvisible handhold with the other moments later they were clambering over the edge of the precipice eager hands pulling them to safety adjani gripped spences arm very hard and pulled him away from the edge kyr bent over him and asked are you injured no dizzy ill be fine i am sorry if i hurt you earthfriend your gravity does not allow me so move with ease i fear i struck you too hard spence only shook his head i never saw anything like it cried gita i never saw anyone move to fast in my whole entire lifetime great merciful heavens spence turned to the chasm my dream almost came true just then thank god it didnt and thank you kyr i owe you my life i am glad to serve you earthfriend i sensed you were in difficulty look at that shouted gita behind them our audience is leaving shows over they turned to see the villagers filing silently away heading back to their homes as darkness closed on the mountains i dont blame them said spence he nodded toward kalitiri seen as a dark impenetrable mass over them now indistinguishable from the mountain around it we go to beard the lion in his den im sure they dont want any part of it but i wonder how they knew they are a very superstitious people these hilldwellers said gita they do not like to wander these mountains in the dark only tragedy can come of it when the sun goes down they light their fires against the night and squat in their home until morning the last of the hillpeople were gone now padding softly away in the twilight they had gone quietly so as not to arouse the slowly awakening spirits of the hills what do we do now wondered spence out loud any ideas yes said adjani ive been thinking about it all day and and i think its time we had a council of war the idea was ludicrous plain silly it seemed to spence the four of them were going to try to break into the dream thiefs stronghold barehandedwith not so much as a bludgeon to swing between themand what reason with him talk him into putting aside his evil schemes this one who through the mysterious tanti wielded power over mens minds could direct their very thoughts according to his willthey dared to approach him it made no sense it was not logical their chance of success spence reckoned was nil but what could they do something had to be done someone had to try it had fallen to these four there was no one else so spence turned his eyes away from the dark imposing shape of the palace shall we go over it again just to be sure we all know what do to they had been over it several times but once more would not hurt and it gave them something to do while they waited for the moon to rise above the rim of hills to the east spence could already see a slice of the moon showing it would not be long now right said adjani we all watch each other and go quietly spence and i will go first gita and kyr follow we dont know if the gates are guarded but it looks pretty quiet from here we havent seen anybody moving probably theyre not expecting anything of course theyre expecting us spence shouted inwardly they know were here theyve been waiting for this as much as we have but he said nothing and nodded as adjani continued once were inside we try to find director zanderson and ari then we look for the machinekyr will know what to look for okay remember we have the element of surprise on our side if we arent seen we just might pull it off without a hitch there was much that was not said they all knew it but nodded their agreement just the same of the four only kyr seemed not to have any reservations about what they were about to attempt adjani looked around him the moon had risen and was pouring her liquid light all around the palace with its leafy camouflage shone traced in silver its time lets go he said and stepped from their hiding place onto the rocky overgrown path leading to the gates spence followed him and they crept toward the massive walls which appeared to grow still more massive and impenetrable as they neared the waiting had only served to make their task more hopeless in their own eyes and the dream thief more terrible it was with an overpowering sense of dread and doom that spence stole toward the huge wooden gates not a branch moved not the slightest breath of a breeze ruffled the leaves the ruin appeared a dead and abandoned relic a shrine to an earthly deity long departed perhaps it was true perhaps the dream thief did not exist after all or perhaps he had gone even as he thought these things spence knew they were not true he had been drawn to this place by forces greater than his own volition whether by the dream thief or some other it did not matter he was here very well come what may he would see it through listen whispered adjani whats that spence had been so selfabsorbed he had not noticed any sound at all i dont shh listen there came a sound like laughter or singing heard from very far awayas if from a boat far out across the water the sound came to them and then drifted away just the barest hint of tinkling voices almost nothing at all then all was silent again adjani and spence looked at each other shrugged and continued toward the gates spence could now see the individual beams that made up the gates he could see the great iron bands with bound them the dark walls arching over them rose higher and though smooth spence saw where a person might find adequate hand and foothold for climbing they had almost reached the entrance when there came a scratching noise from behind the gates and suddenly this gave way to a great creaking groan as the huge gates swung open spence froze in his tracks adjani crouched down there was a buzzing sound in the air above them that made spences stomach tighten and his heart leap it was a nowfamiliar sound and one that filled him with despair then he saw them three pair of luminous green eyes just inside the gates three more dark shapes passed just overhead he glanced around to see the forms of three naga demons touching lightly down behind them then all the creatures began advancing at once drawing the circle tighter around them spence and adjani stepped close together the creatures inside the gates moved into the moonlight and spence saw that the one in the center carried a large silver orbthe same object he had seen before that had stunned the dogs and later had knocked out kyr the malevolent creatures came closer spence looked back and saw that kyr and gita had not moved from their hiding place the creatures appeared unaware of their presence perhaps kyr and gita would remain unnoticed and could help them in some way the beings came nearer surrounding them completely now there was nowhere to run and running was ineffective anyhowone blast from the silver orb and it was all over spence felt waves of helplessness and horror rise in him and subside the creatures were within a few paces ringing them in completely spence looked into their glowing green eyes thoughts came into his head thoughts which he knew were not his own inner voices spoke to him come with us they said you will not be harmed come spence raised clenched fists to his head as if to drive the alien thoughts out no he shouted inside i will not but his feet were already moving toward the gatethe demons were taking them inside he opened his mouth to speak but could not make his tongue move he stared around in mute terror god help us save us they shuffled past the opened gates and under the arch spence felt some will other than his own directing his steps now and though he fought it still he moved on he was powerless to stop himself from doing what he did not want to do he was under complete domination to a force greater than the force of his own will then once again from out of nowhere the sound of singing reached his ears closer this time and more distinct but it was not singing it was the sound of many voices excited voices clamoring all at once coming closer the force that grasped him slackened and he turned to glance behind him a long line of bright lights were swinging through the night toward them for a moment he could not think what they were but the voices came from these lights that floated swiftly nearer torches he grabbed adjani by the arm and swung him around pointing to where the torches massed together at the head and trailed off in single file behind all at once it hit him he found his voice in the same instant the villagers the naga demons hesitated momentarily spence felt their hold on him withdraw as their attention shifted to this new development the creature with the orb stepped forward his wings halffanned out from his repulsive body he raised the orb just as the first of the torchbearers came running up spence saw their faces in the light the blades of makeshift weapons flashed in their handshoes and machetes and other implements they rushed forward toward the creatures and then halted in confusion as the demon with the orb scuttled forward and raised the object over his head spence threw himself headlong at the creature and knocked the sphere away he landed with a thump that knocked the air from his lungs and saw the silver object roll to the side there was a great cry and the peasants came rushing in he felt icy hands on him and saw two creatures clutching at him lifting him to carry him off he yelled and was immediately surrounded by villagers bearing clubs and machetes then he was being hauled to his feet and he looked up to see kyr bending over him im all right im fine he said standing come on cried adjani right behind the peasants swarmed around them pushing through the gates the night was filled with light and noiseit was like a river flooding into a dry valley here and there the current eddied spence saw knots of men pummeling the earth hoes and shovels rose and fell and he knew that the demons would trouble them no more they came back he said in disbelief they came back indeed shouted gita his round face split into a wide grin god be praised they came back to help usand also to share in the treasure they believe we will find inside then i hope they get some said spence but right now wed better find what were after adjani was already leading them across the ancient courtyard the echo of excited voices and the reflection of torchlight on stone came back to them from every corner they ran to the nearest and largest structure and entered through a wide entrance into the main corridor the press of bodies carried them along together the excitement seemed to shoot through them all like sparks they came to a smaller corridor that opened off the main one spence stopped and turned a single door closed off the further end a few meters away spence walked toward the door the sounds of the rout receded in the corridors behind him as the villagers swept on he heard shouts from other parts of the palace but here it was dark once more and quiet he stood looking at the door and knew what awaited him on the other side the dream thief old naag brasputi the fearful ruler of mens minds spence found it strange that he should feel so calm at this moment he had no fear no terror not even any alarm that he should be so close to the monsters own chamber it was as if once resigned to facing the thing before him it held no more terror for him its power over him was broken and yet he knew that could not be the entire explanation there had to be something more he heard a rustle beside him and someone moved yes he is here said kyr raising his hands before the door i feel his presence he paused and added but the life force is growing weaker spence reached out and pushed the door it swung open easily and he stepped through the low stone archway and into a large room reeking of incense and hung in a brown cloudy haze large stone vases lined the walls of the room and candles burned in clusters all around at a further end on a stone dais amid a sea of brightcolored cushions slumped the old martian all alone the ancient head came up slowly feebly the great yellow eyes opened and regarded them with cool contempt the wattled throat trembled and the mouth opened so here you are at last guardian kyr stepped forward slowly who are you he spoke so that spence could understand him i have worn many names in the time of my life which would you like to know brasputithat is how i am known to many dream thief some call me i am told ortu was my name when i walked among my own kind he tilted his head up to regard the imposing form of kyr it is strange seeing one of my race after so long ortu kyr breathed his head weaving back and forth why words unspoken passed between the two aliens ortu accepted the authority of kyr for his gaze slid away he said i will tell you his eyes closed and his head sank back to his chest and as if in a trance he began to speak we sought the far stars and i led many bright ships to homes under different suns but always there burned in my mind the beauty of this world and its people it seemed to me favored of all the worlds i had seen when the vimana under my command malfunctioned we could search no more and i led my colony back here we came to this place then little inhabited we lived here in peace for many long years but we established no colonythe radiation that damaged our vimana also damaged our bodies and we could no longer reproduce our own kind in time our people died some through the strange diseases of this world some through age some were killed by the primitive earthmen we tried to help i alone was left of all who had come and here i remain you know it is forbidden to interfere with the earthmen you ortu argued it before the council you were the one who showed us the way of courage ortu was silent for a long time his body trembled and he seemed to be disintegrating before their eyes when he spoke again his voice had changed lapsing into the whistling lilt of martian speech though the words were still earth words we were doomed my colony would never flourish never achieve the bright vision i had worked so hard to make reality we were dying again a long silence and then his voice came again still more strained with martian and earth speech freely mixed together to die unsung by the sons of ovs helith vsi jvan tried to help to teach them but renni ospri so primitive it took so long so long bvur elchor shri i wanted to teach them i waited years but progress was too slow i burned for them one by one the bright ones died rsis atri pulastya kratu vasistha pulacha marici angiras the words were familiar to spence who remembered that these were the names of the gods of indian folklore adjanis father had told them about these had been ortus comrades now long dead but still remembered and strangely revered in indias fantastic legends as spence had suspected the coming of the martians had given birth to one of the most widespread enduring religions of mankind hinduism was founded upon a primitive misunderstanding a mistake of cosmic proportions spence stared at the ancient martian as the wavering voice went on the errors the needless slaughter the sengri we tried to teach them we loved them but they would not understand at this the crinkled eyelids snapped open once more and the yellow eyes glared out defiantly is it any wonder i learned in time to hate them their world was perfect and yet they were bent on destroying it you had no right shouted spence ortus head swung wobbily toward him benasthani risto no right i took it on myself i had the kastakthe power the only way to keep them from destroying this world and themselves was to bring them under my rule and for this i have labored centuries of your time ortu shrugged and seemed to grow weary of talking his head fell forward on his sunken chest and he closed his eyes once more i dont believe you said spence he quivered inside with rage at what had been done to him by the twisted and perverted creature before him i had power muttered ortu with the tanti i planted ideas dreams in mens mind bringing them ever closer to the time when i would reveal myself as their ruler but it is over now the hairless head rolled on the shoulders and the terribly thin wasted limbs fell feebly aside the body teetered momentarily and then toppled forward onto the cushions on its side it jerked once convulsively and then lay still no shouted spence rushing forward he wanted to pound the life back into that obscene body and make it talk to him to tell him why the things he had been made to suffer had been done to him he felt cheated and used and violated he is dead spence felt cool hands on him as he stood seething over the body of the dream thief but how he was very old and sick the seeds of his destruction were sown long ago only the power of the kastak kept him alive now he has joined the bright ones it is over no it isnt over spence looked around the room quickly coming to himself wheres hocking weve got to find him before just then they heard a stifled gasp and turned to see a slightly bowed figure standing in the doorway it was pundi the old manservant with his hand over his mouth eyes wide with amazement spence went over to him and grabbed him by the arm before he could run away the servants face had gone white and he stared at the body of his master lying so still on the cushions where are the others is my master pundi turned his wide eyes on spence and kyr in turn his expression was one of fear and relief mingled in equal proportions yes he is dead said spence tell us where the others are wheres ari and her father he demanded shaking the servants arm at that moment adjani and gita appeared in the doorway they looked at the body of the dead martian and then adjani announced we cant find themari her father hocking weve been all over this part of the palace where are they spence shouted at the servant who still gazed at his fallen master the man mumbled something unintelligible he says that his masters vimana has been made ready replied gita quick said spence pushing the bewildered pundi before him take us to them hurry kyr stooped over the ancient body of the dream thief folding its limbs and arranging it carefully go he said i will join you spence gita and adjani left the chamber pushing pundi ahead of them as they entered the corridor they heard a low rumble which shook the foundations of the palace to its mountain roots what was that exclaimed spence he and adjani looked at each other it sounded like a blast it was the vimana of my master no doubt said pundi they dashed through the passageway and out into the courtyard over stones thick with moss they ran and stopped to stand looking at a brightly blazing orange star that burned up into the heavens diminishing rapidly white smoke still billowed from the ruins of the collapsed central dome which for centuries had sheltered the vehicle hocking said spence when they burst into the tower keep they found august zanderson sitting with his head in his hands moaning and whimpering director what happened said adjani rushing to his side a quick look around the room confirmed spences worst fears ari was gone he knew even before her father told them that hocking had taken her with him to make good his escape wheres he taking her asked spence dark fire flashing from his eyes i cant be sure but i think he intended to go back to gotham he said something about the station being ready to receive themhe had two others with him there may have been more his face at first hopeful and expectant now fell as the impact of what he said hit him afresh shes gone we cant catch them nowitll be days before we can get a shuttle up oh he moaned running his hand through his hair the man was vastly changed since spence had last seen him he looked gaunt and haggard a straggly speckled beard of coarse stubble lined his jaw his eyes were redrimmed and deeply pouched well catch them said spence wed better hurry said adjani they have a good head start their plan failed miserably hocking reached the station first and was ready for them a brief scuffle in the docking bayresulting in taser darting all around for the would be rescuersput a swift end to the rescue attempt spence came to lying facedown in a cell groggily shaking off the effects of the taser dart and wondering what had happened they had counted on director zandersons sudden forceful appearance to throw the mutineers into panic thereby giving them time to marshall the help they needed from gothams alarmed populace but they never had a chance to sound the alarm chief ramm and his men had been waiting for them the moment they stepped from the craft it was all masterfully calculated looking at it now spence wondered why they had thought it could have turned out any differently they acted foolishly and had been easily outsmarted by hocking how could it have been otherwise their every move had been foreseen now he was alone in a cell in the security section feeling as if someone had clubbed him and then used him for a pidg bird he felt weak and mushy inside his limbs trembled with the neurological aftereffects of the taser jolt his mouth tasted of blood and his nose throbbed from taking the full force of his headfirst dive into the floorplates when the dart hit him with a groan he rolled into a sitting position and saw a small puddle of dried blood where his face had pressed against the floor he hesitantly touched a finger to his nose and found it painfully swollen but probably not broken it had bled freely all over his jumpsuit on his hands and knees he dragged himself to the small vestibule set in the wall he ran water in the tiny sink and splashed it on his face washing the blood from his cheek and neck he rinsed out his mouth spit and then glanced at himself in the mirror the forlorn image he saw staring back at him did not greatly cheer him nor did his prospects for the immediate future what would they do with him and the others then he remembered ari hot black rage flowed up like molten lava within him where was she what had they done to her his rage burned out in futile ravings and exhausted itself in hurling him against the clear plastic door to his cell he slid once more to the floor to sit with his back against the door panting crying tears of anger and frustration grinding his fists against the floor the wave of temper left him and he lay dejectedly against the door it was then that he smelled something burning the smell of melting plastic filled the cell within seconds throwing him into a fit of coughing he lay down on the floor to keep from suffocating on the fumes smoke from a spot in the center of the floor began to rise forming a thick black cloud on the ceiling of the cell he watched the column of smoke fascinated and appalled at the same time what the devil is going on he wondered he did not have long to find out there appeared in the center of the cell first a blackened circle and then the area dipped and sank as if the floor at that spot was meltingwhich it was black fumes rose from the floor trailing black snaky wisps spence feared he would be suffocated very soon the pocket of clear air diminished rapidly as the cloud pressed down from the ceiling he waited holding his breath even as he began choking on the fumes he heard the sound of tearing fabric and then through the smokedark haze saw a head pop through the hole which had formed in the floor the head wearing goggles and a breathing apparatus looked around the room and then saw him a hand appeared and motioned him closer tears streaming down his face spence wormed his way over to the edge squirming on his stomach the floor beneath him was hot like a griddle a mask was thrust into his hand and he blindly fumbled to put it on and drew the oxygen deep into his burning lungs he was handed a pair of thick gloves and motioned down into the opening in the floor with the gloves on he gripped the stillsmoldering sides of the aperture and lowered himself through he felt hands on him steadying his descent so that he would not touch the hot metal rim of the hole once below the floor he cast aside the gloves tore off the mask and jumped from the platform that had been erected directly beneath his cell packer what are you doing here we must apologize for not meeting you at the gate earlier a thicklyrussian accented voice sounded behind him we were unavoidably detained kalnikov you too are you all right reston packer his mask dangling from his neck pounded him on the back it sure is good to see you i didnt expect this i dont thank us yet were not out of the woods by a long shot where are the others kalnikov raised his eyes and pointed upward still captive were working on getting them out now weve been very busy these last few hours ill have to tell you all about it some other time said kalnikov please comrades we must get away from here at once with that the russian stooped and lifted a bulky cylindrical apparatus to which was attached hoses and a sharp nozzle this is our latest invention no space station should be without one im convinced remarked spence they all hurried off along the maintenance catwalk crowded with conduits and pipes and vents of various sizes whats below all this asked spence commissary kitchens replied packer where are we going youll see they walked until they came to a raggededged opening that had been cut in a huge conduit this is our golden highway said packer its a vent shaft that runs the whole circumference weve had to make a few alterations in design but it serves its purpose they stepped inside where a small electric maintenance cart was waiting for them kalnikov will take you to command central ill wait here for the others they should be coming along any time now i want to make sure nothing goes wrong spence got in the cart and they were off the single headlight threw its beam into the darkness of the round seamless tunnel after a journey which he guessed was at least a quarter of the way around the station they halted and got out and went into another tube with a ladder inside it they climbed down the ladder to the next level and continued their way finally arriving at a tiny room littered with tools and materials and scattered pieces of various machines what happened here explosion in the spare parts bin we have not for obvious reasons been able to call housekeeping to properly furnish our little nest we thought you would desire freedom over pleasant surroundings im not complaining believe me it looks great small but great we thought youd like it what happens now that we will have to see about our first objective was to get you prisoners free nothing has been decided beyond that have they taken over then nonot yet not officially anyway there has been no announcement no overt actions for most citizens everything continues as normal most kalnikov smiled proudly there is a small but efficient cadre of enlightened individuals he favored spence with one of his bonerattling back slaps welcome to the underground dr reston within the hour the little room under the docking bay was crowded with people talking excitedly and loudly adjani had joined them first followed by gita and director zanderson wheres kyr spence asked the cadets who had brought the last of the prisoners just shook their heads you got someone else with you asked packer yes said spence a uh friend packer regarded spence suspiciously but did not press for details then theyve taken him somewhere else he turned to his cadets all right you shuttle jumpers clear out keep your eyes open and watch your exits and scramble your trail we cant be too careful now get going ill be in contact as soon as we figure out what to do next the cadets grinning with high spirits at the adventure they were on left silently and swiftly now then said kalnikov to business right agreed packer looking at spence and adjani but first i think you two have some explaining to do they all sat down at a conference table that had been hastily set up in the cramped service area kalnikov took the head chair and packer sat at his right hand spence adjani gita and zanderson filled in around the table director zanderson when an offer was made to allow him to resume command of the station replied as long as those maniacs are in power i have nothing to control im not a guerrilla fighter gentlemen please lets not stand on false ceremony you kalnikov and packer are in chargewell keep it that way we accept your recommendation director said kalnikov now i would like one of you to tell us exactly what were up against we have been working at somewhat of a disadvantage up to now all eyes turned toward spence and adjani and they began to relate all they knew of the dream thief and his plans of world domination the others sat spellbouned as the incredible tale unfolded dream thief is dead spence concluded we saw him die apparently hocking has usurped power from his master and is now bent on carrying out his own schemes here aboard the station that makes sense agreed kalnikov at length we suspected the rebels on gotham were receiving orders from someone on earth we had no idea who it was who is this hocking a madman and a twisted genius added adjani he will stop at nothing to achieve his aims and he has in his possession a machine to make those aims a reality what sort of machine asked packer its called a tanti most simply described it is a consciousnessaltering device once used in psychiatric medicine explained spence to packer and kalnikov he added you wont have heard of it in fact adjani and i have never actually seen it but it exists and it is somewhere here on gotham and we believe continued adjani that it has been modified into a machine capable of broadcasting to entire sections of the globe or to the whole world through the use of satellites that is why this station is so important to hocking it gives him a permanent base of operation beyond reach of the worlds powers packer rubbed his chin and frowned granting what you say is true preposterous as it sounds what exactly does this machine this tanti thingwhat does it do i suspect began spence choosing his words carefully that it interacts in some way with electrical impulses in the brain it stimulates certain cortical bodiesthose normally associated with subconscious activity for exampleand imprints its own predesignated pattern of wave impulses in other words in other words it shapes thought induces dreams manipulates the mind itself mind control said kalnikov precisely replied adjani spence here can vouch for its effectiveness we almost lost him to it the others regarded spence carefully as if trying to detect any sudden changes in him spence smiled grimly on a purely personal basis i can say that the effects are devastating what will happen when the tanti is loosed upon the earth well consider a world where half the population is driven to end its insanity in tortured selfdestruction and the survivors become mindless drones serving a warped master the room was silent director zanderson his voice steady but tense spoke next its up to us gentlemen hocking is to be stopped at once and that machine destroyed every moment he is allowed to continue his schemes we are that much closer to universal chaos kalnikov put his hands flat on the table the pieces are fitting together yes we will now entertain ideas for stopping this monster and his nightmaremaking machine he looked around the table at the tight ring of intense faces what are your suggestions comrades hours later the plan that was finally hammered together lacked several key elements toward making it completely foolproof but whatever it lacked was more than made up in barefaced audacity why wasnt it ready i gave orders for everything to be ready on my arrival hockings pneumochair buzzed ominously across the floor ramm wermeyer tickler and several others watched him silently unwilling to upset him further you failedthat is we failed to anticipate your coming so soon we were waiting for your signal we had only a few hours noticethere wasnt enough time explained wermeyer hocking frowned my plans were shall we say compromised it wont happen again but nothing has changed get your men on it at once i want the platform completed and the machine installed and ready for operation as soon as possible do you hear i already have men on itthey should be finished within the hour said wermeyer excellent and the engines ready for testingalso within the hour thats better see what you can do when you follow instructions and stop whining very well we will begin projection as soon as the tanti is calibrated to our new orbit there was a slight commotion in the antechamber and one of ramms security men came whitefaced into the room he went straight to his chief and handed him a note ramm glanced at the note and his hand trembled hockings eyes narrowed what is it the prisonersreston and the others he looked to wermeyer for support theyve escaped you idiots you bumbling idiots hocking exploded ill have you were on their trail now they will be apprehended ramm was quick to add hocking appeared ready to pursue the subject further but then abruptly changed his mind he looked at each of his crew in turn as if weighing their fates individually the others watched and waited nervously aware that some decision hung in the balance it wont matter hocking said finally so softly that some had trouble hearing an awkward jerk of the head dismissed them you can go now the floating chair showed its back there was the swish of an opening portal and the group filed out hocking turned and saw ramm still standing there well what is it i uh nothing his nerve failed him at the last second i was just wondering why reston is so important to you hockings features tightened in a mocking sneer he is not important to me then why do you want him so bad ramm knew he was on shaky ground i mean why dont you just let me kill him and be done with him once and for all hocking squirmed in his chair and grimaced oh i will kill him eventually he went on speaking more to himself than to ramm but first he must be made to suffer as i have suffered he must bow to me he must acknowledge my superiority yes yes he must curse his weakness he glanced up and shot an angry look to the security chief youre dismissed ramm dipped his head and left without another word time was running out the prisoners had to be recaptured he joined wermeyer who was waiting for him in the next room well what did you expect i dont know ramm said angrily what did he meanit wont matter wermeyer shrugged who can tell obviously it isnt important hes got some scheme thats all i suggest you find the prisoners before anything happens getting worried wermeyer its you im worried about you know how he gets he jerked his head toward the room they had just left and its occupant within im beginning to wonder why i ever let you talk me into this youve got the director of this station locked in your cell and youre starting to secondguess your involvement had i had the director locked up just get him back and itll be smooth sailing from here on i promise you it seems to me you promise too much with that ramm marched off wermeyer watched him go and then hurried away to check on the mounting of the tanti and the alignment of the newly installed engines both projects were now in their final stages soon the station would be pushed from its orbit to travel wherever they willed he could not help smiling to himself everything was going according to plan wearing the green jumpsuits of housekeeperswhich packers cadets had filched from the laundrygothams loyal defenders stood stiffly glancing at their digitons and avoiding one anothers eyes its almost time said packer want to go over it again no need replied zanderson we all know what to do he looked at spence got the drug the encephamine is ready he looked at kalnikov and packer and said ive made up the three vials there isnt much but dropped into the venting system it should be enough to sleep the entire station for two maybe three minutes its potent stuff kalnikov held up his arm im marking ready spence looked at his digiton right the affirmation was echoed around the circle well packer took a deep breath this is it lets go god go with us said zanderson spence looked at adjani standing next to him once more into the fray eh adjani smiled and nodded he opened his mouth to speak and then hesitated what is it forget something adjanis eyes went hard his features tensed adjani spence touched his shoulder and felt the muscles rigid his eyes darted to the othersthey were stopped in their tracks too then he heard it the highpitched prickling soundthe sound of his nightmares his mind squirmed as a curtain of darkness descended around him hocking he gasped the tanti he felt his fists ball up and grind themselves into his eyesockets he screamed a painful pinched cry issued from his throat and he slumped to the floor a leaf fell swirling from a great height it twisted and spun and rode eddies in the air as it slid down and down spinning and spinning spence watched it with fascination and saw that the leaf was really a facetissuethin and nearly tranparent with holes for eyes nostrils and mouth it was in fact his face this thin skin had been torn from him and released set free on the wind to float where it would spence watched it fly hoping that someone would catch his face and return it to him he saw a sea of hands spring up reaching for the tumbling face waving straining to snag it and then it was in the hands of someone he could not see the hands held the fluttering object gently and carried it toward him he could only make out the outstretched hands holding the semitransparent tissue between them the person with his face stopped in front of him and held it up to him he took it and put it on instantly he could see more clearly before him a beautiful young woman with golden hair and eyes of china blue smiled prettily and said thats much better she held out her arms toward him and he stepped hesitantly toward her as his arms closed about the girl she faded from view and he was left standing alone once more ari he shouted he heard the echo of her laughter receding from him and then silence ari he started running toward the place where he last heard the sound ive got t find her spence whispered ive got to find ari he struggled up groggily like an exhausted diver spending the last of his strength stroking toward the surface he could feel the pull of the tanti like the pull of the strong undercurrent on a diver part of him longed to give in and let the current take him to float peacefully into oblivion into the gentle darkness give in the current insinuated dont fight me anymore give in no spence shouted his voice boomed at him from a distance i wont give in then like the diver who feels his lungs must burst but gives one last kick and feels his head break the surface as cold clean air streams into his burning lungs spence with sheer strength of will forced his consciousness to return objects around him became clear and distinct once more his vision sharpened and the awful dizziness left him he was free he stood blinking not daring to believe but it was true he was free he had moved from the secret hiding place of the undergroundthat much he knew he had some vague recollection of having run or walked through endless tunnels as he looked around him now he saw that he was standing on one of the main axials near a junction tube all around him lay the motionless bodies of gothams inhabitants felled by the first projection from the tanti it was as if some monstrous carnage had taken place and the dead lay sprawled eyes staring unblinking unseeing unknowing the sight sickened him and he turned to run along the axial dodging the bodies in his path hocking is insane spence thought he has turned his terrible machine on the station but of course that is exactly what he would dosubdue the station first bring it under his control why hadnt they thought of that they were too busy worrying about what it would do on earth to think about what the tanti would do to gotham but spence had survived the first pulseas he had survived all the others he wondered if he could resist the next one when it came and come it would soon he had to find hocking and somehow shut off the machinebefore there was no one left to resist but he was the only one who could resist the only one who stood between hocking and his evil ambitions that realization brought with it a keen vision his senses sharpened reality divided and rolled away on either hand darkness stood on one side and light on the other he saw clearly the path before him he squared his shoulders and put his feet on the path spence arrived a t his lab rapped in his code and the door slid open he bolted across the threshold there on the floor before him lay the prostrate form of kurt millen a quick look in the control booth found tickler asleep in spences chair the rats always return to the nest he muttered he viewed the destruction of his officefiles and disks were scattered all over the room i wonder what they were doing with all this he reached out and grabbed ticklers shoulder and gave it a rough shake tickler can you hear me wake up tickler spence frowned hocking didnt even spare his own he thought a moan passed the mans lips spence shook him again wheres your boss hockingwhere is he umph said tickler come on old weasel where is hocking tell me and ill leave you alone ahhh i ticklers head rocked forward on the console tickler listen to me spence bent close to the sleeping mans ear i am trying to find hocking youre the only one who knows where he isthat makes you very important i am important he muttered spence smiled darkly thats right you are important now tell me where he is tickler sighed dreamily no one knows if you tell me ill make sure everyone knows you were the one who told youll be famous famous important whispered tickler yes now where is he he jostled the man again hurry before its too late he cried inwardly outwardly he forced him self to remain calm you can tell me tickler its important hocking he started but did not finish yes hes hiding where hiding in the cylinderalways in the cylinder the cylinder wheres that spence gave his former assistant another jolt the cylinder tickleri dont know where it is but ticker did not respond he was sinking deeper into his mindless sleep spence was losing him wheres this cylinder tell me now or youll never be famous s in the stars said tickler and he sank at once beyond spences reach in the stars spence wondered aloud im no better off than before think he told himself stay calm and think where can you see stars from the station any observation bubble of course then thats not it where else outside then spence turned and ran back through the lab with the helpless hopeless feeling that time was running out ari lay in a deathlike slumber on a low couch the soft light pooling around her made her already pale features seem still more spectral her hair lay limp and dull in streaming disarray falling over the side of the couch almost to the floor she did not move when a thin whirring sound like the buzzing of a mechanical insect came near her she did not attend to the voice that addressed her ariadne the breathless voice sighed ariadne my love a thin skeletal hand reached out and touched her cheek withdrawing from the unnatural chill of that soft flesh as from a prick of a needle then the trembling hand stroked her white throat and lingered over the outline of her breast and came to rest upon her cold hands clasped over her stomach a jerking anger traced the fine bones of her hand and wrist which showed through the ashen skin oh ariadne the voice was a quivering sigh that pinched off like a sob soon i will awaken you and we will be together my lovely my ariadne soon you will be mine the shaking hand moved to stroke her hair brushing the temples slightly i am so sorry my dear so sorry i did not want to harm you but you will understandin time you will understand you will love me as i love you my pretty as i love you in time you will see the vision that i see you will share my dreams its all for you that i have done this yes thats it all for you for us my dear i had to show them they think they have spoiled my plans but i will show them all what fools they are my superior intelligence will shame them and you will love me my dear one oh yes you will you will you will hocking withdrew his hand and it fell back onto the tray of the pneumochair his eyes glittered hard in his skull and he licked his thin lips with the tip of his tongue he could not bring himself to tear his eyes away from her it was as if her beauty held him in a trance it was the flame that had drawn this grotesque creature to her in his perverted way hocking loved her the nearness of the young woman during the long sessions in ortus palace had gone to his heart seeing her fearlessly face her task for the sake of her beloved stirred him strangely and he began to imagine that it was for him that she sacrificed herself he imagined also that she had grown to love him as he loved her though he had never so much as breathed of his feelings for her at last he turned away and the chair whisked itself to another part of the room and another couch he paused here too and his glance sharpened once more to his normal arrogance he began speaking in low menacing tones you should not have come alien there is nothing but death for you i will destroy you in the end i must you cannot be allowed to live on here and where we are going there is no place for you but for a little while you are still valuable to me the great elongated form lay still hocking turned away from the inert martian and went back to gazing at his bank of vidscreens which showed various scenes of gothams citizenry sleeping between the pulses of the tanti projections this my children is but a taste soon you will be completely in my power he looked at the chronometer counting down the time to the next pulse very soon spence walked to the end of the docking bay to a maintenance platform and then stood poised for a moment before jumping off he jumped awkwardly kicking in his minithruster a fraction of a second too late he failed to escape gms artificial gravity as gracefully as he had planned he banged his leg on the edge of the platform as he came back down then the thruster on his back took over and lifted him away once free he maneuvered himself deftly turning to draw away from the station backwards he floated along the surface of the gigantic torus as the station spun slowly beneath him above some distance away hung the great circular radio antenna with its long snout he rose toward it scanning the station as it passed beneath him spence felt the thrill of space walking but tried to suppress it and center his mind on the more urgent task at hand still he could not help stealing glances at the infinite starspangled face of the deep and at the quartercrescent of bluegreen earth rising beyond the further horizon of the station a cylinder he thought where is this cylinder he scanned the rotating station for anything that looked even vaguely cylindrical he punched his thruster and drew further away from gms horizon then he saw itlit by the brilliant white and yellow work lights of the construction crews the new telescope housing it looks like a cylinder spence scanned the construction site and saw pieces of long metal girders floating in space and large duralum sheets in stacks near the central tower tiny workmenin special suits that made them look like miniature spaceshipsfloated motionless nearby hiding in plain sight he thought an image flashed to mind of hocking a venomous spider bloated by hate and an insatiable lust for power sitting in the darkness of his foul lair spinning his treacherous webs the image revolted him and now he was about to enter that spiders presence he flew over the construction site and down to the telescope housing when he came near enough he jabbed a button on his forearm panel and the magnets in his boots gripped as his feet touched the metal grid of the trafficway he tilted forward precariously he had not judged his angle of descent precisely and his forward momentum carried him past vertical he fell to his knees and banged his helmet on the trafficway steady now he told himself stay calm he picked himself up carefully and noticed a magnetic wrench laying on the grid he picked up the wrench and moved toward the housing it was a huge cylindershaped appendage rising from its cradle on the surface of the torus when finished it would be completely detached to allow full and undisturbed viewing of any point in the heavens but now it was anchored securely to the station there was a walkway leading toward it and a light above the entrance so this is where youve been hiding all along he thought well hockingive found you now what he pushed the access plate at the entrance nothing happened he had expected as much since it was undoubtedly coded and he didnt know the key but he took the wrench and swung it with as much force as he could into the plate the mechanism shattered and tiny pieces of plastic flew away in all directions he smashed the wrench into the circuitry again there was a bright flash and the portal slid open spence entered the tiny airlock and went on through he closed the inner door and then tried the outer to his surprise it closed and he heard the hiss of air filling the chamber when the light changed from red to green he took off his helmet and struggled out of his suit the inner door slid open automatically and he crossed the small anteroom to the lift tube he walked forward on wooden legs and stepped in his stomach tightened and his heart beat fast he could feel sweat on his back and under his arms an unsteady finger reached out and touched the lift button at the sound of the lift tube sighing up from below hocking turned away from the console an expression of concern flickered across his wasted features the lift stopped and the panel slid aside and reston stepped out you gasped hocking his eyes showed momentary surprise which was covered instantly its over hocking spence glared at his enemy steadily your little game is finished liar spat hocking look for yourself he pointed to a bank of vidscreens showing the work of the tantithe whole station was a morgue of still bodies held in suspended animation the dream thiefs terrible machine had done its work well give it up said spence ha hocking whirled back to him you have plagued me from the beginningyou and that stubborn will of yours you may pride yourself on your accomplishment reston you resisted when no one else couldanyone else would have succumbed long ago but not you youre stalling silence ortu was right about you you are dangerous but its different now i wear the kastak he nodded slightly and the narrow band gleamed on his forehead you see this time you will not escape where are they hocking what have you done with ari and kyr you fool hocking drew nearer save your breath you will need it i mean to crush you like an insect wheres ari spence demanded he noticed hockings eyes shift toward a partition across the room he went to it and pushed it aside ari was lying on a cav couch the sight of her stunned spence he turned with fists clenched at his side if youve hurt her so help me you can do nothing hockings chair rose higher in the air and came closer spence waited not knowing yet what he would do hocking leered down at him i am your master reston say it never say it roared hocking his face was now very near spences spence stared steadily back at his enemy but refused to speak say it cried hocking and as he did so the kastak flashed there was a cracking sound and a bolt leapt from the pneumochair and struck spence in the chest he felt that jolt pass through him and his whole frame was shaken as by an electrical charge he flew backwards several meters through the air and landed on his back now well see who has won crowed hocking the penumochair slid closer spence his vision blurred by tears of pain squirmed and got up on his knees he braced himself out of the corner of his eyes he saw the flash instantaneously the charge struck him again and slammed him to the floor he rolled to his side and turned his face toward the lift tube halfexpecting to see adjani dashing to his aid but no one would come he was alone a sick feeling spread through the pit of his stomach spence knew that he was going to die he heard hockings demented laughter pinging around the rooms metallic walls hocking had conquered after all the thought stirred anger in him my god he thought after all ive been through to die at this madmans hands god help me he pushed himself up on his limbs and knees a third blast jerked his limbs out from under him and his head struck the floor fiery yellow balls of pain exploded before his eyes and he saw hockings face in them taunting him mocking him say it hocking screamed say it and you will die quickly no spence shouted he rolled himself up on all fours another bolt hit him and he felt a weakness in his arms and legs his breathing was becoming labored the repeated blasts were draining vital energy and clouding his mind with pain he felt his strength ebbing the tanti he thought if he could get to the control and disable it there might be a chance slowly straining every nerve and fiber he rose placing his hands on his knees he raised his head and looked at hocking who bobbed nearer his face twisted into a grotesque mask of hate you cant kill me hocking the words came slowly and with difficulty his tormentor loomed nearer and you cant make me bow to you no in a few moments you will beg for death you will acknowledge me hocking tilted his head back and laughed his head shook wobbily on his thin neck spence heard again the cracking sound and instantly another bolt struck him it staggered him back a few paces but he did not go down though he might die he would not allow himself to go down again hocking propelled himself closer coming in range to deliver the killing blow the kastak shone like a beacon on his head spence let him come now he could hear hockings breathing it seemed to fill the whole room he moved toward the console the crackling sound was building again hocking drew closer spence tottered forward slowly with his head down spence did not look at him but continued on stop cried hocking youll never live to reach those controls just as hocking closed on him spence jerked his head up and looked to the side ari he cried hocking awkwardly turned his head toward the couch where the young woman lay she was there asleep as before she had not moved you wont he began but was cut off as spence leaped toward him snatching at the thin tangle of wires that emerged from the base of his skull ahhk he screamed hocking squirmed and the chair dodged to the side spence grabbed the wires and hung with all his might there was a tremendous snap spences arm was wrenched from his shoulder he felt it leave the socket he looked and saw he held a handful of loose wires in the same instant hockings chair crashed to the floor and its occupant was tossed out like a rag doll as its circuits sputtered and fused sending gray smoke and sparks into the air hocking rocked on the floor helplessly emaciated limbs splayeda pathetic puppet without strings the kastak slipped from his head and rolled across the floor out of reach he jerked and twitched and then lay still moaning eyelids fluttering spence grasping his arm at the shoulder stood over the crumpled figure for a moment and then turned away it was over but he felt no joy at winning he went to aris couch the awful stillness of her body made the breath catch in his throat she is not dead spence swiveled to see kyr standing over hockings body behind him but this one is a long hand indicated the skeletal body a small pool of blood was spreading beneath hockings skull he stopped to pick up the kastak at his feet it still pulsed with its strange power kyr youre all right spence sank down beside the couch the martian bent his long frame over aris bed he studied her face for a moment and then touched the rim of the kastak to her forehead you have released me from the hold of that one i will release her from the sleep of the dream thief kyr closed his eyes and a deep thrumming sound filled the room spence sensed a warming flow of energy moving around him it lasted only a moment and then kyr stopped there was a long sigh kyr removed the band but aris features still bore the deathlike traces of her sleep spence blinked back hot tears he clutched one of her cold hands to him as his mouth seemed to fill with bitter ashes oh ari he cried ari he felt kyrs hand on him let your tears be of joy earth friend the dream thiefs power is broken spence raised his head slowly hesitantly and found himself looking into the loveliest blue eyes he had ever seen the party bubbled around him like a pot beginning to boil spence stood to one side with his arm in a sling nursing a glass of apricotcolored champagne watching the bubbles rise and burst as knots of guests crowded this or the other hero and the stories were told and retold to evereager listeners of all the figures in the drama of the moment only spence remained aloof and alone as much by choice as by chance the party had been director zandersons ideaa way to reward in part the loyalty of the faithful and to thank his rescuers after a lavish dinner the long tables had been removed and what the director called an intimate reception commenced which seemed to include the whole of the stations population kyr of course was the main attraction every eye in the room strayed constantly in his direction even spence found himself from time to time watching the martian towering head and shoulders over the throng pressed around him the room sparkled with energy as if highvoltage live wires were pumping electricity into the air spence could almost guess what the headlines would read like back on earth kalnikov sporting a bandaged wrist and packer his left eye blackened by a blow he had received in the tangle with ramm and his men wore their wounds like badges of courage as they held forth to a mixed audience of mira technicians and third year men and others of the sort who were mesmerized by the intricacies of the computercracking caper adjani was besieged by a crowd who hung on his every word and murmured amazement as they plied him with questions concerning the adventure gita whose natural innocence and charm made him an immediate celebrity among the gothamites kept a large coterie of wellwishers laughing with tales of adventures real and imagined all told in his inimitable fashion august zanderson in top form directed what amounted to a roving press conference as he visited each group in turn to extol in ringing platitudes the bravery and fortitude of all concerned spence had heard the stories too the quickthinking ramm and his men combing the air shafts searching out the loyalists hideout were hit along with everyone else by the tantis pulse upon recovery they continued the search stumbling into the hideout still dazed luckily most of the loyalists had awakened by the time ramm reached them a quick combat ensued in which several cadets got darted by sluggish security men and in which kalnikov distinguished himself as a pugilist of the first magnitudelaying out ramm and three of the more obstinate of his men in as many swipes of his great fists packer too used his fists to good account and the remaining rebels offered no further resistance dr williams alone and confused barricaded himself in his office where he was collected in due course surrendering peace fully in exchange for consideration in the prosecution of his case by gm attorneys zanderson and gita recaptured adsec having little difficulty subduing the sleeping wermeyer the director was back at the helm by the time the effects of the tanti had worn offmuch to the chagrin of his former assistant the director had then gone on the air broadcasting over the loudspeaker system of gotham to reassure a groggy and bewildered populace after the initial shock the space station had slowly gone back to business it was all over but the retelling spence sighed and glanced around he had not seen ari but for a brief moment before dinner he craned his neck hoping to catch a glimpse of herlast seen she had been surrounded by a flock of her friends and a gaggle of doeeyed young functionaries from the adsec pool looking for someone tell you the truth i was looking for you spence looked into his glass how sweet i uh guess youre glad to be back imbecile he shrieked inwardly tell her ari smiled but the light in her eyes dimmed somewhat yes i am glad to be back arent you oh sure i guess spence looked away how could he tell her all the things he wanted to say it was not the time or the placeit was all wrong something had changed between them and that fact loomed like a dark cloud over both of them thats great about your mother yes isnt it the doctors say theres a betterthaneven chance shell get better daddy even talked to her this morning shes certainly undergone a dramatic improvementalmost overnight im so happy i she let her voice trail off and then said softly spencer have i done something to hurt you the question stung him no he looked up quickly what makes you say that she shrugged and tilted her head to one side you dothe way youre treating me avoiding me all day and now tonight the way im treating you you have to admit you havent been very friendly since weve been back spence colored and looked away how could she blame him for the coolness she feltit was her doing not his he struggled for a reply but was saved by adjanis sudden appearance there you two are i was hoping id get to see you tonight i was finally able to break away he indicated the swarm with his hand its quite a gettogether isnt it he noticed the look on spences face but you dont look like youre enjoying it exactly oblivious to the tender feelings he might have been trampling on adjani blundered ahead ari did spence tell you his news no he hasnt her voice was a little stiff too modest i guess spence wondered himself what it was that adjani had in mindthere were several things he had been contemplating but none of them were at all decided adjani finally sensed that he had walked into a touchy situation and endeavored to remove himself forthwith excuse me i promised packer a word im sorry i interrupted adjani left and a painful silence descended behind him spence felt the urge to walk away but fought it and stayed realizing ari must have felt the same way what are your plans spence i dont know not really i only know i cant continue my work here that was a surprise oh her face remained calm apparently unconcerned he looked at her trying desperately to recapture some of the intimacy they had once shared its no use anymore he said he might have been pronouncing judgment on the state of their relationship her eyes slid away from his he hurried to correct the impression he had given i mean it doesnt matter anymore something changed for me out there ari theres so much to be done i just couldnt be happy in research again not after what ive seen oh you can see that cant you i guess so weve all been through a lot spence shook his head i didnt mean it that way ive been changed ari he fumbled for the words god called mefor the first time in my life i feel like ive been called to something higher than my own ambitions thats wonderful spence ari forced a smile i mean that im glad for you it was all wrong nothing was coming out like he hoped it would the distance between them yawned wider by the second there seemed to be no way to bridge it what will you do aris voice was tentative spence shrugged i think i should wait for a while before i decide anything i see i cant see getting into anything too hastily of course she was not making it any easier on him spence took a deep breath and crashed ahead i thought about going home for a few weeks id like to see my family theres a lot of loose ends id like to tie up a lot of lost time to make up for he looked at her and she turned away but spence thought her chin quivered and the light glinted liquidity in her eye actually i was kind of wondering if youd go with me there ive said it at last she looked back at him and all at once her manner changed spence felt a warmth of feeling rush over him oh spence really sure that is i mean there are some people i want you to meet my family for a moment they stood before one another spence felt the room shift slightly and then ari was in his arms and his face was buried in her hair the world seemed fresh once more and peculiarly lemonscented now thats more like it the reunited couple turned and met adjani and kyr gazing at them i was wondering how long it would take for you two to get reacquainted adjani said spence was aware that every eye in the room was now on him he did not care adjani and i have been talking said kyr there is something i must say to you in the presence of your friends the martian drew himself up to make his announcement i have decided that it is time to give the gifts of my people to the people of earth spence adjani chimed in he wants you to lead the team that will organize and catalog the treasures of mars spence did not respond he could think of nothing to say did you hear me nothing in the last ten thousand years compares with this adjani quickly perceived the source of spences hesitation i know you want to do something about all the disease and povertyyou want to help those people you saw down there your eyes were opened to a world you never knew existed and you have some vague notion of going back with food and bandages but isnt it possible that god is putting in your hands the means of doing that on a far grander scale than you could ever dream of doing on your own think of it as head of the discovery team you could choose how the gifts of kyrs people could be best implemented on earth true to his calling adjani the spark plug had made the connection it was several moments before spence could speak a lump the size of a potato had formed in his throat he felt ari slip her arm through his and give it a squeeze it is what i want said kyr you have proven to me that the men of earth can be trusted ortus wrongs must be redressed his actions have left a heavy debt of suffering that must be repaid it is time to give what has been saved for you dal elna put this into my mind you honor me highly said spence of course i will accept but only under the condition that adjani shares the responsibility with me and you kyr remain with us to teach us and lend wisdom to our decisions the martian nodded adjani fairly dancing with joy cried excellent we will begin at once not so fast you two can begin at once i have some personal business to attend to first he looked at ari dont we just then packer and kalnikov came up with gita in his blue turban bobbing between them director zanderson followed close behind beaming like a cherub gentlemen and lady he said formally with a nod and a wink to his daughter dr sundar gita has agreed to remain with us for a while and take a refreshertuition and instruments courtesy of gm of course and who knows he may get to like it here and stay on were bringing up his wife and daughters on the next available shuttle please you are too kind i am however much needed at home he grinned though my wife and children would never let me pass up the opportunity to let them come and see this place it is a dream come true welcome aboard they all said in unison director zanderson glanced around the group by the way i want to congratulate thats funny could have sworn spence and ari were just standing here the garden seemed cool after the stuffy warmth of the party the station was tilted away from the sun and the solar shields were open to the light of a spray of stars crickets trilled their evening song among the leaves and a fountain pattered gently nearby the moist perfumeladen air lay still and dark they had exhausted themselves in talking and now spence and ari wandered aimlessly in green solitude their steps lit by small lanterns set in among the foliage along the pathways wed better be getting back said spence after a while before they send out a search party mmm sighed ari raising her head from where it rested lightly on his shoulder i feel as if im in a dream its a shame it has to end she turned to face him looping her arms around his waist it doesnt have to end he said pulling her closer to him the dream is just beginning
