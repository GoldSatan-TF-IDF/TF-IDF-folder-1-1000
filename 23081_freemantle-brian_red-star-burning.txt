brian freemantle red star burning prologue its coming down to me declared maxim radtsic elana stopped with her knife and fork suspended before her gazing at her husband across the dinner table you werent responsible for it going wrong maxim mickailovich not for any of it im directly below the director held the position the longest even before gorbachev or yeltsin came to power what about andrei andrei has to come too there must be some other way there isnt i dont want to andrei wont want to either you cant do this to him itll save us andrei too how trust me im frightened just trust me said radtsic hating the words as he uttered them kill myself echoed charlie derision and astonishment combined thats what i think youll end up doing bollocks rejected charlie at the backtoo often in the forefrontof his mind had always hovered the expectation of dying but violently from a breathsucking assassins bullet or the burn of a backalley knife or a shattering explosion but never of killing himself not even while confronting his now fossilized existence it would be understandable sympathized the small hunched psychiatrist george cowley youve spent almost thirty years at the front end of british intelligence always on the edge now youre blown in a protection program with a new identity a retirement salary a safe house and a protection regime all of which youre refusing to acknowledge or observe from which the only conclusion is that youre either inviting russian assassination or intending to kill yourself bollocks repeated charlie he had to do better than this convince this asshole of an mi psychiatrist that hed got it all wrong as he in turn had got it all wrong staging an intentionally deceiving performance for the too easily detected minders during his limited excursions from the safe house the internal cameras and listening devices would be recording everything of this performance too he accepted it would have been easier for you if maybe not for them if youd had a family a wife children to fill the emptiness within you cowley pressed on but you havent have you charlie all youve ever had is the job and now you dont have that anymore wrong again agonized charlie he did have a wife and a daughter a family still in russia that no one knew about nor could they ever know because natalia fedova was a senior officer in the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti the intelligence agency of the russian federation that his own mi service believed was determined to assassinate him you expect me to adjust in five minutes to all thats happened demanded charlie discomfited at his inadequate reply cowley who had the highest security clearance tapped charlies file on the table between them ive read every word thats in here know everything youve done and having read it id expect you to understand the very real danger youre in and accept all the protection thats being offered what danger was natalia facing after his most recent moscow assignment charlie asked himself as he had repeatedly over the past three months if he was blown as mi believed him to be the search might stretch back to his phoney moscow defection when natalia fedova had been his interrogator charlie had never been totally satisfied then shed sanitized their subsequent relationship from what then would have been kgb records im not convinced the risk is as great as everyone believes it to be thats for the directorgeneral to decide not you and that decisions been made as yours has been made charlie fought back and its wrong you ever kill anyone charlie demanded the psychiatrist unexpectedly never intentionally that was debatable thought charlie uneasy at the prescience of the other man charlie hoped there was nothing in the bulky personnel dossier with which cowley could catch him out didnt it ever worry you people getting killed assassinated persisted the other man it didnt happen often and when it didor had toit was part of the job i never pulled a trigger that reply was a copout charlie acknowledged but theyd been talking of death and dying for the past thirty minutes and he was fed up at the verbal pingpong could you have pulled a trigger if youd had to id been trained to that level as a last resort i never got to that resort charlie was surprised at the sudden although easily suppressed anger an emotion he hadnt experienced for a long time because it indicated lack of control which was always dangerous professionally do you still think you could pull the trigger if you had to not with the barrel against my own head no refused charlie guessing the direction in which cowley was leading you sure about that demanded the psychiatrist or are you pissed off that the rest of your life is going to be spent incarcerated in securitycovered audioandcctvequipped safe houses forever buried deep within a protection program never ever able again to meet or speak to anyone you once knew ill get there responded charlie dismissively youre not even trying accused cowley dismissive in return youre supposed to have adopted the new namethe entirely new identityyouve been allocated and you havent youre supposed never to establish patternsnever the same restaurants never the same pub never the same cinema never the same route or transport to the same supermarketand you havent youre supposed to alter the way you dress alter as much of your appearance as possible and you havent youre even still wearing those spreadapart hush puppies about to fall off your awkward feet as part of that appearance changein your particular case all the more essential because of the target you now areyoure supposed seriously to consider surgical facial reconstruction and you havent bothered to attend three specialist appointments to discuss it i told you id get round to it lame again charlie recognized how often since youve been in the program have you seriously considered suicide since entering the protection program i have never ever considered suicide replied charlie enunciating each word for emphasis i dont believe you declared cowley its a fucking awful existence ive never had a protected patient who hasnt thought of taking his or her own life how many actually did six cowley came back at once im not going to become your seventh assured charlie i know youre not agreed the psychiatrist im going to put you on suicide watch to ensure you dont fuck it thought charlie he had to hurry to reach natalia in time defect to the british exclaimed elana her voice breaking you cant we cant she tried to continue but couldnt her mind seized by the enormity of what radtsic had told her her eyes fixed farther ahead of the embankment road along which they were walking the riverbordered british embassy in the distance we cant youre the virtual head of russian intelligence its unthinkable she tried again what about andrei itll be easy with andrei at the sorbonne insisted radtsic whose heavy mustache gray like his thick hair and heavy indulged body had in the past made him the butt of jokes about his physical resemblance to stalin paris is closer to london than we are here in moscow the moment we run hell be picked up and brought to us there well be together and well be safe its too much for me to understand protested the woman in contrast to her husband who was fifteen years her senior elana was a slim even elegant woman committed to her career as professor of physics at moscow university my work what about my work i mean i dont know i cant go without you youd be arrested dismissed from the university radtsic was agonized by the conversation his whole body clammy with perspiration i didnt mean i wouldnt come with you i was thinking of everything i would be abandoning leaving behind are you sure really sure that youre being targeted i found two listening devices in my office today one actually in the telephone handset the other in the base of the desk light thats why were walkingso we can talkout in the open like this disclosed radtsic and today i was told theres no reason for my attending the quarterly operational review which ive done ever since i was appointed deputy chairman actually headed more sessions than the chairman himself oh my god said elana who was a devoted churchgoer its true isnt it youre going to be purged no im not insisted radtsic defiantly im going to get out hed screwed up big time charlie acknowledged how big he didnt yet know nor how to find out whether even if he would feigning inferiority to encourage the underestimation of those against whom he was pitted was one of several chameleonlike survival cloaks in which charlie muffin so often professionally wrapped himself but it hadnt worked with george cowley on film and on sound charlie knew hed looked a lost vacanteyed idiot who in the specialized environment in which until now hed existed had lost not just the will but the professional ability to live and become a potential liability how in his eagerness to reassure natalia that he was still aliveand financially to provide for her and sashacould he have failed properly to consider the possible misunderstandings the core concern of mi heirarchy had to be that pissing about as hed intentionally stupidly doneneither properly in nor improperly out of the protection regimerisked his detection by those murderously hunting him and that however they chose to destroy him would publicly expose how close russian intelligence had come to insinuating itself into the very heart of the oval office in washington dc with an equally gullible puppy dog britain led unsuspectingly by the nose to the same disaster charlie stirred from the chair into which hed slumped after cowleys departure fifteen minutes earlier it would appear on the allseeing cameras as bad as the confrontation itself as if exhausted by it hed collapsed into continuing depression not what hed objectively been doing taking time for selfcritical selfexamination resulting in what irritation predominantly charlie answered himself irritated at having been so obviously beaten in a verbal whocanshoutloudest contest and at that humiliation being filmed and recorded and at being so completely cut off from everything and everyone and because of that isolation not able to gauge the full extent of his selfcreated situation charlie started up determined to identify all the cameras upon which his every wakingand sleeping through infrared technologymoment was monitored by the time he reached the kitchen and the cupboard containing the islay single malt he was reasonably sure hed located four before abandoning the pointless exercise miniaturized as the lenses were hed never pick them all out and what if he did he wasnt on an operational assignment where he had to protect himself against every eventuality he was in a permanently recorded goldfish bowl and there was no recovery advantage from his being able to pose or perform to mislead his constant watchers whatever he did would be further misconstrued as proof of his mentally eroding hold on reality which it most certainly wasnt charlie assured himself as he splashed whiskey into his glass intentionally to be visible to a camera in the windowblind coping the whiskey and how much of it he drank would scarcely be a revelation to his observers they actually provided it because of its rarity known as it inevitably would be to his pursuers it could have led to his whereabouts if hed placed a regular order with an outside supplier how many pursuers would there be wondered charlie carrying his tumbler back to his accustomed lounge chair overlooking the small sensorseeded garden this soon only three months after hed wrecked an espionage operation the russians had nurtured over practically eighteen years thered be a lot a codenamedesignated operation in fact would it be only russian almost certainly not the russian target had been the cia convincing themwhich it had completelythat a former kgbcumfsb officer about to be elected president of the russian federation would once in absolute power remain their deeply embedded agent through whom america could virtually manipulate the moscow government never suspecting that it would have been the misguided occupant of the white house on pennsylvania avenue washington dc who would have been the puppet on the kremlins strings there would doubtless have been a lot of head rolling at the cias langley headquarters enough certainly for the agency to consider matching murderous retribution was he safe even from his own people charlie knew the mass clearout of those whod swallowed the russian bait at mis thames house headquarters had been only slightly less sweeping at the mi building on the other side of the river at vauxhall cross both sufficient to gain him far more enemies than admirers he wasnt simply caught between a rock and a hard place charlie accepted he was trapped beneath a collapsing mountain range if one avalanche didnt sweep him away another one would most of which to some extent hed already worked out todays humiliating psychoanalysis had simply concentrated it in its entirety as much as it had concentrated his mind which was no longer fogged by the indignation with which hed rejected the psychiatrists accusation he definitely hadnt contemplated suicide but subconsciously hed allowed himself to sink into an acceptance of his eventually being detected of his being killed by one or other of the groups committed to his destruction which was preposterous and unthinkable hed never capitulated to anything or anyone and he didnt intend rolling onto his back and spreading his legs in submission now no matter how different or stultified that life might now be charlie smiled and looked up in the direction of another suspected camera it was he determined a decision that deserved another drink in celebration this time what the hell does he think hes got to smile about demanded aubrey smith turning away from the safehouse recording that directly followed charlie muffins psychoanalysis normally id try an answer that would help apologized george cowley this time i dont think i can youve put him on suicide watch for christs sake exploded jane ambersom the androgynously featured newly appointed deputy director you actually think hes going to top himself i also find that difficult to accept said the mildmannered mildvoiced smith whose confidence remained undermined by his knowing how dangerously close his overthrow orchestrated by ambersoms predecessor had been as it fortunately turned out jeffrey smale had been the highestprofile casualty from charlie muffins success i think hes a potential danger to himself and because of that a danger to the service insisted cowley repeating the warning with which hed begun the assessment meeting theres no way no set of circumstances in which charlie muffin could be suicidal persisted the directorgeneral ive just spelt out the circumstances to you and to him reminded cowley he knows just how much of a target he is and always will be just as he knows simply to survive what every day of every week of every month is going to be for that survival i cant imagineno one can truthfully imaginewhat the constant awareness of that is like its worse than being imprisoned for life in solitary confinement in those circumstances a man quite quickly becomes dehumanized robotlike because there is no human contact apart from his guards which isnt enough charlie muffin doesnt have anyone with whom to adjust to make a new life but hes not incarcerated he can go out to pubs and restaurants and cinemas and theaters and see other people all around him but never risk getting involved never knowing whom he can trust its permanent unremitting torture charlie muffins always been a loner and never trusted anyone disputed ambersom gesturing to her own copy of charlies personnel file whats new now how he lived before was by his own choice the psychiatrist pointed out and before he had the job which i acknowledge from everything ive read he did by his own rules and upset a lot of people in the process but he was doing something he had a reason to live he doesnt have that reason now any reason whatsoever to go on living now what are you suggesting asked smith whose deceptive quietly spoken demeanor hinted to his postoxford career as professor of middle east studies one of the core credos of which was that oncesuffered harm had always to be avenged a philosophy hed quickly recognized in charlie muffin im not employed here to suggest refused cowley im here to assess his mental health and thats what ive done are you saying hes mentally ill demanded the sharply suited precisely spoken ambersom whod bitterly opposed and still resented her manipulated transfer to mi from the external secret intelligence service mi not yet qualified cowley forcefully i think in time a comparatively short period of time he could begin to develop a psychosis i also think that he would be intelligent enough to realize himself what was happening to him and that with the emptiness of his existence an emptiness thats never going to be filled hed prefer to kill himself than gradually knowingly degenerate into mental decline the psychiatrist shifted his own copy of charlies personnel file it might be difficult for most people to decipher from all thats in here but from what ive read and from the sessions ive had with him ive got charlie muffin marked as an extremely proud even arrogant man hed rather kill himself than end up mentally confused wearing an incontinence pad charlie muffin has been an active intelligence officer for twenty years reminded ambersom quite irrespective of his most recent operation we cannot risk the slightest mental uncertainty in someone who knows as much as he does about british intelligence activities over such a period a lame workhorse that can no longer serve its purpose is put out of its misery as an act of kindness i dont want this conversation taken in that direction said smith who resented the womans appointment even more than she did believing it the most positive indication that his attempted overthrow by jeffrey smale had only been postponed if we accept the opinion of dr cowley which i certainly do i dont believe there is any alternative for us to consider argued the deputy director eager to establish herself there will be no discussion or consideration of physically disposing of anyone while i am directorgeneral declared smith the americans have formally asked to debrief charlie themselves disclosed ambersom one of whose new responsibilities was to liaise with us intelligence are you proposing they do your dirty work for us demanded smith i am bringing to your attention a formal request from washington qualified ambersom their request comes with a number of questions not answered in our official debriefing of charlie muffin an abbreviated version of which was made available to them tell both the fbi and cia to provide a full list of what more they want from the debriefing with the understanding that well answer what we can ordered smith and in doing so remind them how many of their executive staff including the cias deputy director of operations were present here in england with every opportunity to debrief him at the moment he exposed their naivete in believing that stepan lvov was their doubleagent coup of the century when he was elected president of the russian federation the request was specifically for personal access to charlie which im not allowing they wont consider that the sort of cooperation thats supposed to exist between our services i dont give a damn how theyll consider it rejected the directorgeneral the last time charlie muffin was in a room with cia and fbi peoplewhich was the occasion he saved them all from making the biggest mistake in their combined historiesthere was a us plane at northolt air base fueled and ready to take him god knows where on a rendition flight from which he would not have returned after whatever interrogation techniques theyd perfected at guantanamo you have any problem with cia or fbi pass it on to me to resolve which leaves unanswered the question of what to do with a mentally declining charlie muffin ambersom said trying to fight back flushed at the mans rejection not quite weve decided against letting him be put down like a workhorse for which theres no further use havent we said aubrey smith very aware that there was no answering agreement from the woman it could too easily be a trap after the way we so recently humiliated them gerald monsford knew hed come perilously close to being the highestranking victim of the lvov debacle surviving only by switching onto jane ambersom the responsibility for his own illtimed and insufficiently considered attempts at selfpromoting involvement which hed further concealed by decimating mis moscow embassy staffing he was terrified now of another near disaster so soon afterward maxim radtsic whose identity has been confirmed by photographs in our own files is the specifically designated executive deputy to the fsb replied harry jacobson mis newly replaced station chief he personally approached me at a diplomatic reception at the french embassy unless he was as desperate as he certainly appeared he would not have identified his son as a potential kidnap victim by volunteering that andrei was studying at the sorbonne would he you talked to straughan about this monsford protectively demanded james straughan was the services operational field director it was straughan who provided the photographic confirmation from the files as well as establishing through our paris rezidentura that andrei definitely is a student at the sorbonne why didnt radtsic approach the french jacobson sighed in frustration at the directors unanswerable questions despite the warning from straughan before the moscow call had been transferred that monsford was a worryingly unpredictable frequently erratic man i dont know why he didnt it didnt occur to me to ask what occurred to me was that it was the opportunity of a lifetime it could be a trap repeated the other man nervously radtsic couldnt have acted out the nervousness he was practically breaking apart no attempted entrapment would be personally baited by the fsbs deputy director whats he offering to prove its genuine himself what more could we expect or hope for something to prove himself first isnt the fact that he isnt which could be fabricated any way the fsb chose further and better proof that this is kosher hell give us everything we want when we get him and his wifeand the boyhere he told me that once he was here safe hed cooperate in whatever way we asked after the near disaster with lvov this coup could secure his mi directorship for life and conceivably secure him the directorshipinchief of mi calculated monsford be very very careful tell him yes well set everything up get them all out new identity house pension everything and keep it tight dont tell anyone in the rezidentura certainly not anyone attached to mi put nothing on the general traffic channels everything under eyes only limited to you me and straughan radtsic wants to get out right away tell him well get him out as soon as we can set it all up and stress hes not to tell his son until we tell him its okay to do so a nineteenyearold might not like the idea of being born again which is whats going to happen when we give them their new life the selfadmission wasnt easy for charlie muffin but he acknowledged that his mistake had been reverting to tradecraft establishing a predictable daily routine and unexpectedly breaking it was an operational ploy charlie had frequently used to lose lulledintocomplacency observers and precisely what hed set out to achieve to continue his financial support for natalia and sasha now there wouldnt be any lulled complacency now because of a middle earth hobbit psychiatrists belief that he was suicidal his observers would be on a higher than normal alert with their number increased which was a compounding setback because charlie was sure hed identified his five regular walkabout watchers which was scarcely surprising under strict supervisionand budgetary restraintsit was standard practice to train surveillance teams in protection situations like this where those within a program were expected to cooperate by protecting themselves in the first place but george cowleys ridiculous diagnosis would change all standard practice if the concern were as great as cowley intimated the improved surveillance would be fully qualified professionals conceivably some who guarded defectors and atrisk foreign royalty and dignitaries but not yet not today today the changeover wouldnt be complete the one everpresent weakness in charlies determination to conceal his relationship with natalia was their unavoidable link to the money he provided it hadnt been a problem when he was operational with unfettered freedom of movement between assignments but even then hed been ultracareful personally carrying the moneyin cash practically all amassed from expenseaccount banditryto a lawyernomineecontrolled credit suisse fiduciary holding in the bank secrecy haven of jersey in the channel islands off the coast of northern france from where it was electronically transferred to natalia in moscow in tranches kept below any legally enforced russian reporting requirement there was nine thousand pounds in expenseaccount profits still in the harrods safe deposit box that charlie who distrusted his own service almost as much as those of his supposed enemies had rented under an assumed name years before ever meeting natalia that now had to be moved to jersey as much to reassure natalia of his survival as to continue her financial support alone as she was with sasha and for which after three toocloselywatched months there remained insufficient funds in the credit suisse account and if her allowance stopped she might believe hed been killed like the others about whom thered been so much publicity charlie was eager to gain as much advantage as possible from the morning rushhour crush but at the same time was concerned at alerting his cctv monitors that todays outing was different from those previously he was ready an hour earlier than usual although he maintained the cultivated aimlessness as he meandered from room to room up to the moment when he made as if to return to his upstairs bedroom but instead snatched his jacket from the closet in which hed stored it in readiness the night before the chelsea safe house was expertly chosen a solitary building lost among a coppice of one and twostory utility blocks and garages additionally dwarfed by anonymous highrise mansion apartmentsin one if not more of which his observers would be housedon all four sides the layout created a choice of four escape runs intersected by a spiders web of walkways connecting each of the four overshadowing buildings charlie followed the regular route his watchers would expect to the trafficclogged kings road and used its gridlocked congestion to pick his way through the unmoving traffic to the far side to isolate his followers which worryingly he didnt he let people board the bus ahead of him until he was sure he could recognize the few who followed the most immediate was a harassed woman with an uncontrollably screaming child in a buggy from which it was desperate to escape and a scarletcoated medaldecorated chelsea hospital pensioner neither disembarked after him at sloane square and all those who did hurried away while he lingered at reflecting store windows charlie bought a newspaper from the underground station seller grateful that this early the pavement cafe on the corner with the eaton square approach was already open it was from this spot over the preceding three months that hed identified two of his regular watchers neither was evident today as his coffee and croissants were served charlie was aware of a raincoated man seating himself on a bench on the pedestrianized central square behind a halfraised newspaper charlie felt a blip of relief at the identification curious where the backup team was it was ten minutes before three vacantlighted taxis emerged in convoy from sloane street the first two turning for their cab stand the last continuing toward eaton square charlie hailed it at the controlled crossing aware of the newspaperreading follower in sloane square jerking up from his bench no hurriedly mobilized vehicle joined those directly behind before charlies taxi turned into pimlicos grid system by which time charlie was talking to the driver of his being late for a cross channel ferry introducing the belgian town of bruges as his destination as he urged the man to hurry for his victoria station train charlie had his fare ready when the taxi pulled up threading his way through the last of the rushhour commuters not to the overlanddeparture gates serving channel ports but down into the underground system he went one stop to green park and took another cab as far as trafalgar square reluctantly walking on already protesting feet to covent garden to ensure hed cleared his trail despite which he still boarded another underground train to oxford circus from there he took a third taxi to the huge park lane subterranean parking lot scuffing his burning feet its full length to marble arch and ground level charlie got to the harrods bank by one thirty hesitating after removing the nine thousand pounds from his safe deposit and the longheld and always meticulously renewed passport international driving license and american express card in the assumed name of david merryweather in which the facility was rented after fifteen undecided minutes charlie firmly closed and relocked the box knowing from already having established the trainconnecting times of trains to and from poole in dorset to jersey he allowed himself a leisurely lunch in the stores premier restaurant complete with a bottle of celebratory aloxe corton the small conference room adjoining the directorgenerals office suite was totally silent everyone waiting for someone else to risk the first contribution relentlessly aubrey smith demanded how was it allowed to happen simon harding the head of the surveillance bureau managed things werent fully in place why werent things fully in place echoed smith the upgrading designation wasnt issued until the evening of the psychiatric interview said harding an exercisetoned lycrawearing health fitness exponent whose discomfort at wearing a suit was heightened by his being the focus of the inquest between which and the time charlie muffin disappeared there was a period of more than twentyfour hours said the ever aggressive jane ambersom personnel had to be reassigned from other duties tried harding tell me from the beginning demanded smith the watch personnel were doubled to be in place today said harding defensively but it wasnt in place not that early the rota hadnt been finalized and were stretched pretty thin the only thing different from how hes acted over the preceding three months was his leaving early which was instantly picked up we had people with him all the way up the kings road and again at his usual cafe i was moving a pursuit car into sedding street which would have kept him fully in sight at all times but it wasnt in place either anticipated ambersom too eagerly no admitted the surveillance supervisor we found muffins taxi at victoria station his most obvious destination hed talked to the driver of crosschannel ferries actually mentioned bruges i got people on all but one channel port trains leaving victoria he wasnt on any of them he didnt go across the channel dismissed the exasperated directorgeneral he just left you a stinking red herring so your guess is that hes still somewhere in england said harding i dont have any idea where the hell he is or what the hell hes going to do complained smith he could by now have flown from a dozen airports into europe where he wouldnt have had to show his passport and from any airport in europe flown on to anywhere in the world you still determined against bringing in americas help asked ambersom hopefully i wont even acknowledge that stupidity with an answer snapped aubrey smith from what ive heard of charlie muffins background i wouldnt think hes on a suicide mission offered harding neither do i and i know him far better than you agreed smith holding the attention of the discomforted surveillance chief i think hed done this to frighten the shit out of us at the same time as proving how good he still is we cant afford to assume that cautioned the deputy director we cant afford to assume anything accepted smith or do anything what proactively can we do asked harding ive already told you said the directorgeneral testily nothing but sit and wait he paused and hope which was what charlie muffin was doingalthough lying not sittingon a sun lounger by the pool at longueville house hotel conveniently close to the jersey capital of st helier his hammertoed feet freed from the captivity of socks and hush puppies trousers rolled up to just below his knees the nine thousand pounds set up in undiscoverable transfers to moscow he was glad hed stayed an extra day and was tempted to extend further enjoying the almost lightheaded feeling of no longer being under goldfishbowl observation fantasizing even of continuing to run sure hed escaped and that he could always keep ahead he didnt have any doubtsor fearsof keeping himself alive thats what hed been doing for virtually the whole of his operational career assessed against the current success of those supposed to be protecting him hed probably be safer on his own but practicalitythe practicality of no longer officially existingwas against him the only income he now had was the morethangenerous allowance deposited into the bank account of the officially christenedcomplete with birth certificatenew name of malcolm stoat the identity in which was registered the credit cards automatically paid from that account his ownership of the chelsea safe house and its utility services local council and national election voting eligibility along with a driving license and national insurance number national health card and hospital registration card and christ knows what else hed forgotten and couldnt lying there in the sunshine be bothered to remember more redtaped than goldfishbowled reflected charlie reluctantly pulling himself up from the lounger they were going to be very pissed off when he reappeared charlie accepted but that was scarcely going to be a new or different experience certainly not as new or as difficult as adjusting to the totally regimented future hed spent the past two and a half days fully considering in all its stultifying detail before concluding as he just had concluded that he never would be able to adjust which was as always a subjective not a suicidal decision although he could well imagine anyone stuck with a name like malcolm stoat would seriously contemplate suicide hes back announced simon harding three oclock this morning he was clean he was so quick disabling the entry alarm we didnt actually know he was in there until the house lights went on and we saw him up on cctv im not going to have him make fools of us like this declared aubrey smith and hes going to hear it from me theres something else said the protectionservice controller the two men spent fifteen minutes unspeaking huddled together over the disk that harding had produced before summoning jane ambersom to replay it several more times the deputy director finally said what the hell is it i dont know admitted smith but weve got to find out maxim mikhailovich radtsics insistence had been that he choose their rendezvous and jacobson was moderately impressed the riverboattour pier was close to the long distance steamer terminal on klenovy boulevard which ensured a perpetual throng of people in which to disappear although by the same token providing virtually undetectable surveillance cover apparently to guard against which the russian had imposed a trailclearing ritual requiring jacobson to board the vessel thirty minutes ahead of radtsic and to remain at the rail overlooking the gangway to guarantee the deputy fsb director did not have followers additionally jacobson was forbidden to make any approach for thirty minutes after departure for radtsic to complete the same check on the british mi officer radtsics satisfaction signal was to drop his empty cigarette packet into the moskva river its good to see you again greeted jacobson coming up alongside the other man what does london say instantly demanded radtsic they welcome you and your wife and andrei too of course it must be soon very soon arrangements have to be made we have to coordinate you and your wife leaving here with moving andrei from paris we have to find a suitable house and equip it with all its necessary security as well as arranging new identities and setting up financial arrangements thatll be acceptable to you most of it can be done when were there there will need to be cooperation once you are completely safe warned jacobson guardedly radtsic covered his hesitation by lighting a fresh cigarette from the stub of the old i told you i would cooperate very full cooperation we can decide all that when i get there no sir refused jacobson there must be complete understanding between us now you are recording this conversation demanded the russian looking sideways for the first time yes i could of course have lied and said no but i want everything to be honest and clear between us i respect and appreciate that and i would appreciate an answer radtsic hesitated further then he said of course i will cooperate thats the deal isnt it yes sir confirmed jacobson thats the deal the warning of an official visit was always made by a recorded voice quoting charlies fourdigit protection designation he had to acknowledge it with a binary response the first sequence by using his telephone keypad to provide a separate fivedigit identification that had to be verified by his verbally reciting for voiceprint recognition a different numberto separate recording equipment his failure to provide both in sequential order or wrongly numbering either was his alarm signal that he believed himself to be compromised charlies telephone rang at eight thirty on the morning of his return slightly earlier than hed expected although he was already shaved and showered waiting by the time he completed the answering ritual he had the impression of the walls closing claustrophobically around him coupled with a flicker of nostalgia for the brief freedom of his jersey escape he sloughed off the memory by looking at continuous tv news programs particularly for any coverage of the impending russian presidential elections about which there had been intense international speculation in the assassinations aftermath of which his incarceration was a livingdeath outcome there was nothing as it had been for weeks now there were security cctv monitors relaying into three rooms of the safe house charlie watched the arrival of his case officer from the one in the kitchen brian cooper was a balding rotund testimony to the more flamboyant style of savile row tailoring to which charlie took as much attentionattracting exception as cooper did of his shambling trousershone charityshop preference charlie opened the door at the first ring matching the other mans critical headtotoe appraisal standing aside for cooper to enter charlie said i wasnt sure if it would be you whod come you ready cooper demanded not moving the voice was brittletoned public school ready for what its not going to be here the suit was a muted gray and charlie guessed he could have achieved a closer shave from the sharpness of the trouser crease than hed got earlier from his razor what isnt what do you think i asked if you were ready we going far asked charlie stumbling awkwardly into step behind the other man vaguely disconcerted that he hadnt anticipated the inevitable inquest being elsewhere it indicated greater irritation than hed imagined cooper didnt reply jerking his head toward the back of the anonymous unwashed ford all the glass was smoked even the fully raised screen between the driver and his rearseat passengers i asked if we were going far charlie repeated i dont know said the man not bothering to look across the car it was possible cooper didnt charlie accepted the ford made a full pursuittesting circle around sloane square and two sharp unsignaled diversions before resuming a gradually emerging northern route maybe i should have packed an overnight bag charlie tried again im not interested in smalltalk shit announced cooper abruptly youre one great big pain in the ass you want to go on being stupid enough to do what youre doing whatever the fuck that is thats fine by me you want to commit suicide for christs sake hurry up and do it so we can start looking after people who deserve to be looked after im sorry if ive made your life difficult apologized charlie meaning it they were clearing london but veering westward buckinghamshire perhaps maybe even farther guessed charlie aubrey smith lived in buckinghamshire whatever the irritation it surely wouldnt have got to directorgeneral level cooper was looking fixedly out his side window his body partially oddly turned to show his back which charlie thought childish taking operational difficulties personally would explain why the man was limited to adult babyminding from a briefly glimpsed signpost charlie saw that they were definitely in buckinghamshire although well off any major roads he could see sufficiently through the separating glass to gauge the drivers divided concentration between the road and the dashboardmounted gps from which charlie guessed they were nearing their destination beside him the backturned case officer was showing no recognition from which charlie assumed that the man genuinely didnt know where they were going which was confirmed when cooper had to snatch for an armrest support when the driver unexpectedly turned into an unmarked driveway the gate was set at least twenty meters back from its original supporting pillars the centerpiece of a secondary razorwiretopped wall the wire hedge was broken close to the gate head to accommodate the camera that swiveled at their approach to record the cars registration to which the driver added by manually directing an electronic fob to a sensor that charlie couldnt detect the admission precautions were completed by the man lowering the drivers window to announce their presence into a doorlevel entry phone almost directly beyond the gate the ford turned off the main driveway and onto a smaller but still paved road that ran between totally concealing closetogether trees and low shrubbery that unexpectedly ballooned out into a clearing in the center of which was a halftimbered building charlie guessed originally to have been a hunting lodge there were four cars all anonymous fords regimented to the left of its heavy oak door charlies driver went to its right a darksuited woman emerged before the car stopped she came to coopers door gesturing stay where you are ordered the case officer as he got out charlie was uneasy his disappearing required a reprimand but this was at a far higher level why the only logical answer was that he hadnt been as professional as hed imagined that theyd followed him every shuffling step of the way to jersey knew about the bank arrangements to fund natalia and were about to strap him onto the rack and start twirling the bonecracking wheel until he confessed all when he was told to get out charlie followed the woman to the lodge but unhurriedly hesitating at the sudden darkness beyond the heavy oak door predictably there was a display of antlered heads along both woodpaneled walls the woman stood at the end of the hall shifting impatiently when he reached her charlie said you were too fast for me i imagine most people are she came back thrusting open a side door for him to enter a quick shot or confirmation that they had been with him in jersey wondered charlie as he saw the assembled group behind a long table at the end of another paneled room lined with a wildlife massacre of glasseyed trophies here interspersed with the heads of a tiger and two bears aubrey smith was at the center of four men with deputy director jane ambersom to his left the directorgeneral was dwarfed by the man next to him appearing almost a foot taller even though he was sitting and with his jacket spread to release a bulging belly couching a bulllike chest the other two were on smiths right there would charlie knew be audio and visualrecording equipment which made him curious about the small unmanned replay machine on a separate table where were you demanded smith without any preamble a clever question charlie acknowledged allowing him little verbal room to maneuver with the wrong response catching him out in a lie from the outset making a point he tried explain demanded the directorgeneral the man was stone faced no inflection breaking the soft measured tone the light reflected off his rimless spectacles made the man appear sightless to prove a nonsense ambersom matched the frown of the unidentified man next to smith who remained the sole interrogator explain there was sufficient space on the menagerie wall for his head to be mounted alongside charlie saw he had to say something to get a clearer indication of why this confrontation had been escalated the nonsense of my being a suicide risk if id wanted to kill myself i could have done so i didnt smith moved to speak but stopped at the sound of the door opening from the quickness of the footsteps charlie knew it was the woman escort before she came into view from behind him the examining panel pulled close together as she leaned forward over the table toward them it was impossible for charlie to hear anything of the exchange from which smith retreated looking left and right as if seeking comment from those on either side no one responded but without any apparent invitation ambersom said nonsense is a good description of what youre saying now answer properly where have you been charlie was tempted by the fixedface womans intrusion more confident of directing the questioning the way he wanted but he still didnt have a good enough map of the minefield in which he believed himself to be the lesser the lies the better he determined jersey i took a trip to jersey ate some good food enjoyed the sunshine weve combsearched your safe house for four hours announced the deputy director triumphantly there wasnt the slightest trace of your having been to jersey or anywhere else they hadnt known about jersey the satisfaction warmed charlie of course there wasnt i tossed it all into the channel the tradecraft designation is clearing your trail remember what would you say if i told you we dont believe you demanded ambersom her voice had the vaguest blur of a northern accent id say you should check at the longueville house hotel in st helier room fortytwo second floor you can see the harbor if they hadnt known where hed been they could discover his reason for going there so he wasnt giving anything away describing his room there was the slightest tightening of the womans angular makeupspared face at charlies dismissal what would you say if i told you we still dont believe you what the hell was this all about im not sure id know what to say tell us about this then said aubrey smith nodding to the man nearest the replay machine into the silent room came the click of an answer phone connection and then a voice that charlie instantly recognized as natalias she said i think we need help charlie call me please tell me whats happening the line momentarily went dead before the click of a second connection this time natalia said i think they know im sure were under surveillance the third final segment was help us charlie please help us the directorgeneral said weve kept on your old vauxhall apartment as a precaution with the telephone still connected we traced all three calls to separate pay phones in moscow the deputy director said who is she the silence lasted for a very long time after charlie finished speaking the panel confronting him statued in apparent disbelief none looking at the other before she did speak eager to maintain her questioning dominance ambersom physically shook her head like someone awakening from a coma this woman is a serving officer in the fsb yes confirmed charlie whod been completely honest omitting nothing in his explanation of natalias three calls instantly aware that he would need every conceivable help from his own service and that one lie even an inadvertent omission would close the door against him he didnt like to hear natalia being referred to as this woman and before the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti she served in the kgb before the komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti was renamed yes you are officially properly married a russian ceremony in the hall of weddings and there is a child ive already explained all this your child sasha is my child yes and you have run this woman as an asset for how long six seven years the relationship began a little over eight years ago natalia serves in the specialized section of the analysis division she was appointed my official debriefer after my supposed defection all the details of which are in the personnel archives she has never been an asset other than that of being my wife and she is my wife not this woman he shouldnt have finished like that showing his irritation so your supposed defection becomes a genuine one this woman turned you bitch thought charlie i am not nor ever have been an agent of either the soviet union or the russian federation he replied formally i never ever discussed with my wife any operation in which i was involved and i repeat neither ever has she we lived together as man and wife after i was seconded to the embassy in moscowwhich is again officially in my filebut it became impossible for me just as she found it impossible then to follow me back to london i obviously made contact during the most recent moscow assignment concerning the death of a man in the grounds of the british embassy and the uncovering of an attempted fsb coup involving stepan lvov the outcome of which has resulted in my having to enter the protection program charlie hesitated briefly i had finally persuaded her to come to live with me in england with our daughter but the retribution began beginning with lvovs assassination before i could get her out shes trapped the incredulity had spread to the four unidentified men one turned and said something to the directorgeneral which charlie thought he heard as preposterous thisall of thisis beyond imagination dismissed the woman everything i am telling you is the gods honest truth i dont think you know the meaning of truth or of god i need help pleaded charlie desperately you need a miracle and theres no such thing as miracles she said ive heard the recording of the radtsic meeting you did well bloody well congratulated james straughan what about the director demanded jacobson hes heard it too says the same so ive got official approval to go ahead absolutely shouldnt that approval be official ill send it today do you want me to come back for the planning well do all that here you just give us the input when we ask for it we mustnt lose sight of radtsics flakiness we wont its scheduled highest priority now the approval will be in the directors name wont it everything will be done by the book dont worry the problem was that jacobson did worry about fulfilling his stationchief responsibilities he worried a lot its totally inconceivable insisted jane ambersom the man isnt suicidal hes insane deluded there were times when i thought it was so inconceivable that it couldnt possibly be made up said geoffrey palmer one of the unidentified members of the examining panel and the foreign office liaison to the joint intelligence committee which doesnt minimize the potential disaster of the situation argued the woman i wasnt trying to minimize anything said palmer who in every respect personified the career civil servant even to the stripedtrousered blackjacketed uniform complemented by the bowler hat and tightly furled umbrella for his daily commute from orpington suburbia gerald invited the directorgeneral addressing his mi counterpart whose inclusion in the meeting he distrusted they had moved from their earlier interrogational formality to leathered armchairs and couches around a dead carvedwood fireplace in which a man could comfortably stand without bending and in which gerald monsford had framed his sixfootthreeinch bulgebellied figure to be the focal point of the discussion monsford said from your provisional inquiries everything he told us about jersey checks out so far qualified smith cautiously not wanting his insecurityspurred antipathy to be obvious and it was charlie muffin who prevented us and the united states being sucked into the most incredibly successful russian espionage operation ive ever encountered said monsford easily lapsing into the pretension of a classics education hed never actually had monsford added if hes guilty of anything its following ovids belief that enemies are the best teachers jane ambersom whod endured that affectation as shed endured other irritations was amused at the startled reactions from the rest of the group at monsfords posturing and said it could still be part of that russian operation how immediately challenged the mi director already sure he could in some way use his totally unexpected inclusion in this emergencyconvened committee to extract maxim mikhailovich radtsic out of russia he extended a hand with his forefinger close to his thumb stepan lvov whom the cia was convinced they had in the bag as their longestablished double agent was just this far from becoming the next president of the russian federation as such in reality a committed officer of the fsb lvov would have maneuvered and manipulated washington and us down god knows how many roads to destruction russian intelligence would have ruled the west as well as whats left of their former empire literally ruled the world how could this have any connection with that janes face blazed at the ridicule from monsford whom she rightly believed was the architect of her transfer to the counterintelligence service she moved to speak but before she could monsford went back to the directorgeneral what about other cases before this last one how many went the wrong way to the other sides benefit that check began the moment muffins state of mind was questioned and was upgraded when he disappeared a conclusion will take time avoided smith the preliminary assessment is that while a few werent completely successful none was compromised through any personal fault or failing of charlie himself and none of us needs reminding how he prevented the catastrophe to which youve already referred as well as preventing my dismissal smith mentally added on the subject of preliminary assessments i have to give to the prime minister and the foreign secretary some indication of the potential problems we might be facing came in sir archibald bland the cabinet secretary whod completed the inquiry team im not sure we can provide that this early apologized smith in reluctant admission charlie muffin will be held here under house detention questioned further to learn far more about natalia fedova i dont intend a kneejerk reaction to a situation as complicated as this appears to be im not naive enough to believe this woman doesnt know anything about operations in which muffin has been involved for at least the past eight years said the deputy director the disparagement embedded in her mind and as such the potential cause of huge embarrassment if not serious longterm harm she should be neutralized killed you mean lured monsford deceptively casual jane ambersom hesitated coloring again inherently suspicious of the man if it were deemed necessary hes given us her moscow address we know where to find her what about the child do we kill the child as well pounced monsford baiting her in front of the two civil servants to continue the criticism hed engineered to achieve her transfer i cant imagine an eightyearold child knowing enough to cause us difficulties but we might as well tidy up any loose ends the womans color deepened i dont believe we are considering this seriously enough this is a highalert situation that needs to be dealt with as such none of us believes otherwise said aubrey smith calmly despite his irritation at the obvious point scoring and astonished at monsfords talking as if hed been closely involved in the lvov exposure id hoped to have made clear that i do not intend worsening a potential problem with a panicked reaction which eliminating a woman about whose existence we have only just learned orphaning a child in the process would unarguably do endorsed monsford how precisely do we learn more about her asked jane ambersom descending to mockery going into what wordsworth described as the burthen of the mystery monsford awkwardly mocked back intent upon controlling what he was increasingly deciding to be a gift situation from a god in whom he didnt believe the separation and independence of our two services is well established for all the obvious reasons i welcome however this opportunity for us to come together in a combined operation to which i guarantee every contribution asked from mi this is precisely how the prime minister wants it handled announced sir anthony bland it seems completely appropriate to me quickly agreed palmer the functioning liaison between mi and mi at this early stage i dont see the reason for a combined operation argued aubrey smith recognizing how he was being railroaded sure it confirmed his suspicion that his directorship remained in doubt perhaps i didnt make clear how i envisage such an arrangement said monsford i am offering my resources in one specific area moscow i anticipate our working in the closest possible way discussing every aspect but equally expect you to be the controllerthe directorof a matched one for one team of officers no one else in the room appeared able to find a response geoffrey palmer was the first thats a very generous offer that would seem to resolve any command uncertainty not of course that i would expect any we are all agreed that everything is at a very early exploratory stage persisted aubrey smith his unemotional monotone concealing the anger at so effectively being maneuvered into a culdesac lets look upon this operational cooperation as a stepatatime experiment i would expect to be an active participant too hurriedly intruded jane ambersom equally concerned at again becoming monsfords scapegoat i would expect all of us to be active participants said the compromiseadept sir archibald aubrey smith who fully acknowledged his initial survival indebtedness to charlie muffin wondered how long his second chance might last at least this time he hoped more quickly to recognize at least some of the moves against him which he hadnt before for as long as he could remember and charlie muffin had an elephantine memory selfpreservation had been a major preoccupation but never so much as now incarcerated as he was in a windowbarred and doublelocked room with only the glazedeyed relatives of the other wallmounted animals on the ground floor for sightless company but this was the first time the preoccupation was not for his own survival how had nataliaand sashabeen detected the money trail had always been the obvious weakness although it couldnt have triggered this discovery two of natalias anguished calls to his abandoned vauxhall apartment were dated and timed before his jersey visit how else he would have been the concentrated focus of the excoriating stopatnothing fsb investigation after the destruction of russias intended puppetmaster emplacement of stepan lvov what of natalias long ago insistence that she had wiped from kgb and succeeding fsb records as much trace as possible of their connection during his supposed defection debriefing there was a stomach lurch of belatedtoo belatedrealization a search as complete and as intense as the fsbs would have encompassed every government institution the hall of weddings was one such institution in which every ceremony was bureaucratically registered electronically as well as in a handwritten ledger why was he looking backward charlie asked himself whatever the route whatever the disclosing mistake their relationship had been uncovered or had it if it had been positively confirmed natalia would no longer be at liberty to telephone him as she had suspected at least charlie qualified but sufficient for the scourging fear in which charlie felt locked because even if she was suspected natalia and sasha had to be got out of russia but how and by whom judged against a lifetimes need for splitsecond thinking to splitsecond confrontations charlie believed hed adequately responded to the stomachdropping sound of natalias voice but only just adequately hed answered every question about natalia with complete and total honestywithout offering any additional informationjust as he had recounted his jersey journey omitting only the financial reason for his making it but the debrief had concluded without the slightest indication of what might happen to him far more worryingly there had been nothing at all about natalia and sasha he had to think of a way to rescue them a very quick stopatnothing way as guaranteed as possible to get them to safety what he asked himself again and again failed to find an answer to quote shakespeare with as little a web as this i will ensnare theyve gone for it announced gerald monsford triumphantly he spoke with his back to the other two in his office in mis vauxhall cross headquarters looking up toward the houses of parliament on the opposite side of the thames even dear jane queried rebecca street well aware of monsfords antipathy toward the woman whom she had replaced although unaware of how it had been manipulated she needed the assurance that she wouldnt be kept out of the loop said monsford whod appointed rebecca not only as his deputy but as his easily persuaded mistress which jane had consistently refused to become providing an additional reason for her transfer what about smith asked james straughan the director of operations palmer and bland got in with their support first which wrongfooted poor old aubrey patronized the director then i played my ace by insisting that hed control it all with us limited to committing our moscow resources which left him high and dry you think hell trust us asked the woman professionally objective at the moment hes totally confused by the sudden appearance of this mysterious natalia fedova said monsford turning at last from the window to the woman he said i want you to monitor everything act as our secondary check to guarantee against mistakes nothing will go wrong said the blond rebecca street smiling she dressed to advertise her fullbreasted but otherwise slim figure that days promotion was a lownecked crossover black dress the bodice pin the diamond clasp monsford had given her as a consummation present shed been far more impressed by the clasp than by the overinseconds lovemaking shed endured in the offices adjoining bedroom suite to gain it what about our own operation queried straughan the entire reason for what i achieved today declared monsford this mi business is a bonus were going to bleed dry maybe even literally have we got an unsuspected conduit to moscow something the fsb will believe unquestioningly straughan considered the question its not as easy as it was when there was a soviet union i didnt imagine it would be said monsford testily i want something to tie charlie muffin closer in to whatever the hell these telephone calls are all about something connected to the lvov business for instance theres an fsb source at the polish embassy in rome weve used before said straughan not for more than a year though after all the damage charlie did the fsb would obviously like to find him wouldnt they suggested monsford thats why hes in a protection program isnt it said rebecca frowning and because of it no longer living where he once did monsford smiled but the fsb dont know that do they so it wouldnt expose him to any actual harm said straughan of course it wouldnt agreed monsford ill try to set it up undertook the operations director not try do it said monsford heavily itll be an irony that charlie muffins last service to british intelligence will be for us not his own people everythings agreed maxim radtsic assured his wife his head close to hers as they went north on the arbatsko line of moscows metro service upon which three hours earlier hed kept his latest meeting with harry jacobson when the woman asked matchingly low voiced soon they know the urgency i dont like all this nonsense elana protested looking around the packed commuter carriage its silly playacting like children its very necessary if were to keep safe insisted radtsic why dont i go to paris for a holiday with andrei and go to london with him from there it would be easier for you to get out alone wouldnt it she was more frightened than he realized radtsic sympathetically it would alert them make them suspicious andrei should be given more warning its got to be the way the british want it lets not take the metro back to the apartment i want to walk its a long way to walk from kurskaya radtsic pointed out identifying where they were from the route map above the seats i know she knew she wouldnt very much longer be able to walk the streets of the city accepted radtsic sadly would she ever properly understand what he was having to do when it was all over goodlooking kid remarked albert abrahams looking down at the selection of photographs hed taken two hours earlier outside andrei radtsics sorbonne college i prefer the girl said jonathan miller mis station chief at the paris embassy can you imagine those legs wrapped around your neck names yvette paruch identified abrahams and i have already imagined it our andreis not just goodlooking hes a lucky bastard as well so what do we do now londons orders are to find out everything we can without going anywhere near him the possibility is that hes being babysat by the fsb if he is theres a risk theyll pick up on our sniffing around warned abrahams thats why straughan told me to be careful reminded miller comforting isnt it to get advice we wouldnt have thought of ourselves from an operations director safe and warm in london mocked abrahams it was two days before charlie was summoned for further questioning in that interim he was held in the barred and locked firstfloor room of the hunting lodge with only the gazelle heads for company apart from morning and afternoon exercise periods in the grounds with two male escorts who refused any conversation and during which there were intentionally staged sightings of other guards none was visibly armed the second session was in the same menageriefestooned room as before but with a smaller inquiry panel just smith jane ambersom and the overpoweringly large man from the initial interrogation there was no replay machine on the side table which had been moved away to the corner of the room once again there was no preamble although it was the woman who opened the questioning she took photographs from a case file in front of her and said who is this woman bitch thought charlie at the same time recognizing the disparagement was intentional to rile him which he dismissed as stupid as well as clumsy there was still the stomach jump of recognition when he took the offered photograph it was a remarkably sharp image natalia was wearing the tightly belted light summer coat he remembered from their most recent moscow reunion in the botanical gardens she was looking sideways almost over her shoulder as if something had suddenly caught her attention natalia fedova my wife and this our daughter alexandra which shortens to sasha replied charlie looking down at the second print the child was wearing her school uniform and hat smiling up at someone who had been cropped from the picture when were these taken jane ambersom moved to speak but before she could monsford replied the day before yesterday aubrey smith formally introduced monsford for the first time and said sis are cooperating with us the woman was looking tight faced between the two directors clearly irritated at both responding to questioning theyre still free then pressed charlie momentarily offbalanced by mis involvement it was logical he conceded that there would have been linked operations in the past although hed never actively participated in one charlie remembered the name during his earlier moscow assignment the gossip in the mi rezidentura had tagged monsford as a reincarnation of genghis khan suffering a bad attack of toothache thered also been a rumor the man had tried to muscle in to the lvov affair lets get some order back into this debriefing shall we said jane ambersom theres a lot more answers we need to get from you i have not committed any criminal offense charlie said embarking on one of the several halfformed strategies hed considered over the preceding fortyeight hours nor have i contravened the official secrets act to which i am a signatory my being in the protection program does not require my being held under detention jane ambersoms snort of derision was too obviously forced doesnt one of the most essential clauses in the official secrets act cover consorting with an enemy it is an entire section not a clause formally corrected charlie both to further her irritation and for the benefit of the bureaucratic recordings and that question is both a distortion and a misphrasing of its wording i have never contravened any section of any act involving covering or forbidding the passing of intelligence secrets or information to a foreign power or intelligence service he gestured with the prints he still held i provided the specific time and date of my marriage to natalia fedova which i know you will have by now confirmed from moscows hall of weddings records i also know that in the intervening two days since i appeared before you my operational files will have been scrutinized for the slightest indication of failure being attributed to my charlie paused again directly addressing the woman to use what appears to be a favored phrase consorting with the enemy no indication whatsoever of which will have been found because none exists i want if you like i plead for help to get my wife and daughter out of a situation in which if our relationship is positively established by the fsb they could be physically harmed as it was believed i would be physically harmed for russias failure of the lvov affair to prevent which i have been put under protection protection not house arrest once more jane ambersoms face was on fire either from her confusion or her expectation that charlie would continue but again monsford spoke ahead of her the mi director hands clasped over his expansive stomach said that was a very spirited and wellargued defense of a charge not yet alleged but do you believe that buried in all the legislation to which youve referredthe official secrets act the most obviousthere isnt a legal accusation that one of our specialized lawyers could formulate against you charlie didnt think hed left any gaping pitfalls certainly monsfords response was encouraging even if the mans inclusion was unsettling and needed separate intense examination dont falter he told himself im quite sure there are several charges that could be laid but im even surer that theyd be thrown out of court although perhaps with an admonishment which id expect after it was proven there has never been any breach of security havent we wandered too far from the purpose of this meeting protested jane ambersom finally reentering the exchanges just one thing said charlie hurriedly pleased at the womans exclusion and talking directly to the mi chief were both those photographs taken two days ago yes confirmed monsford so they were both still free not under detention yes both still free charlie looked back at the print of natalia closely studying the background for the first time and she was outside the apartment i identified when is this session going to be formalized again protested jane was there any indication of surveillance persisted charlie snatching at every opportunity none confirmed monsford for some must watch while some must sleep so runs the world away he thought why was it that shakespeare had a comment for every situation hamlet he remembered this would have a happier ending he was sure natalia and sasha were still safe but how professional had the mi photographer been agonized charlie whod never trusted dawn to follow night if the photographer had failed to detect russian observation but been identified himself he would have hastened an fsb move i really do think weve answered enough of your questions said aubrey smith now answer more of ours from the date of your wedding which we have indeed confirmed against the date you provided for sashas birth natalia fedova was pregnant before you married established jane ambersom taking up the questioning again her tone made it sound like an accusation no longer this woman charlie recognized yes how long had the affair been going on before the marriage about eighteen months everything totally honest charlie reminded himself he needed their help not their antagonism the woman shuffled hurriedly between several sheets of paper from her dossier before looking up we know the precise dates of your fake defection of course it was a recorded operation and a successful one discrediting a genuine defector with whom i broke out of wormwood scrubs after hed been jailed for forty years as a soviet spy at the height of the cold war broke in charlie anxiously establishing what he considered the first of several important facts in his favor im familiar with the records jane paused to counter charlies defense with another point the official records i mean so once more calculated against the known dates and those you have provided your affair began about six months after the russian acceptance that your defection was genuine yes confirmed charlie cautiously he shouldnt have interjected she was obviously building up to what she considered an undermining question tell us about those six months what about them hedged charlie reluctant to answer such a generality the russians had accepted you believed you had joined their little band of traitors did you ever meet socialize with those other defectors with philby or blake for instance no never never are you sure charlie hesitated seeking the trap unable to find it he smiled condescendingly shaking his head its hardly likely that i would forget meeting such people is it unless youre lying she said not undermining at all if that was her best attempt i am not lying what job did the russians give you having accepted you as genuine he could use this question charlie recognized i was assigned to a training school what sort of training school there was a note of triumph in the womans voice a training school for intended kgb intelligence officers answered charlie comfortably intended to operate in which countries the triumph was growing the englishspeaking west the united kingdom america canada jane ambersom again staged her preparing pause and when she did speak she spaced her words to heighten her supposed incredulity youtaughtkgbagentsselectedtooperateagainsttheunitedkingdom no charlie denied seizing his chance my function was to assess during onetoone sessionsone spy was never allowed to encounter anotherwhether their training was sufficient for them to assimilate successfully into a western culture without arousing suspicion i handled a total of eight in each case i dismissed their training as inadequate by doing so i gained limited access but comprehensive insight into russian espionagetraining methods and systems about which i created a manual on my return to this country i believe that manual was later used as a textbook at our training academies i also of course learned the identities of the eight with whom i worked although the names were obviously not those they were assigned in the west over the course of the four years after my return to this country in addition to active field assignments i regularly examined photographs of russians posted under diplomatic cover to the russian embassies in london washington dc and ottawa i managed to identify five none of whom were expelled but allowed to remain observing the principle that the spy you know is better than the one you dont all i believe were fed disinformation by us and the counterespionage organizations of america and canada charlie paused dry throated and gestured toward jane ambersoms dossier everything ive told you is set out in greater detail in my file even the names of the eight russians you should be able to confirm it all very easily jane ambersom was puce faced yet again monsford actually had his hands cupped over his face to conceal his reaction to the putdown smiths head was lowered intently toward the floor and charlie burned with selffury the bloody woman had got under his skin but what the fuck was he doing fighting her humiliating her like this he couldnt afford to fight or humiliate anyone upon whom he now depended he desperately needed each and every possible assistance to get natalia and sasha out of moscow as desperately as he needed to convince them that hed never ever acted against the service to which hed dedicated his life and he wasnt going to achieve any of that in confronting this supercilious mannish woman this woman echoed mockingly in his mind every single time he antagonized any of them he pushed further away the possibility of rescuing from god knew what the only two people of importance in his life the only two people in his life you were able to cultivate your relationship with natalia fedova as well as working at the spy school uncertainly resumed jane easily said charlie determined against further confrontation natalia officially comes within the jurisdiction of the analysis division but her predominant function is debriefing for which she has the russian equivalent of a masters degree in psychology and a track record of marathon proportions the russians attach great importance to the psychology of their field agents as we do which creates another function that of maintaining and monitoring the continuing psychological capability of abouttograduate intelligence officers facing for the first time the reality of being uprooted from the life they know and transposed into an entirely different alien culture that brought her frequently to the training school to which i was assigned on the outskirts of moscow about five miles beyond prazskaja what was the purpose of your false defection hed already covered that although not in detail she was running out of impetus in a russian agent only ever identified by the name edwin sampson was jailed for forty years he was considered one of the most damaging spies ever to be uncovered in this country but we didnt know the full extent of what hed done apart from the barest evidence wed managed to get together to convict him he never confessed or admitted anything i was put in wormwood scrubs supposedly jailed for fourteen years also for spying it was fixed that wed share the same cell in which over the course of time id gain his trust and get some indication of what else hed done it wasnt anticipated the kgb would try to free him as they did with george blake and which indicated the importance they attached to him but when it emerged that they intended to do just that it was decided i should appear to defect with him in the hope of learning what made him so important which i did the idea was that after a period of time with the help of our people in the british embassy youd pretend to be disillusioned with russia and flee back to this country broke in jane yes agreed charlie with the added benefit of all id learned at the spy school with such a history no one was going to doubt your loyalty were they persisted jane no one has until now and youre wrong but theres good reason to doubt you now suddenly presented as we are with a wife whos a serving officer in russias external intelligence challenged jane is that all she is your wife or could she also be your control through whom youre supposed to liaise with moscow after she joins you here which youve told us has consistently been the plan what i told you is that its consistently been my hope that she would join me here but that she has always refused held as she is by that nearmystical bond russians have for their country corrected charlie maintaining control but letting his argument come out in a rush if id been turned and married natalia for the reason youve suggested she would have been ordered to return with me in the first place wouldnt she and i wouldnt have told you that she was a member of the fsb thered be an unbreakable cover legend giving her a background as far as possible from any connection with espionage and would i as a kgbcumfsb double have destroyed a kgbfsb operation eighteen years in creation to put moscow literally in the oval office before jane ambersom could respond the directorgeneral said there is an alternative way to judge this you could be telling the truth the fsb could have discovered your relationship with natalia fedova and be forcing her to make the approaches to trap you into going back to russia where you as the person who wrecked that eighteenyearlong operation would face punishment its hard to conceive judged against the ways theyve killed the people theyve eliminated so far unless they made you watch whatever they wanted to do to natalia and the child before killing you as bestially as possible completed monsford thats what i believe they want to do admitted charlie almost inaudibly you think were going to let you go back to russia to stop it happening dont you taunted the woman irrespective of whether its agreed i go back theyll do whatever they want to them both pleaded charlie that cant be allowed to happen theyve got to be got out theres no way they can be said jane all i had to do was sit and listen to jane ambersom stumble about like a bull in a china shop gloated the mi director christ were lucky being rid of her cow corrected james straughan who always sought to lighten his encounters with someone as unpredictable as gerald monsford particularly when they were alone which they were now it would be a cow in a china shop not a bull cow is certainly more apposite agreed monsford whod enjoyed his manipulation of that days meeting as he had those that preceded it charlies on his knees pleading for his wife and child to be rescued jane came close to orgasm telling him it couldnt be done you broached our idea with smith yet the other man shook his head i need exactly the right moment smith believes its his option to make and his operation to initiate so thats how ive got to make it seem everythings virtually in place assured straughan although cautiously he knew better than to make promises that werent guaranteed no more calls from moscow smith hasnt mentioned any more and im sure he would if thered been more i dont think he feels very secure what about jacobson anxious to get the stuff im assembling the passports for radtsic and his wife are in the diplomatic pouch tonight that should reassure radtsic somethings got to according to jacobson he thinks radtsic is getting critical tell jacobson to give radtsic whatever assurances the man needs i dont want the frightened old bastard collapsing on us ordered monsford what about paris all in hand i want something else announced the director what my own recording system here in this office getting radtsic safely here is going to be the coup of our lives i dont want any foulups through faulty memories which came close with the lvov business the only memory at fault with the lvov business is yours thought straughan and if thered been a proper record you wouldnt be overflowing the chair youre sitting in aloud he said ill organize it and i want personal manual control we mustnt overlook the official secrets act and necessary security clearances no agreed straughan we shouldnt overlook that charlie muffin for the first time felt engulfed in paralyzing impotent helplessness hed faced seemingly impossible abouttodie crises before but always been able to escape sometimes badly bruised sometimes badly burnedoften physically too often metaphysicallyalways survived because every time it had only ever been he whod had to survive no one else to worry about or to consider now it wasnt only he it was nataliaprobably bewildered doubtless confused with only the vaguest indication of what had happenedand innocent vulnerable sasha whom hed always pledged to care for and protect he wouldnt fail them charlie determined he was enduring this animalfarm charade because the finance and facilities of the combined agencies were his best chance of rescuing natalia and sasha none of which from jane ambersoms almost sadistic dismissal earlier that day were going to be made available to him so it had to be just he alone better far better hed never likednever trustedother people with him or acting on his behalf not so much from doubts of their loyalty but from doing things differently less effectively than he could doing it by himself wasnt going to be easy charlie realistically acknowledged although hed always insisted on working alone thered usually been an embassy upon which he could call for falsely named passports and air or road escape and cyberspace communications if the ultimate shit hit the everspinning fan and money unlimited operational finance safe openingly available whenever he needed it which he always had the more so since his marriage to natalia hed datestaged the transfers from jersey so thered still be some left there once hed got away from here that wouldnt be as easy as slipping his leash the first time but this was different this quite literally was life or death natalia and sashas life or death nothing was going to prevent his keeping them alive alive and eventually with him at last james straughan who was an asexual bachelor lived in berkhamsted almost sixty miles south of charlies buckinghamshire interrogation lodge with an almost totally disoriented mother whose evening meal he had just finished feeding her when his telephone rang weve got a match declared the duty officer at the vauxhall headquarters of mi no doubt demanded straughan continuing with generalities because his was an insecure line although the london call was being patched through a router none what do you want me to do keep everything until i get there tomorrow if he told gerald monsford tonight the awkward bastard would probably have him immediately return to london personally to courier the stuff to the mans cheyne walk flat straughan considered cleaning bathing and getting his mother ready for bed a far more important duty maxim mikhailovich radtsic patiently stood on the other side of the bed watching elana set aside her assortment of things knowing from every neatly stacked item predominantly photographs that it was a selection shed made and unmade several times before and hated her having to do it yet again thats everything she said triumphantly looking up no he refused bluntly watched by elana it had taken radtsic two hours of fruitless searching for listening devices but he still insisted on loud radio music to defeat any monitoring installation ive kept everything to the absolute minimum she protested her voice wavering thats all our memories i havent been told yet how theyre going to get us out but itll almost certainly be by air luggage even luggage going into the hold is photographed this amountand these pictureswould be opened and trap us i cant go with nothing you have to go with nothing everything is going to be new our lives our names house everything all new no history it was madness talking even softly like this i cant she pleaded thatll be thatll be dying staying here will be dying literally this was asking too much of her i dont care i dont want to go wont go it wouldnt just be us it would be andrei too thats not fair thats reality help me maxim please do something to help me i will i promise ill do something what he wondered scrubbing the perspiration from his face with the back of his hand until this moment hed never consideredhad no conceptionwhat field agents had to endure straughan did compromise by leaving a note for his mothers caregiver instead of waiting for the womans arrival which he normally did he set off on the seven am train and was at vauxhall cross by eight thirty and had personally reconfirmed the identification determined from previous experience of monsfords irrational impatience against any oversight reassuring himself that he topped the mans morning appointment book as he wasnt summoned until past eleven straughan knew monsford had seen someone else before him and was doubly glad he hadnt bothered with an instant alert the night before playing out the melodrama to test the directors reaction straughan unspeakingly placed the three enhanced infrared photographs on monsfords desk and stood back waiting who is he asked monsford not looking up from the prints boris kuibyshev identified straughan third secretary in the finance division of the russian embassy here these were taken last night outside charlie muffins flat monsford smiled up so my idea of leaking charlie muffins address worked you selfserving fuckpig straughan thought he said yes is he on the known list straughan shook his head weve had the flat under twentyfourhour watch for the last two days comparing every photograph against every print of the entire russian legation and russian trade and bank organizations kuibyshev wasnt flagged until now so smiths people wont have picked him up not unless theyve mounted the same watch and done the same facebyface comparison said straughan and my team havent seen anyone they recognize or suspect to be from across the river he hesitated intent upon squeezing a recorded accolade from the director whod very positively activated his newly installed audio system this gives you unarguable proof that were better qualified than mi to run things doesnt it monsford grimaced rather than smiled precisely what i wanted to achieve and theres something else something that could be connected although theres no peg to hang it on at the moment continued straughan there was an overnight cable from david halliday of rumors of something happening within the fsb i dont trust halliday declared monsford he was close to muffin in moscow during the lvov business but didnt give us any indication to get us involved he told us charlie didnt confide in him reminded straughan defensively he must have known something whats hallidays source cocktailparty gossip from a german embassy reception tell him to harden it up beyond gossip but tell jacobson to stay away from halliday i dont want him involved in anything to do with radtsic and ill maintain the watch on the flat see if we can pick up any more new faces lets have what shakespeare called the observed of all observers quoted monsford straughan exaggerated his sigh did smiths people sanitize the flat monsfords face clouded at a question to which he didnt have an answer why if i were controlling the russian surveillance id tell them to break in if the place continues to appear empty by continuing to doorstep it they must believe hes coming back good point allowed monsford ill try to get an indication smith needs all the help and advice he can get what do you think about charlie muffin persisted the operations director from the personnel and assignment files do you think hes clean monsfords facial contortion really was a grimace this time id come down in his favor the only thing that doesnt make sense is his marrying a woman in the fsb and before that the kgb dont the personnel assessments make a point of his not abiding by any rules asked straughan who believed hed read everything more thoroughly than had the director thats not just breaking rules thats the suicide wish smith had the man examined for he would have known he could never survive if it ever became known so would she but she still married him argued straughan if youre making a point im missing it complained monsford if he felt enough about her to go through a marriage ceremonyand she for himhell do anything and everything to get back to russia to help her whether smith agrees or not monsford frowned disconcerted by another argument he hadnt understood isnt that our whole objective i thought it was a factor worthwhile stressing to smith ive already got it flagged lied monsford i dont want to keep radtsic on hold were ready apart from the security on a safe house im seeing smith at five to confront him with all the rest weve got do you want me to wait until you get back asked straughan warily his mothers caregiver left at six yes decided the director by then i expect to hear something even more helpful from moscow awkward bastard straughan thought he was sorry now that hed asked instead of risking the wrath the following morning before hed completed his exerciseperiod reconnaissance of the outside security and failed on his return to his upstairs cell as he had on his exit from it to identify all the interior precautions charlie finally acknowledged that escape from his huntinglodge prison was impossible charlie slumped into a leathercreaking easy chair head bowed to his chest again to continue the appearance of cowed acceptance letting another halfformed idea harden what could he dowhat could he say or implyto convince aubrey smith and jane ambersom that it was essential to their interests that natalia and sasha be brought out of russia and not just them gerald monsford was involved too why charlie abruptly asked himself calling to mind his surprise at the mi directors presence at his initial interrogation strict interpretation of the internal and external divisions between the two intelligence services would normally have decreed the lvov affair to be that of mi except that it had begun with the finding in the moscow grounds of the british embassyinternationally and diplomatically designated uk territoryof a man who had been tortured before being murdered and even though his investigation later crossed mi boundaries aubrey smith held off the participation demands of gerald monsford so what had changed to bring monsford in now could there still be an internal power problem even though jeffrey smales overthrow had failed or had monsford been invited in by a still apprehensive directorgeneral in the hope of providing sidewaysshifting blame for an asyetunknown disaster for which his being married to a serving fsb officer would unquestionably qualify hed traveled too far down roughtrack side roads leading nowhere charlie accepted properly understanding the reason for monsfords presence had to remain a work in progress in a situation in which he appeared to be making very little progress what lure could he find sufficient to convince the directorgeneral that getting natalia and sasha out was in the national interest instead of solely his the only conceivableand necessarily officialargument was that if left in moscow natalia represented a national security problem for britain and hed already doublelocked the door from both sidesand bolted it top and bottomagainst that contention his entirely truthful and personal defense against official secrets prosecution was that theyd never exchanged the secrets of either side to vary that now could lead to charges being proffered while at the same time further nullifying any possibility of gaining their freedom and then physically blinking at its total clarity the unarguable resolution came to him he doubted that natalia would cooperate by disclosing the secrets of a twentyyearlong russian intelligence career but smith and monsford wouldnt know that until she and sasha were safe and it didnt matter either that her refusal would expose his deception making it impossible for him to remain in the service he was already in a protection program anyway he could make it work charlie told himself he had to make it work the sphinxlike aubrey smith glanced fleetingly at monsfords offered photographs before putting them to one side and said yes boris kuibyshev the directorgeneral took other different prints from a side drawer and handed them in return to the other man this is igor bukharin whos also listed in the embassys finance section did you miss him monsford didnt hurry taking the easy chair to which smith gestured inwardly furious at the mockery we only began the check last night we wouldnt have bothered if youd told me you were already monitoring the place it was such an obvious precaution i didnt think it necessary you considered the possibility that they might burgle it as well demanded the mi director struggling to keep up smith smiled wanly ive been expecting them to ever since we identified the surveillance it was swept clean the day we put charlie into the protection program theres nothing for them to find except the surprise ive got in place what about the answering machine with natalias voice on it monsford retaliated the condescending smile remained from inside the flat the receiver appears disconnected the lines on divert to our technical people who pick up every incoming call as well as the slightest audible sound of forced entry theyd also hear if there were an attempted outgoing call if the russians do go in and try to report back to their embassy control monsford hoped the fury which was making him physically hot wasnt registering on his face whats the surprise youve got waiting for them the mi director listened with his head bowed more to conceal any facial redness than in concentration when smith finished monsford said id have appreciated hearing all this earlier its a contingency plan that might never be activated reminded smith of course you would have been told in advance if it became necessary at least he had more time to decide if there could be any benefit to him monsford realized its the pms personal decision we cooperate so its right i should tell you that were getting indications from moscow of something happening within the fsb smith gave no response to the implied rebuke what ive ordered a specific inquiry said monsford inadequately you suggesting theres a connection im suggesting its a possibility that shouldnt be overlooked he needed more much more agonized monsford lets not overlook it then patronized the directorgeneral whats your feeling about charlie muffins interrogation asked monsford unsettled by the other mans superiority i think theyre using natalia as bait it wasnt just dismissiveness decided monsford the bloody man was positively excluding him whats ambersoms opinion she thinks he went over a long time ago that while our intention was for charlies defection to be phoney natalia turned him and he was sent back as a double and now its all gone badly wrong for them this is a clumsy way of trying to get him safely to moscow the facts dont fit her argument rejected monsford whats your take monsford was annoyed at continuing to be the respondent instead of the questioner i dont believe charlie muffin is a traitor every analysis of every assignment going back an entire year before the fake defection shows a lot of improvisation but not a single loyaltyquestioning inconsistency right agreed smith against which i cant reconcile his marrying a serving officer in an opposition service monsford held up his hand against interruption and dont give me any loveisblind theresalwaysanexceptiontotherule nonsense hes a professionala very professionaloperative whom id have welcomed with open arms crossing the river to my side what do you think we should do i was waiting for you to tell me evaded monsford charlie muffin is a complete professional agreed smith as such he knew exactly what he was doing when he married natalia fedova and the consequences if it became known hes now got to face those consequences hell be kept safe in the protection program and the woman will have to suffer whatever fate the russians choose for her when they realize were not taking their bait i sympathize with them both but they each knew the inevitable outcome if they got caught out his entire fucking alternative operation was going down the drain thought monsford desperately we both of us know charlie wont accept that just as we both acknowledge how good he is hed abandon the protection and give you the slip as he did a few days ago except this time hell go to russia instead the directorgeneral shook his head he couldnt do that without backup resources which he doesnt have you want to run the risk of his trying which he will and create a huge diplomatic incident you proposing we eliminate him there was no outrage in smiths voice im arguing we shouldnt close everything down as quickly as you seem to be suggesting said monsford i also believe it would be an argument that those who crack the whip in downing street would consider a validation i dont think began smith but was stopped by the burp of an internal telephone he listened for several moments before interrupting sharply you know what to do do it to monsfords inquiring look smith said the russians have just broken into charlies flat and theres been fresh contact from moscow its being voiceprinted to make sure its natalia fedova isnt one thing going to complicate the other i dont see why it should said smith well have to see wont we he wasnt manipulating events despaired monsford and he didnt know how to reverse the situation it was the first time theyd met at maxim radtsics insistence in jacobsons car an enclosed vehicle was the easiest for an entrapment so as a precaution jacobson drove several times past the pickup point from every possible approach to satisfy himself there were no ambush preparations in the immediate side streets there werent but jacobson whod never before been involved in an extraction and was even less used to having the deputy director of russian intelligence dependent upon him wasnt reassured his stomach in turmoil as precisely on time he made his final approach still only minimally relieved at the sight of the russian waiting as arranged that relief vanished when he realized that the clumsiness with which radtsic fumbled open the passenger door was caused by his carrying a suitcase in one hand so instinctive was it for jacobson to drive off that he briefly took his foot off the brake making the car jump and almost toppling the russian who was only partially in the suitcase ahead of him it was a separate instinct for jacobson to snatch the case farther in and haul the russian behind it letting the next forward lurch slam the door closed what the fuck exploded jacobson finally thrusting the suitcase away from his shoulder into the rear of the vehicle he was only vaguely aware of the clatter of loose things his concentration tensed for the siren scream of arrest very much what the fuck returned the russian pushing himself upright whats happening whats in the case radtsic recovered first im the senior fsb deputy you actually think i would act as bait for your seizure jacobsons fear was molding into humiliation at his overreaction we never talked about a case about your carrying anything its not a bomb harry and our listening devices are miniaturized just like yours the case contains all the personal things that elana wants to take with her but with which wed never get past airport security jacobson was glad the darkness would cover the redness flaming his face you should have warned me yes i should shouldnt i you frightened me admitted jacobson im sorry the russian jerked his head back toward the case you can ship that out in the diplomatic bag cant you i suppose yes of course we can will there be anything more id hoped there wouldnt be the need for many more meetings that you were going to tell me the final details tonight its close but not yet not too much longer i cant wait too much longer neither can elana you wont have to promised jacobson hoping he was right ive told my father announced yvette paruch she was sitting naked at andreis dressing table until then methodically counting aloud the brushstrokes to her waistlength deeply black hair but looking at him in the mirrors reflection youre exciting me sitting like that andrei maximovich was naked too still sprawled across their bed i can see for myself yvette smiled into the mirror i said ive told my father ive moved in with you what did he say that he hoped i was sure and to be careful not to become pregnant until i was what did you say that i was but that i wouldnt get pregnant did you tell him im russian no why not you know why not so im not going to meet him he invited us down for the vacation do you want to go i want him to meet the man im in love with hell pick up my accent know im not french are you frightened having survived the nazi occupation of warsaw but seen both his parents killed by russian soldiers i think he deserves to be told in advance not when we get there one hundred she declared finishing her routine swiveling on her stool to face him what about you are you going to tell your parents not yet why not i dont choose to does that mean you dont love me that its just more convenient to fuck me if i live here instead of staying on in my own apartment thats ridiculous and dirty and you know it why not then because im jewish youre being ridiculous intentionally making an argument stop it you know everything about me i dont know anything about you lets not go down to aix for the vacation take me to moscow instead id rather go to aix id rather go to moscow well think about it youre not excited anymore she said giggling no im not am i he agreed charlie slept intermittently aware of the infrared monitoring and feigned sleep when hed been awake his concentration entirely upon how to reverse some of the impressions hed conveyed during his original questioning in the desperate hope of gaining some personal involvement in the rescue of natalia and sasha hed stupidly confronted them outargued the ridiculously mindseized deputy directorgeneral for christs sake he could probably deceive a woman as obdurate as jane ambersom but realistically it wouldnt be as easy with either aubrey smith or gerald monsford and not just them the recordings would be reexamined and soberly reanalyzed every pause and nuance tested for the slightest suspicionprompting overeager ambiguity ambersom had been more than overeager desperate as desperate as natalia had increasingly sounded during the pleading calls that had been torturously played back to him charlie wished he could listen to those recordings again the words had registered and hed known it was natalias voice and not an impersonation but in that brief totally startled awareness he hadnt properly heard them not the intonations or hesitations or an emphasis she might have imposed for him to gauge how exposed she and sasha were no he didnt need to hear the recording charlie corrected himself once more refusing the selfdeception he knew exactly how exposed natalia and sasha were just as he knew the pressure under which shed been put to make the calls he couldntwouldntfail her this time had she failed him charlie frowned at the unthinking jealousy straining for recall igor karakov he remembered a teacher at sashas school just as quickly as the doubt came charlie rejected it a friend natalia had said when hed been in moscow the last time only a friend she wouldnt lie as he had earlier escaping from chelsea charlie fought against the impatience to get up earlier than usual to be ready if smith or monsford didnt isolate his eagerness the visually watching voiceprinting analysts might he actually remained in bed longer than normal but as he had for the jersey expedition caught up during his showering and shaving noting the outside rain you got umbrellas he asked the guard when his breakfast rolls and coffee arrived if the debriefing was to be before noon there wouldnt be morning exercise predictably there was no response charlie ate half a roll he didnt want and crumbled the remainder to disguise how much hed left and took his customary second cup of coffee which that morning he didnt want either he didnt try to read beyond the headlines of the times that had come with his food but did it twice to prevent the cursoriness being obvious there was no newspaper connection with the lvov episode but to double checkas well as to fill timecharlie scrolled through the sky and bbc news channels and drew another blank charlies hopes rose when there was no exercise escort accompanying the breakfast retrieval and they grew when the exercise delay extended to twenty minutes it reached a full thirty before the two men arrived neither wore a waterproof charlie said were going to get wet the man in charge said the rain will have stopped by this afternoon and charlies surprise at getting a response collided with the satisfaction of knowing there was going to be another interrogation he had to proceed slower than a snail with hammertoed flat feet as painful as his own charlie reminded himself entering the familiar animalmurder room the three faced him in the same order as before but with the addition today of the replay machine from which at once charlie knew thered been further moscow contact it was important for him to hear the new recording before making his intended pitch the delay would enable him to detect attitude changes among those sitting in judgement upon him to detect the slightest nuance to help what he wanted to achieve gerald monsford sat buddhalike with his hands familiarly cupping his expansive stomach as if it required support charlie thought jane ambersoms buttonedtotheneck mao suit the perfect if outdated uniform for an indeterminately sexed torturer and at once stifled his wandering reflections there had to be only one undivided concentration today and it didnt include antagonism toward the deputy directorgeneral of whose personal dislike hed already had too much evidence it was aubrey smith who opened the session which momentarily surprised charlie the man said thereve been some developments some developments isolated charlie what three russians accredited to their embassy here burgled your flat last night was there something here that he could twist to his advantage wondered charlie hopefully were they caught theyre currently in custody said the directorgeneral theyll claim diplomatic immunity of course but its a criminal offense and were going to use it to the maximum whats that mean pressed charlie curious at the unexpected leniency of the exchange youre dead announced monsford hurrying to appear more visibly and audibly participating than hed so far been the death certificate is dated six weeks ago he looked theatrically at his watch by now therell be a named headstone on an old grave in moss side manchesterwhere your false identity legend has you being christenedand the church burial records will have been registered accordingly that cover legend unmarried bachelor clerk in a government pensions office is fully in placeas you know it has been for yearsand will easily satisfy the sort of media inquiries thatll follow the russians being named picked up smith seeing the other directors intrusion as confirmation of the mans gloryseeking determination with pointed clarification he went on ive got the mystery already preparedwhy should three accredited russian diplomats burgle the nolongerrented apartment of a very minor now dead civil servant who has no surviving family and no known friends charlie didnt let his mild impatience at the double act cloud his recognition of danger i was identifiedpictured on moscow televisionduring the lvov investigation not under the name in which your flat was rented and it wont be your photograph well leak to the media refused smith charlie saw an opening but hesitated deciding to wait moscowthe fsbwont accept any of it of course they wont agreed monsford choosing his intervening moment what they will accept is that you are in a protection program in which they dont stand a chance of ever finding you and that the vauxhall flat was nothing more than a major embarrassment trap thats cost them three agents two of them unidentified until today to lose that many is bad enough and what they wont know but which will terrify them is that well expose their failed lvov operation we burned them with lvov and now weve rubbed salt into very painfully sore wounds and the fsb had natalia and sasha balanced charlie the fragile opening hadnt widened as hed hoped hed wanted a lot more there was still the unheard recording indicating the side table he said theres been contact from natalia hasnt there itll be the last after the arrests predicted jane ambersom finally entering the discussion can i hear it in the time it took the woman to activate the machine charlie prepared himself determined against the slightest reaction to natalias voice the initial seconds of traffic sounds were louder than before an open street pod not an enclosed kiosk he guessed when it finally cameto a stomach jump despite charlies expectationnatalias voice was unexpectedly even as if shed prepared herself theyre examining my debriefing records i dont know how much they suspect remember charlie the cutoff was abrupt either natalia hurriedly putting down the receiver or having it snatched away and slammed back by someone else charlie had let his head drop not forgetting his earlier determination against reaction but cultivating it now although undecided whether seeming to seize this late some significance from what natalia had said would appear too obviously staged but could he realistically hope for anything more jane had rejoined the two directors and all three were staring expectantly at him as charlie looked up the moment he did the overly aggressive woman said whats the matter with you and despite her uncertain sexuality charlie would have willingly kissed her instead he shook his head as if confused continuing to string out a response whats wrong repeated the woman it had to look as if the realization was starting out half formed and needed to be coaxed from him shes very frightened more frightened than she ever was when we had to be careful in moscow but she believes they know about us and if they do shes realized shes caught up in the biggest espionage coup russia has ever attempted the total failure of the biggest espionage coup russia ever attempted theyll be convincedany intelligence organization wouldthat she knew i was going to wreck it jane ambersom turned and said something inaudible to the directorgeneral but to which smith shook his head not turning to her the man said is there something important in what youve just heard they werent dismissing him out of hand charlie said what she hopes ive understood from what ive just heard shes made an offer her bargain for her and sasha to be got out histrionically jane pushed herself back into her chair snorting in customary derision do you possibly imagine in whatever dream world youre living that youll convince us that weve got to get your supposed wife and daughter out of russia the totally fixated deputy director could have chosen what other part of her androgynous body she wanted kissed or otherwise caressed decided charlie in further gratitude youve established natalia is not my supposed wife but my legally married wife yes confirmed monsford before either of the others concentrating upon the mi director charlie went on and youve also established from studying my assignment record that i have never sabotaged anything involving this organization during my marriage or association with natalia yes agreed monsford again continuing to address the mi chief charlie chanced the slightest of exaggerations and you know from her length of service not just with the current fsb but the previous kgb that shes not just a but the senior debriefer for russian external intelligence youre intelligence experts all three of you but not even you can begin to imagine the number of defectors and spy offers and doubles and dissidents shes interrogated the answers she could provide to the mysteries and uncertainties over the past twenty years are you trying to persuade us thats what shes offering by her reference to your debriefing records asked the quietvoiced aubrey smith even more softly than usual im not trying to convince you said charlie thats what im telling you as honestly as ive told you everything else if she had all that to offer why didnt she come with you in the first place clumsily challenged jane i could have done a ventriloquists act with this woman thought charlie because until now she hasnt confronted the reality of a firing squad after undergoing interrogation that she knows would extend beyond her sort of debriefing into the kgbperfected horror of psychiatric hospitals while all the time knowingbecause theyd remind her every day as the most horrific part of that torturethat sasha would be committed to the worst of russian state orphanages the psychiatrist was right the mans mad declared jane ambersom theyd once more moved from the formality of the interview after charlies departure but she was unable to sit instead pacing up and down in front of the dead fireplace around which the easy chairs were set the psychological assessment wasnt that he was mentally ill corrected the directorgeneral it was that charlie muffin would recognize more quickly than anyone else the limitations of a new life in a protection programwhich indicated the highest analytical intelligence that cowley had knownas a result of which charlie was suffering an understandable depression but which he doubted would ever become suicidal the suicide watch was a shock warning to charlie not a necessary precaution i dont believe there can be a single opposing argument against our getting natalia and the child out of moscow declared monsford whod gone through the charade of calling mis vauxhall cross buildingon his cell phone from charlies exercise patchbefore returning for the review which has to mean theres an update from your call sardonically questioned the fidgeting deputy director theres already open speculation on izvestia and in pravda of retaliatory rebuttals to our arrests why should i be surprised about that challenged the woman moscow news is going further continued monsford whod added to what he considered his success in getting the address of charlies london flat leaked to the russians by swallowing his antipathy to david halliday and authorizing the suggestion being offered by halliday to the mans contact in the englishlanguage publication theyre hardening the rumor into a reciprocal intelligence sensation its being picked up and repeated on western wire services theres not the slightest indication that whats going on in moscow has any connection whatsoever with what were discussing here beyond some obviously enforced telephone contact from a woman stupid enough to trust charlie muffin rejected jane our stupidly responding to it is the intended reciprocal intelligence sensation if natalias got as much as half of what charlie sketched out its a gold lode we could mine for years judged aubrey smith reflectively theres no obvious connection but it would be on a par with the lvov business we could tie in knots not just russian intelligence but every other service of any importance up to and including the cia whove doublecrossed and used us both of us for the past two decades there cant be an argument against getting her and the child out repeated monsford anxious to stoke the other mans belief except the obvious one that its a trap a matchmaybe even more than a matchfor what the russians fell into by burgling charlies flat jane persisted id like us to continue our cooperation by actively considering a joint rescue operation declared monsford dismissing the womans opposition why joint demanded jane instantly seeing the possibility of personal revenge you want her and the child why dont you get them out by yourself willingly despite their being the wife and daughter of one of your officers accepted monsford confronting the expected question you couldnt of course expect us to share whatever she told us of all those famous defectors you didnt know were spying against this country until they gave their press conferences in moscow he had no alternative but to go along with monsford decided aubrey smith although not for the reasons the mi director was advocating hed only too recently survived an internecine war he wasnt going to risk walking away from this one until he knew far more than was immediately obvious lets start the planning tomorrow i want put on written record my total opposition to any of this insisted jane ambersom there was an echoing silence each man hoping the other would respond to give him a followup advantage monsford believing himself to have the most to gain broke first im confused first you demand to be included in whatever we do now you demand your complete opposition placed on provable record have i missed something in what weve been discussing my matching confusion also quickly came in aubrey smith denying the sis director whatever hed set out to achieve surprisingly there was no renewed flush from the woman at this new confrontation she said i dont see any dichotomy you intend a reaction that risks both our organizations being exposed to international ridicule and derision while opposing whatever you doand wanting that opposition recognizedi believe my continued involvement as devils advocate to be absolutely essential to maintain a balancing voice the immediate impression of aubrey smith who was fundamentally as honest and subjective as possible in the professional position he occupied was that his recently imposed deputy had established a necessarily important safeguard gerald monsfords equally quick thought was that jane ambersom had put herself forward as a furtherand an additionalsacrificial offering if his real objective went wrong which even the best laid espionage plans so frequently did responding first the mi director said you bring to mind tennysons line of janusfaces looking diverse ways i defer to your superior knowledge not just of classics but the art of the twofaced jane shot back didnt tennyson also remark that men may come and men may go but others lasting longer has anyone got anything further to offer demanded aubrey smith impatiently i suspect jane believes herself outnumbered monsford said flushed why dont we achieve a better balance by adding rebecca to our panel it would give her the opportunity to oppose the whore jane ambersom realized i think thats an excellent suggestion it would probably put him at a threetoone disadvantage but at any disaster inquest monsfords manipulative hand would be more obvious rationalized smith if its the decision of the prime minister for this to be a joint operation it establishes complete equality he appeared to concede i look forward to tomorrow said monsford believing himself the victor so do i said the woman believing the same for herself which was the more murderous place to be moscow or here in london wondered aubrey smith hed have to be very careful that having survived once none of his own blood was spilled either literally or figuratively an hour later the london evening standard broke the story of the russian burglary of charlie muffins flat an essential attribute for an intelligence officer is the ability to become a wallpaper person someone able to merge indistinguishably into any background or surrounding harry jacobson practiced the art more assiduously than most as he was practicing it now doubly invisible deep within the shadows of a buttressed prerevolutionary wall opposite natalia fedovas moscow apartment on pecatnikov pereulok the determination to perfect a chameleon camouflage developed early in his mi career spurred by the fear that his noticeably cleft lip a birth defect would preclude his becoming a field operative to overcome which hed consciously adopted the appearance of a shoepolished departmentstoresuited bank clerk complete with wireframed spectacles and closely cropped hair to conceal the harelip he cultivated an unclipped walrusstyle mustache that matched his hairs natural blondeness the disguise now so accustomed that it was not until this reflective moment that the facial similarity between himself and radtsics heavy stalinlike growth occurred to him it could decided jacobson be his escape from this additional surveillance assignment upon natalia fedova which he resented as an extra and unnecessary burden it was very definitely an objection to be put to james straughan maybe even as early as tonight natalia fedova arrived on foot at precisely the same time as she had the previous two evenings wearing the same light summer coat and carrying the same briefcase as always in her left hand with the entry key in her right and again as worrying as the previous two evenings unaccompanied by the child who had until now always been with her london werent going to like the absence jacobson decided they werent going to like or understand it at all they didnt we could be too late suggested james straughan keeping any satisfaction from his voice at the possibility of monsfords having miscalculated it could mean a lot of other things too argued rebecca street loyally as usual she was giving the director the full benefit of a plunging decolletage being too late is the most obvious insisted straughan whod intentionally held back from announcing sashas apparent disappearance during the mutualcongratulation orgy between the mi director and his deputy at monsfords maneuvering rebecca onto the planning group savoring the moment of deflation although well aware she wouldnt comprehend a single word straughan intended telling his mother about it that evening he had a fading hope that his nightly monologues might get through to her why didnt you tell me earlier that we hadnt seen the child for so long suspiciously demanded monsford who hadnt activated his personal recording facility i didnt want to be premature after three days i decided it should be flagged up sometimes thought straughan he feared this devious man would send him mad what else said rebecca i dont think we should use jacobson to monitor natalias apartment cautioned straughan if the child has been taken from her the place will be under permanent surveillance jacobson could be isolated its a possibility conceded monsford whod led the other two through an hours review of radtsics extraction before straughans revelation i dont like the uncertainty this introduces it neednt materially change what weve agreed encouraged the woman were intending a diversion with natalia not a genuine extraction its an uncertainty weve no way of controlling repeated monsford how does it impact upon what weve discussed pressed straughan whod considered jane ambersom a friend and wished hed been less cowardly and confronted monsfords apportion onto her of all his own misconceptions over lvov now straughan was enjoying monsfords evident stress in front of a woman he wanted to impress all natalias got to do is make another bloody telephone call smiths keeping charlies apartment line open monsford pointed out i thought wed decided shes reciting what the fsb tells her to say what if she somehow gets an unmonitored call out demanded monsford dont forget shakespeares warning of pernicious women well confuse ourselves going around in hypothetical circles risked rebecca shed have said more if shed been able persisted straughan ignoring the warning were gaining nothing by speculating insisted the woman the kids missing and thats that its not our complication we wont allow it to become one said monsford decisive at last we dont tell smith or ambersom tell jacobson to take any cable traffic referring to it off the general file theres no cable traffic about radtsicor muffin or natalias inclusion in his extractionon the general file scored straughan pleased at the small victory you ordered it a dedicated eyes only file restricted to us three remember i havent even told jacobson why were maintaining surveillance on natalia fedova of course i remember what i ordered snapped monsford testily and dont wait another three days before briefing me on anything relevant to what were doing ill instruct the cipher room and the duty officer to alert me at once irrespective of time youll know within minutes of my knowing assured straughan fantasizing himself interrupting monsford in the final seconds of his nightly pony ride with rebecca that fucking man is insufferable declared the woman minutes after straughan left knowing that was what monsford wanted her to say his cards marked hes just too stupid to suspect hes going to fall upon what shelley called the thorns of life said monsford furious at the lack of respect from both straughan and the woman she smiled despite the implication that shed overstepped the familiarity gesturing toward the window and the sluggishly meandering thames another transfer across the river maybe monsford smiled back emptily he feared that straughan had a meticulously kept graveyard map of where far too many skeletonsliterally and figurativelywere buried for any serious move against the man aubrey smith had never intended he and his deputy would be the first at the hunting lodge but neither to be in the psychologically disadvantaged position of having to apologize for their lateness caused by a roadclosing accident on their way having to do so relegated them to the secondary role in which smith had hoped to place the mi duo the initial setback furthered despite briefing her in advance by jane ambersoms belowzero frigidity at rebecca streets inclusion in the top executive group the debacle was very intentionally exacerbated by the warmness of rebeccas nearsuffocating response to their apologies assuring them the twohour postponement had not been at all inconvenient the duck confit at lunch was wonderful and the burgundy exceptional and the tour of the lodge magnificent prompting geraldpointedly not director monsfordand her to wish they had such safe houses at their disposal but these are particularly unusual circumstances arent they rebecca concluded for once the chanel business suit was severely practical although the inherent sexual frisson still sharply contrasted with its absence from the trousersuited jane have you spoken with charlie smith hurried on anxious to get beyond the latearrival discomfort youre in charge monsford continued to patronize he gestured toward a small conference table with a fivechair setting replacing the earlier tribunal formality weve waited for your seating arrangements without replying smith put jane beside him nodding to the others to choose their places what about charlie muffin asked the mi deputy not until weve talked things through refused smith recovering slightly i want us to be absolutely clear about what were going to do and how were going to do it without the slightest possibility of misunderstandings its surely all remarkably simple monsford bustled in impatient to assume the other directors authority weve got the photographs my people took of natalia and sasha we can put prints into genuine british passports although obviously under false english names in the passports therell be russian tourist visas my technical division have provable russian inks and cyrillic type fonts for entry and exit stamps the photographs are good enough for my technical experts again to gauge with sufficient accuracy both the height weight and physique of natalia and the child for a complete selection of englishmanufactured and labeled clothes sufficiently worn for them not to appear obviously new everything will be shipped to the embassy in the diplomatic bag my rezidentura there will put together a choice of russian souvenirs a mother and her daughter would be expected to bring back to england we make contact with natalia and arrange a pickupthats going to need a lot more detailed consideration if theyre under tight surveillanceto get them to the embassy where everything ive set out will be waiting including their confirmed reservations on a direct british airways flight to london the pause was as prepared as the recitation for rebecca to come in on cue taking the urgency into account our technicians have already started work on the passports and the clothing you might like to hold on that stopped the other woman weve already prepared a complete documentation selection smith enjoyed the stretched silence reluctant to snap it you seem to have started a little prematurely as you have challenged monsford youre in charge quoted smith verbatim isnt that what you said this isnt a competition stated rebecca her overeffusiveness gone absolutely not mocked jane the problem isnt one of technical resources or facilities we can forge or manufacture whatever we need stressed smith content that the balance had been restored the problem is physically getting under our protectionand in a way that cant diplomatically or publicly rebounda woman and child presumably under fsb surveillance how do you suggest we do that thats what gerald meant about detailed consideration said rebecca the entire purpose of this meeting reminded jane as conscious as aubrey smith of their recovery whats your proposal she and the child have to come to the embassy by themselves improvised monsford looking to his mistress for support once theyre in the building technically british territory tried rebecca loyally that territorial protection would cease the moment natalia and sasha took one step outside the embassy smith sighed but were assuming theyre under tight surveillance how do you get a message to natalia to go to the embassy without it being intercepted by those watching her andassuming that somehow you docan you prevent their being seized long before they get into the embassy in the first place at this moment i havent the slightest idea conceded the sis director although not as an admission of defeat this is a planning session for each of us to give the most constructive input whats your contact proposal diversions declared the mi directorgeneral enigmatically by letting the russians imagine weve taken their bait and that were coming for mother and daughter but then introduce diversion after diversion to send them around in circles until they dont know which is the genuine extraction and which isnt they dont need to run around in circles disputed rebecca theyve got natalia and sasha theyre the only people the fsb need constantly to watch youre looking in the wrong direction which is what i intend them to do argued the softvoiced smith of course theyve got natalia and sasha but natalia and sasha arent who they really want are they they want charlie muffin youre proposing to send him back in exclaimed rebecca in apparent surprise no denied smith but theyll think itll be charlie muffin and from the moment theyre convinced it is their entire concentration will be upon finding him its charlieor their belief that its charliewhos going to be the diversion how demanded rebecca knowing the importance of reestablishing their briefly imagined supremacy easily said smith allowing the vaguest of smiles natalias calls were from ordinary public telephonesone more specifically than othersbecause we were expected naturally to trace their origin just as we or rather charlie was expected to recognize that the calls to his flat were always at precisely the same time giving him a pattern but they wouldnt have been ordinary public kiosks would they theyll appear to be but theyll have recording attachments automatically triggered by an incoming international call signal in anticipation of charlie responding to the numbers not that of natalias flat so charlie will respond at the precise time which sheor rather the fsbhas established what if shes not there at the appointed time challenged monsford there hasnt been any contact from moscow since the burglary there wasnt any response to her calls before then and from the russian embassy lawyers whove already had legal access to their diplomats in custody here theyll know the flat was empty and we created the legend of his death so theyll also know hes under protection weve already agreed they wont accept that legend jane pointed out any more than theyll accept charlies sudden reappearance is anything more than our trying to lure them into a trap they wont be able to understand just as they didnt understandor anticipatethe burglary snare we set for them said rebecca but they wont risk being burned twice exactly agreed jane triumphantly they wont accept it and they wont understand it but they cant afford to ignore it and before this afternoons over we need to come up with an even more tantalizing bait jane paused caught by the presented analogy our fishing line natalia and sashas safety net charlie muffin is the integral part in this declared monsford desperate to get off the constantly teetering back foot isnt it time we included him in this discussion charlie muffin had a savants instinct for atmospheres within environments and was well into his clairvoyant interpretation by the time he shuffled unescorted now from the trophyroom door to the conference table already unevenly hedged by its four stiffly seated occupants only the one empty chair retained its neat setting the others at disjointed angles separating each from its neighbors there were coffee cups similarly disarrangedthe discarded coffeepot alone on a side tablesupporting the impression of prior discussion although there wasnt a single doodle on any of the individual memo pads before them there was one asyetunknown woman closer to gerald monsford than to either aubrey smith or jane ambersom similarly drawn together both expressionless faces as stiff as their rigidly held attitudes charlie went to the empty chair but didnt sit until smiths head jerk of permission and as he did the mi director announced we want to get your wife and child out its obvious you should be included in the discussion thank you said charlie who hadnt expected such immediate confirmation but pushing as much genuine sincerity into the two words as possible finally halting the individually addressed gratitude at the unknown woman who at once introduced herself having been offered the opening charlie added at what stage is the planning its starting here right now declared smith although looking more to gerald monsford than to charlie perhaps youd sketch out the sis ideas in broad outline the mi director attempted to edit out aubrey smiths earlier pointpicking but several times lost his way and instead of omitting the passport preparations actually elaborated upon them eventually clearly struggling monsford concluded this isnt a proposal even in its broadest sense its a starting point a basis for the sort of material theyll need when they make their break charlie fought against openly showing his dismay feeling no satisfaction at being right about the planning vacuum before his inclusion this echelon was too high obviously none of them had ever worked in the field trained in operational practicalities trusting nothing and no one winning if youre luckyor ruthless enoughdying if youre not carefully initially rephrasing his words to avoid humiliating them charlie said we wont get them out disguised as british tourists wearing british clothes on british passports no matter how good our forgeries and fake documentation russian entry visas are stamped and retained upon arrival to be numerically matched with their departure counterfoils theres no way we could introduce forged entry sections into the bureaucratic system is that your only comment quickly pressed smith guessing that it wasnt these posturing four werent properlyprofessionallyworking to evolve a rescue operation other better professionals who knew the smell of shit and what blood tasted like should have been doing that these figurehead bureaucrats were playacting to score off one another but the charade was the best he could hope for at this moment the only hope he had the embassy can be as much a prison as a haven which links he cautiously began once more indivisible from the paramount problem of getting natalia and the child under our safekeeping and away from russian surveillance jane impatiently intruded unable to hold back from the discussion any longer seemingly unperturbed by the annoyed looks from both men charlies intention had been to continue talking about precisely that but the interruption gave him a moment to reconsider he was he belatedly recognized in a far stronger and definitely more influential position than hed realized maybe even able to make natalia and sashas escape his own although always insinuating his suggestions to appear those of monsford or smith it would all of course go through the pragmatic scrutiny but the rejecting mesh sifting would be far more widely set with the proposals coming down from the gods which you have obviously talked about before i joined you you were cut off before you finished what you were saying questioned rebecca in return after a momentary hesitation charlie said i was also going to suggest that it wasnt advisable to issue natalia and sasha british passports to involve our embassy quite apart from the problem of making contact with natalia without fsb interception its what theyd expect and be most prepared for the documentation weve prepared isnt british for that obvious reason said aubrey smith ahead of the other director what languages apart from her own russian and english does natalia speak german fluently she was assigned for a period to east germany replied charlie taking his time now seeking his openings east germany picked up rebecca at once was she there the same time as vladimir putin charlie came within a whisker of trying further to enhance natalias value by claiming she had been a contemporary of the russian president turned premier ive already told you we never discussed our professional lives but i think theres a strong possibility she was in potsdam at the same time there was a moments pause before smith said just russian english and german and polish added charlie she has some polish although shes not fluent well enough to communicate in polish not draw unnecessary attention pressed smith well enough to debrief in the language confirmed charlie feeling the first spurt of renewed hope sasha obviously only has limited russian weve prepared polish documentation disclosed the mi director theres no matching entry to exit visa regulations for rail or road crossings once theyre across the polish border theyre safe actually in the european union yes agreed charlie once in poland theyd be safe which brings us back to how to reach natalia said rebecca directly addressing aubrey smith tell us how your diversions are going to achieve that diversions queried charlie the feeling of satisfaction growing the initial phone call can be easily managed insisted the mi directorgeneral his entire concentration upon charlie what we need from you is a way or a methodhopefully bothto make that contact with natalia the whole extraction stands or falls by our achieving that and yours is the detailed knowledge upon which it depends exactly as he wanted it charlie recognized the final satisfaction engulfing him dont overplay it came the balancing warning i understand but can you provide it demanded rebecca im sure i can said charlie maintaining the lowkey reaction how soon persisted monsford i need to think it through ill have enough to discuss by tomorrow sufficient for us to start moving by tomorrow picked up smith definitely promised charlie tightly sufficient to start tomorrow monsford and rebecca sat tightly together in the rear of the car returning them to london the soundproof glass screen fully raised between them and their driver monsford said i didnt enjoy playing the complete idiot back there you played it as it had to be played flattered the woman the recordings will show smith forcing the pace initiating the moves that will go wrong you think the woman might really have been in potsdam with putin rebecca shrugged charlie says its possible who knows if she wasas well as being as high as shes clearly been in the kgb as well as the fsbshe really would be a hell of a catch wouldnt she mused the mi director maxim radtsic became the senior deputy to the kgb chairman for the last year of its existence and still has that position today reminded rebecca getting him across which we know were going to do is the higher prize getting both across would be the biggest coup of all said monsford coming so soon after the lvov affair it would reduce russian intelligenceand putins wellestablished cold war determinationto a pile of dust if we tried to do both wed end up with one extraction getting in the way of the other and risk finishing up with neither rebecca warned natalia and the child are our diversion to get radtsic out thats enough i suppose youre right monsford sighed as the car headed up the embankment toward cheyne walk do you want to eat in or out its been a long day and will probably be longer tomorrow said rebecca lets go straight home after that lunch all i feel like eating is you and that she reflected was an exaggeration jane ambersom flustered into the mount street restaurant irritated at her second delay that day searching anxiously around and smiling in relieved recognition at the wave from barry elliott rising to meet her you got my message that id be late she said as the american reached her just as i was leaving the office cleared my decks in the extra hour you gave me said her fbi liaison leading her back to their table something unexpected delay you jane nodded to the offered chardonnay an outoftown meeting overran anything of mutual interest mutual to you or the cia i dont understand the question the man frowned im supposed to act as mi liaison to both i havent heard from the cia elliott smiled with schoolboy shyness i guess theyre nervous of you guys they got their fingers badly burned the last time so its just you and i said jane risking the flirtation just you and i confirmed the american and you didnt answer my question nothing thats emerged so far no really useful chatter avoided the woman although carefully allowing the uncertainty you dont sound very sure quickly picked up the man whose youthfulness was heightened by a schoolboy enthusiasm and a flopforward forelock he constantly tried to sweep back into place as he did at that moment you are aware of all the rumors coming out of moscow about some impending upheaval jane continued to avoid nothing beyond the general traffic said elliott your people think its got some resonance weve got it flagged after the lvov business she said nodding to the waiter that shed have the same at elliott whod studied the menu more thoroughly im not sure what youre telling me complained the man theres nothing to tell it could be coincidence so soon after refused jane content that she had done enough not just to plant but to water a seed she might choose to cultivate further if she suspected she was being offered up as a scapegoat for the second time which was a similar although not such a selfprotective thought that came to james straughan as he replaced the telephone in his berkhamsted bedroom long after hed given up hope of hearing from the nightduty officer it wasnt the alert to which gerald monsford had decreed he should be awakened but it was close enough and straughan was glad he at once called cheyne walk sure from the strain evident in the mi directors answering voice that hed fulfilled his fantasy and interrupted the bastard in flagrante i got everything you wanted to england protested maxim radtsic you should have told me before doing it said elana youre shouting warned radtsix looking around him theyd parked the car and were walking slowly along the riverbank again so are you why should i have told you because you should said elana frowning at her own childlike response shed known from her first case packing trialand ensured it further by overpacking it on the trials that followedthat radtsic would dismiss it as impractical and hoped he would reconsider their fleeing because she believed he was overreacting to coincidence now shed lost every family memento why are you being like this i dont believe we have to run elana protested radtsic anguished at how it was going to be im frightened too frightened the arrangement had been for radtsic to meet harry jacobson that night in gorky park close to the ferris wheel where families with their children would have provided cover jacobson waited increasingly apprehensive for an hour after their appointed time before abandoning the rendezvous he intentionally drove in the opposite direction from the embassy although the registration would have been traceable the fear not subsiding until hed zigzagged through several streets what the hell had gone wrong now came the mantra pumping through his head is something wrong demanded andrei nothings wrong i just felt like calling you replied elana ive written to father we havent had a letter here i sent it to his office im not sure that was a good idea he gave me a poste restante number i could use should i tell him to expect the letter its up to you its nothing serious nothing to worry about i mean have you made many friends a lot said andrei smiling across the apartment at yvette curled up catlike in an enveloping chair we miss you do you miss us of course but im kept very busy when will you be able to come home i dont know not yet id like more letters i told you im kept very busy too busy for a single page the correspondence was channeled through the russian embassy in the diplomatic pouch to avoid french intelligence interception of emails ill write soon i promise is father there hes putting the car away ill tell him about the letter and dont forget to write it was my mother said andrei to yvettes inquiring look i want you to teach me russian i like its sound she wanted to know when i was going to visit i told her not for some time that i was going to aix she smiled again i know my father will like you it wont work any other way insisted charlie confident hed kept the scourging overnight doubt from his voice as he set out his rescue proposals then its stillborn refused aubrey smith flatly theres absolutely no question of your becoming personally involved despite its vital importance hed actually felt embarrassed at the previous nights close in front of an audience of smith jane ambersom and an assortment of earphoned technicians mouthing the carefully prepared words into the unanswered moscow public telephones from which natalia had pleaded ive got your messages im coming back you know ill come back dont panic itll all be over soon everything needs a lot more discussion and consideration before theres talk of abandonment quickly came in monsford russian response queried charlie whod already registered the return of the familiar apparatus and hoped to have learned the reason ahead of smiths demand for his rescue ideas let me quickly offered rebecca street ahead of the other woman briefly smiling as she went to the machine at the recollection of monsfords impotent collapse at straughans previous nights telephone intrusion hurry charlie im sure theyre close came natalias voice and charlies stomach lurched in recognition within three hours of your call to the moscow numbers declared monsford eagerly theyve bitten they havent bitten at anything dismissed smith theyre going with the hand they dealt in the first place to see if it will play out to their advantage which it would if charlie actually went in and why he isnt going im prepared to hear ideas that dont personally include you charlie if there arent any we abort and lose twenty years of priceless espionage intelligence as well as possibly even more priceless personal information about vladimir putin whos going to go on running russia for years challenged rebecca we cant discard this chance im not dismissing it refuted the mi director im agreeing to an operation to get natalia fedova and her child out but refusing charlies involvement beyond his inside knowledge then it is stillborn risked charlie desperately talking more to monsford than to his own reluctant director i dont need a voiceprint to know that was again natalia just as she wouldnt have needed a voiceprint to know it was me she wont do anything trust any part of a rescue attempt if the contact is made in a voice other than mine and that cant be done remotely with my being eighteen hundred miles away her reaction will be that it was an fsb trick part of how theyre using her which shell automatically reject do you really believe expect us to believe that singlehandedly you could beat the entire russian intelligence apparatus sneered jane ambersom pushing herself into the forefront no i cant defeat the entire russian intelligence apparatus charlie replied echoing the sneer but i believe i stand a better chance than a squad going in colda squad shell anyway rejectjust as i defeated not just natalia herself but a group of thenkgb professionals during the phoney defection and just as i beat a dedicated group of kgb and fsb professionals a little over four months ago to stop that russian intelligence apparatus virtually installing itself in the oval office of the president of the united states of america no one is questioning what you did retreated jane which im not boasting about qualified charlie caught by the unexpected lessening of the womans opposition quite apart from natalia trusting no one but me it would take months to train an extraction team and theyd still be ill prepared because as determined as id obviously be to omit nothing id still forget something and we havent got months whatever move they might have been planning against her will have been stopped now because of my calls last night but that holdoff wont last forever i think charlie is talking a lot of logical common sense hustled monsford i think there should be made available as much and as many backup provisions and resources as we can anticipate but that the actual extraction be headed by charlie i agree supported rebecca what if you fail challenged jane again what if they pick you up which theyre ready and waiting to do and stage a good oldfashioned show trial what happens then russiacertainly moscowisnt as controlled as it was in the days of stalins show trials despite what putins done to turn the clock back argued charlie the ultimate humiliation would be theirs not ours for a show trial to work theyd need an open although orchestrated court and some sort of apparent confession to whatever crime they falsify what they couldnt control or prevent when i spoke would be my disclosing how their intelligence operation so abysmally failed and named those already known to have been assassinated by the fsb which would humiliate america as much as russia qualified jane not at all refused charlie id tell it as a cia success in a joint operation with us not of the cia being suckered as they were she didnt at that moment know how or why reflected jane but she could have a lot more about which to talk to barry elliott at their next dinner winning all over again not just for the second time but publicly is a forceful argument no its not resisted smith recognizing opinion settling against him they wont risk a show trial they want you dead like all the others in the lvov affair theyve already killed theyd simply kill you the others whove died were russian charlie pointed out im english and weve got three of their diplomats in custody i dont believe you seriously imagine those diplomats equate as insurance against your being killed said smith allowing incredulity into his emotionally flat voice it would give the fsb and even the kremlin pause for thought if they learned through lawyers representing those arrested diplomats that theyd be named and linked if i died violently even if it were staged as an accident said charlie by then they would have moved against natalia and sasha countered smith yes agreed charlie reluctantly forcing the acceptance by then i would have already lost them but youd have your publicly humiliating second coup wouldnt you were wasting time going around in circles declared monsford impatiently weve got an intelligence opportunity thats potentially too promising to ignore i accept charlie should participate as hes proposed to which i will add all the manpower and resources hes likely to need monsford hesitated and said directly to aubrey smith make it in fact an entirely sis operation with charlie seconded to me if you want no part of it and if you charlie are willing to operate that way it will overcome all the objections wont it perfectly supported rebecca with predictable timing ill accept that agreed charlie on my terms he mentally added the prime minister has ordered it to be a joint operation reminded the other woman itll have to be approved through our government masters said monsford matching the reminder its still early enough to fix a meeting with bland and palmer today that okay with you aubrey a meeting with the government group is certainly necessary agreed the mi directorgeneral but to sanction a joint operation in the terms weve discussed this morning not a separation of authority charlie will not be seconded camese declared monsford what demanded jane voicing the bewilderment of them all camese repeated the m director the mortal wife of janus the greek god with two faces able to look in opposite directions i propose camese be the code designation for natalias extraction its appropriate sos getting to london dismissed the mi directorgeneral it was aubrey smiths suggestion that he and monsford share the car to london for the quickly arranged consultation with their government liaison which protectively guaranteed the journey was in an mi vehicle with a securitycleared mi driver who was as usual separated by the fully raised soundproof glass screen for the first thirty minutes they traveled through the buckinghamshire countryside in selfreflective selfprotective silence smith determined upon a complete mental rehearsal although predictably it was the impatient monsford who eventually spoke i imagine youll want equal participation in the support group of course agreed smith content with the direction the other man had chosen i suggested we accept charlies argument about too many cooks spoiling the broth absolutely this really was going far better than he could have hoped thought smith i am thinking of no more than six three of mine three of yours they could also handle finance materiel and travel everything that charlie might call upon once he establishes contact with natalia only when he calls upon them balanced smith choosing his moment the timing has to be absolutely precise the major argument against what were proposing is the public debacle if we get things wrong by as much or as little as a second we wont get approval unless we can satisfy them there is no risk of that a show trial you mean i mean totally satisfying them that success is guaranteed with no risk of charlieor the governmentbeing publicly exposed monsford lapsed into further silence but when smith didnt continue the mi director said you were adamantly opposed to a very specific insurance as i was opposed earlier today to charlies participation an objection ive since dropped there was another although shorter silence before monsford said as you are now conceding the need for an ultimate insurance if such a move becomes essential if such a need arose we would have lost the advantages of bringing natalia with all she potentially knows here to safety at which stage it would be containment time i agree fenced monsford consciously switching the direction of the conversation onto the other man as he recognized them to be entering the north london suburbs with perhaps only fifteen minutes left in the exchange before reaching their destination smith shifted on his seat discomfited at being outmaneuvered we understand what were talking about but its not an eventuality we can openly introduce into this afternoons discussion the very purpose for the man hesitated searching for the appropriate ambiguity for the airlock through which we have to communicate is to provide legally unchallengeable deniability in parliament in the event of a catastrophe now it was monsford who changed position surely we can sufficiently infer such a guarantee without risking any misunderstandings there are practicalities that we would need completely to clarify to avoid any misunderstandings between ourselves insisted smith determined to recover the impetus do you have such an asset monsford stirred again aware how perfectly everything was slotting into place i have a station chief harry jacobson completely briefed upon the operation following eyes only instructions hes supervised all my preliminary preparations could he perform the ultimate insurance proposal he would need to be totally distanced from everything else and obviously he was going to be one of my three in the combined support team if hes assigned the insurance necessity id need another officer to maintain our threetothree balance which creates an imbalance my four to your three i dont think we need be that pedantic offered smith who hadnt imagined it was going to be so easy youd be happy with a fourtothree imbalance questioned monsford who hadnt imagined it was going to be so easy were not actually on opposing sides are we smith allowed himself being on opposite sides of the thames is simply a geographical separation of course were not on opposing sides monsford sniggered knowing he was expected to appear amused which he was although not at what smith had said its been easier for us to understand each other without those damn women on our coattails hasnt it very much easier agreed smith it had taken close to an hour after the other four left for charlies euphoric mist to lift and for him to confront that his initial reaction had been more fogged than misted by his singleminded fixation upon saving natalia and sasha now after that neartranscendental hour in the nolongerlockedorguarded room in what would soon no longer be his latest safe house came the hardassed examination summoning yet again that closetophotographic recall of every incident and conversation since the numbing moment of hearing natalias metallicvoiced pleas charlie for the first time set out to create a mosaic from the pieces he could safely assume reservingalthough not positively dismissingwhat he judged the more outlandish hypotheses inevitable from the sparse information available his starkest most frightening awareness had to be the relentless dedication with which the fsb were hunting him their utter determination such that theyd consciously sacrificed three undetected diplomatconcealed spies in the ridiculous burglary of his vauxhall apartment it had to mean charlies mind abruptly blocked at the first of the insufficiently considered anomalies how had the fsb discovered the vauxhall flat and its telephone number neither of which was traceable to him either from its shielded lease or its utility records nor was such information available through any documentation in the lawyersupervised jersey bank account the remotest and already partially considered possibilityif true a further confirmation of the russian revenge obsessionwas the fsb establishing a connection from his television exposure during the lvov affair and his long ago faked defection but that still wouldnt have led them to his vauxhall flat or its telephone number yes it could came the instant contradiction after his initial return from moscow charlie had always called natalia from an untraceably anonymous boughtforcash telephone card disposable when its charge value was exhausted but shed very occasionally telephoned from her apartment ignoring his repeated sometimes even angry insistence that she always call from an unlisted public kiosk there was another jarring halt to charlies speculation but always to charge the call collect under the pressure to which she had undoubtedly been subjected reciting the words at least monitored if not actually dictated to her it would have been far more logicalexpected evenfor her to telephone from her apartment more logical too for the fsb eavesdropping enforcers so why hadnt she had natalia tried to convey something beyond her obvious coercion something she was desperate for him to recognize by using a public facility he might charlie at once accepted be stumbling in the wrong direction as he had when trying to lull his protective minders in preparation for his unsupervised dash to jersey but it was an inconsistency in their arranged understanding and intentionally introduced inconsistency was an acknowledged dangeralerting tradecraft signal it was something to flag up even if at this moment it didnt contribute to his empty mosaic what was there that just might contribute the fsb wasnt the only intelligence organization wanting him hanged drawn and quartered thered been a substantial clearout within the cia after his exposure but charlie couldnt see them making up any part of his unfilled picture or could he irena yakulova novikov first the initiating kgb and after their supposed dissolution the continuing fsb architect of the lvov emplacement had not so far been factored into the current context what if somehow irena novikov was a continuing integral part of the lvov bloodletting in a desperate attempt to recuperate her brain child irena had staged her own faked defection in an ultimately failed attempt to prevent his uncovering the truth about stepan lvov now she was incarcerated somewhere in americaor perhaps a torturepermitting rendition countryundergoing the most extreme cia interrogation to provide far more secrets about russian intelligence charlie doubted that someone as dedicated as irena would break under american interrogation no matter how brutal but professionally it wasnt a risk russia could take theyd do everything to get her back by following their unbreakable coda of demanding diplomatic access to negotiate her return it was far more likely charlie conceded that his london address had been disclosed to washington by the avenging disciples stablecleaned along with the disgraced ciapocketed former deputy director of mi jeffrey smale and in turn offered to the fsb by the disgruntled cia he was looking at a brick wall charlie acknowledged hypotheses stacked upon hypotheses upon a quicksand of unknowns and uncertainties he didnt have enough about anything from which to make a halfintelligent guess apart from the one unarguable fact of natalias exposure so why was he trying because he didnt need the familiar foot twinge to warn him that distracted by his consuming solely focused aim hed missed things that would have filled in a lot of his empty picture one of which surely had to be that smith and monsfords lack of field experience didnt by itself justify their comparatively easy agreement to his participation the continuing foot pangs were sufficient to make him wince and with that discomfort came the further warning doubt hed already initiated the moscow incursion with his hollowvoiced messages to the numbers from which natalia had made her contact which broke the inviolable rule that every mission before commencement be separately independently vetted by experienced fieldsavvy executives hed had no reason for euphoria because he hadnt won anything charlie accepted he was caught up in something he didnt properly understand without at this precise moment any hope of finding out about which he didnt give a fuck as long as it got him to moscow monsford had called ahead and rebecca street got to the cheyne walk flat before the mi director flustered in the demanded glasses and celebratory champagne set out in readiness you wont believe what happened monsford greeted exultantly then i wont try to guess said the woman who considered the mans tooquicklystirred excitability to be immature like the haste of his lovemaking on our way to the meeting smith actually asked me to set up charlies assassination if there were a risk of his being seized by the russians did he actually use the word assassination of course not said monsford irritated at the question it was the usual maypole dance of doublespeak but it was protective assassination pure and simple what about the internal inquiry thats inevitable after charlies killed smith will deny it was ever his suggestion not when you corroborate what im telling you by her not corroborating it monsfords removal from the mi directorship would be automatic leaving her his logical successor calculated rebecca your last uncertainty has been resolved hasnt it absolutely agreed monsford what did you think of my establishing camese as the code designation for what everyone believes to be natalias extraction puerile like most of your classical allusions thought rebecca she said very clever more than clever brilliant insisted monsford janus is going to be the code for radtsics extraction everyone looking and thinking in the wrong direction brilliant agreed rebecca dutifully asshole she thought have you had andreis letter asked elana it arrived today whats the problem there isnt one id set up a contact system with the embassy that he was finding restrictive so ive scaled it down which i was going to have to do anyway when are you going to tell him whats happening when everythings finalized by the british whens that going to be very soon youre going to be briefed on a special combined operation announced monsford im appointing you supervisor of the mi contingent thank you sir accepted stephen briddle he was an intense quicktalking man nervous of his first personal encounter with the director youll learn all about the combined assignment at the general briefing this conversation is strictly between the two of us and must remain that way no one else ive chosen you because of your special clearance which might be called upon im sure you wont let me or the service down i wont sir assured briddle giving no indication of his immediate unease at the reference to special clearance this meeting is precautionary i might not need to issue the order so i wont give you any further details but i will dispatch a weapon ahead of your arrival in moscow in the diplomatic bag i understand your sole understanding at this point is that this meeting this conversation is totally classified i do understand that you are going to have a long and assured career in this service thank you sir charlie muffin disliked shared assignments that made him reliant upon others whose professional ability he didnt know and therefore couldnt trust his unease increased by the inclusion of mi as well as by his belated recognition at how quickly his personal involvement had been agreed to charlies wellhoned sensitivity to potential betrayal extended beyond the smell of a rat to being aware of them scuttling underfoot which was the instinctive impression settling upon him his general discomfort began with his am arrival not at his thames house workplace which hed expected but across the river at mis tree and shrubfestooned edifice the smokedglass car sweeping too fast through lastminuteopening steel doors into a basement garage from an unsuspected entrance a block and a half from the actual building charlie dismissed the security checks as far more perfunctory than they would have been at thames house unquestioningly following the two reimposed escorts whod steadfastly refused conversation during the journey from buckinghamshire a matching electronic warning he guessed to have opened the garage doors had obviously alerted the two men waiting for him as the elevator doors opened at last a face i recognize greeted charlie john passmore was respected within the counterintelligence agency for dropping the civilian entitlement of colonel after his transfer appointment from the sas although he continued to wear the regimental tie which didnt coordinate with the suit he was wearing today he was a reserved taciturn man who responded to charlie with a curt unsmiling nod and an immediate introduction to james straughan why am i here not across the river demanded charlie at once your own building will be under far tighter russian surveillance than usual said straughan leading the way into a directly opposite anonymously bare office and thames house doesnt have the separated entry facilities that we do bollocks thought charlie you should charge for the helterskelter approach sell candy floss to attract the customers your proposal for getting natalia and the girl out has been gone through in some detail picked up passmore the intended briskness slightly marred by an almostsuppressed stutter the instructions are to give you your head but personally i think your chances of success are extremely limited its difficult for them to be otherwise knowing as little as we do so far defended charlie it has to be governed by onthespot decisions according to the circumstances as they arise which operations are invariably insufficiently prepared inadequately planned and blow up in your face argued the exsoldier feeling out with his remaining hand to the empty left sleeve of his jacket its been sanctioned pressed charlie with reservations beyond the obvious confirmed straughan which are queried charlie apprehensively shortly youll meet your backup group disclosed straughan theyre not being told of your personal relationship to natalia or that sasha is your child its the weakest aspect of what youll be trying to do criticized passmore before charlie could respond youre team leader and because of who natalia and sasha are youll take more risks than you should theyll know and distrust that if theyre told is everything going to be independently monitored above and beyond the people im about to meet asked charlie presciently there could be gains having so many distracting people milling about passmore looked to the other operational director and straughan momentarily hesitated no but theres another reservation theres to be no maverick bullshit from you we accept theres a lot thats got to be worked out when you get there but you dont initiate anything without approval and we want your acknowledgment right now that you understand what im saying if we get the slightest suspicion youre trying to perform as a oneman band we abort everything and youll lose a wife and child the bullshit was straughans for the benefit of the inevitable protective recording charlie knew im not going to do anything to put natalia and sasha at more risk than they already are and ive already given the undertaking about diplomatic embarrassment dont for a moment forget it threatened the mi division chief ending the encounter people are waiting for us waiting or scuttling underfoot to trip him wondered charlie the briefing room was four doors away on the same level the six men already assembled at namecarded lecture desks in front of a slightly raised stage on the wall behind which were displayed the enlarged photographs of natalia and sasha at the far end of the room were visible cameraprojection facilities from which everything would be filmed after straughans domination of their introductory meeting charlie was mildly curious at passmores supervising the team briefing this was an unusually linked combination between their two services because of the importance of what had to be achieved opened the mi operations director the stutter strangely no longer pronounced each of them had been provided with a individual pack that included the maximum available information upon natalia fedova and her background within the fsb those packs were to be familiarized until their departure for their moscow flight that afternoon but would be retrieved before they left the building duplicate packs were already waiting for them at the british embassy in the residential compound of which they were all to be accommodated the duplicate packsparticularly the photographs of natalia and the childwere never to be taken outside the embassy also awaiting their collection at the embassy were russian mobile telephones through which they would liaise with their team supervisor charlie muffin that liaison had always to be through their cell phones they should never initiate contact by calling his cell phone the number of which would be in their moscow documentation from an embassy or outside landline charlie would not be accommodated at the embassy but would work from hotels between which he would move at his decision and choosing it was obviously an extraction mission the method timing and manner of which could not be decided until contact had been made with natalia fedova until the moment of extraction their function was entirely one of support at which announcement passmore hesitated again identifying those among the group responsible for finance which was to be provided internally from embassy funds and logistics those logistics were to be obtained through outside russian sources paid for in cash and not traceable in any way to the embassy or to britain each of the moscow packs was nominated by name and contained russian driving licenses in their russian cover names together with false russian passports and other necessary identity documents each had been allocated an individual code designation signaling the missions cancellation together with specific escape routes to be unquestioningly followed upon that alert they were immediately and separately to get out of the country under no circumstances whatsoever were they to risk identification or association among themselves and their team supervisor by attempting to contact charlie muffin there had to be no evidential electronicor any otherlink whatsoever throughout passmores presentation charlies attention was divided dissecting the mans every word and phrase while at the same time comparing his initial reaction as much as was visually possible against those before him patrick wilkinson was the only one of the group charlie recognized from a brief encounter at the british embassy in washington dc which had been wilkinsons first mi overseas posting the man showed no recognition although throughout most of passmores address he was looking directly at charlie as were most of the others charlie decided they were trying to assess him from his visible responses as he was trying to assess them they were uniformly bland featured an essential attentionavoiding requirement and dressed accordingly there were occasional frowns one or two nose blowings a few seat rearrangements but no nods of acceptance or headshaking disapproval nor expression of surprise or uncertainty throughout no one had taken a single reminder note youll have questions in which your team leader will participate passmore concluded overly formal at once a balding man identified by his name card as neil preston another mi man said is this woman an embedded asset both operational directors deferred to charlie who hurriedly replied she had the potential to have been i dont understand that answer protested preston she either is or she isnt its a perfectly understandable answer refused charlie she occupies a position within the fsb and before that the kgb that could provide invaluable intelligence a man named by his place setting as stephen briddle whod been picked out by passmore as the operational bag man said does that mean its uncertain whether shell provide it the uncertainty is getting them both out which it is imperative we do insisted charlie content to use the moment natalia fedovas cooperation depends entirely upon the safety and protection of the child youve indicated that im the finance officer said briddle addressing passmore it might be in my briefing pack but if it isnt is there a budget within which i have to work there were isolated sniggers among the other five at the bureaucratic demand which increased when passmore replied none but we expect receipts are these two detained in any way asked robert denning a tall but stooped man whose card identified him as an mi officer theres no indication of that avoided charlie it is something to be established when we get to moscow does any field instruction need london confirmation demanded peter warren disclosing his mi allegiance by directing the question to straughan no replied straughan without hesitation charlie has full operational authority therell need to be liaison with us here which i dont think is covered in your moscow packs so ill make you peter responsible for that particularly relaying anything that charlie wants sent okay im finding this difficult to follow preston continued to protest has she approached us to defect there are sufficient indications said charlie acknowledging the importance of separate backchannel arrangements with his known fellow officers whos her control in moscow through whom these indications have come asked wilkinson coming into the discussion again the other two men on the stage looked to charlie who hesitated anxious to get the answer right there isnt one not in moscow thats what i am going there to become ive had some prior contact sufficient to justify an operation of this size at this early stage frowned preston they were professionals charlie judged hopefully but then so was he or supposed to be there isnt time for lengthy ground planning only what i can set up which is why there is to be the separation between us until the actual moment of extraction im the only one at risk what about that extraction questioned wilkinson whom passmore had designated a logistics officer along with denning theres surely been advanced planning put into that straughan indicated the enlarged photographs behind him already at the embassy there are polish and english passports carrying those pictures you and denning have to pay locally for all transport obviously including airline tickets this is an inandout job which is why were manning it as we are mother and daughter itemized jeremy beckindale who completed the mi secondment what about the father there isnt one replied charlie prepared before the question concluded whats the likelihood of either personal or protective resistance persisted the most obviously doubtful preston none insisted charlie as quickly as before theyre not being kidnapped no extraction will be contemplated if theres the slightest possibility of violent opposition what guarantee is there of that being avoided me said charlie shortly nothing and no one moves until i press the button the room became silent passmore said all through preston said id like a much better idea of what were getting involved in so would i thought charlie we saw it all on the television relay preempted monsford as straughan entered the directors office suite i thought it went well offered harry jacobson tentatively as with stephen briddle earlier it was jacobsons first personal encounter with monsford which was unsettling in itself and he now believed hed made a bad mistake the london recall to witness the televised briefing and reinforce the physical identification of charlie muffin by flying back to moscow on the same plane had been waiting when jacobson returned to the embassy after the failed meeting with radtsic and on impulse jacobson hadnt told the director or straughan of the russians nonappearance now it was too late and there was no guarantee radtsic would keep the automatically prearranged catchup meeting to be activated on his return the majority of the others feel like preston balanced straughan id be disappointed if our people didnt but theyre not going to be involved so their uncertainties dont matter monsford shrugged he once more hadnt switched on his personal recording apparatus what about charlie himself queried jacobson hasnt he wanted more his sole interest is getting there dismissed straughan ive read his file said jacobson tapping his dossier hes unpredictable not this time insisted monsford his reasoning is knocked to hell by his one single priority getting to moscow why dont we tell radtsic the protective diversion thatll doubly guarantee his extraction unexpectedly suggested straughan is that a good idea wondered monsford with his customary reluctance to respond to an idea without first getting the opinions of everyone else it might calm radtsic down said jacobson uncomfortably im surprised every time he turns up for a meeting with no knowledge of the directors earlier encounter with stephen briddle the operations director wondered what jacobsons personal feelings must be sitting as jacobson was sitting discussing an assassination a murder that he had to commit straughan had always hoped never to be personally associated with a sanctioned killing particularly one predicated upon such tenuous reasoning as this he wished he had the courage officially to object for which there was provision in the statutory regulations natalias under surveillance by the fsb if we told radtsic he could guarantee nataliaand therefore charliebeing precisely where we want them to be for the distraction operation it would wouldnt it reflected monsford everything would be gift wrapped so well do it pressed straughan determined against being sacrificed as jane ambersom had been hed liked the woman refusing the sniping of others at her sexual uncertainty and felt guilty that his own asexuality had prevented his doing more to protect her although knowing that if shed survived he would have been the victim instead not in precise detail qualified monsford tell radtsic were setting up a failsafe extraction that hes got no reason to worry about anything going wrong and tell him im looking forward personally to welcoming him here in london it was a good feeling knowing everything was perfectly arranged with no possibility of error charlie held back in the departure lounge waiting to let the other passengers not just board ahead of him but actually get into their seats giving him the opportunity to study the faces of those traveling with him which he prolonged while finding a space in the already stuffed overhead lockers for his minimally packed suit carrier before finally sitting in his personally selected aisle seat just two rows back from the businessclass separation only when charlie completely settled did jacobson properly look up from the inflight shopping brochure for additional concealment as well as for his assigned purpose jacobson had secured a window seat only three rows behind charlies but on the opposite side of the cabin to give him an uninterrupted view of his intended target which prompted the immediate reflection of how ideal it would also be to get this close when the moment came to pull the trigger of the already skipped russian makarov in his embassy safe away from the mi building jacobsons concern at having said nothing about radtsics failed meeting had lessened no one in london or moscow apart from radtsic had known of the appointment so he couldnt be caught out on that omission jacobsons hope was that the russian wouldnt appear at the failsafe meeting sparing him from the assassination order as the flight crew began their acrobatics of emergency flight evacuation charlie was mentally evaluating the potential success against the possible failure of what he had to achieve he was encouraged by the briefing assertion of no expenditure limit realistically there was no way he could have got back to jersey to retrieve what was left of the already committed money which was why at the final departure session with straughan and passmore hed argued up the initially proposed personally carried working float to ten thousand pounds by quoting the irrefutable statistics that moscow had become the most expensive city in the world but potentially hed need considerably more the fine line he had to follow was obtaining sufficient additional money without arousing suspicion that he wasnt going to utilize any more bullshit backup than was minimally necessary which anyway might be difficult after what he planned so soon to do charlie halted the instinctive half turn behind him practically as it began at the expectation of there being one if not more puppetwatchers monitoring his every movement curious if his intended actions would be accepted as proving his professional caution which was more than passmore and straughan had illustrated with their insistence that he was being allowed operational autonomy charlie was glad hed managed the brief private conversation with john passmore before hed left the mi meeting impressed with the mans reaction jacobson had been prepared for charlies backward look the faceconcealing inflight magazine ready at the first indication which turned out to be unnecessary when charlie didnt continue easing his seat back as the plane attained its cruising height he would jacobson decided deserve recognition positive promotion after this if radtsic did turn up at the emergency rendezvous hed been disappointed at the directors vagueness at the hints hed risked every innuendo hedged with a caveat charlie put his hand to his jacket pocket feeling the hardness of the russian cell phone one of the dozen airfreighted from moscow to be technically tweaked before being returned for distribution to the backup squad upon their arrival hed retain it as an insurance but always turned off as it was now and buy himself another when he got to moscow what other personal adaptations did he need hed covered the passport changes during that brief private meeting with passmore hoping wilkinson had been properly briefed just as privately afterward and he was carrying sufficient money for his immediate needs too early to think about anything more he decided at the copilots announcement of the impending en route landing at amsterdams schipol airport charlie stood out into the aisle for his windowseated companion to get out resuming his seat at once for other disembarking passengers behind him to follow flicking through his own seat pocket sales magazine his concentration entirely upon the departing line he timed his move as the last figure disappeared from the plane standing stretching and setting off unhurriedly toward the restrooms relieved the indicator showed the farthest cubicle to be unoccupied he started to hurry only when he reached it partially opening the door but releasing it to continue on to the disembarkation pier his feet at once protesting as he bustled past those ahead of him still in his seat jacobson had craned around the businessclasscurtain separation to see charlie approach the toilet door just before his view was blocked again by a steward moving to greet arriving dutch passengers who filled the aisle for several minutes locating their seats and stowing their baggage by the time they had finished jacobson was standing awkwardly between the seats looking to the toilets the occupancy indicator showed the farthest to be the only one in use several more minutes passed before the door opened for a woman to emerge at that moment the aircraft doors thumped closed hampered as they were by not knowing precisely what time of day or night they would be making the journey jonathan miller stretched the reconnaissancecar journeys from paris to orly airport over a fortyeighthour time frame into which he fitted six trips to establish an average driving himself back to the city on their final run albert abrahams hunched over his clipboard in the passenger seat said without looking up never exceeding the speed limit to ensure against traffic violations and building in an additional thirty minutes for unanticipated problems it gives us two and a half hours during the day two at night well include a backup car against engine breakdown decided miller whens straughan going to give us andreis pickup schedule from all the guidance were getting from london theyre expecting us to snatch the guy off the street straughan told me well get it all in good time including personal contact with the kid himself hell need to meet us know us in advance wont he ive made the point straughan says its all in hand you been involved in an extraction before once ten years ago in rome his cover was third secretary at the russian embassy turned out he was abandoning his wife for his mistress he backed off confronting embassy diplomats at a consularaccess negotiation and went back to his wife without telling us anything whatsoever of value lets hope this one goes better thats all we can ever do hope it all works out said the mi station chief you fancy the brassiere lipp for lunch after two days and nights of sandwiches we deserve nothing less agreed abrahams apart that is from a hell of a lot more information what there was close to physical pain as well as disbelief in gerald monsfords voice and straughan hoped the director had been engaged in a difficult athletic performance with rebecca to cause it charlie slipped jacobson in amsterdam simply walked off the plane thats not possible thats what happened why didnt you patch jacobson through to me from moscow the moscow embassy is secure but we dont transfer calls to your home straughan paused savoring the exchange your specific instructions tell me exactly what happened demanded monsford the loudness lessening charlie was as unpredictable as ever began straughan stringing out the pleasure although acknowledging there was an endangering hole in his own protection charlie specified a seat and jacobson managed to get just a couple of rows behind from there he had the perfect physical identification charlie stowed his suit carrier and appeared to settle for the flight to moscow he didnt make a move until after the amsterdam passengers got off and only then appeared to go to the toilet jacobson lost sight for just a few seconds as new passengers got on the toilet light stayed on in the confusion of people getting onand theres a separating curtain between business and economyjacobson missed charlie leaving the toilet and someone else going in jacobson stayed in his fucking seat didnt get out to walk up and down the aisle exercising like everyone does so far so good judged straughan hopefully charlie left his luggage in an overhead locker and you didnt have a backstop established in amsterdam airport precisely to ensure that something like this didnt happen no admitted straughan the paperthin defense ready why not you and jacobson watched and heard me warn him against doing anything like this trying to show how clever he is struggled the operations director thats all hes doing trying to prove his streetwise independence but he cant hes got to get to moscow which means using the covername passport weve provided and hes got to contact the embassy sooner or later to get the phoney passports for natalia and the child hes just getting his rocks off like a schoolboy masturbating for the first time why didnt the cabin crew realize they were a passenger short i dont know and cant ask said straughan charlie gambled and won after the briefest silence monsford his voice loud again said you havent finished the story i dont follow protested straughan glad his own voice didnt waver what did jacobson do when he realized hed lost charlie there was nothing he could do the aircraft doors had closed tried straughan weakly what about the suit carrier now the silence was straughans as he sought an escape not finding one he said raising an alarm would have compromised jacobsons connection with charlie the suit carrier will have been found upon arrival at moscow which will alert the airline and the russian authorities that the plane arrived short of a passenger set out monsford his voice rising even further the obvious backwards check will be at amsterdam wholl cooperate with the russians because theyve no reason not to and with whom we cant intercede the flight will have had a namedpassenger manifest and the boarding pass will have recorded a seat number from which the russians will learn the cover name we allocated the stupid motherfucker which additionally will be publicly disclosed in the inevitable publicity of a disappearing passenger from a moscowbound flight monsford paused a torturer practicing his art you spotted anything ive missed out so far hes attracting attention to himself which is madness argued straughan it makes no sense the way youre analyzing it it makes each and every sense rejected monsford the fsb are expecting him to come hes actually told them for christs sake with the telephone calls which hes supposed to be a distraction broke in straughan i hadnt finished threatened monsford by creating his own diversion hes making it quite clear that he doesnt trust anything weve put in place as backup at the moment hes not working against the russians hes working against us as were working against him thought straughan amazed at the other mans total hypocrisy he cant get his wife and daughter out without us and we dont have our diversion to get radtsic and his wife out tell jacobson to call me at noon our time tomorrow hes got a meeting with radtsic at noon tomorrow as soon as possible afterwards allowed monsford i wont have this fall apart monsford says charlies telling us our planning is crap said aubrey smith he caught me by myself after yesterdays meeting said passmore asked me to prepare russian passports for natalia and sasha with russian exit visas as well as british entry documentation covering the next month he wants them sent covertly to wilkinson at the embassy cutting out mi i briefed wilkinson to expect the package charlie doesnt trust his own shadow he tries hard not even to cast one guessed passmore ive read your memo complaining at not being included in the early planning said aubrey smith why wasnt i its a stucktogether operation i opposed our ever going into moscow until i couldnt prevent it becoming exclusively mi with charlie seconded to them so you agreed to it being joint smith hesitated i couldnt let it go to monsford could i ive never controlled charlie on an operation said passmore an objective rather than a responsibilityavoiding remark what do you expect him to do smith shrugged god only knows hell go of course but the cover name will be blown to the russians from the flight information even if it doesnt become public through the media ive already checked the news wires as well as the amsterdam and moscow newspapers said passmore its not public so far its too early therell be something by tonight so hes got another passport accepted passmore probably connected with the trip to jersey agreed smith the bit he didnt tell us about he was taken straight to the buckinghamshire lodge the morning he reappeared after jersey yes smith frowned questioningly was he searched as the first safe house in chelsea was searched confirmed smith understanding the question he didnt have a passport with him nor was there one in buckinghamshire and direct from buckinghamshire he was brought here to london for the briefings and after that immediately taken to the moscow flight yes said smith what about luggage his suit carrier left on the plane we brought everything up to the lodge from chelsea hes got to get back here to england predicted the former sas man and to do that hell have to use the cover passport until he can make the switch to whatever else hes got i want to issue a passport watch on the cover name extend it to jersey ordered smith thats where he could have it what do we do when we pick him up ill decide that when we get him and if we dont then we cant do anything other than follow his lead and the russian passport he asked for smith hesitated prepare it as charlie wants i dont trust monsford either all harry jacobsons fragile reassurances had gone compounded by the breach of tradecraft that he hadnt properly taken into account until now when he was actually making his way to the failsafe rendezvous with maxim radtsic it was an inviolable rule in defector extractions that no target meetings should ever be at the same place twice and theyd already met once before at the rivercruise terminal jacobson had agreed to its emergency use only because unprofessionally hed never expected it to be necessary jacobsons most obvious fear was that he was walking blindly into an fsb entrapment almost equaled by the apprehension that radtsic had lost his already overstretched nerve and wouldnt turn up a second time which added to his infantile airplane loss of charlie muffin would inevitably mean his dismissal from the service jacobson arrived almost an hour early at the klenovy boulevard terminal scouring every approach as he had at the previous failed meeting place for the slightest indication of an ambush having failed to find one he positioned himself at the highest possible vantage point above the pier his concentration upon the throng of embarking and disembarking passengers seeking closetogether groups or gatherings of people who did not fit the tourist profile and failed again to locate anything that triggered his suspicion jacobson rigidly followed radtsics trailclearing insistence of boarding fifteen minutes ahead of the russian stationing himself at the rail overlooking the gangway to ensure radtsic wasnt followed so tensed was jacobson that the skin of his arms tingled at the slight pressure of his leaning against the rail and he was overly aware of people close to him twitching away from the briefest contact ten minutes until departure jacobson saw where the hell was radtsic he should have been here by now visible on the pier to ensure there was no surveillance so why wasnt he because he wasnt going to show jacobson answered himself hed panicked or been found out or lost his nerve all or any of which could mean his arrest or an attack and then god knows there he was snatched jacobson at the first sighting and making no effort to merge into his tourist surroundings the barrelchested swarthy maxim radtsic was wearing a collar and tie with his threepiece business suit shouldering his way through the lastminute boarders and jacobsons relief was tempered by the thought of the other still unresolved danger jacobson continued to observe the russians precautions delaying an approach for fifteen minutes after departure for the russian to complete the same check on him as he moved around the boat and even then not until radtsic gave the signal that he was satisfied they were both clear todays sign was again to discard an empty cigarette packet into the moskva river a gesture fitting the chainsmoking habit that had developed since the russians first approach what the hell happened greeted jacobson as he got alongside the other man there was a personal problem said radstic not looking sideways the hand holding the cigarette was shaking creating an almost constant avalanche of ash what problem elana what about her shes losing her nerve doesnt want to come are you coming without her radtsic gave jacobson a frowned sideways look of course not what then ive persuaded her but its got to be soon now were setting up a diversion want you to be involved at the very end you can be the person who makes sure it works by concentrating attention away from you and elana how were sending someone in as a decoy for your people to follow lured jacobson radtsic surely had to know about the attempted fsb entrapment of charlie muffin even if the man was elevated way above operational activity how repeated the other man itll involve your service when it happens jacobson hedged further whats my involvement you have operational oversight dont you not in a planning stage there are progress submission and reviews there hasnt been anything about a potential english situation radtsic properly looked at jacobson for the first time are you trying to trick me no denied jacobson meeting the look ive told you its all going to work just as you want it doesnt sound right im not tricking you maxim mikhailovich im guaranteeing everything and more than youve asked for why was it all going wrong despaired jacobson in less than twentyfour hours hed been made to look an amateur by a downatheel dinosaur and now he was a hairsbreadth from losing the biggest catch in mi history i need to think you need to trust me trust that im telling you the truth i need to think the russian repeated doggedly lets meet tomorrow urged jacobson anxiously check your ongoing operational planning involving the british with so much going wrongbeing misunderstoodhe darent risk actually mentioning charlie muffin and natalia fedova until he talked to london and learned whether theyd found the bastard here again at noon maxim it should be somewhere else here insisted the older man here capitulated jacobson it could be a onenight stand said jonathan miller staring down at the photographs albert abrahams had laid out before him i established the surveillance the day we got the assignment if you look more closely shes wearing three different outfits leaving and entering the apartment over three different days i ran a check at the sorbonne shes registered at the same address with the same telephone number as andrei theyre on the same course perhaps this will put a finger up straughans ass get him to answer all our other questions to all our other uncertainties this is the one that could really fuck everything up id never have worked that out if you hadnt told me there seemed to be no part of charlie muffins body that didnt ache his feet of course caused the worst agony by the time he got back to london he was hobbling so badly that an airport driver returning from taking a disabled passenger to a flight offered charlie a lift on his empty cart which charlie gratefully accepted deciding that the privilege attracted far less attention than the way he was walking despite all of which charlie was happy so fara long way in opportunity if not necessarily in milesreversing the terms of engagement to his personal control was working hed been lucky charlie accepted bloody lucky but there again hed made most of that luck himself the biggest gamble had been the moment hed fled the plane hed built in most of the contingency protection he could anticipate pausing in the amsterdam arrival hall to take the battery from the russian phone to prevent his being traced by any tracker device installed in london but still leaving open his expectation of unknown escorts on the plane that there hadnt been added to his suspicion of a separate agenda of which he was unaware further supported by there having been no passport questioning upon his reentry into heathrow triggered by watchers having alerted the aircraft crew of his disappearance charlie estimated that had given him at least two maybe as much as four hours runaway time hed used some of it buying toiletries and a holdall in which to carry them before purchasing a closing gate ticket on the lastoftheday dutch airline flight back to london which hed established to be half empty while selecting his escape seat at heathrow three hours earlier the holdall provided just enough luggage for him to be accepted without question at a fiftypoundanight thinwalled room in a waterloo station hotel hed still ached although not as badly when he woke he no longer shuffled just walked slowly to get to a conveniently close internet cafe by nine fifteen it took less than another thirty minutes of concentrated google surfing to assemble a selection of holiday companies offering short russian tours and even less to find one in manchester eager enough to retain its newly acquired franchiseand full payment in cash to which he agreedto allocate him one of their three remaining vacancies on an eightday blockvisa trip to the russian capital by eleven charlie had emptied the harrods safe deposit box of his david merryweather passport and international driving license and used the accompanying american express card in the same name to buy a suit trousers shirts and underwear as well as a suitcase additional to the holdall to carry it all from experience he held back from risking new shoes to which his awkward feet would have needed to adapt charlies train arrived precisely on time in manchester enabling him to be one of the first of the tour group independently to reach the airport muriel the russianspeaking tour guide said she was sorry the cost dictated that it had to be a basic economy night flight i took a chance accepting you as i did but we need to maintain our booking numbers what chance was that queried charlie apprehensively adding you to the block visa were supposed to supply the names a week before the embassy requires master copies the apprehension lifted like mist in the sun which charlie prepared to sacrifice his merryweather identity decided to be shining down upon him here it is malcolm stoat the girl queried that wasnt the name i thought you gave me on the telephone it was a very bad line i had difficulty hearing a lot of what you said to me and youve already got a visa she said opening the passport i didnt know anything about block visas lied charlie i thought i had to arrange my own it does mean youre not taking any chances doesnt it i suppose i should add your name to my list perhaps you should and im really sorry its a night flight ill try to sleep said charlie which he did dreamlessly by comparison gerald monsfords day had been a continuous waking nightmare your futures hanging by a thread threatened the mi director the moment his demanded connection was made to moscow because of you the entire operations in jeopardy you realized that if only you knew how jeopardized it really had been thought jacobson with respect sir you were present throughout my entire london briefing at which it was specified that the sole purpose of my recall was thoroughly to study and memorize charlie muffins appearance nothing more it was also specified at that briefing that every conceivable aspect of the operation was being supervised and handled by others from whom i was separated and with whom i under no circumstance would or should have any knowledge or contact because of the particular function i have to perform to create the diversion at the moment of radtsics extraction from which i understood there were to be others of whom i had no knowledge carrying out inflight surveillance and that there would be protective surveillance in place at the known stopover at schipol the meticulously prepared defense momentarily silenced monsford increasing the mans fury but in turn fogging his reasoning you could have alerted the crew jacobson hoped he timed his answering silence to the millisecond i was traveling as an ordinary economyclass passenger whyor howshould i have been monitoring another supposedly ordinary economyclass passenger who might only have been booked to amsterdam closely enough to spot his disappearance had i raised an alarm the departure would have been stopped because security would have insisted the aircraft be searched and all hold baggage unloaded and i as the person who raised the alert would have been publicly identified and even worse put before a televised news conference if my diplomatic cover withstood investigation the exposure would have been prevented by continuing with the diversion mission monsford knew his continuing frustration was suffusing his face and was glad hed taken the call entirely alone with neither rebecca nor straughan as witnesses with determination monsford accepted defeat tell me about radtsic hes falling apart said jacobson enjoying the screwturning elana changed her mind about defecting he claims hes persuaded her to change it back again but im worried what are you suggesting asked monsford anxiously monsford couldnt handle the pressure jacobson suddenly realized im not suggesting anything im simply keeping you informed of a dangerously uncertain situation you must have formed some ideas im not sure if were not trying to achieve too much guaranteeing the extraction of radtsic and his family by making a distraction out of that of charlie muffin and his family again jacobson tried perfectly to time the pause particularly as we appear to have lost charlie muffin how much he would have savored using jacobson instead of charlie as the abouttodie decoy mused monsford you seriously believe we could lose radtsic id put that possibility as high as seventyfive percent if we dont get him out soon then we cant change course all our preparation is irrevocably interlinked we dont have charlie muffin to interlink him risked jacobson hes got to reestablish contact declared monsford clinging to the earlier insistence of james straughan once he does everything slots back into place we wont know what charlies been doing jacobson pointed out from what straughan told me yesterday in london there was suspicion from charlies interrogation after his return from jersey that hed been a longembedded russian sleeper what if he was turned the trip to jersey was to meet an fsb control to fulfill an assignment we havent any idea about that would slot in even more perfectly with natalias pleading telephone calls so soon after charlies jersey return wouldnt it it couldnt be groped monsford anguished hed done everything he couldand moreto promote himself as the architect of it all did you tell radtsic the use to which we were putting charlie he couldnt better have managed the exchange if hed personally scripted and rehearsed it thought jacobson i told him there was to be a diversion without telling him what it was to be and i didnt mention charlie muffin by name you get the slightest suspicion that radtsic knows whats happening to natalia none replied jacobson but hed have to know if charlies disappearance and the sudden emergence of natalia is part of a russian operation hed have to hold back from taking this improvisation too far hed completely escaped censure whens your next meeting jacobson hesitated unsure if he needed the protection of an indeterminate answer deciding that he didnt he said simply tomorrow dont say anything more about a diversion ordered monsford but listen hard to everything he says for anything that doesnt sound right hed risen like a phoenix not just unsinged but smelling of roses jacobson decided sweeter than roses even what demanded monsford as the operational director came into his suite for the second time that day from the oddly cowed way the director was slumped behind his desk straughan thought monsford looked like a bull mastiff that had lost its nerve the media fanfare is in full tune it started in amsterdam obviously it was picked up in moscowrunning on the news wiresand the evening standard has jumped on it here their frontpage headline is moscowbound briton in airport disappearance the story covers the whole spectrum from assassination to kidnap to spy plot in no particular order they using charlies cover name demanded monsford straightening slightly from his withdrawn shell of course they are confirmed straughan its my guess that charlie intended the publicity which will build up when there are no answers to all the questions that are being asked our concern has to be that it concentrates attention on moscow jacobson doesnt think we can run the operation as we planned now that weve lost charlie said the director we cant not until we find him agreed straughan close to impatience at the statement of the obvious curious what the mans reaction would be he added theres something else what repeated monsford slumping back into his defeatist posture the son andrei hes living with another student a french girl named yvette paruch theyre on the same course whats your point getting him here without yvette screaming kidnap telling him whats happening giving him the chance to prepare himself you mean id prefer that to trying an unexpected snatch what if he doesnt want to come would he regard his father as a traitor that is my point said straughan once more close to impatience too many things are going wrong we dont want a difficulty with andrei becoming another one it can only come from radtsic jacobsons seeing him tomorrow do i tell jacobson to fix it pressed straughan determined it should be the directors decision give me a choice of proposals ordered monsford as he wiped his mothers mouth after feeding her that night straughan said hes looking for a way to avoid direct personal responsibility but im not going to let him im not going to carry the can anymore you mark my words and the old lady who didnt any longer know how to mark or even say words stared unseeingly into a world in which only she lived charlies dreamless sleep didnt last the entire flight just sufficiently for the aching finally to disappear despite the seat limitations he straightened with antennaprompted awareness at the first change in the engine pitch the initial priority to study the rest of the tourist group with whom hed had no proper contact in manchester charlie didnt foresee any practical use from being part of it apart from the initial prebooked hotel accommodation but in the entirely unplanned thiniced circumstances hed created for himself it was impossible to anticipate anything he might need there were sixteen other people in the party predominantly couples apart from three teenage girls in addition to muriel whose surname he discovered to be simpson and whom he guessed to be in her early twenties she was sitting next to him when he awoke you really did need to sleep didnt you she greeted she was an auburnhaired smallfeatured woman who clearly believed her bust was her most attractive feature judging from the upthrusting bra in which it was encased beneath a companyadvertising tshirt ive been working flat out to get a project almost to closure said charlie deciding to introduce an already determined insurance for what was soon to follow what sort of project she asked predictably one that means a lot to me said charlie i can trust your discretion cant i id hope so said the woman smiling at being taken into a confidence youve heard of russian oligarch billionaires settling in england of course the expectant smile broadened ive made a particular study of russian architecture got this commission to build a pavilion completely in the prerevolutionary style in the grounds of his sussex estate for one of the bestknown i cant of course tell you his name of course not she agreed dropping the smile to indicate her seriousness if i get this right itll open every door ive studied all the photographs and all the pictured art work spent some time in st petersburg ive snatched at this trip to confirm the styles that ive followed i can understand the importance of that im telling you now to warn you that im going to skip most of your trips for the first time there was a frown the firms responsible for the people in this group you dont have to worry about me soothed charlie with openfaced sincerity how are you going to get around by yourself charlie hesitated anxious to keep the invention as unquestionable as possible i studied russian at university speak it pretty well the smile came back broader than before which university the eagerness warned charlie was russian your university module its why im doing this job postgraduate i want to speak it perfectly eventually to get a diplomatic job which university asked charlie turning her question back upon the girl manchester obviously bristol escaped charlie on their overhead panel the fastenseatbelt sign came on the signal for the copilots landing announcement i hope you get what you want in moscow said muriel im determined i will charlie promised himself charlie rehearsed for the contradictions of a night arrival the time of the fewest incoming flights carrying the fewest number of passengers among whom to hide from the fewest number of airport immigration officers and hopefully from the constantly openeyed cctv which in the case of moscows sheremetyevo while far less than the orwellian intrusion of england still had to be guarded against he scanned as much of the cabin as it was possible to see beyond his own tourist party and concluded his luck was holding with three of themtwo men one big enough to be monsfords twin and a womanremaining the tallest and the heaviest he got close behind them as they got onto the disembarkation pier and muriel unwittingly helped by shifting back and forth a shepherdess keeping her easily strayed flock tight together charlie switched his attention between the tallstatured three and one of the smallest women in the group maneuvering her unevenly wheeled suitcase to give him the excuse to bend away from the easily spotted cameras his most exposed moment came at the passport booth which he guarded against as best he could by fumbling through his cabin baggage holdall close to his face for his touristgroup documentation aware of the watchful muriel on the far side as he was passed through unchallenged charlie judged his other danger point the cameramonitored registration desk at the rossiya hotel on the ulitsa razina and again used the burly trio the monsford lookalike predominantly as well as his faceobscuring holdall the prebooked accommodation put muriel in the next room to his and she paused directly in front of him handing over the key im responsible for everyone in the party to make sure no one breaks the rules dont get me into trouble okay ive never got a girl into trouble said charlie acknowledging as he spoke that it was yet another lie would he be able to make contact with natalia later today when moscow woke up he wondered heathrow four hours after the departure of charlies moscow flight declared john passmore positively confirmed aubrey smith demanded the mi operations director shook his head assessed at the moment at seventyfive percent if its charlie hes bloody good it was the last klm flight of the day weve got two possible cctv shots in each of which hes shielded even at the passport check technical are doing their best to enhance and work out height and weight charlie is bloody good acknowledged the mi directorgeneral no help from passport recognition passmore shook his head again if we get enough to harden up the heathrow images ill circulate charlies picture to airportbased special branch its a shotgun effort to shoot down a sparrow but it might tell us when charlie goes out of the country again if he hasnt already left qualified smith if hes already left itll give us a potential arrival to warn moscow ive had three buckpassing calls from monsford stressing that charlies our responsibility disclosed smith straughan bought me lunch capped passmore the supposedly finest aberdeen angus at the reform which unfortunately was overcooked smith smiled and at one stage i thought he was inferring that wed colluded had some foreknowledge even of charlies vanishing act whats your reading from that panic above and beyond any sensible concern assessed passmore straughans focus was mostly upon whether charlie really had been turned all those years ago i had to agree the sequence of events from charlies disappearance supported that doubt whats the doubt im hearing in your voice right now picked out smith i dont believe this is the combined operation its supposed to be openly admitted passmore you suspect im keeping something more from you demanded smith matching the openness are you thats an insubordinate presumptuous inference declared smith the habitual quietness of his voice reducing the intended indignation and thats an avoiding answer i lost an arm and a career because my superiors didnt tell me the whole truth rejected passmore feeling across to his empty left side i dont want to lose whatever career im trying to establish in this shadowshifting environment to which i still obviously havent adjusted through the same default to prevent which id prefer to resign aubrey smith sat with his head bowed contemplating the totally unexpected turn in the conversation finally looking up he said id hoped my apology for not being completely honest was sufficient i respect and admire your integrity and want to convince you of mine i have kept nothing more of this operation from you if there is a hidden aspect i am as unaware of it as you are now it was passmore who lapsed into silence for a moment good arm once more crossed to where his other had once been im convinced theres something else i havent the slightest evidence for the suspicion beyond instinct but from some of the things straughan said i believe theres a something being kept from us if it is were being set up to be scapegoats which i wont let us be refused smith emptied by what he saw as the confirmation of what hed feared since this current episode had begun how then do we prevent it wondered the operations director managing independent contact with charlie could help who could be following the same instinct by doing what hes done as well as asking for those separate passports suggested passmore harry jacobson nervously lengthened his reconnaissance at the ferry terminal the knot in the very pit of his already hollowed stomach tightening further in his despair of ever properly ensuring there wasnt a snatch squad in the ebb and flow of people he was scouring for the first glimpse of maxim radtsic hoping against hope that once more the man wouldnt appear and that the operation would be aborted before it even began it wasnt just the apprehension of becoming the victim of an fsb counterplot that convinced jacobson the russians extraction was doomed he was equally worried by the accumulated recognition that in the questionably professional planning there were far too many unforeseeable abyssdeep pitfallsthe unexpected discovery of andrei radtsics livein girlfriend the latestin what had been conceived more like a tinsoldiered makebelieve war game commanded by incompetents safe in their london riverside bunkers now the game could be over before it even began because the most undisciplined tin soldier hadnt obeyed orders leaving him if the analogy was continued the first of the other tin soldiers likely to fall if it was all an fsb entrapment jacobson reluctantly acknowledged that his alternative walking away and lying that radtsic hadnt turned up wasnt feasible the chances of the fsb executive director approaching another western intelligence agency the cia the most likely were too great and if the man did and there was eventual publicity his career in mialready hanging by a thread according to monsfords most recent diatribewould be over but he didnt need to lie he realized finally identifying the stalin lookalike barging his way through the shifting melee below jacobson observed the postsailingsurveillance precautions minimally encouraged at isolating no one showing undue interest in either of them eventually following the russian into a windowed observation lounge that provided a panoramic view of the redwalled startowered kremlin as the ferry made its slow way parallel along the river the view kept everyone on the fortress side leaving the farthest section of the observation room free for jacobson and radtsic you had time to settle everything with elana opened jacobson choosing a gradual leadup in the hope of limiting radtsics reaction to andreis romance i think so said the older man although uncertainly has she really changed her mind back again agreed to come yes the uncertainty was still there contrary to which the nervousness wasnt as visible today jacobson saw as they were constantly intent upon their surroundings even the chainsmoking seemed less what about you you happier with everything than you were i still dont understand the delay protested the russian why cant we go right now tomorrow why cant we make it tomorrow tell me about andrei avoided jacobson taking the obvious opening why are you bringing him into the conversation the russian frowned how do you think hell react at suddenly learning whats happening i want to talk to you about that make sure theres a proper safe proposal thats the sort of care im trying to convince you were taking maybe i overreacted earlier they were drifting away from what needed to be talked about jacobson recognized you didnt tell me how you thought andrei might react itll be all right when he settles down understands the kremlin was disappearing as the boat took the first bend in the river and people began spreading themselves more evenly around the enclosed lounge lessening their isolation its the very beginning the moment it happens that i want to discuss whats the problem demanded radtsic at once stopping with an unlit cigarette suspended before him were making plans to get andrei out but weve discovered hes in a relationship what are you talking about what relationship the cigarette remained unlighted a girl a fellow student french radtsic finally fired the cigarette smiling slightly hes a fullblooded russian you knew then no whats there to know she doesnt appear to be a casual girlfriend theyre living together what the russians surprise was genuine gauged jacobson everythings got to be very quick once the extraction starts no unexpected complications whats most important is avoiding any interference from the french authorities i told you andrei needed to be warned reminded radtsic how often are you in contact exchange letters or talk on the phone im sure all my telephones are monitored that my mail is being intercepted ive told you that i also told you andrei wouldnt accept messages through an intermediary ive brought a pocket tape recorder said jacobson he knows your voice make a recording telling him to trust the person who brings it to him that he must do what that person tells him radtsic shook his head his inhalations now coming with chainsmoking regularity youre not listening to me hell think its a trick or something made under duress how then maxim asked jacobson desperately tell me how elana announced the russian shell have to be got out first ahead of me through paris youll have to coordinate their extraction together with mine here will she be allowed to travel i have the authority to approve it youve told me youre being watched that your telephones tapped and your mail opened argued jacobson your approving elanas travel would trigger every alarm its me theyre monitoring not elana thered be a period a few days before the connection was made jacobson suspected that radtsic was trying to force the pace and didnt blame the man it actually improved the russians control of events and if elana was already out of the country it greatly reduced the chances of her suddenly changing her mind once in france shed be committed with no way back and so would radtsic ill put it to london see if theyll accept it as an alternative to what theyre putting in place now i can put everything in motion within two days promised the russian eagerly dont ordered jacobson just as urgently youve got to wait for londons approval prepare whatever preliminaries are necessary but dont positively initiate anything not until we meet again and maxim what not here never again here at the terminal where instead insurance time jacobson thought at once youve got my private number call tomorrow at noon from a public phone ill give you the location then will you have spoken to london by noon tomorrow about a lot of things confirmed jacobson jane ambersom was an intelligent woman who acknowledged her instinctive aggression to be a failing just as she recognized its underlying psychological cause to be an ingrained resentment at her androgenic confusion and she was further annoyed at her inability sufficiently to curb it her sexuality in fact was entirely and eagerly female which added frustration to the resentment shed endured relationships at university that never went beyond a onenight stand and been hopeful of an affair when shed first joined mi until too demandingly again shed maneuvered her lover into a choice which hed made by returning to his wife as shed ascended the intelligenceservice ladder and come under increased internalsecurity scrutiny shed subjugated sexuality for professional advancement which shed quite correctly doubted would have resulted from her submitting to gerald monsfords clumsy experimental pawing in his conveniently constructed bedroom suite adjoining his office since her transfer to mi and her foreignliaison appointment she had become extremely hopeful of barry elliott even seeing in her rarely allowed fantasies a somewhat strained parallel with charlie muffin and natalia fedova so far their encounters although social had remained strictly although not quite formally professional hed volunteered that he was neither married nor in a relationship and twice instead of restaurant encounters had suggested artgallery meetingsthe national and tate modernwhere shed discovered he enjoyed the same artists it was upon his recommendation that in less than two weeks and three novels shed become a committed elmore leonard fan lunch that day was at joe allens which shed initially feared shed have to cancel because of charlie muffins disappearance until the directorgeneral told her there was no practical reason to remain at thames house elliott as usual was considerately there ahead of her and stood to help her into her chair with her preferred rioja already uncorked he didnt immediately embark upon a sharedinterest discussion which was something else that jane preferred but talked of a planned weekend shakespeare festival in stratford having enjoyed his first visit to the rebuilt globe theatre in london it wasnt until they were well into their main course that elliott came to the official reason for the encounter and afterward jane was quite sure shed not overreacted to his unexpected return to their earlier discussion those transcript excerpts of irena novikovs debriefing have given us more problems than answers i dont understand hedged jane theres a lot of disparities between what she appears to have told you and what shes telling us we think shes stalling shes appearing to cooperate which is the deal for her remaining in our protection program but langley suspects shes giving us the runaround and theres a lot of access pressure from the russian embassy in washington ive given you all i was allowed we want fuller versions to check in more detail against what she told your guy charlie muffin he spent a lot of time with her in moscow didnt he i dont think it was a lot of time qualified jane my understanding was that she persistently lied to him trying to save the russian operation right up to the moment he caught her out theres nothing of how he caught her out in what youve given me ill raise it promised jane an idea growing in her mind wed appreciate that maybe i could get an idea from langley about what shes telling them to offer in return i like stratford risked jane in a complete change of direction know it quite well elliott looked at her across the table half smiling why dont you show me around there why dont i jane smiled back you wont forget the comparison debriefings will you of course i wont despite the boardhard rossiya bed charlie managed a further two hours sleep deciding initially to continue with the touristgroup concealment gambling that this soon there wouldnt be an fsb connection between an inadvertent airport cctv picture and the malcolm stoat name in the hotel register and the amsterdam flight passenger list the broken day began with a breakfastroom gettingtoknowyou gathering and a short and vaguely embarrassing promise of an experience of a lifetime from muriel simpson complete with the distribution of the groups intended itinerary and an overflow of brochures maps and information sheets all of which charlie collected for later use charlies discomfort came within minutes of taking his designated place on the coach with the seatlifting arrival beside him of the towering man behind whom hed hopefully hidden for the earlier airport arrival wilfred todd introduced the man in an echoing voice matching his size and a knucklecrunching handshake looking forward to our getting together your being an architect and all that your line of business probed charlie his stomach dipping at the possibility of his ignorance being exposed my lad john qualifies next june hell be looking for a better position then could be theres some openings with your firm becoming the focus of an overly ambitious father was an encumbrance he didnt need but about which he could do little except perhaps store whatever transpired for later as yet unknown use strictly adhering to the story hed invented for muriel charlie toned down his fiction of billionaire russian oligarchs while stressing that his was a particularly refined architectural expertise unsuited to a newly qualified entrant an englishspeaking russian guide took over from muriel for the exploration of st basils cathedral in red square and charlie retreated to the back of the russians brusquely assembled group where muriel put herself i thought what we spoke about my slipping away was between the two of us it was and is replied the woman all i said was that you had a particular architectural interest that wouldnt interest the rest of them to account in advance to the rest of the group for your slopping off and i did that to protect myself my job and the company for which i want to go on working okay okay and im sorry if i sounded tetchy sorry is something i hope not to be by your being on the tour said the girl im going now warned charlie refusing a response ill catch up later charlie used the camouflage of other milling tourists to get off red square despite the impracticality of cctv over such a vast area his mind sifting the unresolved uncertainties natalias approach being the biggest of them all and startlingly came up with the answer of course he knew why natalia had made the calls to his flat in the manner and way she had the way shed expected him to comprehend it gave him his allimportant justshortofperfect start he hoped it would all continue that way recognizing that the slightest changing breeze was psychologically important in the survival battle in which he believed himself embroiled aubrey smith gained the first advantage not just by insisting the mi contingent cross the river to thames house but by doing so reversed gerald monsfords de facto takeover to reinforce that reversal smith staged the conference in a corner room of mis headquarters with the fullest view of the mi building opposite and warned in advance that john passmore and jane ambersom would attend knowing monsford would match them with rebecca street and james straughan they arrived fifteen minutes early reflecting their subordination from which monsford at once attempted to recover charles muffin has very positively shown his allegiance to the russians by what hes done i want confirmation that this meeting is being fully recorded for production in any future official inquiry into the cooperation between our two services of course a record is being kept assured the mi directorgeneral pricking the bombast ill be interested to hear your proof that muffins allegiance is to russia what other interpretation is possible demanded the mi counterpart there were shifts of uncertainty from rebecca street and the mi operations director how about something as mundane as his not trusting that hed arrive safely in moscow suggested smith satisfied how well monsfords attitude suited his intentions its his wife and child whose extraction were working to achieve our entire focused objective or at least what i believed it to be until now monsford said is it demanded smith shortly there was a moment of silence disturbed only by more discomfited chair fidgeting before monsford the belligerence fading said i dont understand that remark and i cant expand it beyond saying that im curious at some what inconsistencies i suppose the inconsistency is that of your officer with whom i mistakenly agreed to a combined operation my recollection which will be confirmed by earlier records is that the urging came more from you than me which is one of the inconsistencies ive mentioned what are you suggesting demanded monsford the belligerence flaring im not suggesting anything again deflated smith im becoming confused at the purpose of this conference rebecca street protested with strained impatience are we supposed to be discussing the future of the operation in which charlie muffin was involved or talking in riddles at smiths gesture john passmore said its a limited disappearance which isnt a riddle weve established a potential sighting of charlie returning to heathrow airport on a klm flight four hours after he got off the moscow plane in amsterdam by potential i mean it wasnt positive facial recognition were making the surmise by forensically making the comparison from weight height and general stature in the cctv image those physical statistics and a slightly better photographic image although again facially insufficient matched a differently dressed man caught on cctv entering manchester airport late yesterday evening compared against the registered timing of that manchester cctv photograph there was one direct manchester flight to moscow and three staged at heathrow en route to other destinations from which connecting flights from london to moscow could have been possible what about a confirming manifest name broke in james straughan im sure youve monitored the dutch publicity about charlies disappearance replied passmore his voice as calm as smiths wed risk a publicity leak if we made a formal approach to an airline other than british we didnt get our checks in place in time to flag up an alert on charlies legend name before the departure of the direct manchester flight or any of the possible transit links weve checked the manifests that are safe for us to access the name malcolm stoat doesnt appear although theres a glitch with a block visa on which a tourist group traveled from manchester are you reasoning that he staged the whole thing to get back to london to pick up a stashed alternative identity seized straughan professionally thats the most obvious interpretation agreed the other operations director and a confirmation that hes a double agent came in monsford or that he didnt trust going into moscow by our route smith argued back doesnt that amount to the same thing challenged monsford no refused the other director it could equally mean he had a facility to change the pseudonym and decided on a different route for better selfprotection which doesnt deviate from the agreed plan that to get natalia and sasha out he still has at some stage to make contact with everyone and everything weve established at the embassy are you proposing we just sit back and wait for the bloody man to reappear as and when he chooses demanded monsford incredulously do you have a better suggestion prompted smith it was straughan professional again who answered travel companies take block tourist bookings at hotels as well as block group visas it should be easy to locate the hotel in which the manchester party are staying charlie might it was easy interrupted passmore its the rossiya on the ulitza razina and a man made a lastminute telephone booking so late that there wasnt time to copy his name onto the master log that the manchester firm holds thats the glitch i referred to was there any real point in stringing everything out to get to this point broke in rebecca street her exasperation even more obvious than before none whatsoever apart from my commitment to liaise fully and openly with you replied smith easily and wed have got to it far sooner if our immediate discussion hadnt begun the way it did so lets drop empty recriminations and move on ive done nothing to fill in the blank on the touristgroup visa but i dont think we should consider it as any more than a blank weve got to fill from surveillance on the hotel and if hes there ask him what the hell hes playing at insisted monsford we know what the hell hes playing at smith sighed heavily and if charlies there it should reassure you about his loyalties he wouldnt be there if hed gone over to the fsb would he its also our thinking that we shouldnt do anything more than establishing if hes at the rossiya said passmore it was always the intention that charlie remain entirely independent our not making contact with him or his not making contact with the embassy until the very last moment hes satisfied we can lift natalia and the child tell us more about your thinking encouraged monsford the belligerence easing once more of course the amsterdam episode doesnt rank as a diplomatic incident itll stay an unexplained mystery and be forgotten but its made headlines wouldnt that have been best avoided by muffin protesting his entry arrangements at the briefing here the fsb know hes coming to russia reminded smith frowning at the question my interpretation about amsterdam is that its a selfdevised diversion with an accompanying message that he knows what hes confronting by openly returning so hes issuing a challenge persisted monsford we were doing that by responding to the moscow calls passmore pointed out according to charlie natalia fedova could provide incalculable information about russian intelligence past and present and much of its uptodate putininitiated thinking listed monsford i am now wondering whether in my determination to have access to such information i didnt overcommit my service to a joint operation the movement among those around the table was different this time more surprise than discomfort at the mans attitude swings whats the point youre now making demanded smith fearing a shift in his domination were at the mercy an unpredictable officer if he is at the rossiya hotel he should be confronted told that unless he accepts superior authority everythings off which is what i proposed in buckinghamshire recalled smith believing he understood monsfords posturing from the outset and no longer dismissing it as overriding pomposity weve moved on from that position now my personal assessment is that its a ninety percent certainty that charlie muffin is in moscow we also accepted his unpredictability in buckinghamshire but what hed do if we told him the extraction was canceled is entirely predictable hed simply continue to try to get them out irrespective of no longer having any embassy backup or of causing diplomatic embarrassment theres only one way physically to eradicate that risk and that would create much greater publicity than amsterdam particularly as there would be the named association with malcolm stoat smith paused taking in a much needed breath are you recommending that guaranteed prevention with all its repercussions fury had begun to flood the mi directors face before smith finished talking coloring a look of near hatred monsford said no i am certainly not recommending that guaranteed prevention im relieved remarked smith are we agreed then that at this stage we limit ourselves to confirming charlie muffins presence if indeed he is at the rossiya hotel it was several moments before monsford managed a reply and when he did it was only a throatblocked yes it didnt work judged jane ambersom emerging from her silence in the directly following aftermath inquest monsford overplayed the buck passing at the beginning he came close to recovering at the end qualified aubrey smith but you got the ultimate resolution and its rejection out into the open passmore added endorsing the qualification the woman frowned between the two men having seen the disconnection of the mi recording apparatus she asked was assassination ever considered an option i believe it might have progressed to that allowed the directorgeneral jane considered the reply again looking between the two men you didnt expand on what you called inconsistencies the possibility of assassination was one an accusation i couldnt openly make said smith showing no discomfort at the clear deception in front of passmore who in turn gave no reaction to the directors unrecorded agreement during his buckinghamshire return with gerald monsford am i right in inferring then that there are limits to our future cooperation asked jane openly again and encouraged at the prospect of more directly opposing the man responsible for ending her mi career everything is to be decided on an itembyitem basis ruled the directorgeneral then there is a decision to be made disclosed jane who took less than five minutes to recount her lunchtime conversation with barry elliott coincidence questioned passmore the moment she finished coincidences occur conceded smith ive never personally made a decision based upon one what did you tell elliott that id think about it dripfeed it ordered smith i want to know his each and every reaction to each and every release i dont see how but if there is a cia involvement in thiswhich weve already briefly touched uponeverything changes and were not sharing elliotts approach with mi pressed the woman surely not until were confident mi arent already aware of elliotts approach maybe even initiated it through their contacts with langley said passmore irena yakulova novikov was ours whom we only handed over to the cia because the white house was the russian target everything charlie did including his debriefing that broke her is still ours unseen by langley or monsford said smith i dont follow that protested jane i judge what elliott said as a totally unexpected pebble thrown into an already murky pool said smith i want to see how far the ripples spread and jane what i want you to stay very close to barry elliott i will promised the woman the smile at her own amused satisfaction in his penthouse office atop the vauxhall cross building gerald monsford settled expansively back into his chair and said i think i handled that exceptionally well the onus now is entirely on mi and were on provable record proposing we back off also on provable record is an unequivocal reference to assassination pointed out rebecca aware that monsford had not turned on his recording machine and irritated at losing the silver bullet to blow monsford out of the chair in which he now lolled she also judged his earlier performance more amateur dramatic than exceptional monsford snorted a laugh youve missed the whole point i said no to assassination when charlie muffin an mi officer is put away with a bang at whom will the accusing finger point they both looked up as james straughan hurried into the office from his check of the operationsroom traffic to announce weve got a problem harry jacobsons call was patched through from the moscow embassys sterilized communications room to gerald monsfords equally securityprotected office enabling the exchange to be put on speakerphone for a simultaneous relay to rebecca street and james straughan bizarrely for a man of his size monsford was once more hunched in his enclosing chair in something close to a fetal ball radtsic cant pull a switch like this not this late protested monsford it would mean an entirely different extraction from paris radtsic says if elana talks to the boy explains whats happening there wont be any problem repeated jacobson if it doesnt come from her andrei or his girlfriend or both will scream abduction and itll all go wrong and radtsic wants to move at once he says he could make all the necessary arrangements for elana by tomorrow he wants his extraction coordinated with elana and andreis from paris if andrei comes willingly we could have them in london at virtually the same time i personally formulated how were getting the kid out reminded monsford im telling you what radtsic told me retorted jacobson that with andrei agreeing all we need to do is drive them to orlyi didnt tell him we were using orlyand bring them out on the passports that are ready i did tell him the passports were ready monsford looked inquiringly at the two others in the room straughan shrugged his shoulders rebecca said softly we need to talk not make any quick decisions into the telephone monsford said tell radtsic we have to talk about it that its an unexpected change that weve got properly to consider not rush into that hes got to accept what were saying that its the safety of him and his family were thinking about i already have said jacobson ill tell him again i havent finished warned monsford irritably we might possibly know where charlie is jacobson listened without interruption but when the director finished said if hes there i go on as planned right wrong corrected monsford i dont want us losing the bastard again go separately from those aubrey smith is putting in place i want our independent confirmation that we know where charlie is no slipups this time im not sure i can any longer trust smith to keep us fully in the loop but you still want the diversion more than ever after the way that bastard has jerked us around insisted monsford vehemently as shakespeare said lets make us medicines of our great revenge mummy going to paris to hold little andreis hand solves most of our difficulty but gives us another one said albert abrahams jonathan miller shook his head weve only got to look after one extra for a few hours its the best we could have hoped for id be happier with more direct contact said abrahams im not comfortable getting things relayed from moscow via london neither am i said the paris station chief straughans promised to set a meeting up just before the extraction more relayed arrangements abrahams pointed out from the tantrum anecdotes of his sadly toooftenabandoned single mother charlie muffin guessed hed been born a cynic suspicious that his bottle milk might be poloniumpoisoned or his diaper pin an offensive weapon but hed never sneered at the apparent childlike elements of espionage tradecraft there was nothing derisory at spy liaisons signaled by chalk marks on designated trees or walls or particularly arranged curtains or plant pots and empty coke cans or drainpipes or rocks some fakeslike others hiding miniature cameras or listening devicesmade perfect deadletter drops because they were so easily dismissed as childlike natalia had never dismissed them either not from the very first uncertain moments of their professionally insane affair shed actually encouraged their discussion most specifically rendezvous locations which as cynically wary as ever charlie had at first imagined as another debriefing trap to test which hed chosen as a site the most historic of moscows botanical gardens on ulitsa miracreated in by peter the great to cultivate medicinally beneficial plants for apothecary potionsto position his tradecraft marker a tightly rolled copy of pravda thrust as if discarded into the struts of the third bench from the main entrance hed returned at precisely the same time the following day to find a pravda pincered in the same position but folded not rolled hed responded with his rolledup signal but concealed himself among the easily available deciduous arboretum from which hed emerged as natalia not an expected thenkgb tracker arrived to acknowledge it theyd kept the oldest of the citys botanical showpiece as their initial meeting place advancing the protective tradecraft even after the physical affair had begun by adding calls between its several public pravdadiscarded telephone kiosks as a doublechecking confirmation that it was safe for him to continue on to her apartment charlie had remembered their protective routine leaving red square that morning which natalia had expected as shed expected him to recognize the significance of how shed made contact with his vauxhall flat charlie didnt though change his already planned day deciding the primary essential remained his continuing to be free of london whod now had close to thirtysix hours and the resources of both british intelligence organizations to locate him he risked an entire hour watching the rossiya hotel for the slightest indication of professional observation not entering until he was thoroughly satisfied that it wasnt and even then limiting himself to minutes remaining in his room just long enough minimally to pack what he could at the bottom of the holdall but leaving sufficient belongings including a toothbrush and shaving kit for it to appear still occupied he left the holdall open to display all the tourist material accumulated that morning and pointedly told the concierge on his way out that hed forgotten to take it with him for that days tours he descended into the labyrinthine gothicstationed moscow metro system buying that days pravda on his way only now slotting his red square realization into his itinerary there was no cause for tradecraft evasion enabling him to stay on the circle line to the familiar ulitsa mira station unsure if the sentimentally remembered mira hotel in which he and natalia had become lovers would still be there it was although shabbier and more decayed than it had been then it ensured at least that there was no questioning at his scarcely adequate luggage which was further explained by the hooker and her workoveralled client leaving as he checked in paying in advance as demanded for a fournight reservation charlie remained in the mirrorstained graysheeted room only long enough to confirm that the dirtrimed shower worked although intermittently and pocketing from the holdall he didnt expect to be there upon his return the spare david merryweather passport driving license and american express card it was only a short walk to the botanical gardens and charlie made it cautiously twice sitting on convenient benches behind the protection of his newspaperin which there was no reference to his amsterdam disappearanceto search for surveillance if he was right natalia wouldnt have given her telephone signal if shed suspected the gardens to be compromised but she was working singlehandedly against the full resources of the fsb as he objectively acknowledged that his observation was strictly limited a guaranteed ambush would be inside where there was sufficient tree bush and hothouse concealment to hide an fsb army it wasnt until hed scoured the other marker spots and found nothing that he needed briefly to sit and reconsider if hed mistaken the significance of the publicphone approach he hadnt any idea how unidentifiably to trace or reach her acknowledging his last resort charlie lingered at two outside floral displays to get close to the first of the telephone boxes which had become their second marker precaution disconcerted that since their special use it had been converted from an enclosed convenienttoemplace shelter into a wallmounted hooded pod without useful nooks or crannies so had the second closest to the first tubularroofed hothouse but inexplicably the third remained as he remembered still graffitidaubed and urinestinking and the foul floor wetness had soaked darkly upward through the threedayold copy of pravda which although having been partially dislodged from its undertray support had been folded precisely in the way he instantly recognized charlie refused the distracting euphoria disentangling what remained dry to dump in a nearby bin before replacing it with his tightly rolled copy of that days issue natalia wouldnt risk a daylight visit charlie knew would she check that night he had the afternoon and early evening to fill before finding out and the touristgroup itinerary scheduled their return to the rossiya at six he checked his hotel room on his way surprised to find the holdall still there and bought a payasyougo russian cell phone to replace his stilldisabled londonissue before descending again into the metro system charlie was in place in a panoramically windowed bar with a view of both front and side entrances by five thirty and that days luck stayed with him charlie isolated his suspect within fifteen minutes well concealed within the covered entrance of an empty office block so dark that his initial impression was of occasional movement rather than a positive physical identification it remained that way until the arrival and disembarkation of the tourist coach when the shifting impression emerged for charlie to identify as patrick wilkinson the only man on his supposed support team whom hed previously known and then there was another movement closer to the front of the hotel but emerging from an equally professionally chosen concealing porch charlie at once dismissed the man as being another of his memorized backup group just as quickly charlie discounted the obvious surveillance to be fsb not solely because of the western tailoring of the graychecked suit but far more tantalizingly because of his immediate conviction that hed somehow somewhere previously knownor encounteredthe watching man but how where it wasnt possible yes it was came the quick contradiction as charlie made the positive identification hed isolated the man as hed intently studied those around him on the amsterdam flight from which hed fled the same suited bespectacled person whose closely barbered neatness was marred by a bushed walrus mustache had been two rows behind but on the opposite side of the aisle it had been an even more successful day than charlie could have hoped for and he was already curious at what was to follow so too but independently were aubrey smith and gerald monsford eighteen hundred miles away in london both intelligence chiefs recognized the symbolism of the breakfast conference in the foreign office room overlooking downing street and each made a gesture of his own by pointedly arriving separately and without prior consultation for the examination of their supposedly joint venture aubrey smith entered last although not late behind both geoffrey palmer who was to chair the session as the foreign office liaison to the joint intelligence and security committee and cabinet secretary sir archibald bland it was bland though who quickly established the agenda the arrest of russian diplomats has greatly embarrassed moscow aware as we are of what else is going on were anxious to know how much longerand furtheryou intend stretching out the situation what have the russians said asked the mi directorgeneral theyve refused anything beyond demanded diplomatic immunity and access to embassy lawyers weve delivered two official notes and publicly summoned the ambassador here to the foreign office for an explanation which of course we havent got and didnt expect theyre offering a guilty plea with a mitigating submission of extreme and inexcusable drunkenness they accept without protest or threatened retaliation our declaring all three persona non grata and expelling them the media will ridicule that insisted monsford his own agenda prepared and its naive to imagine they wont make a titfortat retaliation they always do with hindsight it was a mistake to stage the arrest in the first place had i been consulted in advance i would have opposed it as a completely unnecessary side issue i have already offered director monsford the opportunity to withdraw his participation said smith to frowned looks between the two government officers that offer remains his officers can easily be recalled from moscow if theres disagreement between you both this discussion is even more essential said bland we accept moscow will reciprocate but we cantand wontmake that reciprocation easy for them by mounting an operation about which youre uncertain i thought wed already made that abundantly clear is there a problem not as far as i am concerned smith wasnt worried at monsfords outburst director invited the cabinet secretary monsford hesitated offbalanced by smiths unanticipated assertion unsure how to reverse it i am surprised by the directorgenerals response why demanded the increasingly frowning bland yes why echoed smith you will have read the newspaper furor at the mystery disappearance in amsterdam from a moscowbound flight questioned monsford no refused bland i dont read the popular press i know what youre talking about said palmer more helpfully what about it theres no mystery the vanishing man is charlie muffin announced monsford whod had harry jacobsons surveillance relayed by straughan but been prevented from speaking directly to his moscow station head because of jacobsons timeclashing meeting with maxim radtsic what the stumbled palmer why werent we told finished bland charlie switched his arrival going in on a tourist flight instead of how wed arranged elaborated smith in a calm monotone it was as youre aware always the understanding that charlie would work independently thats what he chose to do without any approval aware as he was of the publicity his disappearance would create as well as blowing his falsename cover before he even got into russia interrupted monsford emphasizing strained indignation it was crassly irresponsible threatening the entire operation and in the context of this meeting provides moscow with a basis for retaliation as embarrassing as that theyre suffering it provides nothing of the sort neither was it crassly irresponsible rejected aubrey smith contemptuously it was an action that allowed to act independently charlie was authorized to make we know he has arrived undetected in moscow as well as the hotel in which he was booked although i dont expect him to remain there this is a totally unnecessary attentionattracting charade repeated monsford i do not wish to withdraw my participation what i do seek at this moment is my appointment as official recognized supervisor of this operation the failure to confirm which will i believe result in the debacle the majority of us are determined to avoid in response to which i in turn invite you to consider the available records of every shared meeting between our two services said smith the flatvoiced outer calmness giving no hint of the gamble upon which he was knowingly embarking from those records i would suggest there are overwhelming indications of such inconsistency and prevarication on the part of my counterpart at mi that to agree to a single control management would do more to guarantee than prevent a debacle charlie muffins independence was rightly or wrongly in hindsight agreed by us all your study of the records im offering include my belief that muffin would disregard any cancellation and continue whatever he considered necessary to save his wife and child those records also contain my colleagues rejection of the one guaranteed way of removing the threat of charlie muffin acting alone as i wholly reject it if you find against me on either continuing the extraction as a shared operation or in the only assured way of preventing my officer continuing unsupported then i must tender my immediate resignation a silence iced the room through the tripleglazed windows an equally silent tableau unfolded featuring the prime minister emerging from his official residence responding to questions after a brief statement to waiting journalists and returning inside geoffrey palmer said this has turned out to be a very different discussion from what i imagined it would be sir archibald bland said i think it would be advantageous for us and perhaps others to study the offered transcripts before continuing this discussion any further harry jacobson decreed their pickup should be at the obelisk commemoration to yuri gagarin complete with its minuscule actualsize orb in which the man contorted himself for the worlds first manned space flight jacobsons alarm flaring the moment he began his aheadoftime reconnaissance at the sight of the militia road check two vans and at least five officers although jacobsons was not one of the cars pulled over he had though to go slowly which he did more than was necessary to identify the uniforms of the gia highway police the openly corrupt shakedown of motorists given the option of paying an onthespot fine or accepting an eventually more expensive official invented traffic violation was not unusual which made it perfect cover for the seizure jacobson constantly feared would maxim radtsic be frightened for the same reason if the russian wasnt orchestrating the entire episode it was thirty minutes too early for him to find out and jacobson let his mind return to the previous nights resented secondary assignment at the rossiya hotel it was totally unreasonable as well as dangerously impractical for him to juggle three balls in the air at the same time and jacobson hadnt been impressed with the surveillance ability of patrick wilkinson whom he was sure he would have picked up even if wilkinson hadnt been identified to him in london but wilkinsons lack of professionalism was mis problem not his he didnt see why the hell james straughan had insisted he duplicate the hunt for charlie muffin when there were six othersthree of them misitting around on their fat asses at the embassy or why having insisted he make the independent check straughan banned a direct approach to a rossiya receptionist with a twentydollar bill folded inside a friendly handshake for a tensecond look at the register what was the point of confirming the bloody mans presence anyway until the actual moment the diversion had literally to be triggered radtsic remained his foremost priority jacobson negotiated the difficult double roundabout system to prevent being automatically routed onto the ring road to return with growing discomfort along leninskaya the maneuver put the highwayrobbing militia on the opposite side of the multilane road but there were uniformed radioequipped militia spotters on the memorial side jacobson had isolated as radtsics pickup point their presence heightened the possibility of an ambush as well as risked curiosity at the return of a car so recently passing in the opposite direction radtsic was there for once properly using what cover a tree clump offered he neednt stop jacobson knew the militia concentration was sufficient reason for him to abort and revert to another emergency contact meeting radtsic was actually looking at him could seewould seethe circumstances and understand although the block was on the other side of the highway the cars traveling in jacobsons direction slowed to gawk forcing him to slow too and as jacobson did radtsic moved away from his partial concealment walking now as selfimportantly as he always did there were two motorcycles previously obscured by militia vans but visible now he could be chased easily stopped if he attracted attention by suddenly accelerating he didnt jacobson was careful to indicate his intention to move out of the slowed otherwise occupied traffic line paused rather than stopped at the pavement edge the moment radtsic reached him and at once indicated his getting back in line the moment the russian was inside the car this was an absurd place to meet protested radtsic at once how the hell could i have known thered be a gia extortion jacobson was intent on his rearview and wing mirrors searching for pursuit i didnt think you were going to stop i almost didnt if this had been a trap i would have sprung it a long time ago said radtsic presciently am i supposed to be reassured jacobson was unsettled at the other mans awareness of his fear youre supposed to believe me believe that im not tricking you no militia vehicles were following and the traffic was picking up speed as soon as he could jacobson pulled onto minor roads from the inner beltway were okay of course were okay youve told london how its got to be done now it cant be according to your timing theyre planning the separate extraction elana and andrei from paris you from here but its got to be at our signal this is ridiculous said the russian its practical and will be safe the safety of you and your family is the essential not something concocted as we go along said jacobson disregarding his earlier doubts direct contact has to be made with elana and andrei you have to tell her that im thinking of going to the americans abruptly threatened radtsic jacobson drove for several moments without responding ill tell london stop them taking anything further in paris that might interfere with how washington might devise their extraction didnt it occur to you though that after the lvov episode washington might not be as receptive as we are now it was radtsic who retreated into silence jacobson had completed the rerouting from the innerring road before the russian spoke why did you mention lvov i thought it was relevant it having occurred so recently lied jacobson exasperated at what was being demanded of him but now suddenly he was curious i had no part in that not the planning i mean radtsic had no need to explain or excuse himself so why was he challengingly jacobson said youre the executive deputy of the fsb you must have been part of it it was a longterm strategy you know that going back to kgb jacobson drove automatically back onto the ring road his entire concentration upon the other man he was in the shit and sinking after the amsterdam mistake jacobson reminded himself and there was the outside possibility of his being wrong with the rossiya assessment this just conceivably might be his recovery youre oldtime kgb maxim mikhailovich you were there when it began not part of it though radtsic once more denied you know when and where the lvov thing was devised in i was in st petersburg not cairo within both british intelligence agencies the lvov episode had already attained legendary status as the most brilliantly conceived and attempted russianintelligence penetration only defeated by more than brilliant mi deduction but jacobson didnt know any details he couldnt continue this totally unexpected conversation without almost immediately exposing his ignorance it had to be ended with the surprise retained were here to talk about elana and her exit visa not things that happened in the past i suspected it was another test that you were doubting me said radtsic it wasnt and im not elanas visa is arranged her flights booked for noon tomorrow her departure will take four days six maximum to permeate through the system potentially to become a personal risk to me youre still trying to impose your own time frame accused jacobson of course i am admitted radtsic and you know why london doesnt want an ultimatum i thought they already knew there had to be a strictly timed schedule the remark fitted the arrogance jacobson had come to expect seeing the possibility of a respite he said youre ready to move the moment i give the word you know damn well im ready so we dont need any more meetings we can keep in touch by mobile phone while paris is set up radtsic looked anxiously across the car youre not abandoning me are you elanas documentation is in the system i cant retrieve it now of course im not abandoning you maxim mikhailovich insisted jacobson i want everything resolved as quickly as you do no you dont contradicted radtsic no one could want it resolved more quickly than i do id hoped for more complained barry elliott im certainly hoping for more thought jane ambsersom already encouraged by the easy familiarity with which the fbi man had kissed her although only on both cheeks when hed picked her up from her london flat that morning according to his estimate theyd arrive in perfect time for their already booked lunch she said i warned you there hasnt been time to collate it all i dont even know how much there is in total there will be more though pressed elliott jane hoped he did other things as well as he drove the car the signpost they were passing showed stratford to be only twenty miles away ive circulated our archival and records people between whom its apparently spread i havent heard back from the directorgeneral but i cant see why there should be any difficulty she hesitated her approach prepared im guessing youve approached mi for help as well for what it was worth whats that mean the message we got back was that lvov wasnt their baby that it was all down to you guys and they didnt think what little they had would contribute anything were switching the unofficial approach to a formal request through the cia it was going her way as she had every hope of this journey going her way which made it essential that she weigh every word there are things we share and some we dont what has our secret intelligence service got to hide about a closed case in which in their own judgment they were only minimally involved you ask me replied the american rhetorically i just did and you didnt come up with the right answer thought jane we both understand were being straight with each other here arent we i hope so when the fuck then was this guy going to prove it by doing something to guide her spurred by her own irritation jane said i dont think youre working professionally with me i think irena yakulova novikov is sending you guys every which way from the right direction and that having been suckered for eighteen years youre worried that it isnt over that the russians have a fallback thats still going to leave you swinging in the wind by a roadsign calculation elliott drove for another eight miles before speaking again weve lost two guys one a friend of mine who trained with me at quantico following up leads that emerged during what the cia believed to be novikovs truthful debriefing the other was one of their own guys would you think that was a fallback or payback lost how a hitandrun in cairo and a drowning in the moscow river the guy in moscow was the one i knew at quantico he was his college swimming champion at kent state so its personal as well as professional elliott shook his head strictly professional jane hadnt known what she might learn professionally from this excursioneven if she would learn anythingand still wasnt sure of this conversation but it was certainly something to be relayed to aubrey smith i think weve got a lot more to talk about which reminds me said the man there seems to be a misunderstanding about the room reservations im sure it wont be a problem said jane i hope she thought what emerged at our last session has been fully considered not just by us but by others assured geoffrey palmer it is to continue as a joint operation announced sir archibald bland which doesnt cover the absolute resolution should charlie muffin proceed independently protested monsford the decision is that it continues to be jointly shared reiterated bland with a hint of strained patience as such the question of an absolute resolution doesnt arise getting andrei to london is being organized by the british elana remained looking down at her scarcely touched meal oblivious of everyone in the restaurant its really happening isnt it we really are going to defect were definitely going said radtsic i wish we werent the adjustments wont be easy but youll accept it eventually all of it i dont think i will not ever dont forget everything ive told you about the british approach how will they make it where itll be their move theyll only make it when theyre sure its safe what about the girl andreis got to understand youve got to make him understand hes a grown man not a child talk to him as a man and as our son youre asking too much too much of both of us im asking you to help save our lives i want to go home said elana go home for the last time charlies brief elation at finding the hopedfor talisman had frozen into icehard questioning reality by the time he uncomfortably awoke in the cold very early light of the following day feasted upon by the more regular multilegged inhabitants of his bed and it wasnt because of his fruitless vigil in the botanical garden the night before it still had to be more much more than a percent chance that natalia had delivered the newspaper signal in the way only hed recognize to their special deadletter drop but the alternative the fear that natalias coercion had brutally forced from her their meeting code remained and if that had happened hed swallowed the fsb bait by going to moscows original herb garden but why hadnt they sprung that trap and seized him the day before the hope that natalia hadnt been broken was no more than the merest wisp of strawclutching reassurance but still something for which he could snatch out to hold could he safely interpret the pravda sign that it was safe to go anywhere near natalias pecatnikov pereulok apartment outside of which monsfords photographer had pictured her and sasha just six days ago not yet not until he was surer the gardens were safe that it was natalias intended indicator maybe not even then it was inconceivable that natalias home was not under the most concentrated surveillance the fsb would have wanted natalia and sasha to be photographed seemingly free to flavor their snare his safer course was to continue with their original personal tradecraft and there were other more immediate selfprotections to be established updated now by an urgent need for medication to ease his redhot bug bites the stuttering shower gave some temporary relief until the trouserchafing walk through the departing congestion of whores and their whoremongers on his way from the hotel charlie was abruptly halted on the pavement by the thought of checking the nearby gardens again but decided it was too soon for a visible response to his pravda deposit instead not abandoning the idea altogether charlie used a remembered kiosk conveniently close to the ulitsa mira metro in preference to his payasyougo mobile to dial the number hed copied from the box in which hed found the particularly folded newspaper allowing it to ring unanswered for a full minute before hanging up he got a seat on the circleline train lessening his insect discomfort which flared only when he switched for the arbat connection which he intentionally chose for its concealing swamp of similarly dressed western tourists in which to sink out of detectable sight a more fortunate secondary benefit was a pharmacy from which charlie bought balm and insect repellent he dialed the unresponding botanical gardens phone twice from different telephone kiosks as he moved through the tourist mecca buying on his way the previous days london times and telegraph as well as a selection of that days russian and englishlanguage newspapers charlie used them to reserve his seat in an enclosed office workers street buffet while he balmed his overnight wounds in its lavatory the telegraph reported a dutch intelligence theory that malcolm stoat whom it described as a man of mystery of whom no official identification records or background existed in england was a fleeing russian spy kidnapped by british counterintelligence that days englishlanguage moscow news also printed the legend name and linked although without explanation the amsterdam disappearance with what it referred to as reorganization within the fsb charlie sipped his sludgelike coffee and spread soured cheese on his black bread conscious of the malcolm stoat passport in his inside jacket pocket next to that days itinerary promising a freetime afternoon for the manchester travel group how free wondered charlie would it remain which was a question he needed to answer he risked the bar with its panoramic overview of the rossiya managing to get a stool and a double measure of properly distilled vodka in a shadowed area between the counter and the rear wall calculating that his slight loss of outside view was compensated by his being hidden from at least a third of the other customers closely studying those still visible for professionally telltale attitudes or recognizable london faces finding neither charlie switched his concentration to the hotel outside almost at once isolating neil preston from the london introductory session wincing critically at the man occupying the same porch that patrick wilkinson had the day before but with even less concealment there was no one obviously watching from where hed picked out the man with the straggled mustache charlie realistically accepted the malcolm stoat name would have had far wider disclosure than in the two media references hed found the name had already been available from the aircraft passenger manifest for more than fortyeight hours now and from his previous days hotel observation london had definitely discovered the location of the holiday group among which hed hidden but theyd had the nameand known of his vanishing actfrom the outset moscow hadnt neither had it been on the blockvisa documentation submitted by manchester to the russian embassy in london only on the hotel registration here and at sheremetyevo airport certainly not available for as long as fortyeight hours then but he was still surprised the rossiya wasnt swarmed by fsb which it obviously wasnt from neil preston being patiently if amateurishly on duty noon charlie saw from the bar clock as he gestured for another drink the itinerary scheduled a twelvefortyfive return hed wait he decided he had no intention of trying to reconnect with the manchester group but it was important he get some indication of what had happened to them the fsb knew that he was coming just not when and how but theyd have made the connection from his amsterdam disappearance what happenedand whento muriel simpson and her band of travelers would trigger the positive start of the fsbs hunt for him he hadnt tried the marked telephone in the botanical gardens for more than an hour charlie reminded himself now midday might be a good time there was a phone on the far side of the bar but it was open fronted and the place was noisily crowded with lunchtime customers hed have to speak loudly shout even if there was a reply and probably have difficulty hearing himself it was hardly likely natalia would be there to pick up the receiver anyway his bestprobably onlychance was to continue the nighttime vigils as surreptitiously as he was professionally able abruptly he saw the tourist coach charlie was gesturing for a third drink momentarily looking toward the bartender and when he looked back to the window charlie at once recognized the vehicle from the journey from the airport stopped at that moment by a car emerging through the forecourtentry gap the coach impatiently edged forward as the car almost imperceptibly eased out stopping altogether as it more positively obstructed the skewed coach at the same time the car horn blared an obvious signal for three closed militarystyle vehicles to tirescream from both directions down the suddenly emptied sealed road to form a complete encirclement at the same time the scene was flooded by lights brightly illuminating the arrival of two more slower and bigger military vehicles that disgorged helmeted bodyarmored men in camouflage uniforms who at once began herding at jabbing gunpoint the bewildered stumbling manchester tourists four of the women crying hysterically from their coach into the larger vans briefly a whitefaced muriel simpson appeared to stare directly into the bar at the watching charlie the trafficclearing militaryconvoy sirens momentarily overwhelmed the astonished uproar inside the bar but neither conflicting noises prevented charlies very clearly hearing an english voice say whisperclose to his ear why arent i surprised to find you here charlie the mi director stared up from the transcript james straughan had protectively printed verbatim of his conversation with their moscow station chief an hour earlier monsfords mouth forming the words but not able to utter them finally he managed cairo radtsic very definitely identified cairo i specifically took jacobson over that three times hes adamant radtsic stipulated cairo because the significance of cairo didnt mean anything to him still doesnt because i didnt explain it and radtsic has consistently denied knowing anything but the vaguest circumstances of the lvov case echoed monsford going back to the transcript radtsic claims he wasnt even in the kgbs lubyanka headquarters when it began that he was a serving officer in st petersburg confirmed straughan irritated at the other mans repeating his pointbypoint memorandum its not right declared monsford somethings definitely not right lets not overinterpret it cautioned rebecca street according to what we know of radtsics history he was in st petersburg in but he would have been involved in the inquest after what charlie did this year read and heard enough to have picked up cairo as its starting point most of whats available of radtsics career was provided by radtsic himself after he made his approach to us reminded straughan weve no independent confirmation of anything hes told us so what dismissed the woman hed still have been involved in the review of the lvov disaster and learned before then how cairo figured whys he told jacobson he knows virtually nothing about it persisted monsford his mind locked on the inconsistency rebecca shrugged conscious that monsford hadnt activated his personal recording apparatus he knows hes got to sing loud and clear for his supper once he gets here jacobsons the facilitator not the one hes got to impress by what he knows my guess is he let cairo slip as a taster i dont rely on guesses rejected monsford stiffly fifty percent of our decisions begin largely from guesswork rebecca argued or intuition at least okay radtsics provided his own legend but we know from our independent identification that he is maxim mikhailovich radtsic and that maxim radtsic is the executive deputy of the federalnaya sluzhba bezopasnosti who wants to defect to us what the hell more do we need instead of answering monsford turned to the operations director fluttering his printout is this everything jacobson had to say its planned as a frontfaced extraction set out straughan determined to establish his personal safeguards were providing a genuine russian passport with radtsics genuine photograph describing him as a chemical engineer the british entry visas are genuine embassy issued with all the necessary supporting documentation and accreditations for a trade visit here it contains all the necessary russian exit visas hell be accompanied by three of our people ive already sent independently and unknown to each other to wait in separate moscow hotels the moscow departure of radtsics plane will be signaled to those in place at heathrow well disembark him first holding everyone else onboard bypass all entry formalities and take him direct to the safe house for his reunion with his elana and andrei monsfords frown had deepened during straughans presentation why are you telling me what weve already planned because i believe there needs to be reexamination and maybe replanning currently its a failsafe extraction already set up and rehearsed except for two exceptions which are questioned rebecca aligning herself with the operations directors doubts the absence of radtsic himself from that rehearsal which nevertheless isnt the main problem all the mans got to do is go through an embarkation procedure whats most likely to go wrong is the charlie muffin diversion your point demanded monsford angry at being confronted according to radtsic elanas exit visa will show up in a matter of days when it does radtsics extraction isnt any longer failsafe its too heavily compromised and we dont know where the hell charlie muffin is let alone have any idea how to inveigle him we dont need the complication i didnt ask for your opinion rejected monsford i asked what else jacobson said i dont think we should wait either intruded rebecca joining the objection we couldnt even guarantee charlie muffin reaching moscow with jacobson on the same bloody plane we need muffin under programmed surveillance which we dont have monsford studiously ignored the woman focused upon straughan who risked an exasperated sigh at the obduracy of the other man jacobson thinks its safer to restrict his contact with radtsic to cell phone until we move i thought radtsic believed all his telephones to be tapped challenged rebecca singleuse russian cell phones discarded directly after one call elaborated straughan no way it could be intercepted staple tradecraft im not started monsford but stopped at the intrusion of his securitycleared personal telephone he said yes and listened without interruption for no more than seconds looking up to the other two he said moscows staged its own theatrical production theyve arrested the entire manchester tour group and televised themselves doing it but charlie muffin wasnt among them anticipated straughan of course he wasnt among them snapped monsford peevishly as he wont be around for any diversion predicted rebecca shaking her head to straughan in a prearranged signal charlie didnt respond and david halliday didnt say anything further instead leading their way out through a side exit to avoid the still eyesquinting television strobes and continuing on foot in the opposite direction to distance themselves from the scene picking their way through hornprotesting traffic jammed by the line of vehicles from the stillmilitiasealed rossiya hotel it was charlie who called them to a halt demanded by permanently protesting hammertoed feet indicating the cinema and shop complex on ulitsa kirova theres a bar on the first floor theyll serve cats piss itll be drinkable cats piss my feet hurt charlies mind was way ahead of his painful stepatatime ascent to the bar level the mi officer had maintained an armslength acquaintance during the lvov affair tiptoeing at the very edge in the hope of personal advancement without endangering involvement able to quote to the penny the pension hed receive at the conclusion of a disasterspared career why then instead of slinking away had the man risked approaching as he had and even more unexpected discarded that previously avoided association by coming with him into this cigarettesmogged bodyodored shoppingmall bar into which he would not normally have allowed himself to be dragged by the wildest of wild horses unwittingly connecting to charlies thoughts halliday held up the vodka that charlie handed him and said its not cats piss its horse piss itll have more body promised charlie halliday touched glasses death to our enemies whomever and wherever they may be responded charlie matching the other mans overly posturing toast i know who they are said halliday his face clearing in accepting surprise at his drink gerald fucking monsford and the rest of the conniving bastards in vauxhall fucking cross in espionage parlance a benefit or a human sourceusually embedded within an oppositionis known as an asset and while the russian fsb was his most obvious opposition there remained in charlies mind those unresolved uncertainties that still nagged from his buckinghamshire interrogation the fsbs knowledge of his london apartment paramount among them was it at all possible that while david halliday did not totally qualify as an assetand continuing the vodka analogyhe could be looking a gift horse in the mouth sounds like youve got an inhouse problem im out in the cold charlie and being left there to freeze to death you want to talk about it coaxed charlie tentatively im offering you the same invitation shit thought charlie youll have to explain that so youre part of the freeze too stop feeling sorry for yourself rebuked charlie sure he knew enough to lead im never part of anything im not at the embassy to be part of anything halliday used the time it took to buy more drinks to consider charlies response theres a big team come in from londona combined job both services im totally excluded and theres nothing sinister in that i was officially told not to include you in the lvov business broke in charlie thered been sufficient embassy gossip for the man to infer that his distancing had in fact been selfmotivated by hallidays own pensionprotecting choosing and that some rapport remained between them you didnt completely blank me not like im being blanked now conceded halliday to charlies satisfaction youre surely not the only one tempted charlie thats just it complained halliday petulantly jacobsons pissing about too my own fucking station chief wont tell me whats going on twentyfive years service unblemished track record and im being treated like the fucking office boy jacobson queried charlie wanting every possible nugget harry jacobson i just told you hes mi station chief he wasnt on station six months ago when i was here monsford went ape shit over the lvov things first at not being included from the beginning and then in his desperation not to be linked by all his efforts to be part of it when it all went wrong i was the only one to survive by rights i should have been appointed head of station but the bastard sent in jacobson i dont see how that means jacobson is pissing about i didnt mean jacobsons appointment said halliday exasperated i meant how jacobsons treating me closing me out from what hes doing charlie gestured for more drinks without looking away from the other man well aware that it was not the case he said jacobsons the control of this big team thats been sent in from london no said halliday his exasperation worsening its something quite separate just mi and with monsford personally involved which has got to mean its big which i know it is because everythings classified eyes only nothing on general traffic and jacobsonwhos keeping the entire file in his personal safeis refusing to talk about it david charlie smiled touching his glass to the other mans to emphasize the iknowwhatyouvedone mockery are you seriously asking me to believe that having retained that unblemished record for twentyfive years you havent got the slightest clue whats going on it took a moment for halliday to smile in return the exasperation slipping away i dont know what the big teams here for or what that was all about back there at the rossiya charlie paused presented with two ways to go choosing to stay on track he said we werent talking about the big team or what happened outside the hotel we were talking about your being closed out of what jacobsons doing im sure its an extraction announced halliday despite the abrupt chill and as always untroubled by his own hypocrisy charlie kept the mocking smile david youve asked me to help you and if im going to do that youve got to be honest you dont think you know youve got your hands on the file havent you halliday held his smile too not all of it jacobson got suspicious and changed his safe combination and most of what i saw was encrypted but you understood what you did read didnt you david its a multiple extraction how multiple a man and a woman and a third but i couldnt understand how he fitted in he seized charlie the third persons male thats how it seemed and i did get the code designation its janus the physical chill suffusing charlie began to freeze the god with two faces able to look two ways at the same time appropriate for a defector which it obviously is confirmed halliday monsfords personal choice from what i managed to see the code designation for natalias extraction had been monsfords personal choice at the buckinghamshire hunting lodge remembered charlie remembering too monsfords insistence on subject gender in the code titles along with his theninexplicable choice of camese the wife of janus hopefully charlie said nothing more halliday frowned i told you it was encrypted on a scale of ten extractions score around fifteen for potential disasters im surprised youre pissed off at being excluded being kept out of one is acceptable being kept out of both is ominous now its your turn what the fucks going on its your round reminded charlie offering his empty glass to gain thinking time throughout hallidays diatribe charlie had been calculating how to escape from the man his mind shifting with each and every unexpected revelation now he didnt want to escape just free himself from the sinbad burden of having halliday on his back im waiting prompted halliday handing charlie his refill looks as if you and i are cast adrift in the same boat opened charlie i know a team was sent ahead of me but i wasnt told the reason my orders were to come in separately stay away from the embassy and wait to be contacted the only thing missing was the tattoo on my forehead reading fall guy i jumped ship in amsterdam and it was you charlie nodded i got back to england that same night and latched on to a tourist group from manchester he gestured vaguely back in the direction from which theyd fled and sticking to the golden rule of telling as few lies as possible he said they were the group picked up outside the rossiya thats why you were there waiting to see what happened the alarm bell rang at his oversight why were you there if youre excluded i followed preston from the embassy he didnt pick me up it was simple enough to be true conceded charlie but only just i saw prestons surveillance so would an fsb trainee hanging about as preston did instead of moving around and the fsb all around the rossiya were very definitely not trainees how many did you mark three positively you four lied charlie who hadnt searched beyond preston as well as failing to locate halliday from his hideaway corner you think you were sent here to be the fall guy demanded halliday selfprotective as always he nervously added me too possibly whyd you think i got off the plane in amsterdam but then came here anyway challenged halliday charlie hesitated annoyed at another slip i couldnt go straight back could i i needed to find out if i was right or not which was why i was watching the hotel my trap for them theyre bastards exclaimed halliday his voice too loud slurred by the vodka that shouldnt surprise you either what are we going to do charlie it was more a plea than a question the mans mind as well as his speech rusting in alcohol beat them said charlie making a promise to himself how it was still a whimpered plea by you and i working together okay youre being excluded but youre still on the inside within the embassy im on the outside not on their intended leash so they cant initiate whatever they intend were beating them so far you want another drink no i dont think you do either what can we do you stay as you are trying to find out whats happening inside get jacobsons new safe combination ill stay on the outside watching like today halliday nodded in befuddled agreement i need to know where you are no you dont refused charlie whod anticipated the demand have you got a cell phone of course ill call you twice every day ten in the morning six at night it had to be four hours closer to five since hed tried the botanical gardens number you dont trust me im not expecting you to trust me which i dont declared halliday with slurred belligerence why not you couldnt have just walked off the amsterdam plane why not jacobson was on it the flight details to and from london were on the general file blondhaired guy very neat and together apart from the big mustache you know him accused halliday still belligerent does he have a graychecked suit persisted charlie you do know him not until now said charlie i remember him from the plane and saw him yesterday watching the hotel but im not involved in whatever hes doing but he was going to be charlie knew my mothers making a surprise visit when asked yvette shes arriving tomorrow said andrei why with so little warning i dont know does she know about me that were together i told them in my last letter that id met you but not that youd moved in do you want me to leave while shes here i could if it would be better theres another bedroom why should you maybe it would be better if i werent here when she actually arrives give you space to tell her i dont understand why she didnt warn me she was coming youll be able to ask her that too while im not here conflicting impressions and confusions swirled through charlies mind like leaves in an autumn gale constantly blown out of any order in which he tried to prioritize them his uncertainties compounded by the distracting but essentially physical need to rid himself of david hallidays pursuit which the man solemnly promised not to attempt but which charlie knew he would that focus eventually brought halliday into the forefront of charlies immediate reflection as he watched from the concealment of a metro station pillar the mi officer carried away in the opposite direction from charlies botanical gardens destination after thirty minutes of footaching bitechafing hopscotch between subway trains hallidays vodkaclouded chase went beyond charlies expectation it was a warning which again he scarcely needed that he couldnt trust halliday further than an outstretched arm if the man thought there were better personal advantages from cheating him than keeping to their agreed arrangement which once more neither disconcerted nor angered charlie who would have abandoned halliday with even less compunction if a better opportunity had presented itself but at that precise moment charlie believed halliday to be his asset because he was the bestthe onlyselfpreserving asset halliday had in return just as he believed that allowing a necessary margin of exaggeration halliday had filled in a third of the far too empty mosaic for him to get a clearer idea of the eventual picture the fury that had engulfed charlie earlier at the unavoidable inference that natalia and sasha were included in his clearly intended sacrifice came again and now he didnt suppress it rather he let it burn and build savoring the anticipation of asyetundecided but overwhelmingly fitting retribution what could be sufficiently overwhelming to punish those who intentionally set out to destroy the two people central to his very existence a question at the moment impossible to answer but he would charlie determined however long it took outwardly conscious of the passing curiosity of metro users at his standing as he was charlie boarded a linking train to connect to mira station whom would he punish he asked himself again as he gratefully sat to ease his throbbing legs they all in some way had to be complicit he guessed gerald monsford to have been the primary instigator too easily identifiable from his preposterous code designation monsfords cowuddered milkmaid rebecca street would have known too along with their lickspittle operations director james straughan what about aubrey smith charlie muffin was too familiar with the amoral practicability of espionagethat there was absolutely no morality successful practicability its only goalto despair at any debtdiscarding betrayal by a man whose mi career hed so recently salvaged but there was still a blip of disappointment that evaporated as quickly as it came the mans obvious acquiescence made him as culpable and as deserving of reprisal as the others the janussexed jane ambersom would have looked in whatever selfserving direction the others took and having been disabled from his army career the orderindoctrinated john passmore would have obeyed his superiors rules of engagement as he crossed to his final ulitsa mira connection charlie acknowledged the background to his mosaic was still incomplete he couldnt begin his retribution until he understood the parallel extractions there was an unsettling similarity to what hed imagined to be the intended rescue of natalia and sasha the only difference the sex of the offspring except for the operational designations came the immediate caveat thered be no purpose allocating two different code names to the same assignment his earlier recognition that one was planned as a diversion from the other had to be the only conclusion which brought charlies mind back to the importance of david halliday the mi man was the only source from whom he could discover more about what he now accepted to be the primary objective and hed already rationalized the degree of trust he could expect from a man as desperate to retain his pensioned career as halliday or was halliday that only source minimally forewarned as he was couldnt he risk contact with those waiting at the embassy searching for him from the embassy he remembered hed have to endure the recriminating explanationdemanding brouhaha from london but their responses might provide further mosaic tiles the downside might be to confuse halliday whod doubtless learn of his approach despite his ostracism wiser to wait albeit briefly he was after all no nearer linking up with natalia that remained his primary objective he thought as he bought a copy of pravda from the station kiosk a total abject disaster announced the flushed sir archibald bland his voice cracked from his earlier confrontation at downing street where his cabinetsecretary competence had unthinkably been questioned for the first time in his ten years tenure everything is to be closed down canceled abandoned whatever this is a disaster for which each of you is required to provide a full and detailed explanation prior to your being called upon personally to account for whats happened neither of you will leave this room until i am given that explanation gerald monsfords squirmed reaction was heightened by the totally contrasting response from aubrey smith who remained as unmoving as his voice retained its accustomed monotone smith said weve only had the opportunity of seeing the televised seizures hearing the russians accusations and reading the evening standard what diplomatically has so far come from moscow the cabinet secretary made an impatient flyflicking gesture to geoffrey palmer who said the indications are they intend officially charging all sixteen with spying and publicly arraign them in court just as we arraigned their diplomats the ambassadors preliminary assessment is that even if we try to negotiate with a release offer for their burglars moscow will still impose a prison term and keep us on a string for months maybe even including in that imprisonment the two tourists both male whove already suffered heart attacks expanded bland outraged he continued consider the situation youve created sixteen totally innocent british holidaymakers incarcerated in a siberian gulag for god knows how long its absolutely appalling so wheres your bloody man charlie muffin or malcolm stoat or whatever the hell you choose to call him resumed the foreign office liaison to the joint intelligence committee directly addressing smith i dont know admitted the mi directorgeneral and until i do we cant close anything down nor in my opinion should we consider exchange negotiations involving their diplomats theyre our only bargaining lever we shouldnt surrender it any more than we should be panicked by suggestions of show trials and siberian imprisonment theyve scored an impressive pr coup and they know it they wont risk their advantage by putting sick men in jail were not asking your opinion rejected bland were ordering you to extricate yourselves and this government from a total unimaginable mess he looked around the table how do we find the damn man to get ourselves out of it i take it any thoughts of extracting his wife and daughter are abandoned ventured jane ambersom of course it does said bland irritably do you have a constructive point one of my responsibilities is american liaison why dont we ask their help in locating charlie muffin in moscow palmer broke the ensuing silence again whats your point the most obvious is utilizing more people in the search offered jane it would also widen the responsibility by letting an american involvement become known hes still your man challenged rebecca street eager to separate mi from direct accountability for charlie muffin jane smiled at the intervention not if we also let it be known that muffin is no longer in either of our services but instead that hes gone freelance moscow knows irena novikov is in america my american link here has told me moscow has asked for diplomatic access to her moscow will also know from their swoop on the rossiya and the observation theyll have stepped up on our embassy since charlies amsterdam disappearance that hes not working from there and from their lawyers talking to the arrested diplomats they know charlie isnt any longer living at his vauxhall flat theyll know he had access to natalias calls rebecca said trying again to deflate the other woman how could he have had that and discovered the numbers to which to reply without our resources doesnt your telephone have a remoteaccess facility to access calls from anywhere in the world mocked jane most peoples have charlies did mine has too both the amsterdam and manchester flights originated from england persisted the mi deputy so what dismissed the other woman freelancers can live wherever its most convenient for them to work cant they its a worthwhile suggestion accepted bland well keep it on the table as a contingency what we need more immediately is a positive rebuttal to their television footage thats being globally transmitted along with the accusations theyre making by now the media will have swamped manchester not just the travel firm but hunting every possible relative of the sixteen whove been arrested for every photograph and anecdote predicted rebecca desperate to come out ahead in the exchanges every interview will insist theyre not spies the prime minister or the foreign secretary wouldnt be lying to parliament declaring theyre entirely innocent of any russian accusation neither would the government in an official protest note to moscow what does the prime minister or the foreign secretary say if theyre challenged in the house about charlie muffin asked bland his tone hinting interest not rejection they wont be will they returned rebecca ready for the question charlie muffin isnt the name in the media headlines its malcolm stoat who doesnt exist again thered be no lie denying any knowledge of that name the russians have got photographs of charlie from his public exposure during the lvov affair said monsford emerging from his protracted silence so far they havent published them they could be waiting for just such a denial to wrongfoot us by releasing the pictures he was never named either as charlie muffin or malcolm stoat at any of those public appearances smith pointed out there could be another reason why they havent released photographs suggested passmore his good arm across his body associating charlie with the failure of their lvov operation you mean too quickly anticipated monsford i dont mean that at all dismissed passmore that lvov failed isnt publicly known any more than that his death was a coverup fsb assassination what is publicly known is that stepan lvov was killed within weeks of a man being murdered in the grounds of the british embassy with which charlie was publicly associated this is becoming convoluted protested monsford to illustrate why we cant abandon charlie insisted passmore brusquely to abandon him would need our withdrawing all the support in place in moscow which would include presumably the exit passports waiting at the embassy for natalia and the child weve all of us acknowledged that charlie would still try to get them out which he wouldnt stand a chance of doing hed get picked up and only then be photographically identified and accused not only of spying but also of being linkedopenly accused evenwith two assassinations on russian soil there was a longer digesting silence before monsford said theyd never be able to do that without the real truth coming out about lvov and all the others killed in the fsb cleanup putins put the straitjacket back on russia argued passmore its not as tight as it was at the height of the cold war but its enough for a public exposure thatll make what theyve staged so far look like an amateur rehearsal we covered the possibility of his arrest and trial during the buckinghamshire planning remembered monsford triumphantly whats to stop charlie exposing everything about the lvov business in court the straitjacket rejected aubrey smith at once charlie would have to be represented by a russian lawyer and get the agreement of the judge or the tribunal to make a statement in open court hed be silenced before he managed to speak ten words we could make sure the truth came out from here publicly if needs be argued monsford which with very little editing maybe no editing at all could be used as confirming evidence against charlie not exoneration in his favor punctured passmore are you saying we cant do anything agonized palmer im saying we cant cut charlie adrift no matter how much we want to and theres an obvious way thats taken us too long to reach to prevent charlie causing any more trouble said smith quietly and its not what youre thinking you did well stepping in to halt the panic aubrey smith congratulated his operations director as they walked across parliament square on their way back to the mi building turning to jane ambersom on his other side he went on and if it hadnt been for your input we wouldnt have reached the decisions we did it was rebecca streets idea how the hotel arrests could be honestly refuted said jane only just keeping the bitterness from her voice you initiated the discussion said smith and if you hadnt the way to lift charlie and close down the whole bloody business wouldnt have emerged they waited for a traffic change to cross to the abbey side passmore said simple and obvious if charlie does the simple and obvious thing by eventually approaching the embassy for the passports he asked me separately to provide from his maneuvering so far i dont expect him to come through the embassy gate with his hand out do you no admitted the directorgeneral at once but theres somehow somewhere got to be a personal exchange thats when and how well get him and once weve got him believe me hell never be allowed to cause any more trouble ever again i wish i were as confident as you cautioned passmore its satisfied our government masters for the moment smith pointed out which is all i wanted time and space in which to think of something better what about the others questioned the woman ever conscious of the puppetry of her former director do you trust monsford to go on working with us now no conceded smith as quickly as before i think he wants out he cant say so not after all the bullshit of seconding charlie to mi but im sure hes got cold feet what can we do to keep him onboard you tell me said smith emptily which creates another uncertainty we dont need said passmore matching the cynicism do tell me said smith abruptly turning his careless cliche into a demand stopping opposite the house of lords to confront jane ambersom you worked with monsford far better than we do how far would he go to shelter mi from any fallout shelter mi from any fallout echoed the woman contemptuously the only entity gerald monsford wants to shelter from fallout is gerald monsford and theres no limit whatsoever to what or where gerald monsford will go to guarantee that you cant mean that not really believe that disbelieved passmore ive never believed anything more in my entire life said jane theyd driven without speaking back to vauxhall cross both rebecca street and james straughan warned against any conversation by monsfords lowering the partitioning glass between them and the driver both remained silent until they reached the directors suite its time to press the button on the janus extraction monsford declared as he turned from activating the recording apparatus alert jacobson and the paris team at once theyre to liaise entirely through you as central control to establish youre in personal command the entire time everythings on standby ready isnt it to establish that youre in personal command the entire time wearily recognized straughan everythings on standby but it cant be immediately activated my orders were and are to have everything ready at a moments notice accused monsford why havent they been followed if the bastard wanted a provable record hed provide it for every later examination to hear in crystal clarity determined straughan ive just told you everythings in place ready but its got to be synchronized a flight plan has to be filed for the private plane thats to be waiting at orly for elana and andrei whose arrival there has to be coordinated to the minute their departure has to be coordinated with radtsics flight from moscow if just one coordinate falls out of sequence the extraction collapses into chaotic disaster ten times worse than that weve already got i didnt ask for a lecture on tradecraft im not lecturing on tradecraft refuted straughan his nerves inwardly in turmoil im setting out the logistical practicalities and before theyve even been put in motion elana and andrei have to be told to be ready at a precise time for their pickup in moscow a ticket has to be bought for radtsic and bookings made for his escorts on a direct commercial flight to london with no intermediary stopovers like amsterdam to prevent an fsb interception if theres an airport identification of radtsic but insufficient time to stop him which is a possibility we cant overlook because youve only just given me the instructions we dont yet know if there are available seats on that first convenient direct flight the lack of which is another possibility we cant overlook and if there arent available seats all the other timings have to be resynchronized and all right stopped monsford tight voiced how long twentyfour hours at the very earliest to guarantee that synchronization promised straughan allowing for inevitable setbacks we should get all three to london the day after tomorrow where a safe house is also set up fully staffed and protected youd better start at once to minimize those setbacks hadnt you what about the other business there is no other business except that which weve just discussed that and that alone nothing more said monsford straughan hesitated jacobson might need clarification of that isnt it your remit to clarify operational details demanded monsford over the last few days ive not felt that ive got your full support said monsford as the door closed behind straughan the recorder was still on rebecca thought i cant imagine whats given you that impression your opinions too often contrary to mine constructively and objectively expressed surely his risk was greater than hers rebecca decided he wasnt going to fuck her any other way than he was already and he was finding even that difficult to manage you sided with straughan against me how could he be so stupid with the apparatus running only objectively discussing whether or not to kill charlie muffin to create a distraction for radtsics defection which just a moment ago you decided against which puts us all in agreement doesnt it monsford smiled at her nothings being recorded i didnt turn it on the motherfucker was setting her up if things went wrong just as hed set up straughan and before that the ambersom woman to save his own repulsively fat ass i dont understand the connection between that remark and what were talking about dont you no she insisted her mind already ahead of her recovery i want your loyalty youve got that as well as my objectivity which is what i have always tried to contribute and what i want to continue contributing on the subject of which i think it would have been wise to disclose radtsics extraction at todays meeting todays meeting was about mis mess bland and palmer would have panicked and aborted the radtsic objective if id announced it and wed have lost him as it is well have radtsic and a huge coup and those across the river will have to clear up the shit charlie muffins left behind whose side would you rather be on the winning side answered rebecca honestly but not she decided that which included gerald monsford he smiled again thats what i wanted to hear and go on hearing shall we go home not tonight refused rebecca my periods started early and im not at all comfortable we could still eat together tomorrow lets have dinner tomorrow she had moreimportant things to occupy her mind than boring crap about helen of troy and gods in loincloths fighting bulls in underground caves it was dark by the time charlie got to the botanical gardens which he approached as cautiously as always stretching his outside checks on those entering or leaving for at least twenty minutes before finally going through the gate lingering even further on separate benches to satisfy himself it was safe and even then feigning interest in shrubbery and trees while making his way casually to the specific telephone the time switch had activated the interior light and before he reached it charlie saw the hopedfor marker and had to stop himself hurrying charlie had his own pravda partially rolled by the time he got into the cubicle and was leaning back to keep the door open while he completed his answering signal when the phone rang the jarring unexpectedness startling him for a moment he stared at it undecided letting it ring twice more before picking it up keeping an unfolded page of the newspaper against the mouthpiece to muffle voice recognition when he said da i know its you charlie i can see you said the voice he wanted to hear rebecca street said im glad ive caught you i was just leaving said straughan it wont take long promised the woman charlie didnt move halting the instinctive swing to look into the gardens the open pod by the first hothouse it was obvious too obvious he should have checked every approach not just that from the main entrance i hoped youd come prayed youd come i kept checking hoping youd remember i told you i was coming you didnt call pecatniko she demanded the alarm flaring of course i didnt call your apartment fortunately he thought discerning her fear how did you expect me to know then this was verging upon the surreal decided charlie i called the numbers from which you phoned street kiosks each of those you used we traced them i dont understand she protested i dont understand either are there people with you there was a pause im alone i really dont understand there was none of the tension that thered been in her voice on the vauxhall answering machine you can move around another pause so far her voice was calmer charlie judged what about surveillance you taught me how to clear my trail remember charlie felt a stir of unease it had been little more than early relationship game playing not proper dedicated training although shed undergone that at kgb academies wheres sasha summer school hed forgotten the school semester dates and the additional privileges to which sasha was entitled as the daughter of a senior state intelligence officer im at the mira hotel there was something like a laugh but it was muffled you did remember it all didnt you we need to talk yes leave first now walk past me and through the main gate wait on the first bench outside about twenty meters down on the left side of the road in the direction of the hotel and i mean wait i wont approach you until im absolutely sure youre clear i told you ive guaranteed that wait youve seen something someone flared the demand again i need to be absolutely sure go now what if im not clear the fear was definitely there im in room fortysix call it tomorrow morning ten thirty from another street kiosk i should have agreed to come before shouldnt i not been so stupid until it was too late there was the slightest catch in natalias voice move now weve been talking too long charlie kept the dead phone to his ear seemingly still talking turning at last to see natalia go by she did so without looking toward his kiosk walking steadily but not hurrying she was wearing a headscarf which she rarely did prompting charlies recollection of their discussing the use of a head covering for a change of appearance wondering if the nowbelted raincoat had a differentcolor reversible lining he was concerned at a couple the man visibly older than the woman who appeared to follow closely behind natalia until they settled on a bench and began fumbling each other under the imagined cover of the inadequate halflight there was no other even vaguely suspicious pursuit and charlie replaced the receiver taking both newspapers with him as he moved in the opposite direction from the main entrance against what would have been any professionally recognizable surveillance upon natalia separately dropping each newspaper into a different refuse bin he studiously ignored the open pod from which natalia had spoken but hesitated as if seeking a direction to study everywhere around it relieved again at detecting nothing he continued until he reached a bisecting junction taking the righthand path to a side exit from which he looped along the outside road to the main highway charlie picked natalia out long before he reached her the raincoat already reversed and was sure she saw him although she gave no indication when he reached her she said ive caused a lot of trouble havent i nothing i cant sort out he said wishing he believed it natalia finally backed away from the embrace in which theyd held each other neither speaking each satisfied by the feel and touch of the other she grimaced around the hotel room as they parted and said this isnt what ive got special memories of try to keep them as they were sit on the chair not the bed there are things that bite natalia did as she was told frowning as charlie perched himself cautiously on the very edge of the bed she said the fsb have been in turmoil ever since lvovs killing not just at the lubyanka but in a lot of outstations too ive inferred a lot but therell be a lot more i havent got right itll help to fill in the missing parts if you go first charlie started awkwardly unprepared needing initially to go back and elaborate until he got the chronology in order realizing that for the very first time he was actually sharing espionage intelligence with her at first natalia gazed directly at him intent on everything he said but gradually dropped her head in what charlie guessed to be either contemplation or disbelief or a combination of both charlie began imagining it would be a long explanation and was surprised how quickly he finished for what seemed a long time almost as long as theyd clung to each other natalia remained with her head bowed until he finally said natalia it was still several moments before she brought her face up her hands too as if wanting to shield the frowned shadowed expression that charlie couldnt read until unevenvoiced she stumbled i got so much wrong didnt understand so much dear god im so sorry and he realized she was genuinely deeply frightened i said i could sort things out natalia shook her head not this time charlie and its me whos trapped you so because you wont be able to get away again god only knows what theyll do to you now i need to understand encouraged charlie who from the beginning had found a dichotomy between natalias piety and her profession in which hed never recognized any religion or any creed i got so much wrong made so many mistakes she said again i have to understand what youre talking about natalia tell me all of it she didnt begin at once and groped for the words when she finally started needing twice to stop and start again it was the body at the embassy i knew thats what you were here for the last time you made that much clear when we met and then there was television i did what i promised then made all the plans to follow you back to england realized how stupid id been for so long not to have come with you when you asked me sorry for that sorry for so much i didnt know what happened of course not when you left so quickly didnt understand your last call that i couldnt come after all and then there was the lvov killing and the others that followed i guessed there had to be a connection although i couldnt understand what it was because you were back in england when it happened i didnt guess a connection until i was called in called in interrupted charlie following her so far but wanting absolute clarity you were interrogated a formal interrogation recorded and transcribed for me to sign about us how much about us she was recovering becoming more coherent about your defection how you tricked me nothing more natalia shook her head just your faked defection and my debriefing all that time ago id sanitized everything i could retrieve from those old kgb files after we got together you knew i had to keep us safe i obviously had to leave some details though in case there was a crossreference which there must have been i dont know about that but it can only have been picked up after you left this last time the first session didnt start out as hostile it took your idea to change the original file to indicate youd been passed on to another moresenior interrogator after me which id done to prevent myself being held responsible for your going back to england then i was able to say id doubted your defection which was why you had been transferred up the line you said the first session wasnt hostile did things change broke in charlie again to keep natalia on track she nodded once more i thought it was all over after that first interview that id satisfied them the tone changed when i was recalled a week later they wanted to know why i hadnt recognized you from the publicity on the embassy killing and flagged it up what did you say that i simply hadnt recognized you from television or newspaper photographs but they didnt believe you the third interrogation came after another week i had to identify what newspapers and television id seen and was ordered to identify you from a collation of photographs and freezeframes you werent in four sections of the collation obviously testing me for a reaction which i didnt give it wasnt actually difficult ive been on the other side catching people out in debriefings for almost twenty years after all what did you do replied as i knew i had to reply stuck to my denial i insisted thered only been three debriefings before you were transferred that it had all been ten years ago and that i genuinely didnt remember or recognize you you think they believe you i dont know thereve been three occasions when i thought i was under surveillance and i am not sure about my telephone thats why i made the calls i did from public booths as you always told me to i told you i called back i still dont understand that our technical people checked the supposition was that youd been forced to make the calls under duress that any replies would be recorded i chose the phones myself at random no one was with me forcing me to do or say anything the feeling was one of numbness an unreal sensation hed never before experienced of being suspended without any control over himself too much surmise and supposition he thought situations virtually invented where nothing at all needed invention he could so easily have come back alone needing only false passports to be available from the embassy and simply flown back to london with them thered been no need for the amsterdam switch or the tourist diversion no need for sixteen terrified people to be arrested it wasnt just you who made mistakes i made far too many but ive trapped you trapped you and all the others you came in with theyll be released eventually eventually not immediately qualified natalia the fsb know youre here now those poor people will be used and when theyre released you wont be among them every way out is going to be locked down against you this far theyd been looking backward charlie acknowledged hearingbut not acceptingnatalias defeat now they had to look in the opposite direction no not yet charlie stopped himself at a sudden stillbackward thought theres something else from what youve just told me theres no way the fsb could have learned my london telephone number no they couldnt natalia frowned what about my address in london pressed charlie natalias frown deepened how could they i dont know it whys this important it would increase her nervousness if he told her of the fsb burglary its something that happened in london nothing to do with us here he hesitated needing to ask her about what had appeared an assignation between natalia and sashas schoolteacher during his previous return igor karakov i didnt know he was going to be at gorky park for you to see sasha i told you that until that last time i never knew if you were ever coming back if i was ever going to change my mind about coming to you igor and i were only ever friends never lovers i told you my decision it was you who told me i couldnt come then there were the interrogations and now its too late now its all over no it isnt insisted charlie nothings all over were not over ill get you and sasha out and we are going to be together i want so much to believe you it had been a stupid mistake to go sideways to give way to jealousy are you still at the lubyanka you havent been suspended or moved to other duties in contrast to how shed slumped earlier natalia fixed charlie in a very direct stare this is not what we talk about not how weve ever talked charlie felt the slightest twitch of irritation a reaction toward her so rare that he couldnt remember a previous occasion im not asking for your betrayal im trying to find a way out for the three of us if i dont find that way out if you dont help me find it i cant imagine what your service will do to you just as you cant imagine what theyd do to me the one thing i dont need to imagineknow for a positive incontrovertible certaintyis what will happen to sasha do you want her from the moment of our arrests to be put into a state orphanage until shes fifteen and then thrown out literally onto the street nowhere to go no one to help or guide her except the brothel traffickers waiting outside to teach her the only way shell be able to survive natalia began to cry which shed never before done in front of him and charlie was shocked at his own outburst unable to believe hed attacked her as he had not an attack he tried to console himself what had needed to be said finally to get her out of the cocoon into which she wanted to retreat rather than confront the reality of where and how they now were you hear what im saying understand what im saying it would have been better if id understood a long time ago wouldnt it she sobbed because all the factors were in place like already tested lights simply needing to be turned on james straughan adhered strictly to monsfords insistence upon unbreakable security by deciding personally to flick all the switches delegating to no one unlike americas cia mi does not maintain its dedicated clandestine aircraft facilities but has feepaying call upon that under the foreign office budget availability of both aircraft and crew was reconfirmed together with morning and evening flight plans protectively stretched over the next four consecutive days into and out of orly from northolt military airfield on the outskirts of london the spread adjustable to all the other timedictated coordinates while straughan remained on the secure line from the vauxhall cross communication center the duty officer at the mi rezidentura at the paris embassy relayed the intended rendezvous with elana radtsic to finalize the russians immediate readiness to move straughan stayed on hold for the time it took harry jacobson to go from the rezidentura to the totally secure basement communications chamber of the moscow embassy his confidence growing at the smoothness with which everything was slotting into its required place whats todays drama cynically greeted the moscow station chief there isnt one assured straughan its to be a straight extraction on the first available direct flight guarantee theres availability for the three escorts wholl be traveling with you give me the flight as soon as you can for them to make their independent reservations what about the side issues demanded jacobson canceled i thought the director would have told you there was a momentary pause as the relief swept through jacobson the tv channels here have been virtually cleared for nonstop repeats of the hotel seizures its been media pandemonium here too anyone got any idea where muffin is we dont know and dont care and thats official you okay personally not catching any shit as okay as ill ever be you think you can fix a flight tomorrow youre the trigger for everything else ill get back to you as soon as i can ill be here waiting straughan separately made his alert calls from the communications room to radtsics independent escorts and had just reentered his office when the summons came on his internal line you got a moment asked rebecca street im waiting for callbacks ill come to you straughan hesitated it sounds important it is ill try promised natalia dryeyed again after charlies limited explanation it wont be easy dont risk anything to draw attention to yourself insisted charlie urgently just listen for any rumors or gossip from which i might be able to make some sense upon which depended david hallidays getting something more concrete balanced charlie whod held back from telling natalia of his earlier encounter with the man worried that it might further unsettle her theres still a lot of both at the lubyanka the turmoil hasnt subsided yet im surprised some of it appears to have got into newspapers here particularly after putins media clampdown i suspect theyre intentionally planted why i dont know ill try to get a steer on that too without taking any risks repeated charlie i heard you the first time remember what else i said i will get all of us out safely natalia looked steadily at him for several moments if you say so she looked slightly away to the infested bed i cant stay i need to be at pecatnikov if theres anything from sashas summer school she hesitated or anyone else i wasnt going to ask you to stay as much as i want you to i want to tell you again how dont stopped charlie positively keeping one step ahead is the only thing to worry about from now on which was virtually the same sentiment expressed in virtually the same words exchanged at that moment between rebecca street and james straughan in their riverbordering building almost eighteen hundred miles away in london it was several minutes before andrei radtsic his face drained his head shaking in disbelief managed brokenly to speak i dont understand what youre telling me i still dont not properly admitted elana there must be something now elana shook her head your father says this is the only way andrei moved aimlessly around the apartment fingering objects picking up and putting down he turned back gesturing openarmed everything will be over finished your job at the university me here what i might have done i cant take it in your father says it will all work out eventually i dont want to do it any of it i wont do it you go both of you leave me we cant do that youll be seized jailed used in some way to get us back to moscow andrei stood on the other side of the room shaking his head again but not speaking tell me about the girl yvette shes living here with me blurted andrei she stayed away for us to talk for me to find out why you came so unexpectedly but shell be back we didnt know shed moved in it hasnt been long do you love her i dont know does she love you i dont know he said again were going to be called at this number who by the british what to be told how were being got out i dont want this any of this neither do i my darling but we havent a choice maxim radtsics insistence upon resuming their meetings to discuss the leadup arrangements only slightly diminished harry jacobsons satisfaction that the entire illconceived haphazardly planned affair was soon to be over jacobson matched radtsics insistence by decreeing the bolshoi as their venue for the very first of his personal celebrations jacobson was a ballet fanatic and swan lake his favorite but that night his fear of entrapment superceded his enjoyment of the performance freed as he now was from the absurd assassination diversion as well as safely shepherding radtsic to london jacobson was able to look past the immediate to the promotions so clearly open to him for what hed doneand been unarguably prepared to do it was objectively accepted that despite the facile diplomatic charade of cover embassy titles and descriptions russian intelligence knew the identities of most if not all british espionage officers in moscow just as mi and mi knew the identities of most if not all russian operatives in london that was how each country was so quickly able to match the other agent for agent in titfortat spy expulsions and why jacobson knew that within days hours even of radtsics defection the fsb would identify him as the mi control whod flown out on the same plane as their deputy executive chairman which following that inevitability to its only conclusion made absolutely impossible his return to moscow about which apart from the ballet he had no regrets there was the slight blip in jacobsons reasoning at the brevity of his moscow posting until he balanced that brevity to be in his favor rather than against a fitting and deserving reward he doubted thered ever been in this or any other hostile country another mi station chief who after just months had landed a catch as big as a deputy head of intelligence and this wasnt any other hostile country this was the hostile country the russian federation led by a man so determined upon a new even more frigid cold war that hed openly threatened a westernfacing missile fence across central europe after crushing the upstart former republic of georgia as brutally as thenczechoslovakia and hungary had been crushed at the height of communism jacobson judged washington his most logical move the posting for which this impending coup most qualified him but jacobson believed himself a true and natural european and genuinely supported its union of nations paris was traditionally viewed as the promotional jewel in the diplomatic crown and of all his intelligence career ladderscrambling jacobson had most enjoyed his earlier tour in the french capital although its ballet lacked the tingling magic of that approaching its intermission before him for which jacobson was ready rising as the curtain fell for the encounter ritual of checking radtsic for unwelcome interest before the russian assured himself that jacobson was also clear which by strict tradecraft interpretation he wasnt although there was no possibility of radtsics becoming aware of his three other intended escorts the only purpose for whose presence was physically to identify the man whose uninterrupted flight they had to guarantee and of whose identity jacobson himself was unaware their bolshoi attendance had been independently arranged by straughan after jacobsons choice of meeting place jacobson established himself in the shadow of a pillar close to the bar entrance after very intentionally ordering the twiceasexpensive french over russian champagne in another early celebration of his anticipated career advancement radtsic bulldozed his way into the salon with his accustomed autocratic swagger ignoring the protests of two separate groups in front of which he forced himself to be served the swagger remained while he moved back into the nowcrowded room although away from where jacobson watched tonights safety signal from the protection of another pillar deeper within the room was for radtsic to consult but quickly pocket his program which he did more quickly than jacobson had expected jacobson didnt hurry to respond doublechecking his own surroundings irritated by radtsics open look of expectation before he reached the man ready at last greeted the russian sardonically everythings fixed yes when the nine am british airways flight the day after tomorrow why not tomorrow radtsic instantly demanded jacobson maneuvered his back to the pillar as much to mark radtsic for the three unknown watching escorts who according to straughan knew his identity from photographs as for his own protective view of the chandeliered room this is the first completely suitable available flight upon which you can be fully escorted its an unnecessary delay it ensures your greatest security insisted jacobson how persisted radtsic its a direct flight removing stopover interception our people will be onboard who i dont even know their identities and go through sheremetyevo more quietly what are you talking about questioned the other man coloring the way you walk your whole attitude attracts attention radtsics face reddened i dont expect or want to be addressed like this and i dont want all thats been arranged for your benefit to collapse with your wife and son already out of the country by your focusing attention on yourself as youve done at every meeting weve had he shouldnt have given way to the annoyance jacobson warned himself in less than fortyeight hours hed be rid of the arrogant bastard it took radtsic several moments to compose himself what are the arrangements we have to meet one more time tomorrow night ill tell you the place and the time by cell phone at tomorrows meeting ill give you your ticketa return obviously although youre not coming backand your passport both are in the name of ivan petrovich umnov the passport is authentically russian so it cant be challenged neither can the exit visa from here nor the entry documentation into britain to which will be attached all the british accreditation for an international engineering conference genuinely being held in birmingham thats your cover youre an engineer specializing in mineraldrilling machinery ill also give you one hundred pounds in sterling with the currencyexchange receipts and all the birmingham contact information including an apparently confirmed appointment with yuri panin the current deputy trade minister at the russian embassy in london jacobson drank heavily from his champagne glass needing it radtsic the color gone said your service is very efficient as yours is acknowledged jacobson is there anything weve omitted or that isnt clear to you where is this place birmingham in the middle of the country what about you asked radtsic are you accompanying me that hasnt been positively decided lied jacobson selfprotectively my job is to ensure your unhindered passage onto the plane at heathrow youll be taken from the plane ahead of other passengers youll be taken direct to a waiting car tell me about elana and andrei everything is governed by your departure that schedule has elana and andrei arriving in england ahead of you because of the time difference between russia and france they will be waiting at the safe house already prepared radtsic smiled i would like to tell them tonight how close everything is no ordered jacobson in quietvoiced urgency itll be madness to attempt contact now the resumption bell echoed throughout the salon radtsic said nothing but his face had colored again give me your solemn undertaking you wont try to make contact i wont make contact said the russian where have you been the arrangement was six its almost eight from the subdued noise in the background charlie guessed david halliday was in a bar the underlying jazz was modern the occasional snatched lyric in english where are you the savoy when you didnt call i came looking for you here charlie had lived at the savoy close to red square during the embassykilling investigation id hardly be likely to stay there with everyone and his dog looking for me i told you this morning that i need to know where to find you and i told you the diplomatic debacle thered beas well as the end of your career and pension with itif the fsb picked up our association by electronically scanning your mobile phone which they probably do automatically to all embassy personnel im calling you from a public telephone the number of which youll find when you access the lastnumber display on your phone which i know youll do just as i know you tried to follow me on the metro charlie listened to the background of ella fitzgeralds summertime which had been the bartenders favorite cd when hed stayed there he had to buy more russian cell phones he reminded himself still refusing to trust the one issued to him in london it was several moments before the mi man said i thought we were working together we are right now and if weve got anything to talk about i dont want you doing so from a bar stool where you can be overheard you think im that stupid yes if youre already topping up the lunchtime vodka thought charlie youve got this number on your phone call me back on an outside line in five minutes if i dont hear by six minutes ill leave this kiosk charlies phone rang in three halliday said i didnt want to keep you waiting shit though you are thats considerate of you said charlie allowing the other man the weak retaliation where are you now looking at lenins tomb theres no one within fifty meters of me did you get into jacobsons safe i couldnt take the risk he was around all afternoon except that he wasnt that doesnt make sense he spent almost two hours in the communications room i couldnt risk going into his office not knowing when hed come back when he did he timelocked the door and left early what are you reading into that somethings about to happen its being finalized or already has been finalized too sweeping an assessment wondered charlie in an ongoing situation or assignment officers have to log their whereabouts or provide a contact procedure any contact with jacobson has to be patched through london a better indicator of something imminent judged charlie how often has he done that before today todays the first time and just after he left there was an internal call from the embassy travel officer they wouldnt tell me what it was about leave a message even more leaves swirled by differently blowing winds to go with those already disturbed by my meeting with natalia thought charlie is that all youre being judged shit of this or any other year by who else apart from you the team that was sent in actually naming me all they need to name is the rossiya theyre sitting around in the embassy bar complaining their being here is a waste of time now are they being recalled urgently demanded charlie i havent heard about a recall but im being kept on the outside i cant ask it was difficult to gauge the furor in london from newspapers and tv here but cancellation of natalias extraction had to be a danger losing the manpower wasnt his concern losing natalia and sashas exit passports were and he guessed the documentation would be sent back in the diplomatic bag if the extraction team was recalled its important i know if the order comes from london you havent told me why you didnt call at six as we arranged in fact you havent told me anything so far its a oneway street everything from me nothing from you in return so far echoed charlie knowing he had to limit his response fractionally short of an outright threat an explanation easily ready you know how so far extends it extends to just short of eight hours from the time we met within minutes of that meeting both of us watching the rossiya i told you to stop feeling sorry for yourself which im telling you again now were both outside whatever the hells going on which i also told you neither of us is going to survive which im determined to do with or without you sharing out who tells whom what like children counting chocolate buttons to ensure theyve all got the same im the one the fsb is looking for the fall guy remember and i did remember thought back to how we met and how quickly we had to get out so quickly i didnt check for cctv cameras that might have picked us up together as we ran thats why i was late calling tonight i went back to check the possibility of you being at the same risk as me by such a photograph which you werent so that precious ass and that precious pension of yours isnt on any line there arent any cameras that could have caught us which charlie had known from scouring the area when hed first discovered the hotel wasnt under fsb surveillance im sorry and thank you you going back to the embassy i wasnt planning to therell be no point in a ten oclock call tomorrow ill postpone it until later ill be waiting so will i thought charlie his problem was not knowing what he was waiting for jane ambersom was in that delicious aftersex suspension between screamaloud exhilaration which shed had and velvetsoft contentment wanting to drift that way forever which she couldnt but intended recapturing as often and as long as she could you okay perfect she mumbled into barry elliotts shoulder looping one leg wetly over both of his everythings wonderful i dont want it ever to end neither do i that had been a ridiculous thing to say why had she let herself be lulled like that lets not talk about it elliott loosened the arm hed had around her holding her to him i didnt start it stop she had to stop this there might be something else to talk about what he asked no longer softly moving farther away something big how big major as big as lvov it could be bigger youll keep me ahead of the curve wont you you know i will she promised smiling into his shoulder as he pulled her back the discreet restaurant close to the pont ditalie was a rendezvous for illicit assignations its cubiclerecessed candlelit tables did not fully compete with the wallmirrored chaiselongueprovided salon particulaire of the belle epoch but some had entrance curtains to pull across for assured privacy jonathan miller hadnt chosen a curtained alcove for the introductory meeting with elana and andrei radtsic but he had made the reservation in person under the pseudonym bissette to ensure it suited their nonsexual seclusion he and abrahams arrived an hour early although separately and did not enter until both were independently satisfied there was no hostile surveillance as an additional precaution a third mi officer paul painter remained in albert abrahamss car to maintain protective alarmraising observation throughout their meal as they were shown to their banquette miller said from how he greeted us the maitre ds frightened were part of a gay gathering hed probably prefer that to knowing who we really are and why were here if elana and andrei show up qualified miller they didnt elana arrived precisely on time but alone and as both men rose to meet her miller said i wish i hadnt said that the station chief ordered chablis for elana and as the waiter left said why isnt andrei with you hes coming later said elana she was the epitome of parisian chic in a fitted black suit that heightened the blondness of her tightly coiled chignon is there a problem asked abrahams he said he has a late class and would join us when it finished so there is a problem said abrahams instinctively checking his watch which read elana sipped her wine not looking directly at either man he doesnt want to do it neither do i but youre here to meet us said miller we dont have a choice do we is that what andrei thinks pressed abrahams its what ive tried to convince him im not sure that i have what about you ive accepted i have to run leave everything andrei cant stay insisted miller shaking his head against the waiters approach for their order i know you cant have more time to persuade him maxim mikhailovichs flight has been booked urged miller everything is arranged to a schedule i know that too thats why im here will you come with us without andrei i dont want to face that choice is it the girl yvette suggested abrahams elana shrugged i dont know i dont think so although they seem very close shes very pretty i like her if he doesnt come tonight well have to meet tomorrow said abrahams i really dont think youll have more success than me trying to persuade him cautioned elana well guarantee him a place at another university in england reading the same subject promised miller pretending to be someone he isnt reborn at the age of twenty said elana nodding to more wine its preferable to the alternative risked abrahams is it she demanded pointedly they ordered at eight oclock elana dismissively asking for a plain omelet both men choosing steak just as disinterestedly at elanas hinting look at the diminishing bottle miller reluctantly ordered a second chablis andrei arrived as their food was served refusing to eat but gulping the offered wine elana and the two mi officers only bothered with token gestures of eating we can understand your uncertainty said miller no you cant rejected andrei sharply we didnt create this situation tried abrahams were offering your only way out of it its not the only way out refused andrei loudly helping himself to more wine the only safe way out accepted abrahams is your relationship with yvette the problem risked miller andreis head came up demandingly all of its a problem yvette being one of them pressed miller of course all the preparations to get you out are made now said miller its possible when youre settled that we could bring yvette for a reunion theres no reason why she couldnt come to england is there could you do that seized andrei the hostility lessening i could suggest it when things settle what are the preparations for our leaving intruded elana its to be within the next thirtysix hours generalized miller well meet tomorrow for me to give you specific pickup arrangements ill call tomorrow to say where its really very simple youll be driven directly to an airfield where a private plane will be waiting you will be flown to london and reunited with maxim mikhailovich that same evening airfield or airport asked andrei that hasnt been decided yet lied miller it wont obviously be charles de gaulle theres a lot of facilities available all along the northern coast of france did you mean what you said about yvette asked andrei of course this is the only way for you all to stay together insisted abrahams i need more time demanded andrei you cant have more time refused abrahams its got to be now well be waiting for your call said elana the two men remained at their table after the russians left each waiting for the other to open the conversation it was abrahams who did the steaks too cold now well order more decided miller and get paul in from the car what do you think we could have a problem thats why i kept all the planning so vague do you think elana would leave without him i dont know miller shrugged london will never agree to the kid being reunited with his girlfriend of course they wont agreed miller but if it gets the awkward sod to england it wont matter will it hell be in the bag as he joined them painter said howd it go christ knows said abrahams lets order some more food and some decent red wine rebecca street was already in monsfords office when straughan entered neither looked at the other as he leaned sideways to start his recording system monsford said i want to hear everythings ready that nothing can go wrong the operations director waited until monsford straightened nodding to the unseen switch everything working as it should perfectly frowned monsford lets hope radtsics extraction does the same monsford sighed im due at the foreign office at eleven diplomatically everythings going to hell so lets get on with it shall we are we included in the meeting interrupted the woman monsford shook his head restricted to directors and government liaison their decision ill fill you in later straughan set out the operation chronologically with maxim radtsics am departure from his moscow apartment to the fsbs lubyanka headquarters at which hed remain for fifteen minutes with an additional five allowed as failsafe to establish his arrival hed assured jacobson his leaving so quickly afterward would not be logged according to lubyanka procedure he would be registered as being on the premises although absent from his desk thered be a staff voice mail that he was in unspecified conference as a precaution against an unexpected summons radtsic would keep his pager with him from lubyanka he would be followed separately throughout the briefly broken journey by jacobson and one of the three inflight escorts the other two would be waiting at sheremetyevo airport to ensure radtsics unimpeded arrival and passage through all the embarkation formalities radtsics arrival at sheremetyevo would be the signal for the private planes departure from northolt and for the paris rezidentura to pick up radtsics wife and son for orly where the landing and departure were factored for one hour which again included a failsafe for unexpected delay straughan expected the linkup and takeoff to take no longer than thirty minutes by that time radtsic would be airborne and beyond interception with just three hours flying time from heathrow there transport and clearedinadvance arrival would already be in place an hour earlier the plane carrying elana and andrei would have landed at northolt from where they would be taken to the prepared safe house in hertfordshire to await radtsic straughan rose as he finished talking glancing imperceptibly although blankly at rebecca to put in front of monsford the thin file from which hed recited the details everythings there annotated against the timings nine thirty tomorrow morning monsford at once challenged why not today i told you i wanted it all over as quickly as possible and i made it clear we needed seat availability reminded straughan nine thirty tomorrow was the first direct flight with four seats available is radtsic all right about that jacobsons concerned at radtsics demeanor warned straughan jacobson says hes arrogant walks around expecting doors to be opened for him and people to stand aside i had all three independent escorts at the ballet last night when radtsic was given his escape itinerary two of them told me this morning they hadnt needed jacobson as their marker radtsic looks so much like stalin which gets him too many second looks when his arrogance isnt on display have jacobson tell the stupid bugger to behave jacobson says he already has but doesnt think radtsic will do as hes told straughan paused it doesnt stop there radtsic announced he wanted to talk to elana in paris to tell her it was all set jesus exploded monsford it cant fuck up over stupidity like this it wont promised straughan im just setting it all out including the unpredictables is jacobson seeing radtsic again hes got to hand over the cover passport and tickets today tell him hes got to spell out to radtsic the risk to which hes putting himself putting everyone his wife and son most of all theres something else continued straughan ive made it very clear to jacobson that charlie muffins assassination as a diversion is aborted that everythings canceled weve got three of our people in muffins support team with nothing to support after what happened yesterday at the rossiya i want to utilize at least one of them to be embassy liaison between radtsics escorts and me here in london i need to know that radtsic passed safely through sheremetyevo to activate in their right order all the other stages of the extraction no irritably refused monsford why have you waited until now to bring this up you knew wed need a pivot for the schedule to work we intended using charlie muffins killing as a diversion for radtsics extraction muffin was never going to leave moscow and neither were his wife and child said straughan we always had three of our own people available to be reassigned my understanding of yesterdays meeting and the disaster muffins caused is that natalia and sashas extraction is never going to happen yesterdays meeting didnt cancel the muffin extraction nothings canceled until that bloody mans been brought in and the danger hes created closed down corrected the director tightly i cant unilaterally transfer any of our people who might very well be needed in that closing down and we couldnt anyway risk such a reassignment leaking out ahead of our getting radtsic safely here it would disclose that all the time we were running a parallel operation using one to guarantee the success of the other straughan hesitated its essential we have four on radtsics extraction if i cant have one of our three ill have to take jacobson off to be my embassy link man he paused again or we could bring in david halliday i know you ordered against his involvement but all hes got to do is take jacobsons call from sheremetyevo and relay it to me here just two phone calls hallidays briefing could be strictly limited virtually telling him nothing except to pass jacobsons call to me in london now it was monsford who hesitated longer than the operations director okay we use halliday but limit the briefing as youve suggested no name theres another unpredictable announced straughan what else demanded monsford straughan gave his account of the previous nights paris encounter with elana and andrei in as much detail as hed recounted jacobsons moscow meeting and again at the end put a written report in front of the director i cant believe this said monsford incredulously doesnt the kid know whatll happen to him if he stays were meeting with them both again today monsford leaned forward over his desk tell miller to frighten the shit out of the kid and if he still fucks about to leave him tell miller to assemble a snatch squad to hold him long enough to get elana airborne and then let him go by tomorrow hell be in a siberian gulag with a lifetime to reflect his stupidity miller hopes elana will persuade him you just told me shes reluctant too reluctant but accepting reality youre the director of operations the man responsible for making this work threatened monsford dont for a moment forget that im never given the opportunity to forget said straughan the whole damn business has escalated out of any control announced geoffrey palmer the russians didnt just reject our note they refused to accept the ambassador sent him packing cap in hand after ensuring their media circus was assembled to see and photograph the entire humiliation and then kept them there to do it all over again when the ambassador respondedas he diplomatically had to respondto their summons to deliver the rejected note theyre refusing us consular access to those theyve arrested as well as the two heart attack victims one of whose condition is reported to be giving cause for concern i cant ever remember this degree of orchestrated diplomatic contempt incredible sympathized sir archibald bland incredible and completely unsatisfactory as well as being totally unacceptable the cabinet decided this morning to summon the russian ambassador in return for an official protest note were also refusing their lawyers access to their arrested diplomats here which technically breaches the agreed consular code well have eventually to concede causing us further humiliation when we do but well string it out as long as we can in the hope of getting in to see our tourist group i dont think theyll blink first cautioned palmer neither does the cabinet admitted bland the doubleact confrontation clearly rehearsed so tell us youve got the bloody man whos caused all this we havent yet admitted aubrey smith and until he makes contact which hes got to do at some stage we dont know where to look which the russians are clearly expecting us to do to lead them to muffin my people are convinced theres a higher than customary degree of surveillance on the embassy and everyone going in and out are you getting the same indication bland asked monsford the mi director shifted more concerned at the potential danger to the radtsic extraction than at not having heard until that moment about a heightened embassy observation tighter than usual certainly he lied what we surely need is something more embarrassing with which to confront the russians the purpose of this meeting is to explore practicalities not daydreams criticized bland i dont want us even to consider anything that might blow up in our faces to compound a disaster into a total catastrophe i want that the government wants that completely understood by both of you so do you completely understand what ive just told you i most definitely understand replied smith i was trying to explore logic more than daydreams monsford defensively tried to recover disappointed at the brusque dismissal of what hed hoped would prepare them for radtsic its inevitably going to dominate the house again today as well as tomorrow mornings headlines predicted bland are you both telling me theres absolutely nothing to add from yesterday absolutely nothing conceded smith his normally soft voice little more than a mumble youll know the minute i do that weve got muffin under wraps which wont provide any counterpublicity will it if there is any news of muffin it will obviously come from my colleagues service said monsford determined to distance himself and mi equally determined upon what would later be recognized as proactive thinking he added and ill alert you at once to anything else that could be relevant and palmer and bland were a blink away from tears of gratitude at the hope of a balancing embarrassment for the russians boasted monsford ending his account of the foreign office encounter you didnt take the hint about radtsic any further than that asked straughan once more he ignored the woman as monsford activated the recording equipment glad hed postponed their intended conversation after the earlier morning session only the merest wisp of hope said monsford smiling hed omitted blands edict against counterbalancing the russian maneuvering theyll recognize what i was talking about by this time tomorrow that we werent just sitting around on our hands aubrey smith was practically whimpering like an abandoned dog isnt there a risk of our being criticized for keeping it to ourselves suggested rebecca palmer and bland are sitting on their hands as well shit scared of anything else going wrong dismissed monsford i wasnt going to risk a lastminute abandonment working through monsfords mixed metaphor was like wading through mud thought rebecca you dont sound very impressed by any of them unlike janus theyre only looking in one direction over their shoulders to protect their backs monsford sneered juggling his responses you made it clear to jacobson hes got to rein in radtsic straughan nodded i didnt just reinforce it to jacobson i personally spoke to halliday there cant be the slightest misunderstanding how did halliday take it asked rebecca he complained at being sidelined not being treated as a senior operative did he now mocked monsford what did you tell him that being a senior officer he knew the golden espionage rule that operational security dictates that agents are only told what its individually essential for them to know for their part of an assignment did he accept that questioned rebecca what he accepted was that he didnt have an alternative qualified straughan what he did say was that he should have been given more responsibility i definitely shouldnt have left him in moscow after the last clearout said monsford bring him out the moment this is all over which brings us to a connected situation seized straughan jacobson pointed out that hell obviously be identified by the fsb as radtsics escape control theres no way he can return to moscow monsford shrugged frowning whats the relevance of that right now bringing radtsic in is going to be a hell of a coup not just for the service but for jacobson personally and give the government the recovery it needs jacobson is staking his claim early for a fitting recognition monsford sniggered derisively hes doing what putting himself forward to be station chief in washington dc or paris his preference is paris monsford sniggered again if we werent as close as we are id consider abandoning the extraction seriously concerned that harry jacobson had suffered a mental problem id diagnose inflated grandeur harry jacobsons future is one of the furthest thoughts from my mind and will probably stay that way for a long time to come if he mentions it again tell him theres absolutely no reason for him to take a frenchlanguage course or learn the words of the star spangled banner ill let you tell him when he gets here said straughan sighing whens he handing over the passport and tickets to radtsic monsford pressed on unaware of the other mans contempt now replied straughan ready for the demand well reconvene this afternoon decided monsford as they walked together from the directors office rebecca said its turning out to be a crowded day productive though agreed straughan the deputy director waited until they were in the outside corridor before saying shall we wait until after the final meeting probably best straughan agreed once more could you see yes said rebecca were doing the right thing i hope so said the man trust me said rebecca that was his problem acknowledged straughan he didnt trust her any more than he trusted gerald monsfod in whom he had no trust whatsoever hed been overconfident charlie muffin admitted to himself hed swung from overcaution to overconfidence instilled by overanalyzing the overly suspicious to end up where he was now overwhelmed by discrepancies by far the worst had been his mistakenly imagining natalias fearprompted telephone calls connected to the provable fsb burglary and staged the amsterdam deception to evade an imagined entrapment and by so doing provided the russians with the propaganda field day they were utilizing to their fullest advantage but from what halliday told him charlie was sure hed correctly judged that the rescue extraction for natalia and sasha had all along been a sacrificial diversion for something entirely separate would he have compromised destroyed even that separate operation as hed now so badly endangered his chances of getting natalia and sasha out it would be a fitting retribution if he had inadvertent though it would have been but that wasnt his major concentration more immediate was covering his selfdug pitfalls safely his hopes of doing that had soared after establishing contact with david halliday and then so quickly afterward with natalia both had leaked away during the nearsleepless selfanalyzing night and flattened even more with the first of his arranged contacts with natalia while acknowledging it to be understandable charlie was still disappointed that natalias previousday deflation hadnt lifted his overnight thinking had concluded that while his mistakes made natalia and sashas rescue hugely more difficult it was possible as long as he remained undetected natalia in total contrast appeared to have sunk into acceptance of inevitable disaster shed dismissed the misconceptions as being his not her fault and heaped further remorse on herself for not having anything to offer from the lubyanka trying to break her mood charlie actually accused her of selfdefeat and selfpity and now entering another kiosk for his second arranged call of the day was unsure if he hadnt been too severe on her can you talk charlie opened without identifying himself when halliday answered im not sure not anymore charliee stomach dipped why not im back on board which i know youre not its different now if halliday completely believed hed been reintegrated hed have put down the telephone the moment hed recognized his voice i believed in london that i was on board too remember thats your problem to sort out i did by realizing in time that i was the chosen fall guy hurried charlie sure he was keeping the anxiety from his voice remember that too you really believe youre fully back in the loop thats what youve got to be absolutely convinced of that and something equally important that youre absolutely safe thats the magic word safety you got the absolute guarantee of that david or arent you suspicious that having been excluded from everything until now youve been picked out as the sacrificial fall guy now they dont have me for the job bite you squirming bastard charlie thought swallow the fucking hook i can look after myself he was unsure that wasnt the impression i got yesterday nothing can go wrong inside an embassy halliday was the point man seized charlie and didnt know enough of his last moscow assignment to identify a manipulation of course nothing can go wrong inside an embassy you know what i wouldnt be at all surprised if that wasnt the thinking of that poor sod for whose murder i was last here you know the one killed in the embassy grounds its not the same protested halliday weakly he certainly wasnt the same when they finished with him pressured charlie did you hear how he was tortured he only had one arm and they used acid to take off the fingertips of the one hand he still had to stop his being identified they took his eyes out too and his tongue all while he was alive charlie could hear uneven gulped breathing from the other man our being able to talk like this means youre in the rezidentura by yourself wheres everyone else do you know how you fit into the complete picture it was you who reminded me how operations are compartmented blurted halliday which i shouldnt have needed to tell you coaxed charlie sure he had the other man well and truly on his line its the first lesson hammered home but i never accepted it it was such an obvious oneway ticket to the cliff edge i kept the golden rule always in the forefront of my mind as i was told to and on every assignment i worked my ass off breaking it to find out as much as i could about what i wasnt supposed to know which wasnt disobedience or disloyalty or any contravention of any official secrets act it was to keep myself alive in an environment in which were also taught were indispensable until that rules changed for a greater indispensable need and why im still alive and youre all by yourself in an empty rezidentura without a fucking clue what youre doing and wont be told if you ask the only thing you can be sure about is that you dont know whether youre going to get a pat on the back or a knife stuck into it the breathing was heavier and more uneven although charlie didnt believe halliday was actually breaking down there was eventually a word that charlie didnt catch but then it came again and charlie heard bastards why are they bastards charlie asked at once not wanting to lose the momentum hed created keeping me out treating me like this hed made another mistake with halliday charlie acknowledged although not as great as mi by inducting halliday he didnt any longer think hallidays constant sideways shuffle from difficulty was his pension concern it was an abject terror of a job hed got but never wanted once hed discovered what it entailed and from which hed always been running im here to help you help yourself david i can get you safely through this if you trust me it is the extraction i thought it was he still had to be careful halliday didnt spit the hook out who janus the code names janes i told you that more selfjustification charlie recognized now the allimportant question whats the genuine identity all i know is janus thats the name ive got to use calling straughan you havent managed to get back into jacobsons safe i cant break the combination either into his office or the safe itself it had to be a major extraction for the mi operations director to be personally involved tell me about janus its the launch code itll be specific demanded charlie professionally janus has gone thats the green code janus has gone yes whats the red janus is stopped is it today there was the first hesitation im on twentyfourhour standby at the embassy another pause i already told you im working from inside who actually briefed you straughan confirmation that it was a major extraction decided charlie positively whos your relay here i dont know whats jacobsons function i dont know hed started to row back theyre really keeping you out arent they youre doing the same youre not telling me what youre going to do and i dont intend to thought charlie a decision half formed keep out of the way until your things over i dont understand i believe i was intended to be the disposable part in the janus extraction none of the special team is involved in janus challenged halliday how do you know that i asked straughan said i assumed they were on the same assignment that was when i got the compartmentalization argument he said they were nothing to do with it and that i should keep myself apart from them and why it had been easy persuading the paranoid halliday that he wasnt safe realized charlie they havent been withdrawn you think i should watch myself demanded halliday anxiously i dont think you should explore dark alleys with them goaded charlie they still ostracizing you in the commissary maybe not as much as in the beginning i had a couple of drinks with pat wilkinson last night i didnt get anything specific certainly not what theyre here for but one of the others denning i think it was said something about being pissed off hanging around not knowing what was happening getting indicators from halliday was like pulling teeth with eyebrow tweezers thought charlie nothing about me by name not that i heard keep in mind what i told you watch your back encouraged charlie why not bring the rossiya into the conversation see what their reaction is straughan told me to stay away dont you think straughan could have gone further than telling you to recite the sort of phrases youd use teaching a monkey to talk ridiculed charlie it feels good to know im safe how do you feel who are you really trying to help charlie me or yourself youll have your answer to that this time tomorrow promised charlie which was an exaggeration because his idea still wasnt completely formulated how the hell am i supposed to respond to that protested halliday by trying harder to break the door and safe combinations and thinking back over this conversation to decide if you gained anything by holding back as i know youve held back charlie heard the other man say no wait in the seconds before he replaced the phone whyd you keep me waiting demanded rebecca street we left gerald more than an hour ago i needed to guarantee the quality enhance it if necessary replied straughan easily gesturing to the recorder on the desk between them did you have to not at all which im glad about if the need arises to use it i dont want any technical indication of interference not that enhancement should register from where you were sitting were you able to see rebecca nodded he turned off during the references to the assassination and when he slagged off palmer and bland you did well getting a lot of that stuff on our copy praised straughan and you did even better returned the woman you think we should go on recording our meetings with him absolutely im not going to be his scapegoat like the ambsersom woman before me what odds would you give about tomorrow i dont gamble on things like this refused straughan stiffly when jacobson asked him directly about handing over the passport and tickets radtsic was adamant he hadnt called paris but theres no way we can be sure jacobson was certainly relieved by radtsics new attitude not a trace of the old arrogance weve done the right thing taking the precautions we have insisted rebecca unprompted and broken every rule and regulation in the book qualified straughan with every justification knowing the tricks geralds playing persisted the woman ill look after the recording okay okay agreed straughan pushing it farther across the desk toward her make sure its well protected protections the name of the game and im very good at it straughan had warned his mothers caregiver hed be late getting back to berkhamsted determined to guarantee the recording quality of his encounter with rebecca street as well as theirs with the director he had broken every rule and regulation in addition to the law itself straughan recognized and was terrified he wished there was someone in whom he could confide someone like jane ambersom who had always been so kind and understanding as they had been the previous night miller and abrahams were waiting ahead of the russians this time in the bar of the george v there were three additional mi officers again under the supervision of paul painter spread protectively in the expansive adjoining lobby painter was directly in their line of sight to give the earliest warning of unexpected suspect arrivals elana entered again precisely on time as chic as before in a camelhair topcoat over a heavy rollneck white sweater she was alone there were no warning signals from the foyer dont be alarmed said elana as she sat we are declared miller flatly andrei cant behave like this hell be with me promised elana he resents whats happened its going to make the situation with his father very difficult but hes accepted theres no alternative are you quite sure hes coming demanded abrahams ordering the womans wine hes given me his word said elana is that enough pressed abrahams elanas head came up sharply but the rebuke was halted by the returning waiter after hed left she said its more than enough londons worried andrei might do something unpredictable he wont insisted the woman what are our arrangements miller hesitated uncertainly its tomorrow i cant give you a positive time everything has to be coordinated with maxim mikhailovlichs departure ill call the apartment to give you the pickup time both of us will take you where abrahams gestured in the direction of the seine the bateau mouche ferry terminal at the far end of avenue v we can join the perephique from there dont bring any baggage just yourselves i understand elana i must ask you an important question said miller what will you do if andrei backs off at the last minute i have told you he wont back off the question doesnt apply treat it as a hypothetical question no charlie stalled at the very moment of commitment confronted by the choice hed never imagined having to make he hadnt substantially lied to halliday prising from the man what little he had during their first contact that day nor during the second when hed learned nothing additional like an inferior player hed just rearranged the pieces on a chessboard without achieving checkmate he had always ignored the compartmenting edict to guarantee personal survival and when hed discovered that survival threatened hed without hesitation committed every illegality short of intentional murder to stay alive but in the process hed never ever sabotaged a british assignment which was what he was contemplating now the enclosed telephone just yards away in the corner of the bar he had every justification he didnt have the slightest doubt that the janusfaced combination of mi and mi intended natalia and sasha to be included in his destruction why then was he holding back charlie didnt know not fully on that taunting corner phone hed fifteen minutes earlier told natalia abruptly charlies mind blocked and just as suddenly he believed he did know the reason for his reluctance and it worried him because he couldnt remember the last occasion hed been halted by selfdoubt not about himself he qualified as always about natalia and sasha and whether what he intended could rebound into another mistake to go with all the others not just selfdoubt selfpity charlie recognized something that encouragingly had been markedly absent from natalia during that earlier telephone conversation in which shed unquestioningly told him what he wanted this wasnt going to be a mistake worsen his chances of getting them to safety this was going to be the retribution hed always intended charlie rose for the second time from the bar and dialed the number natalia had provided for the fsbretained communistera neighborinforminguponneighbor facility there was an immediate automatic answer through a mouthpiece muffled by his handkerchief charlie said first in russian and then hopefully in americanaccented english malcolm stoat is leaving through sheremetyevo airport in the next twelve hours none slept well all were up before their respective dawns allowing for the time difference between moscow and paris and the disparity between moscow and london harry jacobson in the last of a series of hired toyotas used throughout in place of the identifying diplomatic registration of his embassy ford was outside the north moscow apartment thirty minutes before maxim mikhailovich radtsics departure jacobson did not try to locate the separate independent escorts in other vehicles parked hood to trunk in the square or its offshoot streets david halliday responded at once to jacobsons cellphonecheck call to the british embassy on smolenskaya naberezhnaya not trusting the reliability of the skeletal earlymorning train services james straughan had himself collected by an mi car from his berkhamsted home in which his mothers caregiver slept overnight rebecca street stayed at cheyne walk to make the short journey from monsfords apartment to vauxhall cross with the mi director jonathan miller and albert abrahams met for coffee and croissants at an allnightworkers cafe close to the british embassy on rue danjou before crossing to their rezidentura elana radtsic was already in the kitchen brewing black tea when andrei walked in answering her question andrei said hed told yvette he was skipping class that day to show his mother some paris sights before her return to moscow there seemingly immune now to the bedbug attacks charlie muffin lay awake but unmoving frustrated at his isolation from a situation he knew to be happening although without the slightest knowledge of whose extraction he hoped to have sabotaged hoping even more that its wrecking would reverberate throughout the highest echelons of british intelligence for the utmost humiliation and career disaster for those whod tried to destroy him natalia and sasha in moscow it was raining heavily london and paris were overcast with rain forecast later in the day maxim radtsic emerged precisely on time he wore a gray trench coat its collar turned up to a widebrimmed dark gray fedora hed not worn before to meet jacobson the russian carried a strapsecured briefcase in one hand and a small weekend bag in the other he looked neither left nor right getting into a small unmarked mercedes parked directly outside his apartment although there was no moving traffic in the street or those surrounding it radtsic put on his turn signal before pulling away jacobson allowed a gap of almost thirty meters before following as he did so jacobson saw in his rearview mirror a renault emerge from a line of parked vehicles behind but on the other side of the street both rigidly conformed to the speed limit straughan had commandeered the mezzaninelevel overview eerie normally occupied by the communications supervisor who was that day relegated to the far side of the room and a secondary desk to which all satellite television telephone email and telex traffic had been transferred with the exception of the dedicated permanently open lines to the moscow and paris rezidenturas also from the overview room there was direct twoway audio relay to the directors suite for simultaneous exchange between straughan and monsford the separately installed cctv did not have a conference connection preventing straughan seeing into monsfords office rebecca street confirmed her presence there inquiring about technical difficulties straughan assured her there were none there were duplicated already opened lines for such eventualities he told monsford hed spoken to david halliday in moscow and that millar and abrahams were already at their rezidentura it was still too early for their intended backup to be mobilized under paul painters supervision london as ever driving from the backseat remarked miller putting his phone down without a map or satnav to tell them in which direction theyre going agreed abrahams well be superfluous to requirements once we land at northolt ive got a girlfriend in london whos got a similarly uninhibited and freespirited friend why not give her a call fix it up before everything kicks off suggested miller were not likely to get into london proper until early evening good idea accepted abrahams maxim radtsic still led when they joined the multilane inner beltway from the olimpijskaka ploscad link the cars passing with an irony no one was ever to learn within a crowsflight mile from where the resentful charlie muffin still lay at the mira hotel by now the rain had eased and the rushhour traffic built up which slowed them while at the same time providing protectively intervening vehicles between radtsic and his mi escorts jacobsons everhovering fear of entrapment diminished in parallel with the rain although he refused to let his confidence stretch to a triumphant liftoff from sheremetyevo and positive irreversible success what little he did allow evaporated at their approach to the cctvfestooned lubyanka headquarters of the russian intelligence apparatus the detection risk here potentially greater than at the airport forewarned by radtsic of constantly patrolling plainclothes guards and perpetually staffed live television sweeps of the entire surrounding areawarnings passed on through straughan to the separate carthe closeness of the escort was abandoned before they reached the square jacobson parked on a side street with a view of the side exit through which radtsic intended to leave on foot abandoning the mercedes in its reserved bay as further indication of his remaining somewhere in the building the renault found a space in another side road david halliday responded on the first ring to jacobsons call hed already spoken to straughan to establish the voice relays were operating perfectly at londons vauxhall cross straughan closed off his permanent moscow link and into his connection to the directors suite said radtsics arrived at the lubyanka two minutes ahead of schedule everythings going to plan how do you know that demanded monsford at once straughan didnt care if his frowned grimace was obvious on the penthouse tv halliday just reported in from the embassy jacobson made contact from outside hes waiting for radtsic to come out for the airport i told you halliday was only to be used between the airport and you and after i personally gave you the general outline of the extraction i left on your desk the minutebyminute stagebystage route which clearly lists lubyanka as the first to be reported to me no geographical identification stage one and thats all halliday passed on stage one completed two minutes ahead of schedule its essential i tell paris now to keep them in the loop the paris collection is also set out in your detailed dossier so the northolt departure stays on time queried jonathan miller listening to what straughan told him thats the update im going to give them as soon as ive finished talking to you our backup will be in place on avenue george v and the embankment in fifteen minutes ive already spoken to paul painter hell give the alert if any problems arise when were under way well contact elana and andrei once you tell me radtsics airborne painter knows what to do if you get into difficulty queried straughan just the sort of question i needed after id finally convinced myself nothing can go wrong complained miller in mock rebuke so whats the answer persisted straughan humorlessly if theres a problem it wont be compounded by their intervention assured the station chief putting his telephone down in unison with abrahams at his opposite desk abrahams said the girls want to meet in the claridges bar you pay the best you get the best remarked miller i hope youre right abrahams smiled back charlie muffins cutoff disgruntlement finally drove him out of bed and worsened when the hiccupping shower shuddered to a stop while he was still covered in soap lather it refused to start again despite his angrily jerking at the controls it took him ten minutes fully to splash off the soap from the sink tap the deluge seeping wetly out into the bedroom he should charlie criticized have moved on from the mira to a hotel with television or radio in his room although there were no breakingnews stations matching those of london it would be psychologically wrong to call halliday this early betraying an uncertainty he didnt want the man to suspect too early as well and for the same reason to attempt contact with natalia she wouldnt yet have left the pecatnikov apartment which she feared might be bugged there might he supposed be a workers cafe showing live television although he doubted it would be a news program it was worth the effort positive physical movement instead of standing around on a damp carpet neutured into inactivity radtsic increased his time gain by a further three minutes leaving the lubyanka headquarters through the arranged side exit he was on foot and now carried only the weekend bag to qualify as cabin baggage on the aircraft the collar of his raincoat was still pulled up to the widebrimmed hat and jacobsons distracting nervetwitched imagery was of a badly cast bmovie spy it was instantly swept away by the awkwardness with which the russian was making his way from the square a seemingly uncertain meander instead of following a quick direct line that concern was set aside when jacobson coordinated the mans odd movements with the cctv bank and realized radtsic was avoiding camera observation once upon the outside road radtsic went in the opposite direction from red square letting two available taxis pass before hailing the third it took the man directly past the side road in which the escorts were parked he let jacobson follow first in line moscows stopstart rushhour traffic was heavier than jacobson had estimated and theyd not only lost their time gain but fallen fifteen minutes behind schedule before reaching the airport highway jacobsons concern jumped again fixed now upon another highway police shakedown that could wreck the operation his apprehension started to subside only at the sight of landing and departing aircraft in the far distance and didnt go completely until he made out the sheremetyevo buildings with no obvious road blocks success was fingertip close now he told himself its eight ten so absolute was james straughans concentration that he was physically startled by monsfords voice irritated that it might have been visible on camera yes your staged progress puts their airport arrival at eight whats gone wrong estimated arrival heavily qualified straughan that estimate also builds in a fifteenminute latitude for delay for he stopped as his permanent moscow link sounded he listened said thank you and as he replaced the receiver went back to the microphone theyve arrived with no problems lets hope it stays that way responded jonathan miller to the same assurance from straughan four minutes later ive checked the traffic conditions theyre light no roadworks or diversions to factor in dont forget limited cellphone chatter on the next call unless they dont show i will have spoken to elana by then gotten a steer fingers crossed its the right one do something for us will you have a car at northolt to get us into london already fixed enjoy your one night home we plan to predictably the first cafe in which charlie muffin found a working television was showing a soccer game on a sports channel but in the second there was a radio tuned to a moscow news channel that charlie judged more likely to broadcast a breaking media event he drank his way through three cups of closetoundrinkable coffee and forced himself to eat a second serving of black bread and sour cheese listening to repeated accounts of government success opposing natos eastern expansion its negotiating substantial price increases for natural gas exports to the european union and vetoing an americansponsored resolution condemning state atrocities in the congo jacobson dumped his rental car for automatic collection avoiding a parking delay and entered the departure hall just five minutes after maxim radtsic jacobson noted his londondestination gate as he hurried across the concourse already booked in online and with only a carryon bag unworried at not relocating the russian knowing the other anonymous escorts would have been ready for radtsics arrival jacobson saw the hat before the man glad the raincoat collar was finally down but still tensed as radtsic approached the first passport scrutiny radtsic turned as he offered the micreated documentation able to see the man properly in good light jacobson acknowledged the practicality of the mans dress it didnt qualify as a disguise but the hat and its sloped brim completely concealed the graying hair and much of radtsics upper face substantially reducing the stalin similarity most important from the wallmounted cctv there appeared no conversation and little comparison between radtsic and the passport photograph it was no more stringent at the second dedicated ticketandpassport examination jacobson went through just as smoothly and they were less than five meters apart going into the dutyfree area radtsic hesitated at the liquor counter turning to establish jacobsons presence without showing any recognition then continuing on toward the londondesignated gate jacobson maneuvered himself to have just one intervening passenger at the final ticketandpassport confirmation but distanced himself once they went through again unchallenged into the final embarkation lobby he waited for radtsic to enter the aircraftconnected jetway before dialing the mi rezidentura he told halliday janus is go disconnected without acknowledgment and hurried after the russian radtsics on the plane straughan announced into the directors voice link as he dialed the securitycleared northolt airfield number in response to the extraction code he was told the executive jet would be cleared for takeoff in thirty minutes with an estimated orly arrival one hour thirty minutes after that straughan ignored two intervention attempts from monsford instead dialing millers cell phone to the paris station chief he said janus is go miller said everyones safely with me here were moving transport eta is two hours speak to you before boarding im trying to talk to you complained monsford as straughan finished i dont think youve allowed sufficient time to get from paris to orly it was to activate paris that i ignored you said straughan both elana and andrei turned up theyre on their way what about their timing weve done trial runs were well within our margins and there are escort cars to warn of difficulties there was momentary silence from the floor above before monsford said ive decided to personally greet radtsic at heathrow there is no waiting time built into the heathrow schedule objected straughan radtsic will be taken directly off the plane to the car taking him to hertfordshire his being escorted off the plane will attract attention from other passengers the large proportion of whom will be russian i strongly advise against any delay even of only minutes at heathrow theres a permanent media contingent there your personal greeting will be better at the safe house and more fitting executive to executive than in the back of a car camera light can penetrate smoked glass i undertook to meet him personally argued monsford without stipulating that it would be at the airport ive got time to work it out which was what charlie was trying to do in his frustrating isolation with nothing more than instinct and guesswork from which to operate having already acknowledged hed made far too many mistakes relying on both had it been another of those mistakes to accept hallidays story of being sidelined until the last minute what if halliday had instead been one of the deputed searchandfind groups at the rossiya unable to risk losing him to summon backup to the panorama bar halliday had certainly tried to follow him afterward and constantly complained since at not knowing his whereabouts but if he was part of a london search would halliday have disclosed the janus operational code for the separate extraction yes charlie answered himself if it lured him out of hiding again too much guesswork there was an obvious way to test halliday from his independent airport inquiry charlie knew the first direct british airways flight from moscow to london had left at that morning now it was halliday responded on the initial ring howd it go asked charlie like clockwork replied halliday and you know what straughan told me after i gave him the signal and asked what he wanted me to do now he said he didnt want me to do anythingthat it was all overand put the phone down without so much as a fucking thankyou it isnt right no agreed charlie talking more to himself than the other man it isnt right to the victor belong the spoils of the enemy intoned monsford from above in a voice straughan genuinely thought the man had lowered to sound godlike im going up to hertfordshire to meet radtsic there i think thats a better idea straughan replied hertfordshire was always my intention keep in touch if theres anything i need to hear before i get there there cant be anything immediate can there no agreed straughan were in the interim period now the mezzaninelevel communications control was the most secure of an already totally secure area within the mi building its dailychanged entry combination restricted to the director and his deputy straughan and a rota of six duty officers they did not receive the combination until arriving for their shift which was why straughan in the middle of a conversation with orly checking the aircraft arrival was startled for the second time that day by peremptory knocking from outside rebeccas visible annoyance through the observation window matched the irritation of her door hammering why didnt i get todays entry code she demanded as she flounced past straughan i didnt imagine it would be necessary today you had permanent visual and audio access from upstairs said straughan warning the woman with a look to the studiously oblivious duty officer on the far side of the room has he gone ten minutes ago she said also lowering her voice he thinks hell get there in time to greet elana and andrei before radtsic and he was pissed off at your attitude on the voice link and prompted straughan ignoring the warning rebecca smiled for the first time he never bothered to turn on the equipment why arent i surprised said straughan in resigned cynicism well prompted the woman in return doubly backed up assured straughan gesturing to the paraphernalia on his desk every words recorded and theres a tandem line to our own system rebecca looked at the wall behind the regular duty officer upon which was a fivedeep battery of clocks set to the local time of every global capital how much longer until the french evacuation fortyfive minutes said straughan without consulting the wall clock i was talking to orly when you arrived our plane will be cleared for takeoff by the time elana and andrei get there theyll get here ahead of schedule now it was rebecca who gestured to the electronic litter on straughans desk seems as if our precautions werent necessary after all everythings gone according to plan so there wont be any buckpassing straughan shook his head doubtfully therell be a lot of internal uproar between us and our brothers across the river and maybe a lot of internal government examination too i dont think we should stop doing it neither do i agreed rebecca straughan didnt jump this time even though the telephones shrill was unexpected rebecca said itll be gerald from the car it wasnt straughan listened for more than a full minute before saying you did the right thing its got to be a cleanup everything thats possible to do i want you as my permanent liaison this is a catastrophe what is demanded rebecca when straughan stopped although keeping the telephone in his hand there was an ambush at a peage outside orly theyve all been seized miller and abrahams as well as elana and andrei russian groped rebecca painter thinks it was french said straughan emptily we have to tell the director insisted straughan not yet refused rebecca what personal benefit was there there had to be something hell be at the safe house in less than an hour all we can tell him now is that theres a difficulty we need to know more and get monsfords reaction recorded they now had a disaster of incalculable proportions and she wasnt going to be hit by a single particle of the shit monsford would spray in every direction except his own we know radtsics wife and son wont be there to greet him the promise weve given him whats painter and the rest of them doing keeping as far away as possible guaranteed straughan urgently that was their instructions we dont want to lose any more people painters heading them back to paris whys painter think its a french seizure all the vehicles were french there were some uniforms the sort the french use in terrorist arrests although they didnt have any identifying insignia are we talking service de documentation exterieur et de contre espionnage or french police i dont know straughan shrugged emptily whats our relationship if it is french i dont understand the question protested the operations director whats the chances of the sdece backing off when they learn its us straughan stared at rebecca not trying to disguise his astonishment let me ask you a question back what would the chances be of us backing off if we seized two french intelligence officers in a car with the wife and son of the deputy director of the fsb rebecca visibly colored so what do you think theyll do take the maximum possible advantage of course theyve got the wife and son weve got the husband and father rebecca tried again what about a trade reuniting the family for joint completely shared access straughan again looked at rebecca in disbelief physically reunite the family where here in the hertfordshire house or hand radtsic over to the french rebeccas color which had begun to subside flooded her face again itll have been that little shit andrei wont it ive logged everything jonathan miller told me of every exchange he had with both mother and son said straughan as far as i recall miller never told either of them exactly where we were flying them from only that it would obviously be from somewhere along the north coast yet the ambush was only a few miles from orly as if our route was known in advance and if andrei knowingly set out to sabotage it wouldnt it be more likely hed go to the russians and their embassy not to the french we havent yet confirmed it was a french interception rebecca said whether its russian or french is largely academic dismissed straughan philosophically the fact is that whichever it is has got them and two of our officers and the service is well and truly in the shit and sinking fast and we should warn the director he gestured toward a computer on an adjoining table thats monitoring radtsics flight its on time landing in thirty minutes and itll be another two hours after that before he gets to the safe house said rebecca painter and the others will be back to paris long before that wont they straughan looked at the french chronometer on the far wall probably before radtsics plane lands does painter have friends in the sdece he has contact i dont know how friendly or not well give it a little longer for painter to pull in every favor he can decided rebecca we need as much information as possible for gerald get a message to jacobson warn him but tell him to say nothing to radtsic thats geralds responsibility that and informing our government liaison what sort of markedcard game was rebecca street playing wondered straughan whatever it was it had been sensible to keep the safeguarding recording running for these exchanges along with the rest how much he wished again for someone like jane ambersom to help him decide what to do the telephone interrupted the reflection straughan snatched it up listened and then said fuck what started rebecca but stopped trying to understand from the gabbled conversation tell me she demanded as straughan slammed the phone down our planes been seized at orly along with everyone in it youre right agreed rebecca its a total fuckup he was properly floating acknowledged harry jacobson floating thirtyfive thousand feet off the ground on his way to justifiably wellearned rewards nothing could go wrong now hed done it no one would ever know the fears hed endured the potentially calamitous mistakes and shortcuts hed made and now they never would this was going to be engraved in his service record as a percent all singing all dancing coup that could neverwould neverbe taken away from him but he still wasnt taking chances twice since takeoff maxim radtsic had turned from his seat two rows ahead stupidly expecting recognition which twice hed refused and was glad he had radtsic hadnt turned again but on the second occasion jacobson overheard two russians in the seats behind refer laughing to the stalin similarities it would be a story embellished in its telling to their families when photographs of radtsic appeared in the inevitable publicity to follow the mans defection there wasnt anything hed miss about moscow apart obviously from its exquisite ballet hed thought the city dirty and its people arrogant with any professional advancement drowned in a backwater increasingly stagnated by putins constantly tightened control until radtsics unbelievable onceinalifetime approach what passed for secret information gathering was virtually the distillation of cocktailparty gossip from one espionage operative to another flavored by the national political mindset of each teller additionally spiced as it went around the incestuous intelligence circuit paris or washington was going to be far more rewarding jacobsons cell phone was switched to flight mode but he immediately felt the vibration of a mutely received text when he got it from his pocket it read contact urgently on arrival unknown to now solitary companion and although he was still at thirtyfive thousand feet jacobson was no longer floating its definitely sdece announced paul painter despite twice using both his antiasthma inhalers the words wheezed from the man definite confirmation demanded straughan unsettled by the closeness with which rebecca was pressed against him to hear both sides of the exchange her shirt gaped sufficiently for him to see the pinkness of her nipples definite said painter what else its being dealt with at a political level what does that mean i dont know what about the plane our people at orly the same painters breathing was getting easier thats bollocks thats what my sdece man is telling me has there been any formal contact with the embassy not up to five minutes ago when we began this conversation what am i to tell the diplomatic ranks here ive had to warn them theres a potential situation i wish you hadnt and dont forget this conversation is being officially recorded warned straughan you have any idea how the sdece are going to handle it it was when i asked that question that i got the politicallevel answer you mean that its been taken out of the hands of the sdece let me tell you again painter sighed fully recovered now and refusing to be pushed into speculation i called my man at the french service and told him id heard something had happened on the orly autoroute he said it was a security operation as was the impounding of the plane he told me he didnt know what was going to happen next that it had been passed up to a political level and that everyone the four at the toll booth and everyone with the plane were being detained thats it i couldnt get any answers to how why or through whom the sdece got involved i am of course copying you both the complete voiceprint and hardcopy translation what chance is there of it all being kept under wraps asked straughan something else i cant tell you what i was started straughan wait a minute stopped painter theres something coming in on the news wires there was a moments silence shit what demanded straughan its an official release on agence francepresse it says two britons have been detained on suspicion of kidnapping two russian nationals other britons have been held at orly along with an aircraft suspected to be part of the same attempt rebecca street remained in the communications room where there were better facilities for straughan to participate in the conference call peremptorily breaking across monsfords announcement of his arrival youre already at the house of course i am where are elana and the boy thats why im calling you its bad the equipment was so finely adjusted that it was possible over rebeccas succinct explanation to hear monsfords increasingly labored breathing which was scarcely less difficult than paul painters earlier there was no immediate response when she finished finally rebecca said are you there did you hear what ive told you how i mean why kidnaps ridiculous ive told you all we know said the woman smiling as she pushed a note across the desk to the operations director that read my to your hell give us shakespeares wisdom i cant stay here need to get back to london therell be calls downing street you come down here to take over you and straughan i cant move from here refused straughan theres got to be a coordinator im keeping the line permanently open to paris and im still waiting to speak to jacobson blands already telephoned twice aubrey smiths been on once picked up rebecca the smile widening youre to make contact with bland as soon as ive located you i need to stay here where everythings being channeled to field it all jacobson seized the man wheres jacobson and radtsic the planes just landed its still taxiing said straughan i got a message through during the flight telling jacobson to ring me the moment he gets off jacobsons to stay with radtsic that was always the plan jacobson and the others are to bring radtsic here im leaving right now what shall i tell bland or palmer or smith asked rebecca dont tell anyone anything the words came out in a near shout which monsford realized more controlled he went on tell them you got me but im in a bad cellphonereception area but that im on my way back i want everything uptodate and waiting for me on my desk everything will be ready this was an ill beginning of the night quoted monsford at last hes shitting himself rebecca told straughan when the call ended with every reason said straughan but were ring fenced she smiled picking up straughans fivepound note as well as crumpling her wager note i think i should have whats recorded so far ill run it through make sure its all okay said straughan and after making his copy ensure he took out additional insurance he decided in moscow charlie muffin was surprised at the quickness of natalias response until she said somethings broken i cant talk now eight tonight at the restaurant we used in the beginning behind the gardens charlie managed before natalia put the phone down hed have to wait for at least six hours to discover what it was charlie estimated it wouldnt take him that long to complete the shopping he needed as it was charlie didnt have to wait that long at all he checked out of the mira hotel moving south to the student transient anonymity of the moscow university district with the komsomolskaya metro and its pursuitevading convenience of two major subway routes the galaxy hotel was a considerable improvement upon the mira due chiefly to the bedroom television with a cnn channel upon which within half an hour he saw the breakingnews flash of the french autoroute arrests and orly plane impoundment charlie sat unmoving through two repeats the last update of which confirmed that the alleged kidnap victims were russian and that documentation upon the two detained britons indicated diplomatic connections charlies immediate speculation was the extent to which he could stretch what little there was to gain more from david halliday not much was the objective conclusion scarcely anything at all under the closest examination his best maybe only hope was to lure halliday into conjuring more ghosts from his fearclouded mind charlie was encouraged by the audible uncertainty in hallidays voice as the man grabbed up the rezidentura phone to increase it charlie said not such a clean job after all was it david im not responsible for any of it how could i be gabbled halliday the satisfaction moved through charlie you tell me i didnt have anything to do with the french end halliday continued to protest thats how it is when things fuck up dont forget scapegoats and fall guys not this time insisted the other man in weak defiance they try to stitch me into this im going to demand an internal inquiry to prove i cant be held responsible so far so good judged charlie not just good percent better than hed expected but it would take only one misplaced word how can they stitch you into it if you didnt know about france thats the question i asked straughan what was his answer it he couldnt answer it not properly said he wasnt accusing me of anything that he just wanted to know how much jacobson told me about radtsic who the fuck was radtsic wrong question charlie instantly corrected himself it was obvious who radtsic was and even more obvious from natalias telephone reaction was the mans occupation if not his actual rank within it until the departure of british airways flight that morning to london and halliday had lied insisting he didnt know the defectors identity what more was there to squeeze out of the man how much did jacobson tell you about radtsic there was an abrupt silence after what charlie estimated was minutes halliday said youre part of the stitchup now its all gone wrong you just referred to radtsic by name earlier you told me you didnt know who we were getting out i didnt know until you mentioned it less than five minutes ago i didnt mention a name rejected halliday he just wanted to know how much jacobson told me about radtsic quoted charlie thats what you said wasnt it once more halliday didnt reply charlie didnt prompt i dont trust you eventually declared the mi man close to his usual petulance i never asked nor expected you to trust me reminded charlie you proved that not telling me until now that radtsic was the extraction i didnt know the name not until london began the inquest implored halliday professionally the man was a disaster charlie decided once more if halliday had ever undergone hostile interrogation he would within minutes have disclosed the identities of every agent and every secret hed ever known up to and including the color of his grandfathers underwear tell me about radtsic charlie demanded all i now know is that the extraction from here worked perfectly and that hes already arrived in london i dont know if hes been told about his wife and son halliday probably didnt realize the amount of information he imparted every time he opened his mouth for which charlie supposed he should be grateful what is radtsic within the fsb the number two charlie said you know dont you that the seizures public been officially announced by the french how could i know chained here in the rezidentura it makes it easier to understand londons panic dont lose him charlie warned himself and should make it easier for you to understand the scapegoat hunt i told you they cant blame me chained to a desk in the rezidentura echoed charlie where straughan didnt even bother to tell you everythings unraveling what chance do you think youve got to prevent your balls being turned into a necklace ill insist on an official internal investigation if they try that repeated halliday which they can refuse if they choose dismissed charlie dont forget i was brought in as radtsics diversion which i refused to be and beat them im still your best chance of beating them again if they try to set you up i wont forget promised halliday dutifully and im sorry what i said about not trusting you dont be refused charlie just remember whos your best guide out of this shit theres so much i still dont understand protested halliday theres still a lot i dont understand admitted charlie chief among them being how after his anonymous malcolm stoat tip that should have put the fsb on the highest alert its defecting chief deputy passed unimpeded through sheremetyevo airport while the mis extraction of the mans wife and son was intercepted by french intelligence ive been trying to update you but was told you couldnt be reached said straughan as monsford settled himself at his desk my phones broken you got everything ready for me as i ordered said monsford leaning sideways to the record button all there in front of you indicated the operations director you want to read it or hear the bullet points before you decide theres been seven more calls between bland palmer and smith broke in rebecca street i told them youd be back at four which gives you thirty minutes to get updated youre to call bland the moment you arrive here monsford hadnt looked at his deputy as she talked but straughan had and picked up the head shake that told him the director hadnt activated the apparatus impatiently ignoring what rebecca told him monsford said give me the bullet points the french havent named elana or andrei just described them as mother and son straughan set out theyve leaked a diplomatic connection for miller and abrahams according to bland theres been a french demand for an explanation the pilot and crew have been taken to paris its the lead item on every television and radio channel here and in france as well as the evening standard here and every paris evening newspaper its also included in every television and radio newscast and print media time differences allowing throughout the european union and across america and canada what about russia demanded monsford hunched over the unread file nothing terrestrial or localprint yet satellite will of course be available most definitely our bbc world service and cnn bastards hissed monsford almost incoherently bastards bastards bastards at monsfords gesture for her to deny his presence rebecca picked up the demanding telephone insisted monsford still hadnt returned and promised the call would be returned the moment he did geoffrey palmer she identified theyve been told your cell phone is unreachable the circuit boards buckled dismissed monsford how did it leak to the french i havent been able to find out yet admitted the operations director halliday denies jacobson told him anything it was a limited conversation with jacobson but hes adamant he didnt discuss anything with halliday either jacobson thinks radtsic made the phone call hed forbidden the man to make to elana in paris thats the line hes going to take with radtsic when radtsic discovers elana and andrei arent at the safe house i obviously havent been able to talk to anyone in france apart from painter but andreis another potential source we know the kid didnt want to be part of it straughan indicated the ignored rebecca weve talked about that possibility there are several problems with it it would have been far more likely for andrei to have gone to his own people at the russian embassy than to the french wouldnt it it would have been more natural for the girl yvette to do that if andrei told her what was going to happen but that falls down too neither elana nor andrei knew precisely where we were flying from the ambush was in place on the orly autoroute and there was a squad already at the airport itself simultaneously to impound the plane what about charlie muffin straughan frowned he was always the diversion he didnt know anything hes a double tricked us all hes gone over to the russians monsford insisted whether he has or hasnt doesnt affect this refused straughan ignoring rebeccas look charlie muffin didnt know anything about radtsic if he hadand has gone overthe first thing hed surely have done was stop radtsics defection charlie muffin has to have had something to do with this persisted monsford his voice rising against their opposition youre going to be asked for a lot of explanations cautioned rebeccatheyll need logical answers it not logical to include charlie muffin in whatevers gone wrong whose side are you on that question isnt logical either rejected the woman were confronting a disaster from which were not going to escape with illogical accusations monsford looked between the two other people knew rebecca broke the silence that followed i dont understand that remark who outside this room have either of you discussed radtsics extraction with i have discussed the radtsic extraction with no one outside this room and every discussion i have had within this room has been recorded on your personal system specifically installed for that purpose replied rebecca with stilted formality every discussion about the radtsic extraction in which i have been involved within this room is on the same system matched straughan every discussion i have had outside this room either from my own office or from the communication supervisors office is similarly held on the equipment specifically installed for such purposes i hope i can believe you said monsford i hope you can believe me too said rebecca as i also hope you can believe me said straughan the jarring telephone broke this next silence and for several moments monsfsord looked at it once starting to look toward the woman he finally lifted it briefly listened and said i have just this minute come into the building ill be with you on time do you want us to come with you asked rebecca as monsford rose no said the man youve forgotten your briefing papers said straughan i dont need them rebecca waited for several minutes after the door closed before saying he forgot his recording machine too but then hed already done that by not turning it on maxim mikhailovich radtsic physically rose from his chair as jacobson talked he remained standing hunched forward as if worried at missing a single word shaking his lowered head in disbelief how you told me it was all arranged foolproof thats what weve got to speak about sit down maxim mikhailovich radtsic slumped down and looking questioningly from jacobson to the three other escorts in the room a drink i need a drink vodka one of the unnamed men left the room radtsic pulled himself forward in his chair making a physical effort to recover tell me everything that happened youve heard all i know insisted jacobson now youve got to help us what can i tell you demanded the russian reaching out for the escortoffered vodka from a tray laden with ice and the remaining bottle you know it all youre supposed to be looking after me after elana and andrei as well that was our agreement in moscow you told me you wanted to telephone elana tell her it was all finalized jacobson spelled out cautiously his mind functioning on two levels and i warned me against doing so interrupted radtsic holding out his empty glass but did you demanded jacobson hoping for a startled admission instead radtsic stretched out unseeingly for the new drink but with his concentration entirely upon jacobson of course i didnt he said his voice no longer uncertain what you told me made obvious sense the risk was too great unspeaking jacobson in turn held his concentration on the man trying to prevent his mental focus going sideways to the nagging concern at his personal expectations you dont believe me accused radtsic when jacobson didnt speak his normal peremptory tone completely restored i did everything as you wanted never allowed the slightest risk not taking any chances youre the one you and your people who fucked up whove got to sort it out make it work as you assured me you would i told you andrei didnt want to come jacobson reminded flatly why had the arrogant bastard so clearly identified him on the automatic recording system and i told you however reluctant andrei was after hearing his mother explain hed cross with her andrei isnt the cause of this none of it another personal identification jacobson recognized thats not the impression of the people who made contact with elana and andrei in paris the impression of the people who made contact in paris sneeringly echoed the russian holding his glass sideways for more vodka without bothering to look at the man serving it are you talking about those people who allowed themselves to be captured with my wife and son and ruined their escape your escapes not ruined refused jacobson desperately radtsic his face clearing came farther forward in his chair ignoring the man with the third drink at last some sense when are they arriving i didnt say theyre coming squirmed jacobson were trying to sort it out and to sort it out we need to know how and why they were intercepted answer your own questions loudly insisted radtsic find out and sort it out its the french your allies your european partners who are holding them tell paris to release them and bring them here to me thats what were trying to do why were talking like this i was promised id be personally meeting your director where is he working on what were all trying to achieve a way of resolving this i want to see your director which you told me was his personal wish i want him and everyone else all of you to understand something my being here my coming here was entirely dependent upon elana and andrei being here with me i will not stay cooperate in any way whatsoever unless we are together i will tell them what youve said speak to your director and tell him what im telling you undertakings were given and agreed you are not keeping your part in those undertakings i will speak to my director promised jacobson everything had gone vanished straughan had been right it was a total unmitigated disaster gerald monsford tried to match the blankness of the expressionless men confronting him around the table his uncertainty worsened by one of them being aubrey smith in whom despite the facial emptiness monsford believed he saw triumph throughout the formulation of a joint operation approved at the highest level of government to extract an officer of the fsb the absolute and clearly understood imperative was that there should be no diplomatic risk contrary to every order and instruction you independently organized a parallel extraction of another fsb official without any consultation or reference to us your direct liaison to that highest level said sir archibald bland pedantically setting out the accusation made that much more ominous by the calm measured delivery yes i did immediately admitted monsford at once encouraged by the frowned break in smiths composure why demanded geoffrey palmer precisely because the extraction of natalia and her daughter was a joint operation declared monsford embarking upon what hed concluded his best and least challengeable rebuttal that our two organizations were brought together was according to my recollection acknowledged to be an extremely rare and unusual decision theres been no precedent during my tenure as director of mi nor as far as im aware during that of at least two of my predecessors mi and mi are in every normal circumstance entirely separate and autonomous it was my decision that the extraction of maxim mikhailovich radtsic the fsbs executive deputy was completely within the customary autonomy of my organization and did not conflict or impinge in any way with that of the woman and her child to have conjoined the two would have created confusion and endangered both the first of which has been destroyed anyway by the antics of the mi operative charlie muffin you were categorically ordered against anything that could potentially exacerbate the difficulties already existing between us and the russian federation persisted palmer orders you just as categorically ignored what you indeed i was interrupted monsford his earlier uncertainty diminishing close examination of the transcript of the meeting at which those orders were given will show my intimating the possibility of our nullifying moscows actions by confronting the russian federation with a far greater embarrassment which its my contention weve achieved by facilitating the defection of maxim mikhailovich radtsic at the cost of at least six of your operatives an executive jet and radtsics wife and son who to my understanding are accusing us of attempted kidnap qualified aubrey smith its inconceivable you expect us to accept youve put us ahead in any titfortat exchange which was something else absolutely forbidden nonsense rejected monsford welcoming the challenge weve still got their diplomats to exchange for the manchester travel group a swap moscow will fall over themselves to agree when we make radtsics defection public and following that announcement our having established radtsics presence in england it will be little more than a formality negotiating the french release of my officers along with that of elana and andrei to continue their journey here the indications so far are that it will be anything but a simple formality contradicted palmer the french are furious at our mounting an intelligence operation on their soil without prior consultation and agreement with their service de documentation exterieure et de contre espionnage of course theyre furious dismissed monsford almost contemptuous in his now totally restored confidence wed be just as furious if they did something similar here therell be a lot of backroom sniping and threats of broken understandings which dont matter a damn what matters is that weve got radtsic whos been at the pinnacle of russian intelligence and espionage activities for almost three decades wrecking russias lvov operation was a coup without much practical benefit to us getting radtsic in the bag is the espionage prize of the century as youve presented it and if the french difficulty with the wife and son can be resolved it would appear to be so conceded bland then all thats necessary seized monsford are some discreet diplomatic negotiations with parisalong perhaps with an equally discreet apology to the sdece which i am quite ready personally to makefor this to be recognized exactly as ive described it having destroyed his cell phone monsford had to use a pay kiosk within the foreign office to reach rebecca dogs easily won to fawn on any man he quoted the moment rebecca lifted her receiver which is what i made them do eat out of my hand like the welltrained pets they are book scotts for dinner were going to celebrate shall i tell straughan you dont want him to wait here i dont want straughan much more for anything tell him what you like which is what rebecca did verbally repeating to the operations director monsfords every word in london it was pm in paris it was pm and in moscow it was pm when charlie rose at natalias entry to the restaurant im sorry im late we didnt set a time natalia hadnt come straight from the lubyanka charlie knew her hair was perfectly in place and the black dress didnt look as if it had been worn throughout a busy day what little makeup she wore appeared fresh too natalia hesitated studying the table placing it within the restaurant sitting here isnt a coincidence is it i wondered if youd remember natalia gave a brief smile i remember this table from our firstever time here and i havent forgotten either that beneath charlie the hard man theres charlie the romantic the smile went and youll never know how much i wish things werent as they are now what the hell did that mean why dont we order before we talk you order for me she said uninterestedly charlie chose fish for her in preference to the boar hed decided upon while hed waited and the already selected georgian wine unsettled by her mood now lets talk how much do you know just what ive picked up from television that a russian mother and her son are being held in france the diplomatic reference to the two englishmen is a clear enough espionage identification even without the impounded plane charlie intentionally limited his reply to avoid natalias suspecting he had a secondary source natalia sipped her wine to cover the hesitation charlie recognized not just to be her positive nogoingback moment of commitment but the point at which she knowingly crossed their selferected barrier against their betraying either countrys intelligence the hesitation continued even when she began talking naming radtsic and his wife and son but not knowing how the french seizure had come about charlie didnt interrupt not wanting to lose something more important for a less essential clarification only in the last few moments did she bring her head up the guilt obvious i hated doing that i i despise myself the arrival of their meal allowed charlie a brief reflection all our professional lives weve kept our oath adjusted our morality for institutions whose only morality is the expediency of the moment youre not betraying anything or anyone its time for our expediency not just yours and mine sashas too which is maybe even more important natalia was looking away again picking at her fish as he was at his meal neither properly eating abruptly she said thats my problem is it best for sasha to be taken from everything and everyone she knows to what might as well be the moon where shell get a new name and be told to forget her own never ever to mention it to anyone learn a new language and accept a near stranger as her father thats what its going to be isnt it a suspended lifenot really a life at allin a protection program not able to tell her why we cant trust anyone be proper friends with anyone terrified at an accent or an intonation that could be russian and mean theyve found us he couldnt lie to her not after his own so recently fossilized existence i came out of a program to get you both it was everything youve described it to be its the beginning the adjustment that will be bad but we can adjust sashas young enough to adjust we could become happy eventually where anywhere you choose and arent we overlooking why i came here why you made the calls theres more to tell you nothings complete as nothings ever complete in what we do how we work encapsulated in an incomprehensible whole groped natalia theres total uproar at lubyanka more open talk than ive ever known more combined action than ive ever experienced but it doesnt seem like uproar panic it isnt encapsulated people are talking discussing things speculating which theyve never done she put down her fork to raise an apologetic hand i know im not making sense im trying to explain it as the words come to me was there another fear adding to that of a protection program hows it affecting you personally natalia abandoned her meal altogether nervously revolving the gold band she carefully avoided wearing on her wedding finger ive been seconded to an inquiry committee six of us from the analysis division of the first chief directorate which never changed its functions or designation from the old kgb youve been personally selected seized charlie aware of the significance me personally confirmed natalia with another brief half smile to inquire into what maxim mikhailovich radtsic she announced simply our brief is to go back into everythingevery operation every contact every department every officer both here and abroad in either the kgb or the fsbwith whom radtsic had dealings since the day he enrolled in the kgb the fsb reasoning is that he wasnt alone but part of a longestablished cell from which hes trying to distract attention for the rest to go on working against us us immediately registered charlie believing he was beginning to understand youre no longer under the slightest suspicion only a person beyond reproach would be considered and only then after the strictest vetting which you underwent and clearly passed even before radtsic defected i know charlie didnt hurry not to reflect but to examine their conversation and pick up any inconsistency to avoid the wrong interpretation unable to find it he said youre safe you and sasha are safe you dont need to run after all no charlie searched for the appropriate words which didnt come youre giving me your decision arent you thats a stupid selfpitying remark natalia flared too loudly ill be able to get out all right charlie exaggerated shaking his head to the waiters inquiring approach thats even more stupid i didnt say i didnt want us to come then what are you telling me demanded charlie exasperated im trying to say but saying it badly that i love you that ive confronted all the mistakes ive made and that i do want to get out with sasha despite both you and i knowing how difficult thats going to be what then broke in charlie the exasperation growing youre the only person who could have made it work got us out after the mistakes i made happen it would still have been a miracle if youd managed it natalia stopped her voice catching and needing to recover after radtsic itll be totally impossible wed never get past all the new checks and surveillance every passport scrutinized for forgery eye iris and fingerprint verification cctv doubled wed be picked up and lose each other and both of us would lose sasha weve got to lose each other give up the fantasy of my getting out with sasha to ensure we keep sasha safe charlie held back from an immediate reply conscious of the hovering waiter ordered coffee with brandy for himself the waiter gone charlie leaned forward urgently and said i can do it we can do it the added restrictions are too late ill do what they dont anticipate im frightened charlie too frightened i expect you to be frightened but more than frightened i expect you want you to be professional concentrate on being professional more than upon who sasha is and who i am put as far back in your mind as you can that this is personal im not sure i can charlie wasnt sure she could either she was a professional intelligence officer but not trained or inculcated with the field tradecraft as he was he had to get her past her mental barrier work with me plan with me if at the end you think the risk of failing is greater than that of succeeding well abort and try something else and something else after that until youre satisfied natalia hunched noncommittal shoulders im not totally satisfied yet that my committee appointment guarantees that im safe why not i told you mine isnt the only group god knows whatll be thrown up by them all i still dont know if i got rid of all the questionable links between us their absolute unswerving focus will be upon the background of maxim mikhailovich radtsic your right to be part of the investigation is already decided id like to think youre right said natalia uncertainly i am right insisted charlie dismissing his own uncertainties how many more encapsulated committees are there at least six why so many queried charlie eager to move natalia on from her introspection to discover the cell if there is a cell as quickly as possible radtsics been part of the russian intelligence apparatus for almost thirty years it would take almost as long again for just one group to go through his entire archive thats whats going to be made available radtsics entire archive thats the gossip ive never known it to happen before certainly not involving someone of such seniority said natalia but then i dont know of a defection of someone at such a senior level and being spread between so many separate groups itll be impossible to get an overview of all that hes done still an incalculable treasure trove gauged charlie how many more nuggets remained to be sieved the inference is obvious from the french identification of britons but has it been definitely confirmed that radtsic is in england we havent been officially told what of the wife and son whats going to happen to them natalias shoulders rose and fell again i dont know nor do i have a way of finding out our brief is to look back not forward the kidnap claim is obviously an attempted evasion if theyre repatriated here he still hadnt resolved his nagging uncertainty realized charlie is that anonymous reporting system going to remain at moscow airports natalia frowned why did you ask me about anonymous disclosure it was classic stasi tradecraft taught to them by the kgb i was exploring all the possible barriers we might face not knowing then about radtsic replied charlie easily has it been retained with all the other additions there was another shoulder movement its been in place for a long time why discard it now of all times her frown remained its obviously british intelligence with the wife and son didnt you really know radtsic was going to england i really didnt know said charlie the committee convenes tomorrow ill still have my cell phone with me but i wont be able to take calls as freely as i could in my own office probably wont keep it on when were in session i wont know how were going to work until after tomorrow im introducing another precaution announced charlie lifting from beside the table a bag she hadnt seen details of your cell phone will be on record at lubyanka easily scanned im giving you six new phones all chargecard operated so theres no billing address i didnt buy more than one from any shop choosing new names and addresses at random nothings traceable to you or me use one a day discarding it when you leave lubyanka at night but taking out the sim card and battery before you do do you think its necessary natalia accepted doubtfully i do said charlie glad shed moved on ill call at noon if your phones off ill call at seven and if its still off every hour on the hour after that if you keep it on mute and still dont reply ill know youre with people disconnect and try again later i understand understand something more stressed charlie youre not under suspicion but dont take the slightest chance in the conditions youve described internal security will be paranoid dont contact me ill call you always from a different phone and im no longer at the mira whats your new hotel like a great improvement ive got the bed all to myself you neednt be all by yourself at least not for an hour or so thank you both for coming back now i didnt want this to extend overnight said aubrey smith coming to the end of his account of the foreign office encounter i want you to sleep on what ive told you and have ideas ready first thing tomorrow you caught me before id got home said passmore ive put my plans back said jane ambersom relieved shed reached barry elliott still at the american embassy i told you the sort of man monsford is didnt i hes been using the charlie muffin business all along acknowledged smith where did charlies extraction fit in questioned passmore i dont precisely know and wont guess admitted the directorgeneral the only thing i am sure about is that he didnt have anything to do with monsfords maneuvers its essential now that we find charlie monsfords trying to load the blame onto charlie for everything thats gone wrong with radtsic if charlie wasnt involved he was ahead of us all suspecting it wasnt a straight operation jane pointed out we wont know that until we get hold of him but it looks that way i just wish hed break cover the last orders to those waiting for him to do just that were to use force if necessary reminded passmore i think we should scale that down agreed said smith at once everything has to be reevaluated im surprised monsford wasnt challenged more strongly said passmore his story still doesnt explain his total disregard of what he was specifically ordered not to do hes built an embarrassing diplomatic foothill into a bloody great mountain bland and palmer are desperate for any way out and if monsfords scenario works theyve got it judged smith i didnt have anything to oppose him but theres a very fine line weve got to stay behind whatever we do to distance ourselves we dont screw up radtsics defection we do anything and everything to help get the wife and son here which means supporting monsford whos right radtsic is the prize of the century youve just rounded a circle we cant break complained passmore thats why tonight starting right now is important insisted smith so far weve caught all the shit some of it deserved ill acknowledge the mistakes in what charlies done but none of those for which were not responsible if elana and andrei are allowed to continue on monsford will be the golden boy who took a huge risk that worked well be the incompetents who got everything wrong and dont deserve to be here any longer thats the circle weve got to make into a square with enough sharp edges to snag monsford and weve got a little over twelve hours to do it passmore turned sideways to jane you know how the wheels go around over there when all the brakes were taken off which she now believed they were she thought she was encouraged minutes later when the number she rang from her office was answered and all the more so by the conversation that followed as usual barry elliott was waiting ahead of her when jane entered the grill room at the connought hotel an hour after that id like to think you were held up by something involving a certain mother and son id guess right now are somewhere close to the eiffel tower he greeted things are happening even nearer than that said jane charlies reaction had been surprise before excitement at natalias suggestion and probably because of it their lovemaking hadnt been as good as it usually was the real satisfaction had come afterward entwined and tightly holding each other neither one needing sex or to talk or even to think just to be there and have the touch and the feel and the comfort of each other it was only after natalia left carrying her disposable telephones that charlie let his thinking run although at the beginning unfocused and his oncemoretentative mosaic turned upside down into yet another heap natalia was objectively right about the repercussive effects that radtsics defection would have upon his getting her and sasha safely away but putting more locks on a stable door from which its horse had bolted was predictable unlocking them quickly afterward wasnt which just might give him the sufficient advantage of surprise but there was a long way to go and a lot more to evaluate before they got that far the major imponderable of which was whether natalia would be strong enough at that final nervesnapping moment of crossing from one existence to another and because it would remain imponderable it was going to hang over them undermining their confidence until that precise moment which required he do as much as was conceivably possible to instill additional confidence within natalia he hoped hed begun well insisting the committee appointment was incontrovertible proof that her loyalty was now unquestioned how was he going to maintain that necessary momentum the most obvious way was by no longer remaining unconnected and out of touch on the periphery it was time to contact the embassy in the cold dawn after overnight reflection charlie acknowledged the reaction to his reemergence would be so unpredictable that he needed not just janus but a virtual army of twowayfacing protectors to watch his back and all he had was david halliday who unquestionably qualified as twofaced but for that reason was very definitely not a protective friend halliday did however sound more in control when he answered charlies arranged contact thered been no overnight traffic from london halliday said but from online surfing of the news wires hed established the french seizures had achieved widespread international coverage there was no named identification but increasing speculation that the alleged kidnap had been part of a major but nowfoiled espionage operation there was further speculation that an explanation was being demanded by the french government from london from which there had so far been no response neither had there been any public reaction from the kremlin ive got it all ready every regulation and agreement there is for an internal inquiry if they come at me declared halliday good for you encouraged charlie whats happening with my support team probably nothing more than professional curiosity said halliday but ive already had two separate visits from your guys asking me whats going on the first glint of light gauged charlie what did you tell them that i didnt know i told you id been ordered against sharing with them could he trick halliday unsuspectingly into the answer he wanted wondered charlie not even now its all over with radtsic safely away theyre your guys not officially mine briddle was my second unexpected visitor the first was your man wilkinson he was waiting when i got here this morning why would two men supposedly working together make separate approaches the most obvious answer confirming charlies doublecross suspicion was that they werent working together he said they appear worried anything like that difficult to say hedged halliday probably wondering if it might be something more interesting than sitting around on their asses had london made wilkinson supervisor of the mi backup team during the time hed been out of contact charlie said what else is happening at the embassy a lot indicated by its total ostracizing silence said halliday as always when something goes wrong at our end we cease to exist remember charlie decided he probably didnt need halliday to tell him anything more but it was important to retain the man as a potential source which required avoiding frightening the man away im thinking of making a move doing what demanded halliday instantly alarmed at the moment its you im considering lied charlie it was wise of you to stick to londons edict with wilkinson keep doing that if you hear anything involving me i dont want your being linked to me no hint we might have been in contact neither do i said halliday sincerity obvious in his voice for the first time just listen to everything urged charlie youll tell me whats going on though wont you thats our deal isnt it mutual selfprotection wilkinsons cell phone was answered on its fourth ring without any identifying acknowledgment and from the total silence beyond and the response delay charlie guessed wilkinson had quieted those around him charlie said you know who this is patrick dont let the others waste their time trying to isolate where i am its a public kiosk youve probably discovered our technicians fitted trackers into the ones issued to us in london its good to hear from you at last wilkinsons voice sounded more computer generated than human despite the pointlessness theyd still attempt to locate him charlie knew the reason for your being here hasnt changed but im only working with you warren and preston tell london that tell them also that the four of us were part of a setup me most of all i want you to make sure that gets through to the directorgeneral i need the need is for the two of us to meet thats what i want it was going to be foot aching and tiresome charlie accepted but there was no other way are you familiar with the moscow metro system no it has a circle line just like london here its called kolcevaja ride it tomorrow between ten and noon what else just that where will we meet whereand wheni decide said charlie i dont follow what youre saying the scanners havent picked up where im speaking from have they i dont follow that either everyone around you have been scanning ever since we started talking trying to locate me havent they were not all together what youve got to understand is that none of you will be able to find me now and none of you will be able to pick me up tomorrow irrespective of how closely they stay with you im telling youand i want you to tell the directorgeneral this as wellthat we were decoys and that i know monsfords operation has gone bad you expect me to go around and around in circles until you decide to make contact demanded wilkinson thats precisely what i expect i also expect all of the others to go around and around with you although pretending not to be with you ill find you but neither you nor anyone with you will be able to locate me ill only approach you when im completely satisfied youre alone what about the reason for our being here its still active but without mi make that very clear to london and tell the directorgeneral that the other extraction has hugely increased the value of ours thanks for meeting me said jane ambersom what meeting said james straughan pointedly he hadnt realized how much hed missed being able to talk to her she smiled there isnt one you know you can trust me as i know i can trust you we committed ourselves when you called last night and by my being here said straughan shed concealed her car among a line of other anonymous vehicles close to the oval underground station at which shed been waiting for him fifteen minutes earlier smith told me all that happened at the foreign office yesterday told only you passmore was with me im not sure whether what i was told is the truth it probably was not straughan didnt answer as spontaneously as jane had hoped staring directly ahead at the empty cars at last he said more than probably not it was a chance she had to take jane decided monsford set us up didnt he with charlie and his family he intended to sabotage it is he still trying i dont know its a repeat of what happened to you monsford protecting himself is charlie in physical danger straughan didnt reply james he should be careful jane felt nothing neither surprise nor anger aubrey smith thinks monsford could still get away with it bringing us down in the process straughan frowned across the car the french have so far refused to see anyone from the paris embassy not until we respond to their demand for an explanation theyre seeing the russian chef du protocol though radtsics refusing cooperation until we get elana and the boy here jacobsons having an emergency meeting with monsford right now monsford told rebecca theres no reason for either her or me to be there with him thats how i was able to get away he looked instinctively at his watch i cant be much longer where are you supposed to be with a dementia specialist discussing getting my mother into care you think monsfords making his escape arrangement risked jane openly we know hes making his escape arrangement said straughan we isolated jane instantly rebecca is determined she wont go the same way you did you going to tell her about this no so shes making her own escape arrangements she imagines she is what about you i have but its difficult we committed ourselves the moment you got into this car reminded jane straughan smiled havent lost your touch have you i lost it the last time im not going to let the motherfucker beat me again whats your difficulty hes had his own sound system installed in the office but hes using it selectively jane answered his earlier smile so youve installed yours after we discovered what he was doing hes always very careful to avoid anything incriminating how much have you got all of it including how charlie was to be used all of it repeated straughan the difficulty is how to avoid suicidal selfdestruction getting it to those wholl sit in judgment it contravenes every internal security regulation as well as the entire official secrets act i agree you couldnt personally make it available said jane the excitement stirring through her you couldnt either insisted the man youd be even more culpable after all that charlie did and what monsford did to you there could be a way maybe even more than one its better you dont tell me straughan said hurriedly he was backing off jane recognized would you make all youve got available to me straughan hesitated i didnt imagine id find a problem answering that i didnt believe monsford was capable of sacrificing me if it hadnt been you it would have been me he gave himself two choices by accepting the sideways transfer you saved me i know said jane tensed so its payback time right on the button jane thought she said id appreciate that a source investigation could only lead to me its not inevitable argued the woman im assuming rebeccas escape is her own copy its the original mines the copy could yours be forensically proven to be a copy no then theres a way to prevent your ever being discovered i made a mistake coming here like this i wish i hadnt declared straughan we havent met remember i should get back are you seriously considering putting your mother into care ill do everything i can not to then youve got to save yourself as rebecca is determined to save herself shit rebeccas double protection is that she got her recordings from you and did her duty bringing them to bland or palmer not just to expose monsford but to protect the service from your ever making it public bullied jane devoid of hypocrisy and that would put you before a securityclosed court whod jail you for a very long time you wouldnt be able to go on caring for your mother from a prison cell would you james without a job you wouldnt even be able to get her anything but the minimum of care we work and live in a sewer dont we we do your poor mother doesnt im offering the way to keep her out of it ive got to get back we can beat monsford you know we can i need to think do that james go and think long and hard when youre caring for her tonight gerald monsford didnt like the continuing impression of so much thin ice creaking dangerously underfoot maxim mikhailovich radtsic remained the jobforlife prize upon whom if the pendulum swung the wrong way his very survival depended and with whom therefore it was imperative the mans wife and son were reunited hed done the right thing sending jacobson ahead of him back to the hertfordshire safe house but so far his own timetothink journey there almost completed monsford hadnt come close to a guaranteed way of bringing that about at least getting postponed that days foreign office session gave time for a resolve to emerge elsewhere but he wasnt encouraged by sir archibald blands warning during their rescheduling that frances current presidency of the energydependent european union held it hostage to moscows blackmail to cut off its naturalgas supplies there was too the untilnowrelegated alert from paris of andreis reluctance to defect in the first place from which the suspicion naturally followed that the boy was responsible for the french interception even if he wasnt andrei might change his uncertain mind after the first failed attempt to each and all of which had to be added jacobsons insistence at their meeting earlier that morning that radtsics cooperation hinged entirely upon their being together in exile as his car bypassed letchworth monsford saw through the separating glass that the driver was triggering the automatic signal of their approach and took his own securitycleared telephone from its rearseat armrest for an update of what he was approaching hes not physically unwell reported jacobson hes taken his morning exercise but told me hes not going out this afternoon the only thing hes said otherwise is to ask when elana and andrei are getting here when i told him that wasnt yet known he demanded the time of your arrival whats he done in between stayed in his room with a bottle of vodka watching television were monitoring him on cctv hes flicking between news channels obviously searching for announcements as far as i know there havent been any updates from france the vodka bottles half empty and hes already chosen a bottle of burgundy for lunch we should be with you in less than thirty minutes should i tell him that no anything monsford asked when straughan answered his next call the novosti news agency is saying our ambassador is again being summoned to the russian foreign ministry without giving a time or date relayed the operations director associated press is reporting under a washington dateline but without accreditation that there is an impending russian political development connected with the french arrests theres a press association sidebar that the russian and french ambassadors have been summoned to our foreign office for clarification agence francepresse are saying our embassy in paris have delivered a second note seeking access to our detained nationals anything direct from the foreign office nothing routed to me rebeccas heard nothing either call me at once if theres anything anything at all you told me that before you left reminded straughan now im telling you again tell rebecca the same jacobson was waiting at the door for monsford hes still in his room probably seen you arrive ive set things up in the drawing room monsford shrugged discomfited at not having control over the automatic audio and film equipment throughout the house im to be interrupted if theres any contact and you were wrong about no news updates thereve been several i told you i wasnt checking the coverage reminded jacobson do you want me to sit in with you why should i hes got good english hasnt he im the person radtsic knows is most familiar with i thought it might help ill see him alone it would still be recorded will you eat with him lets get on with it for christs sake demanded monsford impatiently the drawing room was at the back of the house overlooking an expansive terracestepped grassland sporadically hedged between stands of wellestablished tightly cultivated trees at the very bottom of the terrace was a swimming pool that ran its entire width and far beyond that over the tops of still more trees there was the hazed outline of letchworth in the interior of the room over couches and enveloping easy chairs were pleated and tasseled loose covering chintzes an inner circle grouped casually around a fireplace fronting a low but large table upon which a vacuum coffeepot and cups were already set filling the dead fireplace was a huge flower display of what monsford guessed to be from the outside garden forewarned by the sound of its opening monsford hand outstretched in readiness was directly behind the door when maxim radtsic started to enter the russian abruptly halted visibly pulling both arms back in refusal in russia it is not done to shake hands on a threshold it signifies it will be the only meeting he intruded a pause perhaps it is indeed an omen monsford backed away changing the offered hand into an indication toward the flowerdominated space and its encompassing couches and chair im sure it isnt radtsic followed the gesture but didnt sit what time are my wife and son arriving please sit encouraged monsford doing so himself glad the door was closing behind jacobson although always conscious of the cameras theres coffee radtsic perched himself awkwardly on the very edge of an easy chair i do not want coffee i want vodka and a reply to my question monsford pressed a summons bell bordering the fireplace it is through no mistake or fault of ours that this problem has arisen im aware youve been told in the greatest possible detail all weve been able to discover from that you know your wife and son were being escorted by my officers to an aircraft waiting to bring them safely here theyre not safely here are they rejected radtsic irritably theyre very unsafely in france where they will have been fully identified the eavesdropping jacobson entered already carrying a tray upon which were a full freezerfrosted vodka bottle an ice bucket and two glasses he almost filled both adding more when radtsic shook his head against ice at monsfords refusing head shake radtsic said youre not prepared to drink with me like you i did not want ice monsford tried to recover hot at the awareness of his second filmed mistake monsford raised his unwanted glass and said heres to your new life here in the west only a new life if its with my family corrected the other man about whom you still have not properly answered my question having until now seen the facial resemblance only from photographs monsford was struck by radtsics similarity to stalin they are still in france where they have accused my officers of kidnap escalating what could have been negotiated away as a misunderstanding into a criminal matter are you accusing them of being responsible for whats happened flared radtsic outraged of course im not denied monsford his disappointment at the antagonism slightly eased by the first wisp of the sofareluded idea i was though worried when my officer in paris told me that andrei initially refused to come you are accusing them what i am doing maxim mikhailovich is being subjective we do not yet know how the french interception was instigated which shouldnt though be our immediate focus that has to be getting them released and safely here monsford was surprised at what little effect the already consumed vodka had upon the russian watching him refill his glass radtsic frowned thats what im waiting for you to tell me how and when theyre getting here theyre not not today declared monsford positively our problem is the kidnap allegation and the association of my officers in that allegation because of that the british government are being refused access any contact whatsoever what the hells your point demanded radtsic seizing the intentionally allowed pause you the husband and father said monsford simply the concept complete in his mind there can be no legal prevention against your being allowed contact nor does your being here contravene french law ive obviously held back from publicly announcing your being here because of whats happened to elana and andrei now i want to announce it publicize it and at the same time connect you by a visual tv conference link not just to elana and andrei but simultaneously to french officials if you can persuade elana or andrei to withdraw the allegation theyll have to be released to continue here to join you for several moments radtsic remained unspeaking all truculence gone is it technically possible yes insisted monsford i can have technicians here in hours setting it up as well as frenchspeaking lawyers to argue the law on your behalf once more radtsic considered the idea topping up what little could be added to monsfords scarcely touched glass and refilling his which he held out to monsford i have not behaved as i should i apologize it is totally understandable accepted monsford as their glasses touched i drink to your reunion shakespeare had been right as he always was thought monsford sweet are the uses of adversity and from where better could the sentiment come than as you like it which he did like very much indeed you are sure insisted aubrey smith absolutely positive said jane ambersom and you can get hold of it yes she risked theres still the selfincriminating problem accepted smith i think theres a way around that said jane does it tie in with what wilkinsons relayed from moscow about charlies refusal to work with mi asked john passmore joining the review i havent the slightest idea what charlies uncovered said smith but janes story seems to support what charlies demanding he smiled humorlessly i can hardly wait for palmer and blands reaction from what little we think we know charlie and our three arent just confronting the russians to get natalia and sasha out theyre opposed by monsford and three of his people already in moscow and completely briefed on the intended extraction cautioned passmore go back to straughan the directorgeneral told jane promise him every protection whatever he wants to get whatever hes got tell him ill meet him personally if itll help hes terrified warned jane so am i said smith by the time he entered the foreign office every uncertainty was perfectly resolved in gerald monsfords mind the creaking ice hardened into a solid conviction that he was unassailable even straughans message during the return from hertfordshire of charlie muffins reappearance hadnt unsettled him the man and his family were no longer of any practical use easily discarded encumbrances monsford intentionally avoided vauxhall cross to arrive early but wasnt concerned either at finding aubrey smith ahead of him alone with geoffrey palmer congratulations upon the return of your prodigal son he greeted the blankfaced mi directorgeneral i hope youve equally good news of your errant mother and offspring smith mocked back as sir archibald bland came into the room to complete their quorum is the longawaited emergence of charlie muffin good news questioned monsford setting the stage for his intended lead thatll have to be judged on the outcome of both extractions suggested smith and were here to examine the more immediate difficulties of maxim radtsic halted bland impatiently which is dominating the cabinet who want it concluded in the shortest time possible with absolutely no further problems im authorized to tell you both that you are losing the confidence of this government effectively to continue in the positions you currently hold for the briefest moment geoffrey palmer appeared as shocked as the two directors it was the confidently prepared gerald monsford who recovered first then its clearly important that on behalf of mi i restore that confidence thats precisely what we expect you to do said palmer his stiffness the only indication of his anger at not being warned in advance of the cabinet secretarys threat the drive back from hertfordshire had allowed monsford not only to formulate his proposals but mentally to rehearse their presentation which he did flawlessly it will overwhelm all the charlie muffin embarrassment monsford concluded delivering his patronizing coup de grace to aubrey smith we can warn russia through back channels that any retaliation will be met with public expose of their lvov disaster unable to stop himself monsford went on which is perhaps some mitigation against the directorship changes youve indicated towards my mi colleague thats an extremely convincing proposal supported by an equally convincing argument cautiously acknowledged bland looking to the intelligence committee liaison for agreement providing the kidnap allegations are withdrawn qualified palmer equally cautious my proposals also make it impossible for moscow to impose any coercion upon france insisted monsford theyll be neutered i am grateful to my mi colleague for his concern at my professional future said smith anxious to match monsfords condescension i also want to make it clear that i am not playing devils advocate but getting the accusation of kidnap withdrawn isnt the only hurdle theres mollifying bruised french pride at mi mounting an espionagelinked operation on its sovereign soil theres the danger of detained mi officers having made incriminating admissions too and we dont know whats passed between moscow and paris there is absolutely nothing to suggest that this will produce any of the speculated success none of my officers will have admitted anything so i wont bother addressing that canard dismissed monsford contemptuously nowhere in my proposals have i discounted or minimized our difficulties what i have done to confront them is bring to this country the highestranking russian intelligence executive ever to defect and already have his agreement personally to persuade his family to deny they are kidnap victims removing any criminal justification for france to detain them frances precious pride can go to hell moscows too we hold the better hand for whatever poker game they choose to play we cant lose none of the others spoke each of the three waiting for one of the others to comment or commit first monsford too lapsed into quiet selfsatisfied reflection amused at how persuasively hed utilized so much of charlie muffins arguments to justify his personal involvement at their original buckinghamshire discussions hed started out properly confident monsford admitted to himself but hed never imagined gaining such an overwhelming victory even the condescension hed directed at aubrey smith a finger snap unprepared decision had worked he was the rule maker the motivator the others aubrey smith their leading supplicant had obediently to follow it was sir archibald bland the permanent civil servant whose influence spanned all political and diplomatic divides who at last broke but tried too hard for cynicism some diplomats might sometimes be mistaken for gangsters but very few aspire to such gunpoint blackmail ive put forward practical workable proposals insisted monsford impatient at last with too many confused metaphors im looking forward to hearing alternatives i believe weve taken this discussion as far as we can and from which there might well be a place for the suggested diplomatic involvement said palmer but isnt there something further questioned monsford reluctant to quit while he was so far ahead what about the resurrection of charlie muffin im curious at your describing charlies reappearance as a resurrection quickly seized aubrey smith do you have a reason for imagining he might have been dead monsfords balloon didnt burst but the air began to seep from the overinflated euphoria it was an inappropriate remark he forced himself to admit but im sure all of us are curious about what hes been doing charlies surfaced smith told the other two ive heard very little apart from discovering hes refusing to operate with mi which makes me as curious as im sure it does all of you with which im more than happy to accept monsford hurried in im no longer willing to risk either my officers or my service on such an irresponsible operative i would even suggest the extraction of charlie muffin and his family is abandoned and all our officers withdrawn before anything else goes wrong we talked began smith but palmer talked over him are you telling us the confounded mans still refusing specific instructions no denied smith emphatically unsure how far he could manipulate monsford with jane ambersoms limited information there are indications that hes discovered a situation making it unsafemaybe even physically dangerousfor him to be associated with the mi secondment i demand an explanation of that remark exploded monsford exaggerating the outrage the fragile confidence wavering which im as anxious to give as you are to hear said smith enjoying the quick reversal but as were discussing your operatives i was hoping you might have some input i havent the slightest idea what youre talking about blustered the mi director in which case therell need to be the most rigorous inquiry which i assure all of you it will get undertook smith perhaps we could get some early indication the three seconded nolongeracceptable mi officers will be recalled or perhaps they should remain to prevent further disasters argued monsford panicked half thoughts refusing properly to cohere youve changed your mind remarkably quickly challenged smith hoping the two government grandees were assessing monsford as he was you began hardly able to wait to disassociate your service from mine now youre demanding they remain that was before your accusations started monsford threw back awkwardly turning that awkwardness back upon the other man smith said what accusations i havent accused anyone of anything i merely speculated in the widest possible manner on a reason for charlies curious message and i would in passing strongly argue against abandoning charlies mission i believed wed accepted charlie will try to get his wife and child out with or without our support precisely the potential danger im warning against and why my men must stay blurted monsford to the frowned confusion of both bland and palmer bland said this is spiraling into absurdity well adjourn but by tomorrow i want this sorted out to be discussed and resolved constructively i opened this session warning of lost government confidence little of what ive heard today has changed the sentiment i think the man stopped at a summoning buzz from outside the room palmer pressed the doorrelease button and accepted the message slip from a foreign office messenger looking up palmer said its just been announced in moscow that one of the two heartattack victims from the tourist group has died after its productive start charlies day went downhill hed spent a frustrating forenoon failing to reach natalia and too much of the early afternoon unable to reconnect with david halliday to learn of a reaction to his approaching patrick wilkinson long before the clumsy russian entry into his vauxhall flat charlie acknowledged the onionskin overlap of espionage and burglary the cardinal credo of both being always to establish a guaranteed exit before contemplating an entry which required the utmost preparation for the following days metro merrygoround with wilkinson which he hoped would be as successful as his london evasion of his original safehouse guardians smolenskaya was the station closest to the moskvabordering british embassy and the logical place for wilkinson to set off to guard against his expectation of wilkinsons not being alone charlie spent a full thirty minutes refamiliarizing himself with the station layout and hideaway surveillance spots he twice rode his chosen route and following that refamiliarization disembarked at each of the linked intersections to memorize their individual geography at four randomly chosen stops charlie interrupted his protective survey to return to ground level for still unsuccessful telephone attempts it took charlie three hours to complete his personal mapping and isolate the bestsuited stations charlie finished at smolenskaya with the last of the continuous tests hed risked during the journey testing the recharged britishadapted russian mobile that was to feature heavily the following day knowing the replacement russian payasyougo devices wouldnt operate at the depths of the moscow underground system he moved as deeply into the station as possible impressed as he had been every previous time that the phones indicator showed a full battery as soon as hed proved its effectiveness charlie once more removed the battery to defeat the suspected tracker application it was past six before natalia eventually answered and from the obvious terseness charlie knew at once she was not alone he named the time and restaurant in the university district quickly enough for her to dismiss the call as misdialed as she disconnected charlie tried from the same kiosk and twice more from others during his next reconnaissance before accepting that hallidays refusal was deliberate which was irritating although predictable charlie wondered how difficult it would be to restore their situation it depended he supposed on londons response to his reappearance and insisted separation from mi to get an indication of that hed have to wait until he met wilkinson if he managed to meet wilkinson came the realistic qualification there had been as always a professional practicality in charlies booking dinner that night at the wild egret it had been a favorite of both at the beginning of their marriage conveniently close to their prerevolutionarymansion apartment the nostalgia of which he hoped shed appreciate as much as she had his earlier choice he enjoyed the nostalgic significance too but equally important was its nearness to the multientranced warren of kurskaya metro station from which he planned to leave the wilkinson carousel he studied that as intently as he had smolenskaya going in and out of all three entrances marking every concealment and vantage point and back once more aboveground rediscovered the tributary streets to the treblelane highways and connecting ring road gratefully approaching the end of his professional preparations charlie sought out a halfremembered landmark that he found closer to the wild egret than hed recalled slipping easily into the alcoves completely dark interior it had once contained a horsewatering trough now removed but still with a wide ledge remaining for charlie to perch on to relieve the footburning discomfort after so much walking refusing even to contemplate how much worse it would be the following day charlie picked out natalia when she was still more than a hundred meters away approaching from the direction of the kurskaya station and was at once caught by the caution she was showing discreetly checking her trail twice before reaching a crossstreet intersection where she hesitated longer to ensure she was not under parallel road surveillance he couldnt detect any either but waited a full five minutes to make absolutely sure natalia was alone before he left the alcove to follow she was being seated as he entered she smiled up as he joined her and said so you were checking i didnt have unwanted company the alcove where the trough used to be you were very good i was trying to impress you you knew id be watching as i expected youd choose this restaurant lets hope it lives up to the memories they took their time ordering charlie insisting upon celebration beluga was my call a problem asked charlie natalia shook her head wed finished but i was still in the building with people around i had it on mute so no one heard it you dumped the phone after removing the sim card and the battery said natalia smiling at the insistence and i didnt dispose of them in the same bins charlie smiled back at the gentle rebuke so how was your first day natalia sipped her wine considering her reply not what i expected not that i knew exactly what to expect there are six of us im the only woman i dont know any of the others three have been drafted in from st petersburg theres no chairperson we each work on a document batch she paused does your service operate by naming with time date and location of each encounter every potentially useful outside contact did she want a matching contribution with what she was disclosing or was it just a point of comparison charlie waited for them to be served before saying its universal isnt it natalia nodded thats how we have to work when we come to any outside name with whom radtsics ever had unsupervised contact particularly british weve got to flag it as well as verbally announcing it around the table for further recognition if the name appears in someone elses separated document batch how thick is each individual batch about a third of a meter have you a better idea of how many other groups there are apart from yours approximately a dozen as far as i can establish but theres an equal number starting tomorrow to refine the initial results the lunchtime rumor was that at that stage the flagged names will transfer to computer analysis and comparison is that all you have to flag up westernparticularly britishidentities natalia shook her head repetitive destinations and locations again concentrated on the west vacation spots stuff like that the checking and crosschecking will take months estimated charlie i know how much crossreferencing did your particular group assemble today twelve at the end of the day natalia was talking on the turned spys psychological profile charlie recognized once the initial dyke breaches the tidal wave of disclosures follows the analysis wont take months itll take years even computerized how long itll take isnt the point said natalia its the documentation itself what about it charlie frowned its all duplicated no originals although from its font and typeface it was created on a typewriter not a computer just your duplicates or everybodys queried charlie everybodys do you understand my point elana and andrei radtsic were detained less than fortyeight hours ago calculated charlie allowing a generous twelve for the connection to be established between paris and moscow that gives thirtysix hours for the kremlin to discover radtsic had gone whats your estimate of radtsics combined kgb and fsb service nearly thirty years responded natalia at once weve no way of knowing if everything has been duplicated cautioned charlie all the other examining groups are handling copies said natalia then youre right finally agreed charlie its impossible for them to have photocopied a thirtyyear archive in just thirtysix hours so whats going on asked natalia i dont know replied charlie its not our problem whens sasha back the day after tomorrow thursday identified charlie are you working weekends of course ill have everything before then well go for sunday after several moments natalia said how the safest way i havent yet chosen which sasha will know its not a holiday that its still term time dont say anything to her until saturday and only then that its a surprise and that the school has agreed and dont let her see any of her friends after youve told her youll be with us wont you i wont be going alone charlie was unsettled by her complete reliance thats the idea isnt it that at last well all be together i hope so hope so very much charlie wished there werent so much uncertainty in her voice this is probably the last full time well have together natalia checked her watch i could come back to the hotel for two hours id hoped you could i want you with me when we go charlie i want to know youre somewhere close she suddenly blurted i dont want it to be just sasha and me from sunday youre never going to be by yourselves not ever again it was just after nine when they left the restaurant in london it was still only six thirty and everyone was still working theres got to have been a leak monsford was striding up and down in front of the panoramic river view more angry than nervous from beside the mans desk rebecca street had already indicated the sound apparatus was inactive how can there have been a leak demanded james straughan jacobson and charlie have never met and jacobson categorically denies he said anything to halliday who wasnt ever involved until the last minute upon your orders which were also that halliday worked blind its not difficult to work out calmed rebecca were misleading ourselves charlie muffin cant have had any reason for getting off the amsterdam plane apart from distrusting his own shadow now hes got a reason after the publicity over the seizure of elana and andrei charlies a consummate professional whos learned and practiced ten times more than anyone ever learns at training school hell have worked out that were involved with the two russian nationals in france at the same time as were supposed to be part of the extraction of his wife and child elana and andrei havent been identified and theres been no publicity that radtsics already here rejected monsford slumping back into his chair people like charlie muffin who trusts no one can multiply two plus two into the national debt argued rebecca what little is publicly known is more than enough to spook charlie muffin from coming within a million miles of any of our people monsford shook his head in refusal turning to straughan whats briddle say just that mi have retreated into their rezidentura slamming the door behind them i beat aubrey smith into a frazzle in the beginning but he recovered almost completely with the fucking cooperation refusal said monsford in a rare admission what do we do about our three in moscow asked straughan they stay insisted the mi director at once now muffins crawled from beneath the stone hes been under i want to be his shadow every time he farts i want to hear it im not having the radtsic coup taken away from me by charlie muffin ive nominally appointed briddle our field supervisor said straughan do you have any specific instructions monsford hesitated head bent it certainly wasnt better to face slings and arrows he decided the only way was to take up arms against the sea of trouble looking up he said tell him to call me at ten prompt tomorrow his time ill take the call personally it sounds as if you won suggested jane ambersom we wont have won until monsfords removed which im determined to make happen before im fired said aubrey smith do you think it was a serious threat queried john passmore totally serious confirmed the mi directorgeneral and if i go ill go down in flame which means its imperative you get whatever straughan has hes not taking my calls either on his landline or his cell phone said jane keep trying said smith are the mi backup being withdrawn asked passmore wilkinson doesnt think its going to be easy operating separately out of the same building i want to speak to charlie direct demanded smith have wilkinson tell him that tell him also to warn charlie to watch his back talking to jane straughan didnt rule out physical violence its unthinkable that monsford would contemplate anything physical against a british intelligence officer insisted passmore no its not said jane even more insistently thats exactly what hell be thinking if it means saving himself charlie worked on the assumption that patrick wilkinson either knowingly or otherwise would not be alone on the circle line which hed most likely join from the station closest to the british embassy it was also possible theyd imagine hed get on at smolenskaya too and assemble an ambush there long before his ten am departure using wilkinson as their ontime bait their obvious concentration would be around the entrance to avoid which he started his approach from kurskaya at the height of moscows eight oclock rush hour sandwiching himself into the secondtolast carriage which hed established from his previous days footslogging disgorged its passengers into the instant concealment of a vaulted support column and an angled wall from its cover he allowed himself a protective sweep for a recognizable face with the train still at the platform for instant escape before edging himself back into the human flow that took him to his already chosen observation spot a set of metal service stairs leading up to a mezzanine range of control offices twenty meters beyond the towering escalator banks to the circle lines snack media and tobacco kiosks the overshadowing darkness of the service stairwell gave charlie unbroken observation of arriving and disembarking commuters as well as an uninterrupted view of the other most likely hideaways from which others trained in his craft would wait in readiness for him to appear and if they chose his hideaway to be theirs he had a second girdered stairwell farther along the concourse beneath which he could merge unseen there was even a conveniently low horizontal stress bar separating two of the upright girders against which he propped himself to take his full weight off his troublesome feet it was eight fifty before charlie made the first recognition relieved it was neil preston a fellow mi officer the fairhaired overweight man was close to the top of the farthest downward escalator tightly clutching the hand support to prevent himself being forced down the stairs by the crush behind anxiously scanning the crowded platform below from his diminishing elevation preston hesitated at platform level pulling himself out of the current of people briefly for no more than seconds preston appeared to look directly at charlie who tensed ready to retreat but then the man looked away and moved in the opposite direction and positioned his back to another of the major support pillars from the inside pocket of his unbuttoned raincoat preston took an unidentifiable newspaper already cleverly folded smaller than its tabloid size for commutercrowded reading which he gave the impression of doing without obscuring his platform view robert denning appeared at the top of the escalator exactly four minutes later but pulled himself into a small recess at its top to stare down at the human sea below charlie knew he was totally concealed from above from the tall balding mi officer who also wore a raincoat although unlike preston tightly buttoned and belted charlie was also sure that from his vantage point denning wouldnt be able to locate preston whom hed presumably followed dennings head moved from side to side as he scanned the platform straining forward at the arrival and departure of trains after at least ten minutes denning took from his pocket what charlie at once recognized to be one of the special vauxhallissued russian cell phones it was a brief conversation after which denning turned back against the crowd disappearing toward street level charlie kept his concentration on the upper level at the same time keeping preston in sight preston in turn maintained his constant vigil from behind his newspaper screen preston had obviously been followed by denning whose telephone alert had most likely been to briddle or beckindale but not both hed appeared to dial only once and the conversation hadnt been long enough to involve more than one person why hadnt denning come down to platform level to avoid his descent being visible to preston charlie guessed he hoped it indicated that london had accepted his message to exclude m nine fortyfive charlie saw from the platform clock where was wilkinson if wilkinson was going to keep to the timetable the man should have been here by now but only if he was joining the merrygoround from smolenskaya charlie qualified it would have been wiser more professional for wilkinson to evade pursuit by boarding at a different station using preston and warren to lay false trails but they hadnt came another qualification preston had led denning to the underground system and denning had doubtless alerted the other m men so even if warren and wilkinson were using different stations the intended encounter was compromised which it definitely was charlie accepted as patrick wilkinson appeared at the top of the escalator by now the rush hour had thinned and as he descended wilkinson expectantly swept the platform below seeking preston whose head jerk of recognition was even more obvious preston left his pillar as wilkinson reached the platform and for a moment charlie thought the two were actually going to link up they didnt but preston stopped close enough for both to enter the same carriage charlies distraction from the escalator was only seconds but when he looked back denning was halfway down using a group of uniformed soldiers for cover and as the man reached the bottom beckindale got on at the top and descended with even less concealment behind a furhatted furcoated woman neither wilkinson nor preston looked behind him to check his trail charlie replaced the battery in his adapted cell phone before beckindale got to the bottom his attention wholly upon the two mi officers hurrying to board the second and third carriage of the incoming train behind that of wilkinson and preston with the carriage doors still open charlie texted denning woman in fur hat and coat two seats in front is fsb and saw dennings grab at his pocket as he went back to the mobile phone charlie texted wilkinson get rid of preston stay where you are denning and beckindale in carriages behind the train pulling away from the station prevented charlies catching the second reaction charlie waited ten minutes to guard against warren or briddle arriving late before using the underpass to the opposite platform for counterclockwise trains knowing from his previous days reconnaissance that he would be at paveletsky long before wilkinsons train the numbered designation of which was it hadnt started well charlie acknowledged objectively you know where he is interrupted gerald monsford hunched forward over the telephone in his empty office i said theres positive movement refused briddle wilkinsons told me theyve been ordered to break from us im guessing theres a linkup with charlie when broke in monsford again briddle sighed audibly after the wilkinson confrontation we started monitoring this morning denning followed preston to smolenskakaya metro preston established observation just short of an hour later beckindale followed wilkinson to the same station wilkinson and preston got on the same train but not together our guys are with them although not together on the same train as the other two its a meeting please let me finish protested briddle whose only professional contact with the director had been during his private assassination briefing before their train pulled out denning got a text from charlie telling him that a woman in front of him was fsb briddle stopped expectantly but for the first time monsford didnt break in denning got off at the next station the woman didnt follow she wouldnt have been alone there would have been a switch said the m director filling in the exchange while he composed his intended story to the other man or it was a trick to screw our surveillance suggested briddle whatever it means that charlie was watching everything my guess is that he was on the train is beckindale searching for him of course he is but he can only risk the carriages behind his own if he goes forward hell be seen by wilkinson or preston ive told him to do his best to get some view into wilkinsons carriage to establish if charlies there if the meetings there hes to follow charlie when he gets off you havent forgotten our private meeting have you said monsford everything clear in his mind of course not what have you been told by straughan little more than that the french business is our operation its the wife and son of maxim radtsic the executive deputy of the fsb jesus exclaimed briddle and weve got radtsic safely here in england im working to extract the family here too expect to initiate it today thats background information for you to understand the echelon at which were working the three of you wont have any active involvement in that your undivided concentration is to be on charlie muffin whose message to denning definitely wasnt a trick the trick was all that crap about his having to get his wife and daughter out of russia radtsics confirmed charlie muffin is a double but m wont accept it thats why theyve ordered their people to block you out and im giving you the same order theres to be no further liaison with mi i want them watched until charlie muffin is located but you are not to tell denning or beckindale why i want him found work against our own people questioned briddle uneasily charlie muffin isnt our people radtsic insists he was turned years ago in the old kgb days and that hes been responsible for the deaths of at least eight loyal officers four of them ours if hes gone over hes here safe said briddle if hes got away whys he apparently got into contact with wilkinson and the others three and eight make eleven said monsford and if he identifies you three that eleven could come up to fourteen im not going to let him have that final count as his swan song briddle lapsed into silence and this time monsford didnt prompt content to wait eventually briddle said theres no way the three of us can detain him get him out of the country even if the others lead us to him i know said monsford shortly what do you want us to do you to do qualified monsford we established at our private session that you hold the clearance authority in extreme circumstances which i judge these to be are you authorizing me with the direct and specific order yes there will be no paper trail that direct order under a classified seal will be logged with your personnel file which you know from your clearance categorization what do i tell denning and beckindale nothing use them as trackers nothing more insisted monsford and the restriction im imposing also includes the operations director and the deputy director is that properly understood yes said briddle i understand two preceding trains gave charlie the time to reposition himself for the paveletsky arrival of service but its decreasing speed was still too fast to satisfy charlie that the unwanted three hadnt remained unobtrusively on the train none was in the same carriage as wilkinson whod acquired a newspaper prop but was ignoring it only once risking a quick sideways glance out toward the platform before turning back to look fixedly ahead nor now the train was stationary were any of those he sought in the carriages directly in front or behind from every rehearsal the day before charlie had been sure this initial precaution would have worked but still refused the twinge of frustration that it hadnt by using his suspected tracker telephone mi would know he was in moscows metro system despite his having once more removed the battery disappointed as he was by the sofarevidenced lack of professionalism it should become obvious from his next text transmission how he was monitoring them there was little if anything they could do to trace his exact location but further to confuse themand possibly cause the disembarkation of those still possibly riding the carouselcharlie waited until the train moved off before reinserting the battery to text wilkinson stay onboard afterdobryninskayaget offkomsomolskaya wait dobryninskaya was the next station along the line into which the train should be pulling as wilkinson read the message charlie used the a filevskaya subline changed at the midring hub and arrived at komsomolskaya within twenty minutes it was one of the stations hed personally surveyed the day before to choose his observation hide charlie was glad his feet werent so far aching as badly as hed feared he didnt tell you anything demanded james straughan rebecca street shook her head nothing about the moscow call just that he was getting a decision on the radtsic linkup and that he expected to go directly from the foreign office to hertfordshire what did he say to briddle i dont know why dont you know demanded the woman he had briddles call patched directly through from the communications room to his extension theres no way i could attach a tieline both circuits are alarmed didnt you ask briddle briddle told me it was officially restricted to himself and the director that the exclusion applied to you and me he cant do that protested the woman that undermines the position and authority of both of us monsfords done it cut us completely out weve got enough declared rebecca cut out we dont know what hes saying putting in our names or making us appear responsible warned straughan we cant afford to overlook how much of what he did to get into the lvov affair was dumped onto jane ambersom the moment it all went wrong she didnt have what weve got he does know everything the three of us have discussed up to now even if hes been selectively recording it all reminded straughan unconvinced you keep running around in fear circles youre going to disappear up your own ass derided rebecca it would be safer there than where i believe myself to be now said straughan selfpityingly on this occasion gerald monsford got to the foreign office ahead of the other three his quick irritation at being relegated to an anteroom to wait for the government liaison compounded by aubrey smiths arriving next the m directorgeneral nodded curtly but didnt speak monsford didnt bother with any response sir archibald bland and palmer were fifteen minutes late neither one apologized or explained their delay as they sat bland said the french have agreed to a visual conference exchange between radtsic and his family but theyre insisting upon conditions as we are he looked directly at monsford how much time will you need to set it up no time at all responded the mi director my securitycleared engineers are already in hertfordshire waiting being a permanent safe house all the technology is already there too theyll only want the french technical information to make the twoway communication connection did you prepare it all ahead of the diplomatic agreement queried palmer i thought id made it clear that im working proactively it didnt require a great deal of preparation how involved are the russians questioned aubrey smith one of the french insistences is that russia has full access through their paris embassy said bland you mean a simultaneous live tiein to everything thats said pressed smith yes confirmed the cabinet secretary radtsics in a safe house smith pointed out isnt there an obvious danger of the russians technically pinpointing his whereabouts to mount a recovery operation ive anticipated that possibility with my technicians monsford smiled hed hoped for an intervention he could mock it will be a satellite transmission which for the recipient begins and ends at the satellite but as an added safeguard against the russians having the scientific capability to overcome that cutout the connection will not be direct from hertfordshire it will be routed through a booster station just outside ashford in kent that cutout totally precludes anything being traced back to where radtsic is admirable forethought congratulated bland were interpreting russian constraints in some of the french conditions their major insistence is that there should be no pressure or threatening accusations that it is all conducted unemotionally what about pressure or threats that the russian diplomats will have already made upon elana and the boy asked smith professionalism overcoming his personal antipathy toward the m director theres no way we can discover the extent of that nor counter it said palmer were actually surprised astonished almost that theyve agreed at all werent our strengths made clear demanded monsford belligerently i have no knowledge of the actual negotiations avoided palmer unconvincingly radtsics strongminded to the point of arrogance ive already told you that several times said monsford ill spell it out again but there cant be any guarantee spell out something even more clearly urged bland the moment it degenerates into a shouting match the french will disconnect from their end and itll all be over the russians are orchestrating it judged smith quickly their simultaneous access enables them to make a complete transcript its a preposterous insistence that it wont be emotional theyll let the exchange between the family continue for as long as serves their purpose but at some stage whether or not radtsic loses control theyll cut the link and have a recording they can edit to whatever benefit they choose thats a wild hypothesis prompted by nothing more than the despair of a counterespionage service thats proved itself incapable of performing its function or controlling its officers accused monsford aubrey smith ignored the outburst as well as the man continuing to address the cabinet secretary the entire encounter will obviously be in russian wont it with simultaneous english and french translation confirmed bland in what other language would a conversation be conducted between a russian family demanded the m director once more smith ignored the other director it will somehow be manipulated into a russian propaganda coup most definitely within the country itself my guess is that itll be turned into apparent proof that weve kidnapped radtsic and are holding him here against his will so what if its only for internal consumption demanded monsford what spin do you imagine the french will put upon it asked smith speaking at last to his counterpart certainly not that theyre under russian duress and their versionremember they hold the european presidencywill get a strong play throughout the union he went back to the other two men and our problem has been counteracting russian publicity and public perception hasnt it has everyone forgotten my suggestion how to counteract that dismissed monsford aubrey smith waited hopefully arent there several points there questioned bland in cautious agreement no rejected smith satisfied we cant anticipate the publicity this will generate until its happened so well be following their lead with each and every rebuttal we attempt appearing that we have to defend ourselves what then are you suggesting demanded palmer that the conference connection is established that maxim radtsic is warned as strongly as possible of the potential traps and that we all pray that he manages to persuade his wife and son to continue on here said smith establishing his reservations if that is the kidnap allegations are withdrawn and the french agree to release them into our protection and not moscows if we get them here we achieve the defection if we dont itll be unmitigated professional disasters im sure we all of us defer to your knowledge of professional disasters said monsford your favorite shakespeare had a view of professional disasters didnt he said smith something along the lines of how he was wearied by them the first murderer in macbeth i seem to remember the circle line service hissed into komsomolskaya more slowly than it had at paveletsky which charlie assumed to be dictated by platform length making it easier to identify beckindale and warren in their respective carriages both were standing as if to get off but which charlie guessed made it easier for them to scour the arrival platform taking it as confirmation of their surveillance realization wilkinson snatched to answer charlies call as the train squealed to a final halt charlie said appear to be getting off the train but dont and disconnected watching warren and beckindale move separately in their respective carriages toward the opening doors for a closer platform search warren must have had his cell phone in his hand from the awkwardness with which he answered it getting off the train charlie said beckindales with you lose him im at the top of the escalator ill make the contact warrens reaction was better than charlie had expected there was no startled backward look warren continued purposefully on as beckindale got off appearing surprised at the sight of the other man ahead of him beckindale hesitated uncertainly looking between warren and the train edging just close enough to see wilkinson getting up from his seat beckindale remained momentarily undecided before hurrying after warren charlie moved too having to thrust his outstretched arms between the closing doors for them to reopen to admit him he was taking a hell of a chance charlie accepted with no idea if any of the others remained on the train it would be safer to stay where he was next to the door at least until he cleared the next station there were audible voices speaking french but no picture the screen flickered distorted images breaking up then settled to show elana and andrei side by side behind a table which was how radtsic was positioned in hertfordshire by m technicians theyd also covered the entire wall behind him with beige nonreflective fabric as the french had also done in paris in the same color the microphones on both tables virtually matched as well the water carafes were similar each oddly set with four accompanying tumblers monsford was behind the camera with earphoned technicians and engineers hands cupping earphones to his head to hear the simultaneous translation i can began radtsic uneven voiced at a gesture from a technician off camera radtsic stopped clearing his throat and started again i can see you we can see you too said elana she was wearing a vivid red dress with a diamond brooch pinned close to her left shoulder her hair was immaculately coiffured her voice was even showing none of her husbands uncertainty how are you asked radtsic all right andrei all right andrei shrugged as he spoke he was wearing an openneck shirt beneath a sweater which appeared too big for him his hair was tousled uncombed and he constantly fidgeted both hands first on the table then in his lap quickly back to the table again unlike his mother instead of looking into the camera he seemed to be seeking people behind it radtsic cleared his throat again stiltedly enunciating each word as if reading from a script he said are you being well treated very well assured elana for the first time glancing behind the camera i am in england yes almost hurriedly she said we know i want you both here in england with me were going to live here you were mistaken about being kidnapped they were friends helping you you must tell people that make it clear to people there so they understand the french transmission began to break up and monsford came too close to the technician operating the english equipment jogging him abruptly the screen cleared i started elana but andrei talked over her no he declared loudly im not coming not agreeing youre betraying us traitor youre a traitor radtsic visibly clenched his hands outstretched on the table and monsford tensed forward again anticipating the outburst against which hed warned the russian but radtsics voice was controlled although still stilted i am not a traitor i want you here with me and your mother i want to come will come elana managed before andrei overwhelmed her shouting now i dont want to come dont want to be with you see you dead thats what i think youre dead to me please pleaded radtsic still controlled although his hands were bunched into fists please andrei dont break up the family i need you here with me you cant stay there stay anywhere except here with me you know that i will come want to come elana repeated go with him yelled andrei turning to his mother go with the traitor i dont want to be with you either of you not anymore he began to struggle up physically to separate himself from her stay where you are roared radtsic all restraint gone red faced with fury you will come here do as youre told but the link was cut long before hed finished i warned you what would happen said monsford stopping just short of the exasperation that might have antagonized the russian into worse anger theyd moved from the room in which the conference link had been established into a glassed conservatory overlooking the grounds radtsic had refused vodka demanding scotch disobeying me actually disobeying me his father struggled radtsic disbelievingly oblivious anyway to what monsford was saying he must come they wont let him stay in france hell be taken back punished were trying to reconnect said monsford emptily desperately trying to think ahead it was the surprise of actually seeing you knowing that youre already here after whats happened in france hell come round when he adjusts to the reality he called me a traitor denigrated me remembered radtsic overwhelmed in disbelief i must speak to him make him understand i told you were trying to reconnect there are discussions in france diplomatic channels opened dont forget elana is coming to be with you its all going to work out radtsic shook his head comprehending what monsford was saying i must speak to andrei make things clear hell come when he understands its taking a long time to reconnect to paris why cant we go back to where the camera is to be ready harry jacobson appeared at the door gesturing there was a telephone call wait here monsford told the russian i dont want you coming near the television setup i need to make sure its safe for you when monsford reached him jacobson said geoffrey palmer wants you personally and france is refusing to reestablish the link tell them to keep trying i already have weve seen the replay announced palmer when monsford identified himself what happened you saw what happened said monsford irritably who else watched it all three of us why didnt you tell radtsic to hold his temper to stay calm i did snapped monsford the irritation more at knowing aubrey smith had seen the transmission than at palmers facile questions what is the embassy saying in paris theyre still trying to reach someone wholl talk to them elana said she wants to come i told you we saw it said palmer we also saw andrei refuse and call his father a traitor whats his reaction been he wants to talk to andrei he thinks he can persuade him to change his mind if he can speak to him im not neither are the others and even though they havent made direct contact the embassy dont think its a technical breakdown theyre sure the frenchwhich means the russianscarried out their threat when radtsic started shouting its too early to judge insisted monsford anxious to escape from the foreign office mandarin the judgment being made here in london is that the whole episode has been a complete disaster said palmer and i know the bastard whos promoting that verdict monsford thought ive got to get back to radtsic what youve got to do is sort this mess out said palmer putting down the phone ahead of the other man hed have to take the risk charlie accepted as the train came into kurskaya no one against whom he was tensed appeared during the sixminute journey between stations which left two suspect mi officers unaccounted for as well as neil preston who from their standard of tradecraft so far could still lead the mi hunters back to him after cellphone contact with wilkinson if that is they were still somewhere on the train or waiting at one of the intervening stops farther along the line ready to board it seemed a relatively slow entry giving charlie a platform sweep and he didnt see a hostile face among the waiting passengers but he was more vulnerable on a train than on a platform with a choice of exits and escape tunnels the train came to its final halt as charlie made his decision abruptly pushing against passengers preparing to get off ready to run with them if he saw unwelcome faces which from wilkinsons instant recognition as he reached the mans carriage charlie suspected his to be charlie scarcely paused or bent as he passed saying follow me now charlie didnt hesitate on the platform either striding on now agonized feet to the linking tunnel to the metro services third arbatdesignated line hunched against an identifying challenge which didnt come charlie pulled to the rear of the platform satisfied at last with wilkinsons following arrival the man didnt repeat his earlier recognition but came to the same platform section close to the wall charlies concentration was beyond the man seeking pursuit relieved at seeing only strangers he moved toward the first incoming train bringing wilkinson with him but hung back for the man to board first relieved again that wilkinson chose a separate twoperson side bench sufficiently isolated from other passengers im never going to take another metro greeted wilkinson as charlie slumped beside him nor am i said charlie gratefully stretching out his overworked feet hed got away with it but the metro merrygoround had proved more difficult than hed imagined and the suckedin streetlevel pollution was worse than hed remember even during his earlier reconnaissance im relying on guesswork start from my plane disappearance what in charlies opinion wilkinson lacked in tradecraft he more than compensated for in succinct recall and charlie didnt interrupt abandoning his intended train change at the central hub continuing on instead to the arbat where it was quicker anyway to transfer to the southtonorth sokolniceskaja route it still took another ten minutes for wilkinson to finish smith believes youre in genuine physical danger he ordered me to tell briddle theres no longer any partnership that all cooperation is over smiths trying to get monsfords people withdrawn but theres no sign of it happening you let them follow you today that was stupid openly accused charlie i was sure id slipped beckindale denning was with preston too why bring preston with you believing mi want me eliminated why werent preston and warren decoys drawing them away smiths orders are that we provide maximum protection on todays showing im safer on my own it was a mistake and im sorry charlie shrugged dismissively radtsics definitely in london right yes and elana and the boy are held in france as of yesterday i havent heard anything new today why is smith so convinced monsfords planning a move against me wheres monsfords gain doing this wilkinson matched charlies earlier shrug smith doesnt know not yet he might have learned more since we last spoke but isnt it about time you told me what the hell youve been doing he had to be careful charlie knew natalias extraction value was hugely increased by her secondment to the lvov investigation but that value would be quadrupled by keeping her in place and using him as a conduit before we get to the details theres something important to pass on to london which means your getting some background we misinterpreted natalias calls to london she was interrogated after the lvov affair i was identified during it which threw up something that happened a long time ago she debriefed me after i worked a phoney defection thats what brought her under suspicion after lvov but shes been cleared and now shes been appointed to one of at least eight separate damagelimitation teams to investigate radtsics complete background to discover who turned him shes got access to radtsics records demanded wilkinson incredulously enough decided charlie now he had to ensure against a london insistence that natalia remain in place she and a lot more to prevent any one person getting a comprehensive overview thats why its being split between so many different initial analysts anything they find is to be passed on to other groups for further examination her secondment is strictly limited i dont how short its still an incredible opportunity gauged wilkinson a gold mine expanded charlie pleased at the reaction thats what you have to tell london for them to realize how much more important its become to get her out but not before shes got everything she can not until she has to leave her group of course not agreed charlie satisfied the train had passed the circleline intersection without any mi presence but charlie maintained his usual caution jerking up without warning at dmitrovskaya knowing there was a conveniently close although neglected postagestamp park in which he could end their meeting as well as observe his pursuit precaution theres not a lot more to discuss at this stage he resumed choosing a bench that kept the metros single entrance and exit in sight i met with passmore after the general session at vauxhall cross i know the russian passports were shipped separately direct to me unknown to the three from mi yes youre sure positive those are the ones i want as well as twentyfive thousand pounds all in us dollars what about tickets the twentyfive thousand is traveling expense traveling about which youre not going to give me any details no but i want you to be overheard by the others discussing the polish exit were not to be involved at all are we no thats ridiculous protested wilkinson youre not just an fsb target ive just told you smiths convinced our own side might even want to kill you you spell out how much more important natalia has become why its imperative she gets to england and cap the whole fucking thing telling me youre going to do it all by yourself im still free because i know how to stay that way and i performed the amsterdam vanishing trick because monsfords involvement stank from the beginning and now we know why no we dont rejected wilkinson we dont know why youre at risk from monsford i accept we fucked up this morning youve got every reason to be pissed off but youll fail trying to run the extraction entirely alone and you know it and aubrey smith wouldnt allow it either charlie accepted and could forbid the passport handover i dont intend running the extraction alone of course thats impossible youll all be part of it at the very end its the logistics im compartmenting just as the fsb are compartmenting their lvov investigation youve got mi in permanent pursuit i havent i can move about make the plans you cant aubrey smith still wont sanction it warned wilkinson he wouldnt have liked people from whom he believes im in physical danger being led to me this morning said charlie how will i get the passports and money to you if london approves ill call you personally at the rezidentura i might not get a quick response from london with so much going on elsewhere nine oclock tomorrow morning as its striking said charlie and i know youll try to follow me when we split up and my feet hurt too much to fuck about losing you so ill come with you back to the metro to know where you are he took the londonissued cell phone from his pocket did you pick up the tracker signal after your first call admitted wilkinson why didnt you tell me asked charlie glad hed followed his instinct our orders are to look after you now weve linked up reminded wilkinson you dont have to worry about cellphone trackers anymore thered been an element of luck stephen briddle congratulated himself as he saw the two get up from the park bench but hed worked most of it out himself after learning from denning and beckindales calls that wilkinson wasnt moving from the circle lines service positioning them on clockwise platforms to confirm it and already onboard waiting when charlie finally joined it two stations later hed managed to keep up with all the line switches allowing them the longest possible lead because of that intentional distancing and the skilift height of the escalators briddle had still been inside the dmitrouskaya station when charlie and wilkinson found their park bench the metro provided complete concealment throughout their encounter and as they came toward him briddle recognized he couldnt be in a better place not just to continue his surveillance but even to stage monsfords demanded fatal accident aware despite his newness to moscow that there were at least suicides a year on the underground system and that one extra statistic would not arouse any official suspicion briddle was invisibly within the shadows of the platform food stall by the time the two men rode the escalator down for the simultaneous arrival of a train to board and wilkinson didnt pause neither did briddle joining a noisy group of departing foodstall customers to sit two carriages behind his quarry briddle had an unbroken view of the outside platform which was where as the train lurched into motion he saw charlie not on the train as hed imagined but still standing there and although there was no obvious recognition briddle knew charlie had seen him too an expectant serious jane ambersom was waiting in the anteroom to smiths suite with an equally gravefaced john passmore when the directorgeneral flurried in from the foreign office gesturing them to follow him you could call it a solomon resolution i suppose announced aubrey smith elana and andrei withdrew their kidnap claims and the french are releasing elana into the custody of our paris embassy along with all our people andreis refused to go with them he was released into russian protection monsfords hailing it as a victory monsford cant have heard yet said jane heard what smith frowned why i havent been able to reach straughan said the woman security didnt immediately react when he didnt arrive at vauxhall cross this morning he was sometimes delayed because of his mother her caregiver found them but straughans protective cover legend caused a delay in vauxhall being told the mother could have been dead since last night overdosed straughans death is apparently more recent delayed probably because of what he did after killing her i dont know precisely what was found we probably never will there were some letters i believe ive no idea what else could they have been killed if monsford wanted them to be judged passmore the mothers dementia left her catatonic she would have swallowed whatever she was given without knowing who gave it to her mi will have taken over everything by now there wont be a public inquest or any pathology details released james straughan and his sad mother will simply have ceased ever to have existed how did we find out asked smith straughan had listed my private number to be contacted in an emergency it was the police who called me when the caregiver gave it to them hell have made some arrangement for you to get whatever he had we can only hope said jane i was just leaving for berkhamsted when rebecca called saying thered been a mistake that she was taking over damn exclaimed smith maybe itll protect charlie suggested passmore maybe said the other man whats come from moscow nothing yet from wilkinson but we know from the others charlie was using the moscow metro said passmore somehow he found out preston and warren were support for wilkinson he made cellphone contact warning that denning and beckindale were following warren thinks they decoyed them off but hes not sure if charlie used our phone the tracker would have been activated it was confirmed passmore both here and in moscow mi would have got his location and we havent heard from wilkinson repeated passmore when the hell am i going to get ahead of this start calling the shots instead of trailing behind in somebody elses dirt demanded smith unusually venting his anger charlie muffin was thinking something similar as he replaced the kiosk telephone after being told by natalia that it was impossible to meet that night his call before that to david halliday hadnt been answered either and thered been more luck than tradecraft expertise in his evading stephan briddle one of possibly three men hed been warned were trying to kill him theyd kissed but perfunctorily acquaintances rather than husband and wife and afterward remained standing although not together radtsic staying close to where hed greeted elana just inside the door elana still wearing the vivid red dress wandering aimlessly around the conservatory like a disappointed prospective buyer this isnt how it was supposed to be said radtsic breaking the awkwardness it was my duty to come but i didnt want to said the woman she stopped close to a corner of the windowed room frowning up at a roof joint theyll be listening to everything i suppose and filming confirmed radtsic whats happened to andrei there were always three russians in the room after andreis outburst they asked him to go with them so they could protect him they asked me too i refused the french officials there asked andrei if he wanted to go with them he said yes at once and left with them they would have been your people wouldnt they fsb yes radtsic confirmed again what did andrei say to you before he went just repeated that he never wanted to see or hear from us again that we were dead to him both of us hes my son supposed to respect me and do what i tell him it was a plea not an angry demand hes a man a young one but still a man corrected elana finally slumping into a overpadded solitary positioned easy chair making it impossible for radtsic to sit close to her he doesnt respect you anymore maxim mikhailovich he hates and despises you and now me for coming here to you do you hate and despise me im not sure not yet admitted elana with brutal honesty i do know i dont want to be part of any of this but i know even more than ive ever known anything in my life that i never wanted to lose my son which is what youve made happen you dont understand what dont you dare tell me that i dont understand stopped elana giving way to shouted anger i understand every fucking thing youve made me do and with which i went along because i am your wife and while i dont know yet if i despise and hate you i do know that i despise and hate myself for doing it for allowing it to happen radtsic began to move toward her but elana started up moving away from him i dont want you near me what will happen to andrei i dont know dont lie to me she erupted into almost screaming frustration hell be punished for what weve done wont he become a nonperson at the age of nineteen how do you feel about that maxim mikhailovich you proud about destroying your only son stop it elana demanded radtsic matching her anger you know why i had to do this how everything would have worked if andrei had done what he was told instead of babbling about kidnap giving the french the legal excuse to hold you he didnt say wed been kidnapped halted elana you questioned radtsic uncertainty lessening his anger but you knew i didnt say it either neither of us said wed been kidnapped stop wandering about ordered radtsic loudly i need to know what happened how it happened if theres a way of getting him back elana hesitated seemingly unsure but went back to the overstuffed armchair i cant answer your question dont have any answers tell me from the beginning from the time you arrived in paris elana frowned in recollection i did everything you told me i went to andreis apartment direct from the airport yvette wasnt there andrei and i ate dinner at a cafe quite close everyone knew him i was very proud at how popular he was i didnt meet yvette until the second night i like her that first night he kept asking why id come so unexpectedly almost without warning i decided against telling him outright i wasnt sure how hed react i told him my coming was part of a surprise that together we were going london to meet you and that you had something very important to tell him you didnt say anything hint even at a defection ive just told you i didnt said elana irritably he seemed so happy so confident even a hint would have been a mistake i wanted to get andrei here first she smiled wanly i was the one guilty of kidnap i expected him to be more excited at my arriving and of our coming on here i thought it might have been to do with yvette not wanting to leave her i mean but he agreed to come said radtsic elana nodded but without much enthusiasm how did you explain being escorted by english people he only ever met two english people jonathan miller and his partner whom i only ever knew as albert remember andrei never knew precisely what you did the position you held just that it was something important and very high in the government i told him you were in london with a russian delegation for an internal conference and that youd arranged for us to get to london on a plane taking some people from the british embassy i told miller and his partner so they wouldnt make any mistakes on our way to the airport andrei didnt like either of them he was rude when he met them you think he suspected who they were elana shook her head although he didnt know exactly what you did he did know how powerful you are she hesitated how powerful you were and he was used to your going away without any explanation he didnt questioning it after the awkward restaurant meeting with the british he said he couldnt understand why we couldnt travel on a normal flight what did you say that it was how you wanted it he never challenges you does he not until now corrected radtsic elana looked up to the conservatory corner shed examined earlier i dont like being listened to im going to have to cooperate to get andrei back i dont understand how you came to be intercepted or howor whythe kidnap claim came to be made elana stared at her husband for several minutes at last she said maxim mikhailovich youre not making sense you were always going to have to cooperate tell them everything for us to be accepted protected as well have to be protected for the rest of our lives and we can never get andrei back hes gone weve lost him forever i wont lose him ill do a deal what deal with whom you ran away from russia because you were going to be purged what do you imagine would happen to you if you changed your mind now and we went back youve got nothing with which to negotiate with the british to keep us safe youve got to tell them everything andrei wont come stop fantasizing accept reality and that reality is that youve made a terrible mistake and wrecked the family what if andrei accepts reality and recognizes hes made a terrible mistake changes his mind what do you imagine the reaction would be to his going up to the commandant of whatever siberian gulag hell be sent to and saying he doesnt like it there and wants to come to england after all derided elana he wont be sent to a siberian gulag things arent like they were in the old days theres law and andrei hasnt broken any law there was another long silence before elana said if theres law thats got to be followed how could you have been purged you didnt break any law what ive done all my life isnt governed by any law said radtsic in subdued reflection there has been a terrible mistake but i didnt make it wouldnt have made it because i knew everything devised it all and could still have prevented it being turned into the disaster it became if id been brought in when i should have been but i wasnt others with ambition intervened but theres no proof no paper trail of their intervention that was the first internal purge i didnt suspect which left me the architect who didnt react quickly enough i should have left the service honorably an internally recognized and acknowledged legend instead i leave it not just as a failure and a traitor but as a failure and a traitor to you and to andrei radtsic stopped brought out of his reverie by the awareness of elana silently weeping hands cupped to her face to hold back any sound ill make it better try to stop you hating and despising me elana stayed with her hands covering her face still weeping my deputy director is handling the situation declared monsford ive no specific details other than the indications that straughan killed his mother before killing himself nothing will ever become public a complete blackout has been imposed what security implications are there demanded sir archibald bland monsfords eyes flickered toward aubrey smith absolutely none what about letters an explanation intruded smith savoring the other directors discomfort i havent had the chance to talk to my deputy said monsford his voice uneven ill provide all the details as soon as i have them myself which brings us back to the original point of this gathering said aubrey smith turning away from the nowdead screen on which theyd watched the encounter between radtsic and his wife what happened after she recovered they walked outside in the grounds said gerald monsford inwardly squirming at being questioned by the other director neither wanted to eat when they got back to the house elana insisted upon sleeping in a separate room what did they talk about walking in the grounds smith continued to press surely you dont imagine started geoffrey palmer nothing that added to what theyd talked about inside hurried in monsford eager to save palmers embarrassment they hardly spoke as far as we could detect so they were heads down persisted smith could someone help us here demanded palmer irritably they were filmed throughout their walk explained the mi director the cameras have special enhancing lenses enabling whats said out of microphone range to be recorded and then lipread lipreading that can be defeated by a person walking with their head lowered avoiding the camera added smith directly addressing his counterpart smith said you didnt answer my question yes confirmed monsford tightly so we dont have recordings of everything they said to each other no monsford was forced to admit whats your point protested sir archibald bland whats your assessment of the confrontation inside the house where we did hear every word demanded smith answering a question with a question bland hesitated unaccustomed to the reversal very emotional which was understandable considering every circumstance radtsic defecting after being at the top of his profession for so long being reunited with his wife after what shes been through neither knowing if they would ever be together again all of it topped by their being reviled by a son whos abandoned them and im intrigued by whatever it is radtsic was talking about at the very end added palmer all of which you were supposed to be warned smith what the hell are you suggesting demanded monsford again smith confronted question with question do you normally allow encounters like that to be completely unsupervised i dont have a precedent monsford quickly came back neither my service nor yours has had someone from such an echelon of russian intelligence cross over to us nor after managing such a defection succeeding in getting released from at least nominal russian detention a wife with whom to be reunited indeed neither of us has agreed smith smiling in return youve very definitely established the precedent but how did that unsupervised reunion come about did you offer it or did radtsic insist upon meeting his wife alone monsford hesitated he didnt insist he asked and it was hardly an unsupervised encounter weve just watched and listened to everything that took place with no debriefing intermediary to direct or guide it smith pointed out in the intrusive absence of whom caught up in their emotion weve already got a lead to something radtsic expected to be the culmination of a thirtyyear intelligence career but instead because of an internal power struggle monsford stopped his mouth physically distorting to avoid the intended singular boast weve got the coup lets not keep credit from where credit is due enthused smith layering the condescension the coup is yours and yours alone which was how it was initiated and carried out without the participation of anyone else just you alone were becoming increasingly irritated at this perpetual antipathy declared bland as well as becoming increasingly concerned that its endangering the matter at hand true weve got our coup but externally its greatly mitigated by a number of unresolved issues we wantas others more important wantthis constant bickering to stop for the concentration to instead be upon tidying up those issues i reiterate that to resolve those issues i am offering every assistance asked of me and my service to help the directorgeneral whose officer created them said monsford that offer would best be achieved by the immediate withdrawing from moscow the three mi officers seconded to the original extraction for which i am responsible but for whom there is no further need responded aubrey smith at once mi has succeeded with their extraction and achieved its coup but upon which there would appear to be a need for much more work the only sound in the room for several minutes was that of differing seat and chair shifting prompted by differing reasons the firsttospeak concentration settled upon bland the nominal chairman who avoided the conflict with a matadors deftness by inviting monsfords contribution unfortunate and public embarrassments aside i am not aware of any changes in circumstancein which of course i do not include the reemergence of charlie muffinjustifying the directorgenerals astonishing demand are there any changes of circumstances palmer asked aubrey smith i believe there are considerable changes none of which i intend discussing here said the mi directorgeneral i shall of course discuss them in full and complete detail when the extraction of natalia fedova becomes a wholly independent mi matter not only is it outrageous to impugn my service as i believe the directorgeneral is doing it is arrogant for him to imagine that the separation of our two services is for him to decide said monsford it is for the director to make whatever interpretation he chooses dismissed smith in making your decision which i was in no way taking from you its important i make totally clear that i am not prepared to continue the extraction of natalia fedova in partnership with mi and i must make it equally clear as i have already done that i am prepared completely to take over the extraction as an mi operation declared monsford you took it over the edge accused jane ambersom objectively you didnt have a fallback if the ruling had gone against you id have done what i know monsfords going to do ignore it said aubrey smith unoffended at her directness the whole intention was to get monsford and mi officially out of our operation which is what im determined to do get monsford out not just from this extraction but out of vauxhall cross hes the paranoid megalomaniac to mi that j edgar hoover was to the fbi monsfords dangerous out of control after today hell be even more determined to destroy you cautioned the woman and now hes excluded weve no way of secondguessing what hell do we know what monsfords going to do or try to do repeated the mi director what weve got to do is wrap up moscow get everyone safely back here he turned to passmore so whens that going to be as of fifteen minutes ago charlie hadnt contacted wilkinson said the operations director ive authorized the money charlie wants as well as the russian passports for natalia and the child as soon as weve finished ill add the decision officially to cut mi adrift and tell wilkinson to make that clear to monsfords people do that broke in smith once wilkinsons completed the handover he and the other two are out too their only function from now on is to take monsfords people all over moscow on wild goose chases wilkinson is to tell charlie were sending in independent backup wholl head the new group ian flood responded passmore without hesitation hes one of four on standby all with valid visas charlie likes the savoy near red square remembered smith thats where he lived during the lvov investigation floods to book in there and charlies to be told thats where his contact is but dont tell wilkinson the hotel name i dont want any more mistakes charlie will identify it by being told its his favorite smith looked between the other two what else do we need to do once charlies got his travel money and the passports theres no reason why he cant move at once picked up passmore i can get our second team in today with flood going in first all wed need from charlie is routes and arrival day i wasnt exaggerating monsfords paranoia said smith i also believe hes capable of paranoid orders dressed up with whatever justification tell floods team upon my authority to confront like with like if necessary youre surely not imagining a gunfight at the ok corral asked passmore those are the orders in my name said smith ive got an idea announced jane first i need to know if anything was said this morning about straughan smith shook his head it was mentioned monsford denied knowing any details apart from it not being a security problem and that rebecca was handling it ducking and weaving again jane recognized howd it be if there was an alert that mi has been penetrated particularly after the suicide of its operations director a security purge might even find rebecca streets copy of what straughan made i think it might cause monsford a very big problem smith smiled not if the internal search is controlled by monsford passmore pointed out it cant be insisted jane the regulations are that it would have to be independent of currently serving officers gerald monsfords purplefaced fury accompanied by seemingly uncontrollable facial twitching was greater than rebecca had witnessed before although the irrational pacing was familiar for a long time after his stormed entry it was impossible for the man to speak comprehensibly even attempted words burst out incomplete or slurred bastards fucking bastards imagine then came what appeared another indecipherable splutter sided with him with smith against me me gave them their fucking coup all smiths fault all the mistakes incredible unbelievable rebecca remained silent letting the diatribe burn itself out beginning to interpret and still listening but giving over most of her concentration to review all that shed personally done or put into practice since james straughans suicide shed left nothing undone or unchecked nothing that monsford could pick up and challenge she was sure she hadnt apart of course from the involvement of jane ambersom which was causing the unease to churn through her she was convinced straughan had kept his own copy of the incriminating material there was still a chance a lot of chances of its being uncovered and it was to her that each and every discovery had to be handed unopened unheard or unread but shed wanted to recover it by now needed to know she had the protection of the only one in existence rebeccas concentration refocused at monsfords sighed collapse behind the expansive desk ignoring the folder in readiness before him risking a renewed eruption she said we need to redefine a few things are you going to handle moscow or shall i do what needs to be done there leave it snapped monsford im handling moscow personally what the fucks happened with straughan how did smith know she had to get it out of the way rebecca knew jane ambersoms name and number was on a callinemergency list at straughans house this time monsford was rendered completely speechless and there was a change when he did recover quietvoiced fear instead of irrational fury they were friends sometimes ate together in the canteen whats he left with her told her nothing insisted rebecca hoping her precautions proved her right we were also on the list obviously according to the police i was contacted within fifteen minutes of ambersom i called her told her it was an overhang from her time here and that i was taking over which i did its all contained under our control i dont like it didnt like him trust me its all contained tell me how demanded monsford his voice still hushed there was no other family apart from him and his mother set out rebecca the home office has confirmed to the local chief constable my instructions for no public inquest i personally supervised the total clearance of the berkhamsted house everything movable has already been brought here to be reexamined theres a second deepsearch team taking the house apart after theyve done that theyll excavate the garden were separately going through all the local banks to locate what deposits he had she gestured toward the studiously ignored folder that contains whats immediately relevant his suicide note all the medication he used to kill his mother and himselfsamples have been taken of all of them to confirm our autopsy thats being conducted now that what killed him came from those sources and every piece of documentation of his and his mothers existence whats the suicide note say monsford interrupted its there for you to read yourself persisted the woman nothing thats a problem he considers his work has been undermined by the strain of constantly caring for his mother hes made mistakes none of which he lists the bastard wanted to bring me down insisted monsford so do i thought rebecca it usually came at the liveordie part of an assignment without warning and irrespective of place or time charlie muffin didnt think of it as fear although thats what it was instead as he always did he considered it the essential sensessharpening adrenaline boost to react faster and think quicker and win but this time the fear was different more hairtriggered the keepahead intensity stronger charlie knew why winning emerging the victor had never been enough by itself to win totally meant surviving which hed always done disregarding the cost to friend or foe alike but not this time this time he had far moreeverythingto win by getting natalia and sasha safely out of russia but far more stilleverythingto lose if he failed which made the predictable adrenalinespurred fear the wrong sort the dangerously overcompensating overreactive sort of fear that risked skewing his subjectivity to cause the forbidden inconceivable failure the possibility of which from the moment of his amsterdam sidestep had been compounded almost daily by inconsistencies and uncertainties which subjectively again was par for the course of professional espionage but from which hed hoped to be spared in this particular instance it was twelve ten later than hed intended when charlie literally pushed his way into the touristpacked arbat sure he was alone but after the metro debacle of the day before with no confidence in patrick wilkinsons ability to detect surveillance charlie let himself be carried unresisting along the stallcluttered thoroughfare seeking the remembered centrally placed brickbuilt emporium disappointed from the outside at the limited escape options if wilkinson once more guided mi pursuit to him after two further toptobottom street reconnoiters charlie failed to locate a better alternative charlie correctly guessed wilkinson would arrive at the arbat metro despite the mans vow never again to use the underground system wilkinson emerged manila package tightly clutched beneath his right arm precisely ten minutes ahead of their appointed time charlie remained in the stationbordering cafe his pravda spread before him but concentrating upon recognizable faces needing a second vodka to justify his staying where he was during the fortyfive minutes it took wilkinson to get through the tourist crush in both directions he let wilkinson get twenty meters ahead on the mans third promenade before following he caught up at the emporium and said to your left with the greenpainted shutters sure the man would visibly jump which he did wilkinson moved without turning charlie went with him but didnt enter lingering at the outside displays to satisfy himself the man was alone wilkinson was in the back of the incenseperfumed arcade examining icon reproductions when charlie finally entered it took a full meandering five minutes for charlie to reach him charlie reached out for wilkinsons package slipping it between the pages of his newspaper before turning to keep the main door in view what did london say youve got new backup announced wilkinson copying charlies icon interest no connection to the embassy no connection with us your contact is an ian flood hes at your favorite hotel youre supposed to understand that were to decoy the others try to get it right this time said charlie unforgiving im glad to be out of it blurted wilkinson all three of us are so am i said charlie did you also tell london mi did more than just try to get to me that briddle was with you and through you was with me right up to dmitrouskaya from where he obviously watched us in the park and afterwards rode the train with you the train upon which he imagined id be a sitting target how do you know that said wilkinson disbelievingly because watching you leave i saw him in the carriage behind you i i mean i should stumbled the man dont bother stopped charlie is there anything more to tell me mi have been officially taken off their guys withdrawn have they gone we only got the cable this morning just before all three of us left the embassy to give usmetime to lose surveillance but i told him last night i knew about londons order that they were out of it what did he say to go fuck myself that he took his orders from london thats why the three of us are staying as decoys another uncertainty in the lucky dip tub thought charlie in an afterthought gerald monsford stopped to buy roses for elana the fumblefingered florist took almost half an hour to gift wrap them complete with red ribbon to match the flowers and he was practically an hour late getting to the hertfordshire safe house radtsic was alone in the conservatory im late because i stopped to get these for elana said monsford offering the bouquet as if for approval where is she he already knew from his arrival meeting with harry jacobson resting said the russian ignoring the flowers he was in the chair elana had chosen the day before preventing monsfords sitting close to him perhaps shell join us later for me to give them to her she doesnt want to see you be part of anything im sorry about that said monsford putting the flowers on a side table you already knew accused radtsic looking up to the ceiling joist elana had identified monsford instinctively followed the look and wished he hadnt uncomfortable that it would have been filmed itll get better not without andrei refused the man youve got to be realistic maxim mikhailovitch cautioned monsford were trying you know were trying but its going to take a lot of time then itll have to take a lot of time said radtsic flatly our deal was that wed all be together a complete family theres no deal if were not a complete family not anticipating its weight monsford had to struggle to get another chair opposite the russian and knew the film would show his overweight awkwardness what happened in france wasnt our fault we dont yet know how or why it happened well find a way to get andrei back but our deal cant be put on hold indefinitely i cant accept anything without andrei being here neither can elana andrei will be here but during the time itll take weve got to start work there are people youre going to meet people youll regard as friends as you work together i know what debriefing is snapped radtsic in a small spark of his old arrogance just as i know what you want and which youll get but thats got to be met with what i want and thats not empty words and talk of indeterminate time its got to be a balanced exchange what i have to tell you equated against getting andrei back thats not a balanced exchange protested monsford tensed against his anger at the other mans belief that he had a bargaining position its tilted entirely in your favor which creates the incentive to get andrei here the bastard was playing with him cat to mouse realized monsford hating his own analogy and hating even more that others would witness radtsics derision i wont be coming down every day tomorrow ill introduce you to the people youll be dealing with all the time and to a liaison officer a woman to ensure elanas got all she wants the only thing elana wants is andrei like me repeated radtsic i hope that tomorrow youll have something to tell us about that the confounded mans refusing to cooperate complained bland its early days as monsford said reminded palmer itll settle down when radtsic realizes he hasnt any real option why did monsford tell him we can get the boy back bland demanded we dont stand a chance of doing that it would have made radtsic even more difficult if he hadnt said palmer every day i tell myself it cant get any worse and every day it does get worse bemoaned the other man im fearing the time when were no longer able to shift all the responsibility on these two bloody directors and start getting it apportioned onto us i dont want that to happen said palmer unsettled im not going to allow it to happen determined the cabinet secretary mine isnt going to be the head that rolls nor mine said palmer even more determinedly it took charlie a long time to move between individual booking outlets to make one from each paid and confirmed reservations on separately available flights on his intended hedgehopping escape route the following day and then to duplicate the entire process from different booking facilities to ensure there were two situationdictated alternatives for himself natalia and sasha in addition improvising upon their changed roles as decoys against both his m pursuers and the fsb who by now would have identified their presence from embassy surveillance charlie confirmed booking on lot polish airlines to warsaw with a direct transfer connection to london from moscows domodedovo airportfrom which none of his other escape flights was departingfor patrick wilkinson neil preston and peter warren throughout the second ticket buying charlie also booked tickets for his new protection squad for only one of whom he had a name at the end he had only three thousand pounds left from the twentyfive thousand earlier provided by wilkinson in the arbat the delay made charlie much later getting to moscows permanent state circus for his premeeting security check restricted anyway by the saturdayafternoon throng of arriving and departing audiences natalia responded at once to his precisely timed call as she had to be told their rendezvous and said she was twenty minutes away charlie bought admission tickets before becoming a crowd person among the outside refreshment and souvenir kiosks the area was slightly higher than the main approach and from its elevation charlie picked out natalia when she was still some way away she showed no recognition at seeing him halting at a souvenir seller five booths away as he reached her she said its definitely tomorrow we need to go through it confirmed charlie disappointed at her nervousness ive got tickets for the circus well be less obvious inside no she refused lets walk maybe find somewhere to sit charlie took her firmly by the arm leading her back against the incoming crowd you have to get what im going to tell you totally clear in your mind your actual extraction depends on your getting this right im frightened ill make a silly mistake and you wont make stupid mistakes stopped charlie as they reached the main road if you do what i tell you you cant make a mistake all youve got to do is take sasha to the airport go through the normal formalities make one change en route and youll be safely in england by this time tomorrow youre saying me me and sasha where are you going to be with you all the way with others to protect you both theres a bench she pointed i want to sit to concentrate charlie was concerned at the indecision hed never seen in natalia when theyd lived together at greater risk of discovery these are new russian passports theyve got all the necessary exit and entry visas and documentation everything is valid you and sasha are booked on finnair flight leaving at noon from vnukovo airport to helsinki theres a transfer connection within two hours on finnair flight to london i wont acknowledge you keep as far away as possible sasha wont remember me therell be three other people on the plane you wont know ill only know one well be taken off before other passengers at heathrow stop demanded natalia urgently youll definitely be on the same plane i want you to be with us i dont want to be alone not knowing what to do this was far more difficult than hed anticipated as close as he was to her he could feel her nervousness vibrating along the bench i will always be with you but as far back as i can be the last probably to board the plane the others you dont know will be onboard too i have to tell london were on our way the moment you enter the embarkation lounge ill trigger that alert he had to stop her physical shaking charlie decided whats the first principle of entering an operational situation natalia frowned sideways dont play tradecraft games charlie im not playing a tradecraft game he insisted answer the question the twitching spread to natalias face at charlies tone guarantee an exit why do you want me to acknowledge that theres a second complete set of tickets doubly to guarantee our exit said charlie tapping the bulky manila folder on his lap ive booked the three of us as well as our escorts on a direct mea flight to nicosia also from vnukovo ill only have minutes from my london call to catch the helsinki flight if i miss it youll still have three other escorts and an assured protected arrival in london ill simply call london again tell them whats happened but that youre still on the finnair flight if when were all at vnukovo theres something i dont like all of us will abandon the finnair route although staying booked on it and switch to cyprus but cyprus is only an exit insurance but remember once youve started to board dont turn back thats the unbreakable rule dont turn back keep going why cant one of the escorts alert london use the cyprus plane if its necessary asked natalia her shaking had subsided and charlie was reassured by the professional question i personally want to guarantee youre onboard safe i feel confident every moment im with you but so frightened so incapable the minute im not natalia said feeling out for his hand twentyfour hours from now well be exaggerating our stories about it all laughing i dont think i will be but youre going to go through with it encouraged charlie not let sasha down i wont let you or sasha down you know that finally handing her the package charlie said everything you want is there well talk a lot on the throwaway phone on your way to vnukovo airport yes she said looking down at the package before closing her handbag what have you told sasha nothing i didnt want her talking at school ill tell her tonight shell be excited are you i will be this time tomorrow excited and happy for the rest of my life you cant be serious i couldnt be more serious said jane ambersom she was glad shed waited until after their lovemaking anticipating his reaction to the story prepared between her and aubrey smith barry elliott had pulled away and was now sitting directly opposite on their crumpled sheets naked but with all intimacy gone why the hell havent you told them you cant begin to understand monsfords outright animosity but theyve got to be warned its its what you said absurd absurd not to im telling you theyd dismiss it as disinformation if it came from us you think its this guy straughan that its why he killed himself he must have known something suspected something theres got to be a damn good reason for the operations director of m to kill his own mother and then himself this new demanded elliott head suspiciously to one side or is this something that irena novikov told charlie about the lvov penetration they hadnt anticipated the question improvising jane said there could be indications you going to give them to me an actual printout of the debriefing shit thought jane there isnt a debriefing paper it was conversation between them when they were still in moscow before charlie had any reason to suspect her he didnt file a proper official report pressed elliott head still to one side i wasnt at m during the lvov affair escaped jane im picking up secondhand telling you what ive been told certainly theres nothing officially logged but you know both camps whats the problem between you monsford said jane shortly the bastard who framed me for his mistakes youre surely not suggesting stumbled elliott incredulous im telling you what we suspect from what im told of the lvov investigation i cant tell you anything more elliott looked down appearing surprised at his nakedness im cold and think i should get back under the covers i think so too invited jane within fifteen minutes of their being together charlie was reassured a feeling hed rarely experienced since the very beginning of the attempt to get natalia and sasha out of moscow ian flood appeared a totally controlled selfconfident man who allowed himself to think before speaking which wasnt slowness but sensible consideration not interrupting as charlie outlined in detail the following days extraction charlie was enjoying too being back in his familiar corner stool at the savoy bar brief though the visit had to be the fsb had discovered his preference for the hotel during the lvov investigation mikhail guzov the involved fsb colonel had personally confronted him as hed sat on the same stool at this time of the evening the bar was filling with the professional girls two of whom charlie recognized from before but the bartender had changed there are photographs of natalia and sasha with the tickets youll have to add the names i dont know to the two left open concluded charlie he hadnt demanded the other names and flood hadnt offered them arent you following in tandem from pecatnikov to ensure they get to the airport questioned flood polishing his spectacles for the second time since theyd made contact it wasnt a mannerism charlie knew but an added headlowered precaution against their conversation being overhead despite their carefully established separation from anyone close charlie shook his head natalia doesnt think shes under observation but i dont want to take the risk the fsb know what i look like ill keep beyond airport cctv until you enter and for natalia to see me ill have one of the others in a separate car from pecatnikov decided flood ill put the other one inside the terminal is that how you want it charlie nodded make sure everyone understands theres to be no interference if im challenged the only essential is to get natalia and sasha out what have you told natalia about that nothing ive said i might miss the flight alerting london you think there could be cctv recognition its no secret that im here said charlie ive got to ensure against the possibility thats why i want you to keep me permanently in view inside the terminal until the last minute if im not satisfied im clear after checking in for helsinki ill switch to the cyprus flight why bother questioned flood youre the weak link the essential is getting natalia and the child out why cant i and my team extract them leaving you to make your escape later shes as tight as a spring about to snap judged charlie if she doesnt physically see me shell abandon the major fsb and cctv concentration will be at sheremetyevo not vnukovo and ive laid a false trail to warsaw from another airport im making myself visible to natalia and you no one else its your call acknowledged flood doubtfully okay we dont intervene if youre challenged what if she sees it do we try to make her get on the plane if you can without turning it into a second incident said charlie if i am intercepted ill try to concentrate the attention as a distraction for you you must consider this a hell of an important extraction said flood head bent for the third time covering the preceding two by holding his spectacles up to the light as if there were a blemish he couldnt clean off the man wouldnt have been told of the personal relationship charlie realized if it werent important it wouldnt have been initiated you come with any guidance from the directorgeneral theres an internal war between us and mi said flood he knows we were used as dummies to get radtsic out but smiths convinced without knowing why that theres also an order out for you to be eliminated ive already been warned smith wants you warned again wants you to believe it said flood and why i was also told getting you out was as essential as extracting natalia and the girl my orders are to follow your instructions without question but whatever those instructions are that youve got to be brought out too which gives you a problem said charlie which gives us both a problem agreed flood you got a god you can trust that itll all go to plan no said charlie thats another problem said flood neither have i it was inevitable that he should think about charlie muffin as he approached the savoy hotel supposed david halliday it was where he and charlie had spent a lot of time during charlies previous assignment and because of which it had become a favorite watering hole of his it was reflected halliday about the only benefit hed gained from his association with the man it had been a mistake not to have held back the day the fsb picked up the rossiya tourist party and made an even bigger mistake imagining an advantage in cooperating with charlie instead of maintaining the monitor that others in the mi rezidentura had been ordered to keep to locate the man but hed got away with it halliday reassured himself broken the contact until finally charlie had stopped trying to reach him he wasnt being ostracized as much after his inclusion in the last stage of the radtsic extraction and wasnt being blamed for the french fiasco now he reverted to the trusted practice of avoiding each and every difficulty it was initially only a fleeting image as halliday pushed through the hotel entrance looking instinctively to his left into the bar but he was sure it was charlie getting off his accustomed bar stool another man beside him the door leading from the lobby to the baroque dining room was heavily engraved but there were sufficient gaps in the etching for halliday hurriedly concealed on its far side to confirm the sighting and to see charlie pass something to the other man before turning to leave halliday left too after five minutes crossing the square to the metropole relieved the shaking had gone when he lifted the brandy snifter for the first recovering sip it was he decided his chance to be completely rehabilitated of not being kept out any longer hed got everything wrong acknowledged david halliday done it all by the book except perhaps insisting he speak personally to the director but instead of getting the congratulations and gratitude he deserved for finding charlie muffin hed been berated by gerald monsford for not following the man and relegated to being duty driver for stephan briddle and robert denning outside the savoy hotel at three oclock in the fucking morning briddle was openly mocking him and denning was an unapologetic farter whod already stunk the car up you know what they say about life reminded briddle to whom halliday had complained of the directors tirade it isnt ever fair you come across flood before asked denning from the rear gas chamber no said halliday whod gone with briddle into the hotel because his russian was better with a fiftydollar bribe to the night porter to identity the replacement mi officer you absolutely sure floods still in his room didnt leave separately after charlie pressed denning i already told you he ate dinner in the restaurant has a wakeup call booked for five thirty and a hertz cars being delivered at seven said halliday irritably i really would like to know whats in that package you saw charlie pass over came in briddle its passportandticket size snapped halliday theyre moving and its happening early said briddle reflectively theres two direct london flights from sheremetyetevo before eleven and three transfer connections by one pm itll be direct predicted denning transfers risk interception wherever they stop if its sheremetyetevo cautioned briddle charlie muffins a sneaky fucker would it have been better if hed stayed with charlie wondered halliday hardly except for being spared monsfords wrath and this ignominy certainly not professionally was there any point in staying in the service apart from the final pension entitlement he didnt stand a chance of promotion even if monsford was replaced he was the sort of vindictive bastard whod poison all the personnel files and why should he be replaced after the radtsic coup the mans directorship was set in stone heres beckindale with breakfast announced denning as the second anonymous rental car came down the street he farted as he spoke and halliday knew he wouldnt be able to eat anything beckindale had bought charlie finally abandoned the idea of sleep at five and was showered and dressed by five thirty charlie wished he could have started out with natalia be with them all the way from pecatnikov as unrealistic and unprofessional as that would have been he was confident of flood didnt doubt the mans professionalism natalia had recognized the risk of sashas doing or saying something unexpected and would guard against it six fifteen charlie saw checking his watch too early to call even though shed already be awake probably hadnt slept at all as he hadnt hed give her a little longer peter warren was the last decoy to arrive in the embassy cafeteria at six thirty as he joined the other two coffee spilling as he maneuvered his selfservice tray onto the cluttered table you sure its necessary for us to be up this early i wouldnt have set the time if i hadnt been sure said patrick wilkinson tetchily or booked the six oclock wakeup call for them to find on the internal personnel computer which i discovered they were monitoring you hear any movement neil preston asked warren whose compound apartment was on the same floor as briddles and dennings warren shook his head heaping scrambled eggs and sausage onto his fork quiet as a grave when i passed both doors i stopped to listen outside both lets decide whos going to go where demanded wilkinson ill ride the metro call charlies phone for the tracker to be picked up theyll think that significant after the last time what about my doing a river cruise suggested warren if i get one to follow me on a steamer hell be out of action for two or three hours ill go to the metropole and con my way onto a tourist coach theres always spare seats and guides with their hands out for beer money ill pick out the following car after a few blocks well all keep in touch on cell phones to add to the tracker confusion declared wilkinson itll convince them somethings happening but where the fuck are they demanded warren looking toward the entrance youve spilled egg down your tie said preston heres the rental car identified halliday the coffee had been disgusting and he hadnt bothered to drink it he felt physically sick i guess the hertz sticker gave you the clue briddle continued to mock you think jeremy will have realized it questioned denning jerking his head toward the side street in which beckindale was parked stay where you are ordered briddle hurriedly flood and the other mi replacements will have photographs of us all i was going to phone denning sighed let me see the photographs of natalia and the kid again said halliday and wished he hadnt when it was the odorous denning who offered them hello exclaimed briddle bringing hallidays concentration up from the prints at the arrival of another hertz car and thats flood identified halliday as the man emerged from the hotel with the delivery driver of the first vehicle and continued on toward the second car together the two mi men went back into the savoy jeremy says hes already clocked both of them reported denning the cell phone to his ear any change from simply following them hes to stick to the second car leaving flood to us ordered briddle and to make sure hes not seen to be following jeremy says thanks for the lesson and to go fuck yourself relayed denning gerald monsford had slept overnight and alone in the studioapartment extension to his office suite and in which hed established rebecca street as his gratefully rewarding mistress a month after securing her as his deputy he wished now that she had stayed that night even though he didnt completely trust her any longer right not to have trusted straughan either dangerous deceptive motherfucker wished he didnt have to rely on rebecca for the straughan business didnt have to monsford decided as soon as he sorted radtsic out hed take straughan off her hands important he personally ensured straughan hadnt left anything dangerous behind he had to concentrate on moscow for the moment not that there was anything to do at this predawn moment except wait his insistence upon total onetoone control with briddle to guard against a later evidenceproviding intermediary meant he couldnt risk russian scanner interception of cellphone communication with the man now outside the hotel at which new mi support had been discovered hallidays name threatened an outburst of pointless anger why the fuck hadnt the man followed charlie muffin to wherever hed been hiding right now briddle could have been there carrying out the disposal that so easily could have been accepted as an fsb assassination the fallout from which compounded by all the preceding publicity would have brought about aubrey smiths dismissal not just as mi directorgeneral but as a threatening professional adversary now there was too much uncertainty particularly involving the plausible denial of any personal involvement what shakespeare had so rightly described as right perfection wrongfully disgraced the summons on his personal line broke into monsfords reflection making him physically jump despite his expectation of briddles call director monsford it wasnt briddles voice one he didnt recognize who is this matthew timpson who matthew timpson head of internal security when i didnt find you at home i checked inhouse registration and discovered you were already here which is fortunate im already in the building i need to see you immediately of course its a matter of urgency whats a matter of urgency the reason i need to see you immediately its not convenient refused monsford arrange a meeting through my appointments secretary in two or three days i insist its now sir immediately as ive said you must insist im the director which is why it must be now i shall be with you in five minutes with my support staff you will began monsford outraged but the line was already dead it was in fact three minutes with timpson were a woman and two men timpson was a roundfaced rotund balding man in a bank manager black threepiece suit complete with chainlinked fob watch in the waistcoat pocket the other two men were dressed identically except for the pocket watch the woman was in black too what the hell is this demanded monsford im confident of your complete cooperation timpson smiled we have information the reliability and source of which is unquestionable that theres been a hostile penetration the man indicated those behind him this is my advanced group team leaders my full investigatory staff will be here by midmorning the first essential will be to install independent listening and monitoring facilities upon all incoming and outgoing electronic lines its a comparatively simple procedure i expect that to be largely established by midafternoon we require complete and total access to all files recordingselectronic audio written or printedinitially for the preceding and current year it may of course be necessary to extend that over a longer period our inquiries will inevitably go beyond the building to encompass the homes of officers and employees there was another quick smile including of course your own the security head reached behind for documents held in readiness by the woman heres our necessary documented authority no objected monsford loudly his mind blanked refusing orderly words and all he could again manage was no it was a physical strain to recover to pull himself up to confront them why havent i been told properly informed i mean you are being informed now sir whats the reliable source i cant disclose that at this stage refused timpson our investigation has to be total from the very top to the absolute bottom until proper safeguards are established you cant suspect me insisted monsford new outrage hovering you could be compromised timpson pointed out calmly he indicated those behind him initially until those safeguards are in place youll have one of my senior officers with you at all times as will your deputy and division directors this is absurd ridiculous persisted monsford i cant have wont allow people wandering about the building looking wherever they choose have you forgotten where we are people will not wander unsupervised around the building looking wherever they choose corrected timpson i and those with me have the same level of security clearance as yourself and your deputy its the straughan business started monsford but was stopped by the ringing of his personal phone briddle from moscow he thought at once staring down at the receiver which blinked its red light as well as rang shouldnt you answer that suggested timpson monsford did so tentatively said yes and held the receiver tightly to his ear so that only he could hear glad i caught you before you left said harry jacobson radtsic doesnt want to see you or those you were bringing down until youve got something about andrei here we go announced briddle as flood and the other man emerged from the savoy to halliday he said your job is to make sure he doesnt see us behind him go fuck yourself echoed halliday to denning whod pulled forward to look through the windshield he said get back youre in the way of my rearview mirror halliday waited until the second hertz car turned in line behind flood and allowed two vehicles to intervene before following beckindale came directly behind as flood took a left turn briddle twisted to the rear of their vehicle and said to denning you following the route on the map denning broke wind but didnt reply halliday said east maybe the beltway would be better for sheremetyevo theyve got pickups to make havent they said briddle you all right asked charlie yes said natalia tightly sasha shes excited she was awake early what have you told her that its a surprise holiday you didnt tell her id be with you did you questioned charlie the possibility of sashas recognizing him in his mind of course not where are you i can hear traffic on the street said charlie looking for a taxi there was a grunt ive just flagged one down ill be outside the terminal but not obvious im leaving in fifteen minutes i love you its all going to go as i told you it would ill look for you beckindale overtook the others but pulled directly in front leaving the barrier of the four other vehicles that had built up between them and the mi men from the rear denning said pecatnikov is three streets away theyre picking up natalia and the child decided briddle his voice catching he coughed to clear the nervousness one hand over the other glad there was no tremor the makarov suddenly felt heavy in its holster hard against his ribs charlie could be with them suggested denning call beckindale warn him to be careful ordered briddle charlie wont take the slightest chance would it be possible here outside natalias apartment if charlie tried to resist it would provide the excuse but hed planned to do it close the makarov hidden as much as possible and not with the others as witnesses nor in front of natalia and certainly not sasha thered be panic hysteria the child could get in the way get hurt killed even he didnt want to shoot a child wouldnt shoot a child the log had switched from night to day registration by the time they got to the gate house and there was further delay going back to the security office inside the embassy to retrieve it to discover all three mi officers were recorded leaving the legation at am with the mi resident david halliday all three were in hallidays embassy car none of the names was listed on any of that mornings flights direct or transfer connections from sheremetyevo to london and they wouldnt have needed to leave at two am to catch a plane said warren so where have they gone demanded preston rhetorically i think i should tell london said wilkinson whats there to tell them said warren were in enough shit already according to what youve told us agreed preston you really think its a good idea for london to know weve lost everyone were supposed to be leading all over moscow i think its better than waiting until london hear it some other way said wilkinson we were supposed to mislead them we couldnt physically stop them could we youve got a point conceded preston i think we should tell london capitulated warren its definitely pecatnikov declared halliday its the next turning and floods indicating i agree said denning briddle could feel the tremor now not just in his hand but trembling through his arms and he had to press his left leg hard against the floor to stop it pumping beckindales signaling said halliday unnecessarily stay back ordered briddle lets not screw everything getting too close what are we supposed to do if theyre all together complained halliday leave it all to me said briddle that goes for you too jeremy i make the approach alone you stay back guard against my being intercepted we should have gone through all this earlier said denning ill approach alone insisted briddle but not here even if charlie was with them he couldnt shoot here theyd have to halt way back from natalias apartment to avoid being seen charlie would be warned by their driving up fast beckindale had stopped just after the turn into the road at least one hundred meters from natalias known address stop here ordered briddle waving halliday in about ten meters farther on to denning he said tell jeremy to keep out of the way to leave me alone theres a taxi pulling up outside said halliday straining through binoculars and theres natalia must have been waiting just inside just natalia and the girl no sign of charlie you all right denning asked briddle from behind youre shaking they havent any idea exclaimed aubrey smith passing the printed message slip to jane ambersom whom hed summoned after passmores alert none nor any chance of finding out said passmore to whom wilkinson had confessed and we havent heard from flood its all being done away from the embassy away from secure lines reminded the operations director its all at charlies lead thats the arrangement theres no way monsfords people could have found out said jane its got to be some kind of mi move said passmore our only link to charlie is through flood said smith we dont have secure communication insisted passmore route it through one of our european relays decided smith weve got to warn charlie tell me where sasha giggled its a surprise insisted natalia hot or cold sometimes hot sometimes cold youre holding my hand too tightly protested the girl mountains or flat small mountains but we can swim you packed my costume i hope we can swim do lots of things i wish youd tell me where were going sasha complained natalia started forward at the sound of the mobile telephone were on our way im already at the terminal waiting said charlie about thirty minutes no problems no i told you there wouldnt be who was that demanded the child someone from the airline wanting to know we were on our way vnukovo declared halliday this is the road to vnukovo can they get to london from vnukovo direct and via a lot of other links confirmed halliday how far is the airport maybe two miles weve got to be careful said briddle charlie might already be there waiting drop us off at the approach to the terminal before you park the car behind them denning broke wind halliday said i wont drive back with you ill catch an airport bus charlie saw them before their taxi stopped sure natalia wouldnt be able to locate him on the farthest side of the booth from which the baggage handlers and traffic supervisors operated natalia got out first at once searching and charlie stepped out saw from her facial reaction that shed seen him and withdrew he had the briefest sight of sasha before the booth blocked his view of their entering the building charlie hoped the unknown escort had picked them up inside hed failed to isolate any professional indicators earlier getting his boarding pass from the prebooked electronic dispenser and been reassured because it proved the expertise of whoever flood had put there ahead of their arrival charlies replaced contact emerged from the passage connecting to the parking and rentalcar return moving surely but unhurriedly and slowed at the main entrance when charlie stepped out for the second identification pushing a previously withdrawn luggage trolley back into its line flood understood at once offering charlie the release coin to avoid the procedure with those already locked and said briddle and the others cant be found you think theyve picked you up possibly at least one car stayed all the way from pecatnikov you take over charlie ordered taking the man with him as they entered the terminal you give london the arrival details make sure natalia and sasha get there if theres a challenge ill distract londons orders get natalia and sasha out stopped charlie splitting away from the other man how could it be blown thered been no link to the embassy no way the extraction could be compromised natalia had physically to see him to know nothing was wrong the terminal was far more crowded than it had been earlier making it difficult to isolate anyone earlier echoed in his mind like a warning bell he had a boarding pass a ticket record in his pocket identifying the flight theyd be on charlie transferred the boarding pass from his jacket to his trouser pocket keeping his hand on it he had to get rid of it at the first hint of trouble charlie saw her natalia was at the edge although not positively part of the line of people straggled into the departure area imperceptibly her face relaxed as she saw charlie she turned at once properly joining the line to move forward charlie couldnt see flood the red boarding message was flashing on the departures board hed fall back to the cyprus flight charlie decided discarding the finnair boarding pass in a rubbish bin on his way to the mea desk this time ignoring the automatic boarding machine knowing flood and the other escorts would realize what he was doing as he got into the mea checkin line his back to the main hall david halliday saw charlie as he entered after parking the rental car he saw briddle too and then denning and beckindale by a wall briddle was walking strangely both arms across himself as if he was in pain halliday continued on his concentration upon the oddly hunched stephan briddle and because of that concentration glimpsed the gun it was the briefest sight an openandclosed gap in briddles jacket from the contorted way the man was holding himself but halliday knew it was a gun a makarov and then he saw it more properly as briddle took it from beneath his jacket and without any conscious thought halliday yelled charlie who didnt hear briddle did though jerking toward the sound still bringing the gun out and halliday shouted again and this time charlie did hear turning back into the hall to see briddle and halliday one in front of the other the shot sounded very loud a reverberating echo and very quickly there was another and the screaming began and people ran and charlie ran too blindly pushing against other running people crashing into him there seemed a lot of shooting now echo after echo and in the first seconds charlie thought the numbness was somebody running into him harder than before but then there was more numbness and he knew he was falling although he didnt want to fall he wanted to keep running it didnt hurt when he hit the ground but he knew it should have done charlies last conscious thought was that the lights had been turned off which he couldnt understand charlies first awareness was of sound not voices and he hoped his eyes hadnt flickered werent flickering now he was consciously keeping them closed there was some pain probably where hed fallen but not a lot mostly he still felt numbed and didnt know why didnt understand much at all although he could remember what had happened briddle with a gun in his hand halliday behind arms outstretched as he ran forward the shotsa lot of shots impossible to count because of the echoing reverberations fallingfalling although he hadnt wanted to fall not able to save himself because he was so numb he could distinguish voices now russian but he couldnt properly determine the words it was as if they were talking softly whispering even couldnt understand why they were doing that either he tried to tense his body but not visibly move to discover if he was restrained but the numbness wouldnt let him please dont let me be paralyzed why should he be paralyzed why dont you open your eyes came a voice loud now which strangely charlie believed he recognized charlie did but couldnt focus several people some in uniforms a small room a bed he was in a hospital his vision cleared intermittently mikhail guzov the fsb colonel hed outwitted and beaten to expose the lvov plot was at the end of the bed smiling down at him were going to be together for a long time you and i said guzov lets start properly shall we how shall i call you malcolm stoat as you were listed on the amsterdam plane david merryweather as you were booked on the finnair and mea flights or charlie muffin why dont started charlie but stopped his voice cracking he cleared it why dont you take your pick charlie i think thats what the two weve got in custody call you sasha didnt know his name snatched charlie natalia and sasha had got away it had to be briddle and halliday charlies fine youre right you are fine agreed the russian the bullet a bullet from your own side we think went straight through your lower shoulder didnt even hit a bone you were knocked unconscious from the impact shock thats still affecting you now according to the doctors but they say youll be up and about in a week able to tell me all i want to know now wasnt the moment to argue finding out about natalia and sasha was the only thing that mattered what about the others not so fine the two colleagues coming for you briddle and halliday according to the identification they were carrying are both dead sos a russian militia officer another ones badly wounded so is an arab who was in the line behind you who were the two colleagues whod been arrested im surprised those youve got are talking so readily what did you do to them nothing guzov smiled its amazing how fear affects some people what about you charlie are you going to tell me so readily all i want to know i dont know anything there is to tell you i do charlie ive got a very long list what happened the truth you must tell me the truth not lie there was an incident a mistake caused by our own people said aubrey smith what sort of incident persisted natalia the directorgeneral hesitated the truth she demanded some shooting was charlie shot yes now it was natalia who hesitated lips tightly together is he dead we dont think so i know a lot about stepan lvov its not right what you think you know youll make mistakes are already making mistakes we want you to tell us about that natalia to tell us all you know natalia shook her head get charlie out ill tell you nothing until you get charlie out then youll get everything save everything but charlies got to be saved first
