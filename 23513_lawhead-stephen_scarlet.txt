stephen r lawhead scarlet chapter so now one day soon they hang me for a rogue fair enough i have earned it a hundred times over i reckon and thats leaving a lot of acreage unexplored the jest of it is the crime for which i swing is the one offence i never did do the sheriff will have it that i raised rebellion against the king i didnt oh theres much ive done that some would as soon count treason for a fact i et more of the kings venison than the king has et bread and good men have lost their heads to royal pikes for far less but in all my frolics i never breathed a disloyal word against the crown nor tried to convince any man boy horse or dog to match his deeds to mine ah but dainties such as these are of no concern when princes have their tender feelings ruffled it is a traitor they want to punish not a thief the eatin o red williams game is a matter too triflingmore insult than crimeand its a redhanded rebel they need too much has happened in the forests of the march and too much princely pride hangs in the balance to be mincing fair about a rascal poaching a few softeyed deer until that illfated night will scarlet ran with king raven and his band of merry thieves ran fast and far i did let me tell you faster and farther than all the rest and thats saying something heres the gist its the raven hood they want and cannot get so ol will is for the jump poor luck that no less no more they caught me crest and colours my own bloody fault theres none to blame but the hunter when hes caught in his own snare i ask no pardon a willing soul i flew field and forest with king raven and his flock fine fun it was too until they nabbed me in the pinch even so if it hadnt a been for a spear through my leg bone they would not a got me either so here we sit my leg and me in a dank pit beneath count de braoses keep i have a cellfour walls of stone and a damp dirt floor covered with rotting straw and rancid rushes i have a warden named guibert or gulbert or some such who brings me food and water when he can be bothered to remember and unchains me from time to time so i can stretch the cramps a bit and wash my wound i also have my very own priest a young laggard of a scribe who comes to catch my wild tales and pin them to the pages of a book to doom us all we talk and talk god knows weve got time to kill before the killing time it pleases me now to think on the dizzy chase we led i was taken in the most daring and outrageous scheme to come out of the forest yet it was a plan as desperate as death but light and larksome as a maidens flirting glance at a blow we aimed to douse the sheriff s ardour and kindle a little righteous wrath in lorn britannia we aimed to cock a snook at the crown sure and mayhap draw the kings attention to our sore plight embarrass his sheriff and show him and his muttonheaded soldiers for fools on paradeall in one fell swoop sweet it was and save for my piddling difficulties flawless as a flower until the walls of the world came crashing down around our ears truth is i cant help thinking that if we only knew what it was that had fallen plump into our fists none of this would have happened and i would not be here now with a leg on fire and fit to kill me if the sheriff dont oh but that is ranging too far afield and there is ground closer to home needs ploughing first ah but see the monk here asleep with his nose in his inkhorn odo you dunce wake up youre dozing again it ill becomes you to catch a wink on a dying mans last words prick up your ears priest pare your quill and tell me the last you remember sorry will he says hes always ever so sorry rubbing sleep from his dreamy brown eyes and it is sorry he should besorry for himself and all his dreary ilk but not for will never feel sorry for will lad i tell him will ent sorry for nothing brother odo is my scribe decent enough for a norman in his simpering damphanded way he does not wish me harm i think he does not even know why he has been sent down here amongst the gallows birds to listen to the ramblings of a dangerous scofflaw like myself why should he abbot hugo is behind this wheeze to scribble down all my doings to what purpose plain as daylight in dunholme he means to scry out a way to catch king raven hugo imagines languishing in the shadow of the noose for a spell will sober me enough to grow a tongue of truth in my head and sing like a bird for freedom so i sing and sing if only to keep jack oladder at arms length a little longer our larcenous abbot will learn summat to his profit as may be but more to his regret hell learn much of that mysterious phantom of the greenwood to be sure but for all his listening hell hear naught from me to catch so much as a mayfly hell not get the bolt he desires to bring king raven down so now i say pick up your pen brother odo well begin again what was the last you remember odo scans his chicken tracks a moment scratches his shaved pate and says when thane aelreds lands were confiscated for his part in the uprising i was thrown onto my own resources odo speaks his english with the strange flat tongue of the frank outlanders that he speaks english at all is a wonder i suppose and the reason why hugo chose him poor odo is a pudgy pudding of a man young enough and earnest in faith and practice but pale and only too ready to retire claiming cramp or cold or fatigue he is always fatigued and for no good reason it seems to me he makes as if chasing a leaking nib across freshscraped vellum is as mighty a labour as toting the carcass of a fat hind through the greenwood on your back with the sheriff s men on your tail all saints bear witness if pushing a pen across parchment taxes a man as much as odo claims we should honour as heroes all who ply the quill amen i am of the opinion that unless he grows a backbone and right soon brother odo will be nothing more in this life than another weakeyed scribbler squinting down his long french nose at the undiluted drivel his hand has perpetrated by blessed cuthberts thumb i swear i would rather end my days in baron de braoses pit than face eternity with a blot like that on my soul perhaps in gods dark plan friend will is here to instruct this indolent youth in a better lesson thinks i well we will do what can be done to save him when thane aelreds lands were confiscated for his part in the uprising i was thrown onto my own resources and like to have died they were that thin this i tell him repeating the words to buy a little time while i cast my net into streams gone by to catch another gleaming memory for our proud abbots feast may he choke on the bones with this blessing between my teeth i rumble on chapter thane aelred was as fairminded as the tyne is wide and solid as the threehundredyearold oak that grew beside his barn a bullnecked man with the shaggy brown mane of a lion and a roar to match as may be but he treated his people right and well never one to come all high and mighty with his minions he was always ready enough to put hand to plough or scythe bless the man he never shirked the shearing or slaughtering and all the grunt and sweat that work requires for though we have lived a thousand years and more since our sweet jesus came and went it is a sad sad truth that sheep will still not shear themselves nor hogs make hams theres the pity toss a coin and decide which of the two is the filthier chore under aelred god rest him there was always a jar or three to ease our aching bones when the days work was done all of us tenants and vassals who owed him servicea day or two here a week therewere treated like blood kin whenever we set foot on the steading to honour our pledge of work in return he gave neither man nor maid worse than hed accept for himself or his house and thats a right rare thane that is show me another as decent and honest and ill drink a health to him here and now not like these norman vermincall them what you like franks ffreinc or normans theyre all the same lords of the earth they trow lords of perdition more like hold themselves precious as stardust and fine as diamonds dressed in their goldcrusted rags they flounce about the land their bloody minds scheming mischief all the while from the moment a norman noble opens his eye on the day until that same eye closes at night the highborn frankish man is in aelreds words a walking scittesturm for anyone unlucky enough to cross his path a norman knight lives only for hunting and whoring preening and warring and their toadlicking priests are just as bad even the best of their clerics are no better than they should be i wouldnt spare the contents of my nose on a rainy day to save the lot of them sorry odo but that is gods own truth groan as you will to hear it write it down all the same if it please you what is scittesturm odo wants to know ask a saxon i tell him if bloody baron de braose hasnt killed them all yet youll learn quick enough but there we are aelred is gone now he had the great misfortune to believe the land his father had given himland owned and worked by his fathers father and the fathers father before thatbelonged to him and his forever a dangerous delusion as it turns out for when william the conqueror snatched the throne of england and made himself the law of the land he set to work uprooting the deepgrown offices and traditions that time and the stumpsolid saxons had planted and maintained since their arrival on these fair shoresoffices and traditions which bound lord and vassal in a lockstep dance of loyalty and service sure but also kept the high and mighty above from devouring the weak and poorly below this was the bedrock of saxon law just and good enforcing fairness for all who sheltered under it like the strong timber roof of great alfreds hall we all found shelter under it however hard the gales of power and privilege might blow the thanesfreeholders mostly men who were neither entirely noble nor completely common willy conqueror did not understand them at all never did nor bothered to see now a norman knows only two kinds of men nobles and serfs to a norman a man is either a king or a peasant nothing else there is black and there is white and there is the end of it consequently there is no one to stand between the two to keep them from each others throats the welshmen laugh at both camps i know the british have their nobility too but british kings and princes share the same life as the people they rule a lord might be more esteemed by virtue of his deeds or other merits real or imagined but a true british prince is not too lofty to feel the pinch when drought makes a harvest thin or a hard winter gnaws through all the provisions doublequick the british king will gladly drink from the same clay cup as the least of his folk and can recite the names of each and every one of his tribesmen to the third or fourth generation in this king raven was no less than the best example of his kind and ill wager baron de braose has never laid eyes on most of the wretches whose sweat and blood keep him in hunting hawks and satin breeches like all norman barons de braose surveys his lands from the back of a great destriera giant with four hooves that eats more in a day than any ten of his serfs can scrape together for the week his knights and vavasorshateful wordspill more in a nights roister than any hoveldweller on his estate will see from christmas eve to easter morn and thats if theyre lucky to see a drop o anything cheerful at all well de braose may never have shaken hands with one of his serfs but he knows how much the man owes in taxes to the nearest hapenny thats a kind of talent i suppose give him that i give him also his shrewd calculating mind and a farsighted sense of selfpreservation he could see or maybe smell the right way to jump a long way off the old goat rarely put a foot wrong where his own vital interests were concerned the king liked him too though i cant think why still and all royal favour never hurts abody while it lasts making it last aye theres the grit in the loaf so when william the conquering bastard got himself killed in a little foray in francetook an arrow they say just like poor king haroldthat upset the apple cart no mistake and thane aelred was one of those ruddy english pippins as got bounced from the box aye heads rolled everywhere before the dust settled on that one stout aelreds lands were confiscated and the good man himself banished from the realm all of us vassals were turned out thrown off the land by the kings stinking sheriff and his bailiffs our village was burned to the last house and pigsty aelreds holding was returned to forest and placed under forest law devils work most of us myself included lingered in the area awhile we had nowhere else to go and no provision made for us for like the others in aelreds keep i was born on his lands and my father served his father as i served him the scatlockes have been vassals ever and always never lords yes odo that is my real namewilliam scatlocke i pause to explain ysee its just some folk have it hard with such a ragged scrap between their teeth and scarlet has a finer sound i agree says he splendid i tell him i will sleep so much better for knowing that now where was i odo scans what he has written and says you were telling about forest law you called it the devils work aye and so it is forest lawtwo perfectly honest and upright words as ever was but placed together they make a mad raving monster see now under forest law the crown takes a piece of land useful and needful for all folk in common and at a stroke turns it into a private hunting park forever closed to common folk for any purpose whatsoever forest law turns any land into kings land to be used by royals only them and their fortunefavoured friends the keep of these socalled parks is given to agents of the crown known as sheriffs who rule with a noose in one hand and a flamin hot castration iron in the other for anyone who might happen to trespass however lightly on the royal preserve truly merely setting foot in a royal forest can get you maimed or blinded taking a single deer or pig to feed your starving children can get you hung at the crossroads alongside evil outlaws who have burned entire villages and slaughtered whole families in their sleep a petty thing hardly worth a mornings sweat as it may be yes that darkeyed deer with the fine brown pelt and tasty haunches is worth more than any fifty or a hundred vassals be they serfs or freemen and theres a fact forest law is what happened to thane aelreds landshall barn sty granary milkhouse and mill all burned to the last stick and stake and the ashes ploughed under the ageold boundary stones were pulled up and the hides taken off the registry books and the whole great lot joined up to the lands of other english estates to be declared kings forest aelred himself was hauled away in chains leaving his poor lady wife to make her way as best she could i heard later he and his were dumped aboard a ship bound for daneland with other miserable exiles but i never really knew for sure the rest of his folk were turned out that same day and herded off the property at the point of long norman spears those of us without friends or relations we might flee to for aid and comfort took to the greenwood we aimed to live off the land in spite of the threat of death hanging over us if we were caught as one of aelreds foresters this was no great hardship for me but others who were not used to such stark conditions suffered mightily cold and fever took a heavy toll and the sheriff s men took more they killed us whenever they could and chased us always it was no kind of life odo lad let me tell you he glances up with his big dreamy eyes his soft mouth caught in a half smile you would not last above three days i might be stronger than i look says he and looks are ever deceiving i reply and we go on eventually with winter coming on and the sheriff and his men growing wise to our ways the few of us that had survived those many months broke company and drifted off to other parts some went north where the harrowing had desolated the land in those empty parts it was said honest folk might begin again trouble there was that too many dishonest folk had gathered up there too and it was fast becoming a killing ground of another kind me i decided to go west to walesto wallia land of my mothers birth id always wanted to see it mind but there was more to it than whim for i had heard a tale that stirred my blood a man they said had risen in defiance of the norman overlords a man who flew in the face of certain death to challenge king william himself a man they called king raven chapter lundein cardinal ranulf de bayeux stepped from the small flatbottomed boat onto the landing stone set into the soft shore of the river thames the rank brown water was awash in dung and garbage awaiting the estuary tide to rise and bear it away pressing the cloth of his wide sleeve against his nose he motioned impatiently to his companions as they clambered from the boat two menatarms had travelled down to lundein with the cardinal and they followed his lead remaining a few paces behind the red pennants atop their spears fluttering in the breeze clutching the skirts of his scarlet satin robe to avoid the mud ranulf tiptoed up the embankment to the wooden walkway that led to the city street and passed the walls of the white tower the new stone of that magnificent fortress glowed in the full light of a warm sun a blazing milky brilliance against the yellow leaves and dazzling blue autumn sky king william had returned from normandie two days previous and had summoned his chief advisor straightawayno doubt to review the accounts which ranulf carried in a velvet pouch beneath his arm it had been a good year all things considered the treasury was showing a small surplus for a change so ranulf was to be congratulated thanks to his tirelessly inventive mind the king would have money to pay his bribes and his troops with a little more besides oh but it was becoming ever more difficult the people were taxed to the teeth the nobles likewise and the chorus of grumbling was becoming a deafening din from some quarters which is why ranulfa man of the cloth after allcould no longer travel about the land alone but went with an armed escort to protect him from any who felt themselves particularly aggrieved by his efforts on the kings behalf william of course was ultimately to blame for the resentment festering throughout his realm it was not that the king was a spendthrift common opinion to the contrary william the red was no more wastrel than his fathera man who lived well to be sure although far less so than many of his baronsbut war was a costly business much expenditure for piddling little gain even when william won the conflict which he usually did he almost always came away the poorer for it and the warring was incessant if it wasnt the scots it was the bretons and if not foreign troublemakers it was his own brothers prince henry and duke robert fomenting rebellion yet today if only for today the news from the treasury would please the king and ranulf was eager to share this good news and advance another step towards reaping a substantial reward for himselfthe lucrative bishopric of duresme perhaps which was empty now owing to the death of the previous incumbent cardinal de bayeux and his escort passed through the wide and handsome gate with but a nod to the porter they quickly crossed the yard where the kings baggage train still waited to be unloaded ranulf dismissed his soldiers and commanded them to remain ready outside then entered the tower and climbed the stairs to the antechamber above where he was admitted by the steward and informed that the king was at table and awaiting his arrival entering silently ranulf took one look at his royal patron and read the kings disposition instantly his majesty is displeased declared cardinal ranulf from the doorway he made a small bow and smoothed the front of his satin robe displeased wondered william beckoning him in with a wave of his hand why would you say displeased hmm rising from his chair the king began to pace along the length of the table where he had lately enjoyed a repast with his vavasours the kings companions had gone or been sent away and william was alone why indeed said the king without waiting for ranulf s reply my dear brother robert threatens war if i do not capitulate to his ridiculous whims my barons find ever more brazen excuses to reduce their tributes and taxes my subjects are increasingly rebellious to my rule and rude to my person the king turned on his chief counsellor and waved a parchment like a flag and now this ill tidings mon roi by the holy face of luccawilliam shouted is there no end to this mans demands which man sire if you please ranulf moved a few paces into the room this jackanapes of a pope roared the king this urbanhe says canterbury has been vacant too long and insists we invest an archbishop at once ignore him sire suggested ranulf oh but that is not the end of his impudence continued the king without pausing to draw breath far from it he demands not only my seal on a letter of endorsement but a public demonstration of my support as well which as we have often discussed you are understandably loath to give sympathised the cardinal stifling a yawn blast his eyes i am loath to give him so much as the contents of my bowelswilliam his ruddy cheeks blushing hot with anger threw a finger in his counsellors face god help me if i ever suffer one of his lickspit legates to set foot in my kingdom ill boil the beggar in his own blood and if urban persists in these demands i will throw my support to clementi swear i will tell him so suggested ranulf simply that is what the conqueror would have doneand did often enough there there you say it by judas crowed william my father had no illusions about who should rule the church in his kingdom he would not suffer any priest to stick his nose into royal affairs it was true williams father the conqueror had ruled the church like he ruled everything else on his adopted island not content to allow such a wealthy and powerful institution to look to its own affairs he continually meddled in everything from appointing clerics to the collection of tithesever and always to his own advantage ranulf knew that the son william the red was peeved because try as he might he could not command the same respect and obedience from the church that his father had taken as his due mark me bayeux ill not swear out my throne to urban no matter how many legates and emissaries he sends to bedevil me tell his eminence that his continued attempts to leech authority from the throne make this most sacred display of loyalty a mockery cardinal ranulf of bayeux moved to a place across the table from his pacing king tell him to stuff the fishermans ring up his sanctimonious ha cried william if i told him that he would excommunicate me without a second thought do you care countered ranulf smoothly your majesty holds rome in contempt in any of a hundred ways already you go too far my faith or lack of it is my own affair ill not be chastised by the likes of you bayeux ranulf bowed his head as if to accept the reprimand and said methinks you misunderstand me sire i meant that the king of england need spare no thought for pope urbans tender feelings as you suggest it is a simple enough matter to offer support to his rival clement william allowed himself to be calmed by the gentle and shrewd assertions of his justiciar it is that sneered william the king of england surveyed the remains of his midday meal as if the table were a battlefield and he was searching for survivors i much prefer clement anyway you see ranulf smiled pleased with the way he had steered the king to his point of view god continues to grace your reign sire in his wisdom he has provided a timely alternative let it be known and voiced abroad that you support clement and well soon see how the worm writhes if urban suspected i was inclined to pledge loyalty to clement he might cease badgering me william spied a nearby goblet on the table there was still some wine in it so he gulped it down he might even try to woo me back into his camp instead is that what you mean he might confirmed ranulf in a way that suggested this was the very least william might expect he might do more william ventured how much more the kings goodwill has a certain value to the church just now it is the pope who needs the king not the other way around perhaps this goodwill might be bartered for something of more substantial and lasting value william stopped pacing and drew his hand through his thinning red hair the pope has nothing i want he decided at last he turned and stumped back to his chair he is a prisoner in his own palace why he cannot even show his face in rome william looked into another cup but it was empty so he resumed his search the man can do little enough for himself he can do nothing for me nothing asked the cardinal pointedly nothing at all nothing i can think of maintained william stubbornly if you know something bayeux tell me now or leave me alone i grow weary of your insinuations given urbans precarious positiona position made all the more uncertain by the kings brother robert said william my brother may be an ass but he has no love for rome i was thinking of henry sire said the cardinal seeing that henry is courting clement it seems to me that urban with the proper inducement might be willing to recognize the english crowns right to appoint clergy in exchange for your support suggested the cardinal what is that worth do you think william stared at his chief justiciar the wheels of government grind slowly as you well and truly know he said his pale blue eyes narrowing as he considered the implications of his counsellors suggestion you are paid to see that they do yes and every day a pulpit stands empty the crown collects the tithe as you well and truly know a tithe which would otherwise go to the church said william ultimately to rome indirectly perhaps agreed ranulf he buffed his fingernails against the sleek satin of his robe urban contests this right of course but if the pope were to formally relinquish all such claims in favour of the crown i would become head of the church in england said william following the argument to its conclusion i would not go so far sire allowed ranulf rome would never allow secular authority to stand above the church urbans power ebbs by the day to be sure but you will never pry that from his misers grasp well grumped the king it would amount to the same thing england would be a realm unto itself and its church an island in the papal sea even so granted ranulf gallantly your majesty would effectively free the throne of england from the interference of rome for good and forever that would be worth something how much said william he leaned across the table on his fists how much would it be worth who can say tithes landsthe sale of benefices alone could run to william might not understand the finer points of the papal dispute that had inadvertently thrown up two rival claimants to saint peters golden chair but he knew men and money and clerics were the same as most men in wanting to ease the way for their offspring in the world a payment to the church to secure a position for an heir was money well spent thousands of marks a year mused william pounds sire thousands yesthousands of pounds straight into your treasury it would only take a letter william looked at the empty goblet in his hand and then threw it the length of the room it struck the far wall and tumbled down the tapestry by the blessed virgin flambard you are a rascal i like it returning to his chair william resumed his place at the table wine he shouted to an unseen servant lurking behind the door sit he said to ranulf tell me more about this letter the cardinal tossed the black velvet bag onto the bench and sat down he cleared a place among the crumbs and bones with the side of his hand choosing a goblet from those on the table before him he emptied it and waited for the servant to appear with a jar when the cups were filled once more the king and his chief advisor drank and discussed how to make best use of the pope and his predicament chapter brother odo is dozing over his quill again much as i like to see him jump i wont wake him just yet it gives me time the longer i stretch this tale the more time i have before the tale stretches me so to speak besides i need a little space to think what i think on now is the day i first set eyes on king raven a pleasant day it was too in all its parts crisp bright autumn was descending over the march i had been months awandering poking here and there as fancy took me moving ever and always in the direction of the setting sun i had no plan other than to learn more of this king raven and find him if i could a fellow of the forest such as myself might make himself useful to a man like that if i did i reckoned he might be persuaded to take me under his wing i kept my ears sharp for any word of king raven and asked after him whenever i happened on a settlement or holding i worked for food and a bed of straw in barn or byre and talked to those who were bold enough to speak about the abuses of the crown and events in the land many of those i spoke to had heard the nameas well they might for baron de braose lord of bramber had set aside a right handsome reward for his capture some of the folk had a tale or two of how this raven fella had outwitted the baron or abbot or some such but none knew more than i did of this elusive blackbird or his whereabouts the further west i wended however the pickings got better in one respect but worse in another more had heard of king raven to be sure and some were happy enough to talk but those who knew of him held that this raven was not a real man at all rather they had it that he was a phantom sent up from the lowest infernal realm to bedevil the normans they said the creature took the form of a giant highcrested bird with wings to span a tenfoot pike and a wicked long beak deadly as plague to the normans they said and black as satans pit whence he sprung he was a creature bred and born of deviltryalthough one alewife told me that he had given some kinfolk of hers aid in food and good money when they were that desperate for it so he couldnt be all that bad as green spring gave way to summer i settled for a spell with a swineherd and his gaptoothed wife on their small farm hard by hereford where baron neufmarche keeps his great stone heap of a castle although wales is only a few days saunter up the road i was in no hurry just then i wanted to learn more if more was to be learned and so i lay low biding my time and listening to the locals when they had cause to speak of matters that interested me when the days work was finished id hie up to town to spend a fair summer evening at the cross keys an inn of questionable repute the innkeeper was a rascal no mistakeits him they should be hanging not willbut he served a worthy jar and thick chops so tender and juicy your teeth could have a rest i came to know many of the local folk who called at the keys and they came to trust me with their more private thoughts always i tried to steer the talk towards happenings in the march hoping for a word or two of king raven thus it fell out one night that i met a freeman farmer who traded at hereford on market days he had come up to sell a bit of bacon and summer sausage and seeing me cooling my heels came to sit down beside me on the low wall that fronted the inn well said i raising my jar heres hail to the king hail to the king devil take him when he will oh red william gone out of favour with you i ask aye says the farmer and i dont care who knows it all the same he glanced around guiltily to see who might be overhearing no one was paying any mind to a couple of tonguewags like ourselves so he took a deep draught of his ale and reclined on his elbow against the wall i pray for his downfall every day what has the king done to you to earn such ire what hasnt he done before rufus i had a wife and a strapping big son to help me with the chores and now wife got croup and died and son was caught in the greenwood setting rabbit snares lost his good right hand to the sheriff s blade now he cant do moren herd the stock you blame the king for that i do if i had my way king raven would pluck out his eyes and eat his right royal liver that would be a sight i told him if that feathered fella was more than a story to tell on a summer night oh he is the farmer insisted he is right enough my vengeful friend went on then to relate how the dread bird had swooped down on a passel of norman knights as they passed through the march on the kings road one fine night king raven fell out of the sky like a venging angel and slew a whole army o the barons rogues before they could turn and run the farmer said he left only one terrified sot alive to warn the baron to leave off killin brits this creaturehow did he kill the knights i wondered the farmer looked me in the eye and said with fire and arrows fair enough says i but if it was with fire and arrows how do they know it was the phantom bird who did it and not just some peevish welshman you know how contrary they can be when riled oh aye agreed the farmer i know that right enough but it was the king raven no mistake he shook his head with unwavering assurance that i know because i prodded lightly because says he with a slow smile the arrows was black stone tip to feather they was black as beelzebubs tongue this bit of news thrilled me more than anything id heard yet black arrows mind just the kind of thing olwill scarlet might think up if he was about such business as spreading fear and havoc among the rascal brigade in this tetchy farmers tale i saw the shape of a man and not a phantom a man that much like myself it gave me the first solid hope to be getting on with i lingered on the holding through harvesttime to help out and then as the leaves began to fall and the wind freshened from the north i took my leave and one bright day took to the road once more i walked from settlement to settlement pausing wherever i could to seek word of king raven autumn had come to the land as i say and i eventually arrived at the edge of the march and entered the forest easy in my own company i remained alert to all around me i travelled slow and with purpose camping by the road each night on those clean clear mornings i rose early and made for a high place the better to watch and listen and learn what i could of the woodland round about see now the forest of the march is an ancient wood old when adam was a lad a wild place not like any forest id known in england denser darker more tangled and woolly it clutched tight to its secrets and held them close mind you i am a man used to forest ways and byways and as the bright days chased one another off toward winter i began to get the measure of it one morning just as the weather turned i woke to a chill mist and the sound of voices on the kings road i had seen wolf scat on the trail before sunset and decided a prudent man might do well to sleep out of reach of those rangy longtoothed hunters so having spent the night in the rough crook of a stout oak within sight of the kings roada stiff cradling to be surei stirred as the daylight broke soft on a grey and gusty day and heard the sound of men talking on the trail below their voices were quiet and low the easy rhythmic tones familiar even as the words were strange it took me a moment to shake the sleep out of my ears and realise they were speaking welsh my mothers tongue it was and i had enough of it from my barefoot days to make myself understood i heard the words rhi bran y hud and knew i was close to finding what i was looking for so yes odo what is it my scribe rouses himself from his snooze and rubs his dreamdulled eyes these words riban hood he asks yawning wide what do they mean if you would let a fella get on wi the tellin god knows youd find out soon enough i say but see here now it ent riban hood as you will have it it is rhi branthat part means king raven and hud means well it means enchanter it is what the british folk call the phantom lord of the marchlands ree bran a hood he says dutifully writing it down a good name aye a good name that i agree and we rumble on well i shinnied down to join those fellas on the road and see what they could tell me of this mysterious bird here now i called dropping lightly from the last branch onto the bank above the road can you fellas spare a traveller a word or two you would have thought id dropped down from the moon to see the look on those two faces two men one big as a house and the other slighter but muscled and tough as a hickory root they were dressed in odd hooded cloaks with greenery and rags sewn on and both carried sturdy longbows with a quiver of arrows at their belts what cried the big one spinning around quicker than youd have thought possible for so large a lump of humanity this one has spent a fair bit of time in the greenwood thinks i his knife is in his hand that quick i mean no harm friend i said and full sorry i am if i startled you i heard you talkin and was hopin for a little chin music is all you lurking devil growled the slight one thrusting forward well not be singing for you he looked to the big one who nodded slowly not until we know more about you well ive got time now if you do said i where would you like me to begin a name if you have one said he that will do for a beginning my names william scatlocke i told them think what you like but theres some as tug a forelock when they hear that name i give him a smile and a wink but a doff o the hat will do nicely just now i am iwan replied the big one warming up a little this here is siarles scatlockes a saxon name observed the slight one with a frown but william now thats ffreinc he seemed ready to spit to show me what he thought of normans saxon and ffreinc aye i agreed politely my mother bless her dear sweet wellmeaning soul thought a frankish william would make my life that little mite easier seeing as our land was overrun by the vermin with a william to go before me they might mistake me for one of their own see and give me an easier ride do they he asked suspicion making his voice a threat not as ive noticed i said then again it ent as if id been named siarles now theres a name just begging for trouble if ever i heard one the slight one bristled and bunched up his face but the big one chuckled aloud his voice like thunder over green hills you are a bold one give you that said he but youre in the march now friend what causes you to be dropping from our good welsh trees bold william friendly folk call me will scarlet i answered forester by trade i amjust like my father before me i see you two know your way around leafland yourselves that we do will iwan said are you running from someone then running to more like well they wanted to hear more so i went on to explain about thane aelred getting banished and his lands taken in forest law and all that ruck i told about taking to the greenwood and all my travels since then they listened and i could feel them relaxing their distrust as i described hiding from the sheriff and his men on land that used to belong to my good thane and poaching the kings precious deer to survive pretty soon they began nodding and agreeing siding with me in my plight thing is since then ive been on the move all summer looking for this fella they call king raven naturally when i heard you mention rhi bran my ears pricked right up you speak cymru asked siarles then learned it on my dear mums knee i told him same mum in fact that named me william i also bothered myself to learn a little frank so id know what those buggers were up to why do you want to see king raven asked iwan if you dont mind my asking to offer my services i replied and id be much obliged for any help you could give me in that direction might we know the nature of these services asked siarles looking me up and down he was softening a bit but still a little brittle for my taste seems to me that if he is even half the man i think he is hell be needing a strong and fearless hand like will scarlet here what do you know of him i know he ent a phantom as some would have it i know baron de braose is offering fifty pounds of pure english silver for his fine feathered head on a pike truly siarles asked much impressed aye i assured him did you not know that we maybe heard something about it he muttered then a new thought occurred to him and just how do we know you dont want to claim all that money for yourself good question i allowed and it deserves a good answer well he said suspicion leaping up lively as ever siarles bless him his grey eyes are quick and they are keen but he distrusts most of what he sees half of it is living in the wildwood i reckon where your eyes and wits are your best and truest friends but the other half is just his own leery nature as soon as i think up an answer good enough ill tell you i said this brought a growl from young siarles who wanted to run me off then and there iwan only laughed he had already made up his mind about me peace siarles he said he doesnt want the money how can you be so sure any man after the reward money would have thought of a better answer than that why hed have a whole story worked out and like as not say too much and get himself all tangled in the telling will here didnt do that maybe hes just that stupid nay he isnt stupid replied iwan i liked him better and better by the moment ill wager my good word against anything in your purse that claiming the reward money never crossed his mind you would win that bet friend i replied in truth it never did seeing as how iwan had made such a fine argument for me i asked am i to be thinking that you know this rhi bran siarles still suspicious frowned as iwan said know him aye we do would you kindly tell me where he can be found i asked nice as please and thank you better than that said iwan well take you to meet him iwan snapped siarles he was tenacious as a rat dog give him that what are you saying we dont know this saxon or anything about him we cant be taking him to bran why he might be anybodymaybe even a spy for the abbot if hes hugos spy we cant be leaving him here countered iwan i say we take him with us and leave it to bran to decide who and what he isaye and what is to be done with him turning to me he said if we take you with us do you swear on your lifes blood to abide by our lords decision whatsoever it may be ordinarily i do not like swearing my life away on the whims of persons unknown but seeing as he was only granting me the chance id been seeking all summer i readily agreed on my lifes blood i swear to abide by your lords decision good enough for me said iwan follow us and see you keep quiet added siarles for good measure ill be as quiet as you were when you woke me from my treetop perch just now i told him iwan gave out a laugh and in two quick strides disappeared up over the bank and into the brushwood beside the road after you said siarles prodding me with the tip of his bow ill come last and dont you put a foot wrong cause ill be watching you theres relief to be sure i replied stepping into the forest i was led a merry chase to meet the man id crossed half the country to see god save me but i never imagined him the way he first appeared chapter the trail went on and on my guides maintained a curious wolftrot pace three steps quick walk alternating with four steps slow running it took a bit of getting used to but once i got the knack i soon understood that it allowed a body to move quickly over long distances and still have breath enough and strength to do what you came to do when you reached your destination i had never seen this neat trick before and was glad to add it to my own tidy store of forest craft you should try it odo i tell my blearyeyed scribe he raises his pudding face to see if i jest it would do you good i will take you at your word he says stifling a yawn he dips his quill in the horn and the wet nib hovers over the parchment where did they take you these hooded strangers where did they take me pay attention and youll learn soon enough now then where was i running through the greenwood to meet the raven king not the raven king i tell him it is king raventhere is a difference monk get it right odo gives an indifferent shrug and i resume my tale well we ran miles that morning and i am firmly persuaded most of it was just to confuse me so as to prevent me leading anyone else to their forest hideaway for the most part it worked well enough on a fella less firmly rooted in woodland lore it would have been wellnigh confounding as for myself it produced only mild befuddlement as iwan probably guessed after a while for we came to a place where a little clear water stream issued from beneath a natural rock wall and after wed got a few good mouthfuls the big man produced a scrap of cloth from his quiver sorry william he said handing me the cloth you must bind your eyes now if it makes you and yours feel better im happy to do it i said ill even let siarles here tie the knot right you will said siarles stepping behind me as i wound the cloth around my head he tied the loose ends gave them a sharp tug and then we were away again more slowlythis time iwan leading and me stumbling along with my hand on his shoulder tripping over roots and stones and trying to keep up with his longlegged strides it was more difficult than i would have thoughttry it yourself in rough wood and see how you go after a time i sensed the ground beginning to rise the slope was gradual at first but grew steeper as we went along i heard birdsong high up scattered and far offthe trees were getting bigger and farther apart gaining the top of the ridge we came to a stony ledge and stopped again here now said iwan taking me by the shoulders and turning me around a few times not far to go a few more steps is all he spun me around some more and then siarles spun me the other way for good measure mind your step said siarles his mouth close to my ear keep your head low or youll get a knock he pressed my head down until i was bent double and then led me through a gap between two trees and almost immediately down a steep incline cel craidd said iwan i pray it goes well with you here you better pray so too added siarles in tone far less friendly he had taken against me i dont know whymaybe it was that jibe about his name or maybe it was the cut of my cloth but whatever it was he gave me to know that he held me of small regard play us false and it will be the last place you ever see now now i replied no need to be nasty ive sworn to abide and abide i will come what may siarles untied the binding cloth and i opened my eyes on the strangest place i have ever seen a village made of skins and bones branches and stones there were low hovels roofed with ferns and moss and others properly thatched with rushes some had wattleanddaub walls and some were made of woven willow withies so that the hut seemed to have been knitted whole out of twigs and the chinks stuffed with dried grass giving the place an odd fuzzy appearance as if it wore a pelt in moulting if a few of the hovels in the centre of the settlement were larger and constructed of more substantial stuffsplit timber and the likethey also had roofs of grassy turf and wore antlers or skull bones of deer or oxen at the corners and above their hidecovered doorways which gave them the look of something grown up out of the forest floor if a tribe of greenmen had bodged together a settlement out of bark and brake and castoff woodland ruck it would look exactly like this i thought indeed it was a fit roost for king ravenjust the sort of place the lord of the forest might choose nested in a shallow bowl of a glade snugged about by the stout timbers of oak and lime and ash and elm cel craidd was not only protected but well hidden the circling arm of the ridge formed a wall of sorts on three sides which rose above the low huts a fella would have to be standing on the ridgetop and looking down into the bowl of the glade to see it but this concealment came at a price and the people there were paying the toll with their lives our arrival was noticed by a few of the small fry who ran to fetch a welcome party they werebeneath the soot and dirt and ragged clothesordinary children and not the offspring of a greenwife they skittered away with the swift grace of creatures birthed and brought up in the wildwood chirping and whooping they flew to an antlerdecked hut in the centre of the settlement and pounded on the doorpost in a few moments there emerged what is possibly the ugliest old woman i ever set eyes to mother mary but she was a sight with her skin wrinkled like a dried plum and blackened by years of sitting in the smoke of a cooking fire and a wiry wayward grizzled fringe of dark hairdark where it should have been bleached white by age she was that old she hobbled up to look me over and though her step might have been shambling there was nothing wrong with the eyes in her head people talk of eyes that pierce flesh and bone for brightness and i always thought it mere fancy not so she looked me over and i felt my skin flayed back and my soul laid bare before a gaze keen as a freshstropped razor this is angharad banfaith of britain iwan declared pride swelling his voice at this the old woman bent her head i give thee good greeting friend peace and joy be thine this day she said in a voice that creaked like a dry bellows may thy sojourn here well become thee she spoke in an oldfashioned way that oddly enough suited her so well i soon forgot to remark on it at all peace banfaith i replied id heard and seen my mothers folk greeting the old ones from time to time using a gesture of respect this i did for her touching the back of my hand to my forehead and hoping the sight of an ungainly halfsaxon offering this honour would not offend overmuch i was rewarded with a broad and cheerful smile that creased her wrinkled face anew albeit pleasantly enough you have the learning i ween she said how came you by it my blessed mother taught her son the manners of the cymry i replied though it is seldom enough ive had the chance to employ them these last many years i fear my plough has grown rusty from neglect she chuckled at this then we will burnish it up bright as new soon enough she said turning to iwan she said how came you to find him he dropped out of a tree not ten steps from us he answered fell onto the road like an overgrown apple did he now she wondered to me she said pray why would you be hiding in the branches i saw the sign of a wolf on the road the night before and thought better to sleep with the birds prudent she allowed know you the wolves enough to know it is best to stay out of reach of those longlegged rascals he says he is searching for our bran put in siarles impatient he did not care to wait for the pleasant talk to come round to its destination as is the way with the cymry he says he wants to offer his services does he now said angharad well then summon our lord and let us see how this cast falls out siarles hurried away to one of the larger huts in the centre of the holding by this time the children had been spreading the word that a stranger had come and folk were starting to gather they were not i observed an altogether comely group thin frayed and worn smudged around the edges as might be expected of people eking out a precarious life in deep forest few had shoes and none had clothes that were not patched and patched again at least two fellas in the crowd had lost a hand to norman justice one had lost his eyes a more hungry haunted lot i never saw nor hope to seelike the beggars that clot the doorways of the churches in the towns but where beggars are hopeless in their desperation these folk exuded the grim defiance of a people who exist on determination alone and all of them had the look id already noticed on the young ones an aspect of wary almost skittish curiosity as if drawn to the sight of the stranger in their midst they nevertheless were ready to flee at a word one quick move on my part and theyd bolt like deer or take wing like a flock of sparrows if your search be true the old woman told me you have naught to fear i thanked her for her reassurance and stood to my fate presently siarles returned from the house accompanied by a young man tall and slender as a rod but with a fair span of shoulders and good strong arms he wore a simple tunic of dark cloth trousers of the same stuff and long black riding boots his hair was so black the sun glinted blue in his wayward locks a cruel scar puckered the skin on the left side of his face lifting his lip in what first appeared to be a haughty sneeran impression only belied by the ready wit that darted from eyes black as the bottom of a well on a moonless night there was no doubt that he was their leader branthe man i had come to find if the right and ready homage of the ragged forest folk failed to make that clear you had only to take in the regal ease with which he surveyed all around him to know that here was a man well used to command his very presence demanded attention and he claimed mine without effort to the extent that at first i failed to see the young woman trailing behind him a fine darkhaired lady of such elegance and grace that though she was dressed in the same humble drab as the starvelings around her she held herself with such an imperious bearing that i took her to be the queen i present rhi bran lord of elfael said iwan speaking loud enough for all gathered round to hear pax vobiscum said the tall young man looking me up and down with a sweep of a quick intelligent eye gods peace my lord i replied in cymric offering him the courtesy of a bow i am william scatlocke former forester to thane aelred of nottingham hes come to offer his services siarles informed his lordship with a mocking tone to let his master know what he thought of the idea bran looked me over once again and finding no fault i think replied what kind of services do you propose william scatlocke anything you require i said from slaughtering hogs to thatching roofs sawing timber to pollarding hazel theres not much i havent done you said you were a forester mused bran and i saw the glint of interest in his glance aye i wasand a good one if i say it myself why did you quit thane aelred god bless him lost his lands in the succession dispute and was banished to daneland all his vassals were turned out by red william to fend for themselves most like to starve it was that grim the darkhaired young woman who had been peering from behind brans shoulder spoke up just then no wife or children nay my lady i replied as you see im a young man yet and hope burns bright still young or old a man needs a bit of wherewithal to keep even one small wife i smiled and gave her a wink to let her know i meant it lightly unamused she pressed her lips together primly ah well i was just scraping some of that wherewithal together when the troubles began most lost more than i did to be sure but i lost all the little i had i am sorry to hear it said bran but we are hardpressed here too what with the care of ourselves and the folk of elfael as well any man who would join us must earn his way and then some if he wants to stay then as if hed just thought of it he said a good forester would know how to use a longbow do you draw william i know which end of the arrow goes where i replied splendid we will draw against one another he declared win and you stay if i should lose his grin was sly and dark and full of mischief if you would stay then i advise you not to lose he said well what is it to be will you draw against me there seemed to be no way around it so i agreed that i will i said and found myself carried along in the sudden rushthe people to the contest and myself to my fate chapter obviously you won the contest says odo raising his sleepy head from his closenipped pen you think so do you i reply of course he assures me smugly otherwise you would not be here in count de braoses pit waiting to be hung for a traitor and an outlaw brother odo is feisty he must have got up on the wrong side of his hail marys this morning now monk i tell him just you try to keep your eyes open a little while longer and well get to the end of this and then see how good you are at guessing i settle myself on my mat of mildewed rushes and push the candle a little closer to my scribe read back the last thing i said quick now before i forget siarles iwan your bows says odo in rough imitation of my voice oh right and i resume the two foresters iwan and siarles handed rhi bran their longbows and taking one in either hand he held them out to me choose the one you will use my thanks i said trying first one and then the other bending them with my weight there was not a spit of difference between them but i fancied winning with siarless bow and chose that one this way everyone called bran already striding off towards the far side of the settlement we came to the head of a miserable patch of barley they were about growing a few pecks of grain for themselves but it was a poor sad field shadowed and soggy as it was the people ranged themselves in a wide double rank behind us and by now there were upwards of sixty folkmost all of the forest dwellers i reckoned saving a few of the women and smaller children the grain had been harvested and only stubble remained along with the straw man set up at the far edge of the clearing to keep the birds away the figure was fixed to a pole some eighty or a hundred paces from where we stoodfar enough to make the contest interesting three arrows the scarecrow will be our mark bran explained as iwan passed arrows to us both hit it if you can its been that long since i last drew i began no excuses said siarles quickly just do your best no shame in that i was not about making excuses i replied nocking the arrow to the string i was going to say its been that long since i last drew i almost forgot how good a yew bow feels in my hand this brought a chuckle or two from those gathered around turning to rhi bran i said where would you like this first arrow to go my lord head or heart either will do bran replied the arrow was on its way the instant the words left his mouth my first shaft struck the bunched tuft of straw that formed the scarecrows head with a satisfying swish as it passed through on its way to the far end of the field a murmur of polite approval rippled through the crowd i can see youve drawn a longbow before said bran once or twice lord bran drew and loosed sending his first shaft after mine and close enough to the same place that it made no matter the people cheered their lord with loud and lusty cries my lord i said i think you have drawn a bow once or twice yourself the heart this time he suggested as we accepted our second arrows from iwan if straw men have hearts i said drawing and taking good aim his has thumped its last this time i sent the shaft up at a slight arc so that it dropped neatly through the centre of the scarecrow and stuck in the dirt behind it your luck is with you today sniffed siarles as polite applause spattered among the onlookers not a bit of it i told him grinning that was so the lads wouldnt have to run so far to retrieve my arrow then i shall do likewise said bran and again drew and aimed and loosed so quickly that each separate motion flowed into the next and became one his arrow struck the scarecrow in the upper middle and stuck in the ground right beside mine again the people cheered heartily for their young king head and heart i said weve done for your man out there what else is left the pole on which he hangs said iwan handing over the last arrow the pole then asked bran raising an eyebrow the pole i confirmed well now the day was misty and grey as i say and the little light we had was swiftly failing now i had to squint a bit to even see the blasted pole jutting up like a wee nubbin just over the peak of the scarecrows straw head it showed maybe the size of a ladys fist and that gave me an idea turning to brans darkhaired lady i said my queen will you bless this arrow with a kiss queen she said recoiling i am not his queen thank you very much this was said with considerable vehemence yes vehemence odo my scribe has wrinkled his nose like hes smelled a rotten egg as he does whenever i say a word he doesnt understand it means well it means fire you knowpassion grit and brimstone i thought you said she was the queen objects odo that is because i thought she was the queen well was she or wasnt she he complains lifting his pen as if threatening to quit unless all is explained to his satisfaction forthwith and who is she anyway hold your water monk im coming to that i tell him and we go on this time we draw together said bran on my count ready i press the bow forward and bring the string to my cheek my eyes straining to the mark one two three i loosed the shaft on his three and felt the string lash my wrist with the sting of a wasp the arrow sliced through the air and struck the pole a little to one side my aim was off and the point did nothing more than graze the side of the pole the arrow glanced off to the left and careered into the brush beyond the tiny field bran however continued the count four he said and loosed just a beat after meenough i think so that he saw where my shaft would strike and then believe it or not he matched it just as my arrow had grazed the left side of the scarecrows pole so brans sheared the right he saw me miss and then missed himself by the same margin mind proud bowman that i was i could but stand humbled in the presence of an archer of unequalled skill turning to me with a cheery grin he said sorry william i should have told you it was four not three he put a friendly hand on my shoulder do you want to try again three or four it makes no matter i told him indicating the straw man i said it seems our weedy friend has survived the ordeal arrows gwion bach called bran and an eager young fella leapt to his command two other lads followed on his heels and the three raced off to retrieve the shafts iwan walked out to examine the scarecrow pole he pulled it up and brought it back to where we were waiting and he and angharad the banfaith scrutinized the top of the pole with siarles not to be left out pressing in between them judging by the notches made by the passing arrows announced the old woman after her inspection iwan and i say the one on the right has trimmed the most from the pole therefore we declare rhi bran the winner the people cheered and clapped their hands for their king and suddenly disheartened as the meaning of their words broke upon me i choked down my disappointment fastened a smile to my face and prepared to take my leave you know what this means said bran solemn as the grave i nodded the contest was fairall it wanted was a better day i lifted my eyes to his hoping to see some compassion there but where the moment before they had been alive with light and mirth his eyes were flat and cold could he change his demeanour so quickly you deserved better said the darkhaired lady i make no complaint i said it is a hard thing bran observed glancing at the young woman beside him but we do not always get what we want or deserve in this life sadly true my lord i agreed who should know that better than will scarlet i lowered my head and prepared to accept my defeat and as i did so i saw that he was not looking at me but at the young woman she was glaring at himwhy i cannot sayseeming to take strenuous exception to the drift of our little talk but sometimes william the forest king announced we get better than we deserve i looked up quickly and i saw a little of the warmth ebbing back into him i have decided you can stay it was said so quick i did not credit what i had heard my lord did you say i can stay he nodded providing you swear allegiance to me to take me as your lord and share my fortunes to the aid of my grellon and the oppressed folk of elfael that i will do gladly i told him let me kneel and i will swear my oath here and now did you hear that everyone his smile was suddenly broad and welcoming to me he said i would i had a hundred hardy men as right ready as yourselfthe ffreinc would be fleeing back to their ships and reckoning themselves lucky to escape with their miserable hides with that iwan beg pardon says odo interrupting again are we never to get this told i say with a sigh of resignation although i do not mind his questions as much as i let on for it lengthens the time that much more that word grellonwhat does it mean it is britspeak monk i tell him it means flocklike birds you know it is what the people of coed cadwand that means well thats a little more difficult it means something like guarding wood as if the forest was a fortress which in a way it is grellon murmurs odo as he writes the word sounding out the letters one by one coed cadw as i was saying grellon is what rhi brans people call themselves right can we move on at brother odos nod i continue so now iwan sent someone to fetch brans sword and i was made to kneel in the barley stubble and as the first drops of rain begin to fall upon my head i plighted my troth to a new lord the exiled king of elfael no matter that he was an outlaw hunted even then by every norman in the territory no matter that he had less in his purse than a wandering piper no matter that a fella could pace the length and breadth of his entire realm while singing heynonnynonny and finish before the song was done no matter any of it nor that to follow him meant i took my life in my own two hands by joining an outlaw band i knew in my heart that it was right to do if only to annoy the rough and overbearing normans and all their heavyhanded barbarian ways oh but it was more than that it felt right in my soul it seemed to me even as i repeated the words that would bind my life and fortunes to his that i had come home at last and when he touched my shoulder with his sword and raised me to my feet a tear came to my eye though i had never seen him or that forest settlement before and knew nothing of the people gathered close around it felt as if i was being welcomed into the fellowship of my own tribe and family and nothing that has happened since then in all our scraps and scrapes has moved me from that stand the rain began coming harder then and we all returned to the village your skill is laudable william said bran as we walked back together almost as good as your own said the lady falling into step beside him you may as well admit it bran your man william is as good with a bow as you are yourself just will if you please i told them william rufus has disgraced our common name in my eyes rufus bran laughed i have never heard him called that before it is common enough in england i replied willy conquerors second sonthe rakehell william now king over uswas often called rufus behind his back on account of his flaming torch of red hair and scalding hot temper his worthless brother duke robert is called curthose owing to his penchant for wearing short tunics thinking of those two neerdowell nobles made me that sorry for thane aelred who like all rightthinking men of his kind had thrown in his lot with robert the lawful heir to the throne alas robby shortshift turned out to be unreliable as a weathercock forever turning this way and that at the slightest breath of a favourable wind from each and any quarter that poor numbskull never could make up his mind and would never fully commit himself to any course nor stay one once decided he was a flighty sparrow but imagined himself a gilded eagle the shame of it is that he led so many good men to ruination aye the only time he really ever led of course red william held tight to the throne hed stolen from his brother and used the confusion over the successionconfusion he himself caused mindto further strengthen his grip after he seized the royal money mintery he had himself crowned king sat himself on the throne and decreed that what was in truth little more than a family disagreement had actually been a rebellious uprising and all those who supported sad brother robert were made out to be dangerous traitors lands were seized lives lost good men were banished and estates forfeited to the crown only a small handful of fortunekissed aristos came away scapegrace clean turning to the lady i said speaking of names now that ive given mine this is lady merian bran said she is our he hesitated hostage she put in quickly the way she mouthed the word with such contempt i could tell it was a sore point between them guest bran corrected lightly we are to endure the pleasure of her company for a little while longer it seems ransom me she said crisply or release me and your trial will be over my lord he ignored the jibe lady merian is the daughter of king cadwgan of eiwas the next cantref to the south bran keeps me against my will she added and refuses to set a price for my release even though he knows my father would pay good silver and god knows the people here could use it we get by replied bran amiably forgive my curiosity i said plunging in but if her father is only over in the next cantref why does he not send a host to take her back by force i lifted a hand to the patchedtogether little village we were entering just then i mean it would not take much to overwhelm this stronghold redoubtable as it is my father doesnt know where i am merian informed me and anyway it is all the barons fault i wouldnt be here if he had not tried to kill bran is that baron de braose i asked no she shook her head making her long curls bounce baron neufmarchehe is my fathers overlord bran took me captive when the baron turned traitor against him it is somewhat complicated offered bran with a rueful smile no contradicted merian it is simplicity itself all you need do is send a message to my father and the silver is yours when the time is right merian i will be sure of it i will thats what you always say she snipped to me she confided he always says thatits been a year and more and hes still saying it the way they talked a fellad thought they were a married couple airing a grudge nursed through long seasons of living together there was little hostility in it and instead i sensed a certain restraint and even a sort of backwards respect theyd had this discussion so often i suppose that the heat had gone out of it long ago and they were left with the familiar warmth of genuine affection forgive my asking but why was the baron trying to kill you my lord because he wants elfael said iwan coming up behind me no ffreinc usurper can ever sit secure on the throne while bran is alive elfael is a good place to stand if youre trying to conquer all cymru bran explained elfael may be small but it is a prize both de braose and neufmarche want to possess for their own de braose has it now but that could change aye said iwan firmly it will and one day soon in this i began to see the shape of the desperate necessity that had driven them into hiding as in england so in wales the welsh now faced what saxon england had suffered a generation ago the difference was that now the normans were far more numerous far better supplied and far more deeply entrenched in land and power than ever before restless industrious and determined as the day is long the norman overlords had stretched their long greedy fingers into every nook and cranny of life in the island of the mighty they are relentless constantly searching out and seizing whatever they want and often as not destroying the rest and now they had turned their attention to the hillfast lands beyond the march i would not have given an empty egg for wales chances of surviving the onslaught england in its strength with its massed war host and bold king harry leading the best warriors the land ever saw could not resist the terrible norman war machine what hope in hell did proud little wales ever have so now fool that i am i had joined my fate to theirs exchanging the freedom of the road and the life of a wandering oddjobber for certain death in a fight we could never win well thats will scarlet for youdoomed beginning and end oh but shed him no tearshe had himself a grand time between chapter castle truan a little more than a year had passed since baron william de braose decreed that a market town would be built within the borders of his newly seized lands in elfael in that short time the place had grown to respectable size already it was larger than glascwm the only other settlement worthy of a name in the region true the inhabitants had been moved in from the barons other estatessome from bramber and lands beyond the march and some from the barons lands in francefor unfortunately the local welsh shunned the place and refused to reside there that however did not detract from the pride that count falkes felt in what he reckoned a considerable achievement by any measure creating a town with a busy little market from a rundown worthless monastery housing a few doughty old monks one day thought falkes as he surveyed the tidy market square this town his town would rival monmouth or perhaps even hereford one day if he could just maintain order in the cantref and keep his uncle off his back baron de braose might have many good qualities but patience like a lame hound was lagging far to the rear of the pack falkes was only too aware that his uncle chafed at what he considered his nephews slow progress in the barons view the conquest of wales should have concluded long since it has been almost two years he had said last time falkes had visited him at bramber it was at the first of summer that the baron had invited him along with his cousin and closest friend the barons son philip on a hunting foray in the south of england the sunny open countryside of his uncles estate made a welcome change from grey damp wales falkes was enjoying the ride and basking in the warmth of a splendid summer day if not in his uncles good opinion two years said william de braose as they paused beneath an elm tree to rest the horses two years and what have we to show for it we have a town uncle falkes had pointed out a very fine town and if i may be so bold to suggest it has not been two years but only a little more than one since work began a townwilliam de braose turned a cold eye on his nephew a single town and an abbey added falkes helpfully casting philip a sideways glance the new church is almost finished indeed abbot hugo is hoping you will attend the consecration ceremony his uncle had allowed that while that was all well and good he had far grander plans than this solitary town elfael was still the only cantref he had conquered in the new territories and it was costing him more than he liked taxes are low he observed the money collected hardly pays the supply of the abbey the british are poor sire they are lazy no my lord it may be true they work less than the english granted falkes who was beginning to suspect his uncle entertained a faulty understanding of the britons but their needs are less they are a simple folk after all you should be more stern with them teach them to fear the steel in your hand it would not help replied falkes calmly killing them only makes them more stubborn as falkes had learned to his regret the slaughter of the ruling welsh king and his entire warbandwhile offering an immediate solution to the problem of conquering elfaelhad so thoroughly embittered the people against him that it made his position as ruler of the cantref exceedingly difficult and tenuous impose your will the baron insisted make them bend to your bidding if they refuse then do what i doknock some heads seize lands and property they own little enough as it is falkes pointed out most of them hold land in common and few of them recognise property rights of any kind money is little use to them they barter for what they need whenever i tax a man i am far more likely to be paid in eggs than silver eggs sneered his uncle i speak of taxes and you talk eggs it happens more often than you know declared falkes beginning to exhaust his own small store of patience what about this creature of yoursthis phantom of the forest what do they call it rhi bran y hud replied falkes it means king raven the enchanter the devil you say have you caught the rascal yet not yet confessed falkes sheriff de glanville is hopeful it is only a matter of time time roared the baron it has been two years man how much more time do you need father said earl philip speaking up just then may i suggest a visit to the commot see it for yourself you will quickly get the measure of elfael and you will see what falkes is making of the place a worthy suggestion philip the baron had replied curling the leather reins around his gloved fist as around the neck of an enemy but you know that is impossible i am away to rouen within the month if all goes well i should return before christmas i will speak to abbot hugo said falkes and we will hold the consecration at christmas rouen is where duke robert is encamped mused philip concern wrinkling his smooth brow what takes you there father then while the hounds and their handlers spread out across the field before them baron de braose had confided his plans to meet in secret with a few likeminded noblemen who were anxious to do something about the incessant fighting between the king and his brothers their silly squabble is costing us money that would be better spent on the expansion of our estates and the conquest of wales the baron fumed wiping sweat from his plump round face whenever one of them thumbs his nose at the other i have to raise an army and sail off to normandie or angevin to help the king slap down the knave ive had a bellyful of their feuding and fighting something must be done dangerous words father cautioned philip i would be careful about repeating any of that anywhere you never know who is listening phaw scoffed the baron i would tell rufus to his face if he were here the king must know how his noblemen feel no the situation is intolerable and something must be done something will be done by heaven philip and falkes exchanged a worried glance speech like this was dangerously close to treason king william who knew better than anyone else how little his nobles and subjects esteemed him viewed even the slightest wavering of support as disloyalty open disagreement was considered outright betrayal if the king learns of this secret societe he will not be best pleased philip pointed out you will all be condemned as traitors the king will not learn of it the baron boasted he drew off a glove and swatted at a fly buzzing before his face then dragged his blue linen sleeve across his forehead special measures have been taken we have appealed to the archbishop of rouen who has agreed to summon a council of noblemen concerning the papal succession the archbishop has recognised urban as pope declared philip unimpressed with this revelation as everyone knows yes granted his father but urbans position is faltering just now he is increasingly out of favour and clement occupies rome it would not take much to swing the balance his way is this what you propose to do throw the weight of the nobles behind clement for certain concessions the baron replied a papal ban on this continual family warring would be a good beginning the king would ignore any declaration the pope might makejust as his father always did scoffed philip comme le pere donc le fils the baron frowned and looked to falkes what say you count do you agree with my upstart son it is not my place to agree or disagree sire hmph snorted the baron in derision what good is that but if i might offer a suggestion continued falkes choosing his words carefully it seems to me that while it is true the king is likely to ignore any censure by the church were you to establish clement firmly on the throne of saint peter clement would be in a position to offer william certain benefits in exchange for a signed treaty of peace between the king and his brothers precisely agreed the baron is this not what i was saying to make good clements claim said philip you must first depose urban for good blood would flow it may not come to that replied the baron if it did que sera answered his father a drum began beating just then and baron de braose gazed out across the field to a clump of beech trees where the handlers were waiting if all goes well you will receive a sign before christmas i will send it with the winter supplies with that he put spurs to his mount and galloped away earl philip watched his fathers broad back his frown a scowl of displeasure a word beyond this field and we are dead men he muttered count falkes the baron called back to him when you catch this phantom raven of yours let me know i think id like to see him hang well thought falkes de braose as he rode into the town square we would all like to see king raven hang and hang he would there was no doubt about that but there were other more pressing matters on his mind than chasing down elusive thieves and anyway elfael had been quiet latelynot an incident in many months most likely the black bird and his band of thieves had been frightened away by the sheriff and was now raiding elsewheresomeplace where the purses were fatter and the pickings easier count falkes paused outside abbot hugos stonebuilt church it was a handsome building the abbot had spared no expense commanding the finest materials available and gathering the best masons and it showed the count had no great love for his abbot a haughty highhanded cleric who connived and conspired to get his way in everythingfrom the cloth of gold for the altar to the lead roof gleaming dully in the sun that very roof falkes paused to admire just now ordinary thatch was not good enough for hugo it had to be lead cast in heavy sheets in paris and shipped at great expense across the channel and then there was the stoneworkonly the most skilled stonecutters were allowed to work on the archway carvings producing the finest decoration money could buy at the church entrance falkes stopped to examine a few of the finished sculpturessome of the last to be finished a dragon with wings chasing its tail for eternity a centaur brandishing a sword a lion and horse intertwined in mortal combat aquarius the water man with his bucket and ladle an angel driving adam and eve from the garden a winged ox a mermaid rising from the waves clutching an anchor and more all of them contained in dozens of small stone plaques around the arch and on the pillars falkes traced the shapely outline of the mermaid with his finger he had to admit that the work was extraordinary but then so was the costand increasingly difficult to bear it meant among other things that he required constant support he was still far too dependent for his survival on regular supplies from his uncle true the largest part of the problem was the baron himself and his unquenchable zeal for conquest if baron de braose was prepared to build slowly to develop the land and settle the people count falkes had no doubt that elfael and the territories west could eventually be made to yield untold wealth but the baron was not willing to wait and falkes had to bear the brunt of his uncles impatiencejust as he had to endure the umbrage of the abbot whose spendthrift ways could well ruin them all falkes entered the church cool and dim inside it breathed an air of quiet serenity despite the steady chink of chisel on stone he stood for a moment and watched the two masons on the wooden scaffold dressing the capitals of one of the pillars one of them was carving what looked like a bear and the other a bird you there shouted falkes his voice loud in the quiet of the sanctuary what is your name the masons stopped their work and turned to look down at the count striding down the centre of the nave me sire i am ethelric what is that you are carving ethelric a raven sire replied the sculptor pointing to the leafy bough issuing from the face carved into the top of the pillar you can tell by the beak sire remove it sire asked the mason bewilderment wrinkling his brow remove it at once i do not wish to see any such images in this church the second stonecarver on the scaffold spoke up begging your pardon sire but the abbot has approved of all the work we are doing here i do not care if the king himself has approved it i am paying for it and i do not want it remove the hideous thing at once there you are count falkes exclaimed abbot hugo moving up the nave to take his place beside the count his white hair was neatly curled beneath a fine cloth cap and his robe was glistening white satin i saw your horse outside and wondered where you had gone glancing at the two stonecarvers on the scaffold he nodded to them to get back to work and taking the count by the arm led falkes down the aisle well let these men get on with their work shall we but see here protested the count come there is something i wish to show you said the abbot surging ahead the work is going well we have years of construction still before us of course but the building will soon be serviceable im contemplating a consecration ceremony on the eve of all souls what do you think of that i suppose agreed falkes diffidently although baron de braose will not be likely to attend but see here that carving in there the abbot opened the door and stepped out why not he asked turning back he looped his arm through the counts and walked him into the market square i would very much like the baron to attend in fact i insist he must see what we have achieved here it is his triumph as much as my own he must attend i agree of course said falkes however the baron is away in france and not expected to return much before christmas pity sniffed the abbot none too distraught then we will simply wait it will give us time to finish more of the corbels and capitals that is what i wanted to speak to you about abbot said falkes who went on to explain that his treasury was all but depleted and there would be no more funds to pay the workers i sent a letter to the baronand it like everything else awaits his return from france abbot hugo stopped walking what am i to do until then the men must be paid they cannot wait until christmas the work must continue the work must go on if we are ever to see the end of it that is as may be granted the count but there is no money to pay them until the baron returns can you not borrow from somewhere do you really need cloth of gold to dress the altar the abbot pursed his lips in a frown you said you wished to show me something said falkes this way said the abbot they walked across the empty market square to what was left of the former monastery of llanelli on whose ruins the town was being raised the modest chapter house had been enlarged to provide adequate space for the abbots needswhich so it appeared to falkes were greater than his own though he had a score of knights to house inside what had been the refectory was now the abbots private living quarters i have drawn plans for the abbey garden and fields the abbot said placing a rolled parchment in the counts hands some wine you are too kind said falkes unrolling the skin he carried it to the rooms single window and held it to the light the outline of the town was a simple square and the fields indicated by long narrow parallel lines seemed to be some distance from the town and almost twice as large as llanelli itself what are you thinking of growing flax mostly replied the abbot and barley of course we will use what we need and sell the surplus with such a great extent of fields said the count you will surely have a surplus but i am wondering who will work these fields for you the monks abbot hugo handed him a cup of wine how many monks do you reckon you will need as to that replied the abbot with a smile i estimate that i can make do with no fewer than seventyfive to begin seventyfive cried falkes by the virgin if you had said thirty i would have thought that was fifteen too many why do you need so many to carry on the work of saint martin falkes turned an incredulous gaze upon the abbot who still smiling sipped his wine and continued it is ambitious i confess but we must begin somewhere saint martins you cannot imagine said the abbot that we would continue to call our new norman abbey by its old heathen welsh name in fact i have prepared a letter to the pope requesting a charter to be drawn up in the name labbaye de martin de saint dans les champs at the mention of the pope falkes rolled up the parchment and handed it back to the abbot saying you would be well advised to hold onto that letter a little longer abbot chapter king ravens greenwood refuge served in most respects as a village for those forced to call it home deep in the forest king ravens flock had carved out a clearing below the protecting arm of a stony ridge at great effort they had extended the natural glade to include a pitiful little field for barley a sorry bean patch and one for turnips they had dragged together bits of this and that for their huts and crude shelters and the pens for their few scrawny animals there was a patchedtogether tun which served as a granary for storing a scant supply of grain and a seeping pool at the foot of the rock scarp that served them for a well in the days following the archery contest i came to see the place in a little better light than had greeted me on first sight but that ent saying much for it did seem that a lorn and lonely air hung over the placethe vapour of suffering produced by the folk whose lives were bound to this perilous perch no one was here who had hope of a better life elsewheresaving maybe only myself now a right fair forester like myself might find living in such a place no great hardship for a few weeks or even months but even i would be screaming to get free long before a year had come round and these poor folk had endured it for more than a yeara tribute i suppose to lord bran and his ability to keep the flame of hope burning in their hearts i greatly wondered how they could keep such a place hidden all the more since there was a bounty on rhi brans head the barons reward had been set at a price and it kept on creeping up higher and higher as king ravens deeds became more outrageous and damaging to the de braose interests the reward was enough to make me wonder how far some poor fellas loyalty might stretch before it snapped like a rotten rope i also wondered how long it would be before one of the sheriff s search parties stumbled upon cel craidd yet as i settled in amongst my new friends i soon learned that the location was well chosen to confound discovery to find it would take a canny and determined forester well trained to the march which the baron did not possess beyond that the folk worked hard to keep their home secret they contrived everything from confusing the trails to sowing rumours specially concocted for norman ears and sending spies among the folk of elfael and castle truan they kept perpetual watch on the kings road and the forest approaches round about marking the movements of all who came and went through the march also call me tetched if you willi came to believe there was something supernatural in it too like in the old legends where the weary traveller comes upon a village hidden among the rocks on the seacoast he sups there with the local folk and lays him down to sleep in a fine feather bed only to wake raw the next morn with sand in his eyes and seaweed in his hair and the village vanished never to be found again until it pleases its protectors to show itself to the next footsore wanderer i arrived at this odd belief after several curious encounters with banfaith angharad they called her hudolion it means enchantress odo thank you for interrupting ah it is the same as hud no he says the glint of understanding briefly lighting up his dull eyes enchant yes from the same word i tell him and it is pronounced hood so see you set it down aright my leg is on fire again today it pains me ferocious and i am in no mind to suffer odos irritating ways i watch as he bends his nose to the scrap of parchment and scratches away for a moment so now i say while were about it his name is not robin as you would have it his name is rhi branthat is king bran to you rhi is the word for king yes you told me already he intones wearily and branit is the same as raven no yes the word is the same rhi branking raven see it is the same i will have you speaking like a welshman yet odo my lad i give him a painsharp smile just like a trueborn son of the black country odo frowns and dips his pen you were telling me about angharad he says and we resume our meandering march indeed angharad was wise in ways beyond measure accomplished in many artssome now all but lostshe could read signs and portents and as easily as a child tastes rain on the wind she could foretell the shape of things to come long before they arrived old she was ancient wreathed in wrinkles and bent low beneath the weight of years she appeared to the unsuspecting eye merely one more old soul awaiting elijahs chariot but the eyes in her head were bright as baubles her mind was quick and keen restless as a wave on the strand and deep as that selfsame sea if she sometimes shuffled in her shapeless dress her mind leapt lightfooted and deerlike yet she never rushed never strove was never seen to be straining after anything whatever she needed seemed to come to her of its own accord and if betimes their elders grew uncomfortable in her presence the children always found peace and comfort in those stout arms she was as i say adept in all manner of curious arts and it is through one of these or another that i suspect she purposed to keep cel craidd concealed from all intruders how she did it i have never yet discovered but i know the old ones put great store in what they called the caima saining charm you might say useful for protection against many dangers threats and ills something like this must protect king ravens roost then again it may be i that am that big a fool and there is no such thing i soon came to regard our banfaith not as a doddering spindleshanked hag but as the very life and spirit of cel craidd her soul was deep and gentle and blessed her wisdom true as the arrow from brans unerring bow her will resilient as heartwood and stronger than iron from the flutter of the first dove of morning to the hushed feathersweep of the midnight owl nothing eluded her notice the reach of her restless searching senses ranged over her forest stronghold and far far beyond at times i do believe they reached right into the very castles of the norman barons one particular occasion taught me to respect her judgement however queer that judgement might seem at first blush well a fine dry winter had set in i had been some weeks with the forest tribe learning their ways and getting to know the folk right well i helped in the fields to gather in the paltry root crop i chopped firewood by the wagonload i helped slaughter two of the three pigs and salt and smoke the meat to keep over the winter i also turned my hand at building two new hutsone for a family that had come a week or so earlier than myself and one for a young widow and her wee daughter rescued from count falkess marauders and their hounds mostly however i went hunting with iwan siarles and one or two of the other men occasionally bran would join us more often iwan led the party siarles whose skills as a forester were greater even than my own always served as guide since he knew the greenwood well where the deer would be found around which bend the pigs would appear or when the birds would flock or fly a good and worthy huntsman uncanny in his own way he made sure we rarely returned emptyhanded from the chase to be sure it was desperate huntingwe brought back game or we went hungry in all these things i was tested in small ways and never openly still through a word or gesture or a glance exchanged i soon came to understand that while they accepted my presence among them they did not wholly trust me yet they were testing both my abilities and mettle as well as my honour this was only natural i know for a folk whose lives depended on remaining out of sight the barons spies were everywhere and the abbot was a wily relentless foe king raven lived or died on the loyalty of his flock even as they lived or died with him so they watched and they tested far from begrudging them their doubt i welcomed every opportunity to prove myself whats that odo strayed from the point you say lately our odo has taken to interrupting me whenever he thinks i have wandered too far afield and may not be able to make it back to the place of my departure so he checks me with a word or two perhaps i allow but it is all of a piece you see that is as may be he says rubbing his bald priest patch but you were speaking of an incident that ahhe scans his scribbled scriptaught you to trust angharads wisdom right you are odo lad so i was well then where was i the days were growing dimmer and a fine dry winter had set in he resumes writing and we go on one morning a few days before christmas i heard the call of a raven but thought nothing of it until i saw people hurrying to the bare circle of earth beneath the tree they called council oak will come join us called iwan it is the summons angharad was there wrapped head to foot in her cloak although the day was mild enough for that time of year and the sun low in the southern sky was bright standing beside her was a small boy id seen him before darting here and there about the place always moving never still he seemed a clever curious child and a favourite of brans among the youngsters gwion bach has news from elfael she announced when bran had taken his place count falkes is expecting winter supplies from his uncle the baron the wagons are to arrive any day is it known what is coming asked bran grain and wine cloth and such she replied glancing at the boy who gave a slight nod and some things for the abbots new church any day mused bran not much time none to lose agreed the hudolion then we must hurry if we are to make ready a warm welcome for them bran was already moving towards his hut iwan siarles to me he paused in midstep turned and regarded me as if weighing the prudence of taking an untried hound ahunting with the pack i sensed his reluctance and guessed what he was thinking my lord i stand ready to lend both hand and heart to whatever command you give me indicating young gwion bach who was following in his lords footsteps i said but if even children serve you in this fight then perhaps you would not deny a willing elder to aid you in your purpose he nodded once deciding it then and there come along will join us rhi bran angharad called after him one thing moresomething else comes with the wagons yes there will be snow she said gathering her robe around her more tightly bran accepted this without hesitation but i had not yet learned to honour these utterances with unquestioning belief unable to help myself i glanced up at the sky bright and fine and not the least smudge of a cloud to be seen anywhere the amused expression on my face must have given me away for as i stood looking on bran called to me whatwill could it be that you doubt our good banfaiths word nay lord i replied softening his accusation let us rather say that it will be the first time ive seen snow from a clear blue sky hmph sniffed angharad muttering as she stumped away these old bones know snow when they feel it i followed bran to his hut and took my place alongside the other two iwan seemed comfortable enough with my presence but siarles did not appear to prize it much even so i was there at the kings pleasure so there was nothing to be said or done it seems the baron in his boundless generosity is sending us a christmas blessing bran said we must make ready to receive it with all good grace the other two grinned at the thought and all three began planning how best to greet the supply wagons when they passed through the forest on their way to castle truan i listened to their talk keeping my own counselas i was yet a little uncertain what manner of outlawry i had fallen into every now and then the name king raven arose in their discussion it was the first time i had heard the name used among them in just this way it was bran himself they meant and yet all three spoke of him as if it were someone else finally after this had gone on awhile i asked pardon my ignorance lord but are you not king raven of course replied bran as you already know to be sure i said but why when you speak the name do you say he will go or when he calls and the like if it is yourself you mean bran laughed iwan answered it is bran and not bran see again i must beg pardon but that makes no sense to this dull head at all bran is king raven siarles explained giving me a superior smile but king raven is not bran sorry i shook my head i may be slow of wit god knows but it still seems nonsense to me bran said then youll just have to wait and see well we spent most of the day planning the welcome for the barons supply train while they talked about all they would do i still had little real idea what to expect save for my part in the proceedings which amounted to little more than watching the road and being ready with a bow in case events did not fall out as predicted a few of the grellon were involved but not many and none of them was given duty at the sharp end bran siarles and iwan assumed the greatest risk and made particular efforts to keep the people both out of sight and out of danger as much as possible oh but it would be dangerous there was no avoiding that chapter it was an odd thing everyone scurrying around like ants in the rainthe children dragging wood into heaps near the door of each hut and the women bundling foodstuffs and the men drawing water and snugging the sheltersall labouring under a clear bright sky to prepare for snow the only hint of which was a twinge in an old womans bones while the rest of us were taking such measures against the coming storm iwan and siarles went to spy out the best place for the welcome we did not know how many soldiers would come with the wagons nor how many wagons there might be but iwan and siarles knew the road and knew where an ambush might succeed they were gone all that short winters day returning at dusk upon arrival they went directly to our lords hut tired from the days work i settled by the common fire where a stew pot was bubbling to warm myself and wait for the food to be served you were busy all day observed a woman nearby i was that i turned to see merian bundled in her cloak taking her place on the log beside me my lady i give you good greeting you didnt go with the others she observed no there was enough to be done here they only went to see where the wagons might pass to see where the wagons might be attacked she corrected that is what you mean yes i suppose that is my meaning she made a small tut of disapproval you do not agree with the king in this whether i agree or not makes no difference she replied crisply the point is that bran will never achieve peace with the baron if he insists on raiding and thieving it only angers the baron and provokes him and the count to ever more cruel reprisals you are right of course i agreed but from where i stand i dont see rhi bran making peace with the baron or the count either one he wants to punish them he wants the return of his throne she corrected crisply and he will not achieve it by plundering a few supply wagons no perhaps not there she said as if she had won a victory herself you agree you see what must be done my lady you must talk to bran and persuade him to change his mind about the raid me i said i cannot i dare not why she said turning her large dark eyes on me it is not my place i would have thought it the place of any rightthinking man to help his lord whenever he can certainly if you saw him sticking his hand in a nest of vipers you would warn him i regarded her closely before answering my lady please i said i cannot do as you ask iwan might and i daresay siarles would risk it but will here cannot i do beg your pardon she lifted one slender shoulder and sighed oh very well it was worth a try do not think poorly of me will scarlet it is just that she paused to find the right word i get so vexed with him sometimes he will not listen to me and i dont know what else to do i accepted this in silence stretching my hands towards the flames i know he will get himself killed one day she continued after a time if the sheriff catches him or one of the barons men bran is as good as dead before the sun sets you worry about him truly i do so worry she confided i do not think i could bear losing him again again she nodded growing pensive it was just after the ffreinc came to elfael the kingbrans father lord brychanhad been killed and all the warband with him only iwan survived she went on to describe how bran had been seized and taken hostage by count falkes and how he had fled the cantref he might have made good his escape but he stopped to help a farmer and his wife who were being attacked by the counts rogues he fought them off but others came and gave chase they caught him and he was wounded and left for dead she paused adding in a softer voice word went out that he had been killed and so i thought everyone thought he had been killed i only learned the truth very much later she drew breath as if there was more she would say but thought better of it just then for she fell silent instead how did bran survive i asked after a moment angharad found him she explained and brought him back to life he has lived in the forest ever since i considered this it explained the curious bond i sensed between the old woman and the young man and the way in which he honoured her i thought on this for a time content in the silence and the warmth of the flames he wont always live in the forest i said more to have something to say and so prolong our time together no she replied glancing sideways at me she was kneading her fingers before the fire and the flames made her eyes shine bright why he intends to win back his throne you said so yourself just now when that happens i expect we will all bid the forest a fond faretheewell but that will never happen she insisted does no one see the baron is too strong his wealth too great he will never let elfael go am i the only one who sees the truth she shook her head sadly what bran wants is impossible well i said i wouldnt be too sure i have seen the lone canny fox outwit the hunter often enough to know that it matters little how many horses and men you have all the wealth and weapons in the world will not catch the fox that refuses to be caught she smiled at that which surprised me do you really think so gods truth my lady that is exactly what i think thank you for that she smiled again and laid her hand on my arm i am glad you are here will just then the first fresh flakes of snow arrived one brushed her forehead and caught on her dark eyelashes she blinked and looked up as the snow began to fall gently all around god help me i did not look at the snow i saw only merian is she odo wants to know his question brings me out of a reverie and i realise ive drifted off for some moments is she what lad i ask is she very beautifulas beautiful as they say oh lad she is all that and more it is not her face or hair or fine noble bearingit is all these things and more she is a right fair figure of a woman and i will trounce the man who slanders her good name she was born to be a queenand if there is a god in heaven that is what she will be pity sniffs odo with men like you to protect her i wouldnt give a rats whisker for her chances most likely shell share the noose with your rhi bran oh this makes me angry listen you little pus pot of a priest i say my voice low and tight this ent finished yet not by a long walk so if you have any other clever ideas like this keep em under your skirt tired of him of my confinement sick of the pain that burns in my wounded leg i lean back on my filthy pallet and turn my face away odo is silent a moment as well he should be then says sorry will i did not mean to offend you i only meant it makes no matter i tell him read back where we left off he does and we go on the snow fell through the night we awoke to a thick layer of white fluff over the forest branches dragged down and saplings bent low beneath the weight of cold wet snow our little village of lowroofed huts lay almost hidden beneath this shroud early yet the sun was just rising as we gathered our gear and made our final preparations after a quick meal of black bread curds and apples we gathered to receive our marching orders here said siarles handing me what appeared to be a bundle of rags covered with bark and twigs and leaf wrack put this on taking the bundle i shook it out and held it up before me a cloak i asked none too certain of my guess long ragged duncoloured things with all manner of forest ruck sewn on they looked like the pelt of some fantastical woodland creature born of tree and fern we wear these when moving about the forest he said pulling a similar garment around his shoulders good protection folkwhether twolegged or fourare difficult enough to see in dense wood this any forester will tell you for nothing wearing these cloaks a fella would be wellnigh impossible to see even for eyes trained in tracking game along tangled pathways through dense brush in the dim or faulty light that is the forest nevertheless bless me for a dunce i saw a flaw in the plan it has snowed i said you noticed replied siarles oh youre a shrewd one no mistake he indicated a basket into which the others were digging get busy the basket was filled with scrags of sheeps wool birch bark and scraps of bleached linen and such which we fixed to the distinctive hooded cloaks of the grellon quickly adapting them for use in the snow one of the men tomasa slender lightfooted little welshmanhelped me with mine then set it on my shoulders just right and adjusted the hood as i drew the laces tight i did the same for him and iwan passed among us with bow staves strings and bags of arrows i tucked the strings into the leather pouch at my belt and slung the bag upon my back at brans signal we fell in behind iwan and tried our best to keep up with his great groundcovering stride no easy chore in the best of times it was made more difficult still by the snow after a while we came to a place beneath the great overhanging limbs of oak and ash and hornbeam where the path was wide and still mostly dry i found myself walking beside tomas once in hereford a man told me a tale about abbot hugo losing his gold candlesticks to king raven i said opening a question that had been rumbling around in my skull for some time now is it true at all aye tis true tomas assured me mostly which part pardon my asking what did you hear he countered there were twenty wagons full of gold and silver church treasure they saidand all of it under guard of a hundred mounted knights and menatarms they say king raven swooped down killed the soldiers with his fiery breath and snatched away the gold candlesticks to use in unholy devil rites i told him thats what i heard we did stop the wagons and help lighten the load replied the welshman and there was some gold yes and the candlesticksthats true enough but there were never a hundred knights twenty more like put in siarles who had overheard us talking aye only twenty confirmed iwan joining in and there werent but three oxcarts still we got more than seven hundred marks in that one raid not counting the candlesticks and how much since then i asked thinking i had come into a most gainful employment a little here and there said siarles nothing much only some pigs and a cow or two now and then put in iwan aye any that wander too close to the forest said tomas thems ours but the way people talk youd think the raids were tenaday you cant help the way people talk iwan said we might stop the odd wagon betimes to remind folk to respect king ravens wood but there was only the one big raid what did you do with all the money we gave it away said tomas a note of pride in his voice gave it to bishop asaph to build a new monastery all of it most of it agreed iwan placidly we still have a little kept by thing is said siarles silver coin isnt all that useful in the forest we give out what is needful to the folk of elfael to help keep body and soul together i had heard this part of the tale too but imagined it merely wishful thinking on the part of those telling the story it seemed however the generosity of rhi bran the hud was true even if the greater extent of his notorious activities was not just the one big raid why so two good reasons iwan replied it is flamin dangerous put in siarles to be sure said iwan it does no one any good if we are caught or killed in a needless fight neither did we want the ffreinc to become so wary they would make the escorts too large to easily defeat or change the route the wagons followed siarles said the slight edge to his tone suggested that he did not altogether agree with the caution of his betters as a result continued iwan the ffreinc have grown lax of late because they have passed through the forest without trouble these many months they think they can come and go at will now today we will remind them who allows them this right such prudence i thought they would not spend themselves except for great and certain gain nor kill the goose that laid the silver eggs meanwhile they watched and waited for those chances worthy of their interest am i to take it that todays supply train is of sufficient value to make a raid worth the risk that is what we shall soon discover iwan surged on ahead and it was all we could do to keep up with him finally as the unseen sun stretched toward midday we came in sight of the kings road here we stopped and bran addressed us and delivered his final instructions my own part was neither demanding nor all that dangerous so long as things went according to plan i was to work my way along the road to a position a little south of the others there to lie in wait for the supply train i was to keep out of sight and be ready with my bow if anything went amiss just before he sent us to our places bran said let no one think we do this for ourselves alone we do it for elfael and its longsuffering folk and may god have mercy on our souls amen chapter amen we pledged our lives with our kings and then stood for a moment listening to the hush of a woodland subdued beneath the falling snow and there was that much to goad a fella to reflection some or all of us might be dead before the days journey had run and theres a thought to make a man think twice you heard him lads be about your work said iwan and we all scattered into the forest i moved a few dozen paces along the roadside and found a place behind the rotting bole of a fallen pine it lay atop the slight rise of a bank overlooking the road below with a clear view ahead to the place where our rude welcome would commence trying not to disturb the snow too much i cleared me a place and heaped up some dry leaves and pine branches and lay my bowstave lengthwise along the underside of the pine trunk where it would be somewhat protected from the snow and ready to hand then i hunkered down amongst the boughs and bracken i need not have worried about leaving too many telltale signs for the snow kept falling gradually becoming heavier as the morning wore on by midday the tracks wed made had been filled in removing any traces of disturbance all the world lay beneath a clean unbroken breast of glimmering white i sat and watched the flakes spin down snow on snow and still it fell the day passed in silence and aside from a few birds and squirrels i saw no movement anywhere near the road all remained so quiet i began to think that the soldiers guarding the supply train had thought better of continuing their journey and decided to lay up somewhere until the snow stopped and travel became easier maybe little gwion bach had it wrong and the wagons were not coming at all the daylight never bright began to falter as the snow fell thicker and faster warm as a cock in a dovecot under my cloak i dozed a little the way a hunter will alert though his eyes are closed and passed the time in my halfsheltered nook and awakened to the smell of smoke i looked around nothing had changed the road was still empty there was no sign of anyone passing or having passed the snow was still falling in soft clumping flakes the light was dimmer now the winter day fading quickly into an early gloom and then i heard it the light jingle of a horses tack i fished a dry string from my pouch and was rigging the bow before the sound came again i shook the snow off from the bag of arrows and opened it bless me there were nine black arrows insideblack from crow feather to iron tip i placed four of them upright along the trunk of the tree in front of me and blew gently on my hands to steady and warm them oh a fella can get a bit cramped waiting in the snow i tried to loosen my stiff limbs a little without making too much commotion the sound came again and again the faint whiff of smoke i had no time to wonder at this for at that same instant two riders appeared the snow softened all sound but the jingle of the tack as they rode and the hooves of their horses breaking a path in the snow big menknightsthey loomed larger still in their padded leather jerkins and long winter cloaks which covered their mail shirts helmeted and gauntleted their shields were on their backs and their lances were tucked into the saddle carriers their swords were sheathed they passed quietly up the road and out of sight i counted slow beats until those following them should arrive but none came after i waited after a time the first two returned hastening back the way they had come when they reached a place just below my overlook one of the riders stopped and sent the other on ahead while he tarried there scouts i thought wary they were and right prudent to be so the soldier below me was so close i could smell the damp horsehair scent of his mount and see the steam puff from the animals nostrils and rise from its warm sodden rump i kept my head low and remained dead still the while as would a hunter in the deer blind in a moment i heard the jingle of horses tack once more and the second rider reappeared this time eight mounted soldiers followed in his wake all of them joined the first knight who ordered the lot to take up positions along either side of the road so now these were not complacent fools they had identified the hollow as potentially dangerous and were doing what they could to pare that danger to a nub as the last soldier took his place the first wagon hove into view a highsided wain like that used to carry hay and grain it was pulled by a double team of oxen its tall wheels sunk deep in the snowcovered ruts of the kings road and though the wagon bed was covered against the snow it was plain to a blind man by the way the animals strained against the yoke that the load was heavy indeed within moments of the first wain passing a second followed the oxen plodded slowly along their warm breath fogging in the chill air the falling snow settling on their broad backs and on their patient heads between wideswept horns no more appeared the oxwains trundled slowly down between the double ranks of mounted knights and that hint of smoke tickled my nostrils againnor was i the only one this time no mistake the soldiers horses caught the scent too and came over all jitteryskittery they tossed their fine big heads and whinnied chafing the snow with hooves the size of bleedingbowls the soldiers were not slow to notice the fuss their mounts were making the knights looked this way and that but nothing had changed in the forest round about no danger loomed as the first wain reached the far end of the corridor i caught a flicker of yellow through the trees a glimmering wink o light just that quick and gone again with it there came a searing screeching whine like the sound an arrowstruck eagle might make as it falls from the sky the short hairs on my arms and neck stood up to hear it and i looked around in that selfsame moment one of the scouts horses screamed and broke ranks the stricken animal reared and plunged its legs kicking out every direction at once the rider was thrown from the saddle and as he scrambled to regain control of his mount the animal reared again and went over falling onto its side the other knights watched but held firm and made no move to help the fella they were watching still when there came another keening shriek and another horse rearedthis one on the other side of the long double rank as with the first animal the second leapt and plunged and tried to bolt but the rider held it fast as the poor beast whirled and screamed i chanced to see what none of the soldiers had yet seen sticking from the horses flank low behind the saddle was the feathered stub of a black arrow the knight yelled something to the soldier nearest him my little bit of the frankish tongue serves me well enough most times but i could not catch hold of what he said he flung out a beseeching hand as the horse beneath him collapsed another soldier in the line gave out a cryand all at once his horse likewise began to rear and scream kicking its hind legs as if to smite the very devil and his unseen legions before abody could say saint geralds jowls three more horsestwo on the far side of the road and one on the near sideheaved up and joined in that dire and dreadful dance the terrified animals crashed into one another bucking and lashing throwing their riders one of the beasts bolted into the wood the others fell thrashing in the snow it was then one of the knights caught sight of what was causing all this fret and flurry an arrow sticking out from the belly of a downed horse with a loud cry he drew his sword and called upon his fellows to up shields and hunker down his shouts went unheeded for the other knights were suddenly fighting their own mounts the poor brutes already frightened by the scent of smoke and blood and the sight of the other animals flailing around broke and ran the soldiers could no longer hold their terrified mounts the wagon drivers fearful and shaking in their cloaks had long since halted their teams the commander of the guardone of the two fellas i had first seenspurred his mount into the middle of the road and began shouting at his men black arrows cut his horse from under him just that quick and he had to throw himself from the saddle to avoid being crushed dragging himself to his feet he shouted to his men once more trying to rally them to his side then over and above the shouts and confusion there arose a cry from the wood the like of which i had never heard before the tortured shriek of a creature enraged and in terrible agony and it echoed through the trees so that no one could tell whence it came the sound faded into a tense and uneasy silence the norman soldiers put hands to their weapons turning this way and that ready to defend themselves against whatever might come the screech rang out again closer this timedevilishly closeand if possible even louder and angrier three more horses went down and the last followed in turn now all the knights were afoot their mounts dead or dying oh but it was a sorrowful sightthose proud destriers flailing away in the bloodred snow it fair brought a sorry tear to the eye to see such fine animals slaughtered i can tell you the commander of the knights summoned his soldiers to him they seized their lances and hastened to join their commander backtoback weapons drawn they formed a tight circle and waited behind their long pointed shields for the next flight of cursed black arrows for a moment all was quiet save for the quick breathing of the men and the neighing of the wounded horses and then i saw a clump of snow fall from an elm branch overhead sending a glistening curtain of down upon the road when the frozen dust settled there he was king raven black as satans tongue from the crown of his head to booted feet and covered all over with feathers great wings outspread with long curving claws on the ends but the thing which gave him the look of the pit was the absolutely smooth round skulllike face with its wide hollow eyes and unnaturally long sword of a beak king ravenit could be none other the knights saw this phantom creature and shrank back at the sight i forgave them their fright i felt it too indeed it seemed as if the day already cold and dim grew cold and dark as the grave in the moment of his appearing that dread beak rose slowly until it pointed straight up toward the dense webwork of snowladen branches and boughs the creature loosed another of its horrific cries as if in reply i saw a bright flicker in the air and a flaming brand landed in the snow midway between king raven and the cowering knights another joined the firstmore or less the same distance from the knights but behind them then a third fell behind the secondto the left of the huddled body of knights this time a fourth fell among the others on the opposite side of the third i saw it arc high through the surrounding trees and before it had even touched the ground three more were in the air the knights stunned and lifeless with disbelief were ringed about with fire the torches sputtered in the snow sending thick black smoke boiling up through the downdrifting flakes so far all had fallen out as planned and i imagined we would escape clean away with the goods but bad luck has a knack for catching a fella when he least can abide it even as our numb fingers reached for victory ill fortune arrived in the person of abbot hugo dressed in a white satin robe with white leather boots and a woollen cloak of rich dark purple he appeared more king than cleric as he came galloping into the clearing with him was marshal guy de gysburne commanding a small company of oafish louts spoiling for a fight truth be told at the time i did not know who these men might be though i would be learning soon enough all i knew was that they had come to the banquet as guests uninvited and had to be driven off before one or another of our folk got hurt well they burst into the clearing weapons drawn ready to start lopping heads and making corpses eight soldiers not counting the abbot broke into the ring of torches guy all in mail and leather greaves and gorget charged ahead on a pale grey destrier he took one look at the blackfeathered phantom reared up in the saddle and let fly with his lance king raven darted lightly to the side as the spear sailed past easily evading the throw even as i nocked one of the black arrows onto the string and holding my breath drew and aimed at the marshal someone else had the same idea out from the brushwood beside the trail streaked an arrow it blazed across the clearing struck guy and slammed him backwards in the saddle as he reached to draw his sword that reaching saved his life i think the arrow pierced the steel rings of his hauberk at the fleshy part of his upper arm and stuck there if he had been more upright in the saddle hed have had it in his bonnet as it was he dropped the sword and called his men to shield themselves as the arrows began falling thick and fast three men went down before they could unsling their shields and a fourth took an arrow in the back the instant he swung it around to protect his chest they fell like stones dropped in a well abbot hugo shouting in ffreinc drove into the clearing heedless of the missiles flying around him well i suppose killing a priest is serious businessnorman or noand hugo maybe felt safe even with men falling all around him or it may be he is that brave or stupid even so he was urging the knights and menatarms to throw off their fear and attack but that showed no understanding of the nature of the assault a fella afoot cannot strike what he cannot see and a warrior on a horse cannot charge into the brush and brake if he hopes to live out the day the soldiers on foot drew together trying to form a shield ring to give them protection from the whistling death all around i loosed two and made good account of myself so that by now any soldier still in the saddle threw himself to the ground even as his horse was slaughtered beneath him those who somehow escaped being skewered with an oaken shaft scuttled on hands and knees to join the others as arrow after arrow slammed into the shield wall splintering the wood ripping the leathercovered panels apart striking with the force of heavy hammers i sent two more arrows to join those of the others the commander of the knights showed heart if not brains he struggled to his feet and shield thrown high to protect his head broke ranks charging off in the direction of the main attack he made but four steps from the ring before an arrow found him there was a thin whisper as it cut through the snowclotted air i caught the dull glimmer of the metal headand then the knight was lifted off his feet and thrown back a pace by the shock of the oaken missile driving into his chest he was dead before his heels came to rest in the snow marshal guy clutching his arm with the slender shaft sticking out both sides of the wound gave his thumping great warhorse his head and the animal charged the blackcloaked phantom standing in the trail at the far end of the clearing king raven stood motionless for a moment allowing the beast and wounded rider to come nearer lifting his long narrow beak to the sky as if taunting them as the horse closed the distance between them guy released his bloody arm and drew the dagger from his belt making a clumsy swipe with his left hand the phantom ducked under the stroke as the big horse sped by he gave a last wild shriek and turned wings spread wide retreating not into the wood as anyone might expect but straight down the centre of the roadthe way the wagons had come abbot hugo seeing his adversary on the run reined up and screamed for the soldiers to give chase but they remained cowering behind their shields crying down heaven on their craven heads the abbot threatened strong punishment for any and all who disobeyed the soldiers looked around and when they saw king raven fly they did what norman soldiers always do when an enemy retreats they followed the soldiers weighed down by their long mail shirts and shields and heavy cloaks and what have you lurched through the snow after king raven who was swift and nimble as a bird the abbot and marshal charged after them guarding the rear that soon all of them disappeared from my view i waited wondering what would happen next the drivers must have wondered too for they stood on the wagon benches and gazed into the murk after the departing soldiers one of them shouted for the guardsmen calling them back but no reply was returned he did not shout again before he could draw breath four cloaked figures swarmed out of the forest and onto the wain i saw tomas and siarles leading the flock two men to each wagon while one of the grellon threw a cloak over the head of the driver and pulled him off his bench the other took up the ox goad and began driving the team the two wagons were taken up the road a little way to a place where the track dipped into a dell upon reaching the dingle wonder of wonders the wall of bush and brush beside the road parted and the oxen were led off the track and into the wood as the second wagon followed the first into the brake four more of the grellon appeared and began smoothing out the tracks in the snow with pine branches the two drivers were bound in their cloaks dragged to the side of the road and each one left beside a dead horse where i suppose they might stay a mite warmer for a while frightened out of their wits they lay still as dead men offering only the occasional soft whimper to show the world they were still alive new snow was carried in reed baskets and spread lightly over any remaining tracks and then the grellon departed flitting away into the gloaming vanishing as quickly and quietly as they had appeared chapter i waited for a time listening but heard only the whispering hush of falling snow i did not know what would happen next and wondered if the attack was over and i should now begin making my way back to cel craidd the wood was growing dark and if i did not leave soon it would be a lonely slog on a frozen night for old will nothing moved in the forest or on the ground save the lone wounded man who had taken the arrow in his back he lay with the dead moaning and trying now and then to rise but lacking the strength i felt that sorry for the fella i thought that if someone did not come back for him soon i might risk putting him out of his misery but my orders were to watch and wait so that is what i would do until told otherwise i kept my eyes sharp and bided my time winter twilight deepened the shadows and the snow had been steadily melting into my cloak the icy damp was spreading across my shoulders as night came on i knew i would have to leave my post soon or freeze there with the corpses on the trail as i was pondering this i heard someone approaching on the road from the dingle where the wagons had disappeared in the direction of elfael in a moment a man on horseback emerged from the gathering gloom not a tall man he sat his saddle straight as a rod his head high across his legs was folded a deerskin robe his hat had a thin folded brim which was pointed in front like the sharp prow of a seagoing ship heavily swaddled against the winter storm he wore a monks cloak of brown coarsewoven cloth secured at the throat with a thick brooch of heavy silver even from a distance in the failing light i could tell he was more devil than monk something about that narrow hatchetshaped nose and jutting chin the cruel slant of those closeset eyes gave me to know that richard de glanville was happier with a noose in his hand than a rosary he reined up at the carcase of the first dead horse regarded it and then slowly swept his eyes across to one of the dead knights he observed the arrows jutting rudely from the corpses and after due contemplation let out a shrill whistle ive heard the same when falconers call their hawks to roost and quick enough four riders emerged from the gloaming to join him on the road yes odo this was the first time i laid eyes on the sheriff i tell him my monkish friend knows well of whom i speak our sheriff is a right sharp thorn of a man and that nastya man who thinks frailty a fatal contagion and considers mercy the way most folk view the black death if it was the first time says my scribe how did you know it was the sheriff well says i with a scratch of my head the authority of the man could not be mistaken even in a snowstorm asks brother odo with the smarmy smile he uses when he thinks he has caught me decorating the truth a little too extravagantly for his taste even in a snowstorm monk i tell him anyway it was the same with abbot hugo and marshal guyif i did not know their names right off the first i saw them i knew them well enough before the day was over mores the pity odo my friend mores the pity odo grunts in begrudging agreement and we stumble on the sheriff s men quickly dismounted and began searching among the dead men and horses for survivors de glanville remained in the saddle he did not deign to get his fine boots wet i reckon well they found the bundledup wagon drivers untied them and brought them to stand before the sheriff the drivers were still quaking from fright and gawking around as if they expected to be swooped upon by the phantom bird again under the sheriff s stern questioning however they soon lost their fear of the great preying bird the sheriff had them now and he was fleshandblood fiercer than any phantom or host of unseen archers i could tell from the way the ox handlers were gesturing and squawking that they were filling the sheriff s ears with their weird and wonderful tale oh yes and i could tell by the way the sheriff s scowl deepened by the moment that he was having none of it he listened to them prate a while and then cut off their mewling with a shout that travelled through the silent wood like a clap wheeling his mount he cantered down the kings road in the direction the abbot and soldiers had gone passing so close to my perch i could have reached down and plucked that absurd hat from his pointy head he rode on leaving his men and the ox drivers behind meanwhile i studied hard to see what they might find but was relieved to see that the snow had mostly filled in the tracks of men and beasts and wagon wheels the only disturbance now to be seen was that left by the sheriff and his men themselves soon enough de glanville returned close on his heels came abbot hugo and the marshal and the surviving soldiers the fighting men were that weary and out of breath they could hardly hold their weapons upright king raven had led them a wild chase right enough their snowcaked feet dragged and their hair was stringy wet beneath their steel caps they looked as cold and damp and limp as their own soggy cloaks they assembled in the road gawking at the dead horses and knights casting many a sideways glance into the wood lest the phantom catch them unawares after a brief word with the sheriff marshal guy sent his knights and the remaining soldiers and wagon drivers down the road it would be a long frozen walk to count de braoses castle and i did not envy them the welcome they would likely receive the wounded soldier clinging to life was taken up behind one of the sheriff s men and they all clattered off with a rattle of tack and weapons thoughts of home fires and welcomes put me in mind of a nice steaming bowl of something hot and i was that close to quitting my post and finding my way back home but glanced back to see that the sheriff had not yet departed he simply sat there on his horse alone in the middle of the road waiting i could in no wise leave before he did so i stayed put good thing too for as winter twilight settled over the forest out from the undergrowth stumbled a man with two fat hares slung on a snare line over his neck and another in his hand i did not recognise the fella and supposed he was from elfaela farmer out to get a little meat for his table you there shouted the sheriff his voice loud in the quiet glade startling as it was it took a moment before i realised old rat face was speaking english stand where you are the poor man was so surprised he dropped the hare in hand and turned to run the sheriff was that quick he spurred his mount forward to catch the poacher the fleeing man lunged for the brush at the side of the road but was caught and hauled back by the hood of his cloak the fella gave out a yelp and tried to struggle free of the cloak the sheriff well used to catching folk this way pulled him off his feet he hung there at the side of the sheriff s saddle feet dangling off the ground swinging his fists and yelling to be released when the sheriff drew his knife and put it to his squirming captives neck i reckoned the affair had gone far enough easing myself from my place i tucked three arrows in my belt put another on the string and moved down onto the road as quickly and quietly as stiff muscles would allow creeping like a shadow i came up behind the sheriff s horse and with an arrow already on the string drew and took aim let him go i said in my best english or wear this arrow to your wake the sheriff s head spun around so fast i thought his neck would snap he gaped at me and at the bow in my hand opened his mouth then thought better and closed it you might be thinking your little knife will save you i said but i think it wont if you want to find out just you hold on to that welshman de glanville recovered himself then and said i am sheriff of the march this thief is caught poaching in the kings forest and unless you want a share of what is coming to him turn aside and go your way bold words sheriff i replied but it is myself who holds the bow and my fingers on this string are getting tired i gave my arm a jiggle to sharpen my point as it were whereupon the sheriff dropped our man pick up the hare i told the farmer and light out he scrambled to his feet snatched up his prize and dived into the wood you cannot hope to gain anything by this the sheriff informed me i have marked you for a felon you will not escape the kings justice the kings justice i hooted sir the kings justice is rough to be sure but it is fickle and inconstant as a flirty milkmaid i will gladly take my chances fool cried the sheriff suddenly angry heedless of the arrow he spurred his horse at me so as to run me down i stepped lightly aside and he made a wild looping slash at me with his small blade as he passed he wheeled the horse at once a beast well trained to war it turned so fast the sheriff s long cloak flung out behind him i saw it flying like a dull flag against the dark bulwark of an oak bole as he made to drive me down and loosed the shaft the arrow whined through the air catching the heavy cloak and pinning it to the oak as he passed the cloak snapped taut the horse charged on and de glanville was jerked clean from the saddle the sound of ripping fabric cut sharp in the little glade but the cloth and arrow held fast sheriff de glanville was strung up like a ham in a chimney to dangle with his feet a few inches from the snowy ground oh he squirmed and wriggled and cursed me up one side and down tother but i was not ready to let him go so easy so i sent two more arrows into the trunk to better nail my captive to the tree redfaced and foamin with rage if that fella coulda spit poison he would have no mistake instead he swung there ripening the air with his rage i calmly trained an arrow at the centre of his chest i was this close to loosing the shaft when i felt a hand on my shoulder put up said a familiar voice in my ear the sheriff s men are returning it is time to fly i have him i insisted i can take him and save the world a load of trouble it may bring more trouble than it saves another day we have what we came forand now we must fly with that bran pulled me into the brushwood at the side of the road and we were away no sooner in the wood and on the path than we heard the sheriff shouting behind us after them through there ten marks to the man who brings them back immediately we heard the crack and snap of branches as the soldiers searched for our trail in less time than it takes to tell they found it and were onto us so now here was a bother fleeing through the woods over snowcovered pathways and no way to cover our tracks those fellas would have no difficulty at all seeing where we went the first clearing we came to i stopped to make a stand we can take them here my lord i said ill drop the first one you take the second i dont have a bowwill said bran so tonight we let them live they will not pay us the same coin if they catch us i replied that is a fair certainty true enough bran allowed gone was the feathered cloak and the longbeaked headpiece dressed in his customary black tunic and trousers he shivered slightly with the cold consider it just one of the many things that makes us better men than they are our pursuers could be heard thrashing through the wood coming closer with every heartbeat bran smiled and winked his eye his face a disembodied shape floating in the gloom but that does not mean we cannot have a little fun at their expense turning lightly on his heel he said come will lets give them something to talk about when they join their comrades at castle de braose with that he flitted away i glanced over my shoulder then followed him into the forest i caught up with him a few dozen paces down the path where he had stopped beside an ancient oak and was tugging on a bit of ivy vine this is where we start he said as the end of a rope snaked down from a branch above stand where you are and make no more tracks he instructed i did as i was told bran wound the end of the rope around one wrist and gave it a tug the rope snapped taut he tugged again and the end of a rope ladder dropped from the limb overhead up you go will he said passing the ladder to me i will hold it for you but be quick slinging my bow i grasped the highest rung i could reach and swung myself up climbing the ladder with no little difficulty as it twisted and turned like an angry serpent under my weight i gritted my teeth and hung on after some tricksy rope climbing i gained the limb of the oak at last pull up the ladder hissed bran in an urgent whisper the sheriff s men were that close he could not speak more loudly or risk being overheard there is time i whispered back take hold and ill pull you up but he was already gone chapter i hauled up the ladder as fast as i could and crouched in the crux of the largest bough to wait within five heartbeats the sheriff s men burst into the clearing we had just left a few more steps along our trail carried them to the base of the oak where our tracks became slightly confused although i could no longer see the path below and was not fool enough to risk looking down i could well imagine what they were seeing the wellformed footprints of two fleeing men set in deep undisturbed snow and then one set of footprints vanishing only a solitary track continued along the path and they were not slow to mark this they paused to catch a breath beneath my hiding place i could hear them puffing hard as they stood below searching trying to find where the second pair of tracks had gone one of them muttered something in frenchsomething about the futility of catching anything in this accursed forest and then another voice called from the trail and they moved on from my perch i caught a fleeting glimpse of three soldiers in dark cloaks barely visible in the winter twilight no doubt they were loath to return to the sheriff emptyhanded and seeing only a single set of footprints leading away they had no choice but to follow them so panting and cursing off they went to continue the pursuit when they had gone i settled myself more securely on the branch to wait for whatever would happen next the night was not getting any warmer nor my cloak any drier folding my arms across my chest to keep warm i prayed to saint christopher that they would not be pulling my frozen corpse from the oak come christmas twilight deepened to night and the wind sharpened kicking up gusts to drive the snow i wrapped myself tight in my cloak and had just closed my eyes beneath my hood when i heard the creak and clatter of tree limbs nearby as if something big was moving among the branches my first thought was that all the fuss and fury had awakened a bear or wildcat asleep in its treetop bower peering around lord bless me but i saw a great dark shape walking toward me along the very bough i had chosen the thing came closer get back i hissed fumbling beneath my damp cloak for my knife hush came the whisper youll bring them back bran who else he laughed lightly heavens will you look like you were ready to take wing i thought you were a bear i told him follow me he said already turning away they will be coming back this way soon and it is best we are not here teetering on the bough i edged after him sliding one cautious slippery foot at a time while clinging to a branch overhead the bough narrowed as it went out from the trunk but at the place where it would have begun to bend under our weight i discovered another stout limb had been lashed into place to make a bridge of sorts on which to cross the gap between trees this makeshift bridge spanned the trail below linking two big oaks together and this was not all no fewer than four trees were likewise linked in a mad squirrelrun through the treetops we worked our way along this odd walkway until we came to another rope ladder and so at last climbed down to a completely different forest track you knew we would be chased i said the moment i set foot on solid ground once more aye he replied king raven can see the shapes of all things present and yet to come he told me peter and paul on a donkey bran i gasped then you must have seen the sheriff and peace will he said chuckling at his jest angharad might be blessed with such a gift on occasion but i am not no i said none too certain listen to you he said it does not take the second sight to know that any time you take arms against a company of norman knights you might soon be running for your life true i allowed feeling stupid for being taken in so easily thats a fact right enough still and all it was a canny piece of luck they chased you the way you wanted to go not at all he said moving lightly away i led them this way or another it makes no difference we have worked all summer to prepare such deceptions there are ladders and treewalks scattered all over the forest and especially along the kings road treewalk i said enjoying the word i hurried after him ladders and limbs and such he said it makes for easier escape if you can move from tree to tree i agree but do the normans never see them the ffreinc only ever view the world from the back of a horse bran declared they rarely dismount even in dense forest and almost never look up he shook his head again i should have told you about all that but i confess i did so want to see your face the first time we used it this revelation stopped me in my tracks i hope it gave you enjoyment my lord i said the complaint sharp in my voice i live to provide amusement for my betters oh do not take on will no harm done i thought you were a bear i did he laughed come iwan and siarles will be wondering what has become of us he hurried off along the darkened path and it was all i could do to keep up with him his long legs carried him by fast stridesand his sight even in the dark led him unerringly along a path that could no longer be seen i struggled along slipping and sliding in his footsteps trying to avoid the branches and twigs that whipped back in my face after a time bran slowed his pace the trees were closer here the wood more dense and the snow less deep on the path we moved along at a much improved pace until we arrived at a place far from the road and where we had last seen the sheriff s men bran paused and put his hand back to halt me he hesitated and then i heard iwans voice murmur something and bran stepped from the trail and into a small snug clearing that had been hewn from the dense undergrowth beside the trail a fire burned brightly in the centre of this bower and aside from iwan and siarles there were five of the grellon huddled close around the flames they all rose when bran stepped through the brush and welcomed him they made room for us by the fire but before bran sat down he spoke to each one personally telling them how pleased he was of their accomplishments this day aside from the men there were two women from cel craidd they had prepared barley cakes and a little mulled ale to help draw the chill from our bones so while bran spoke to the others i sat down and soon had my frozen fingers wrapped around a steaming jar we were getting worried said siarles settling down beside me i might have known there would be trouble a little i confessed the sheriff turned up and took it into his head to have us give some of his men a run through the wood the sheriff are you certain oh aye it was himself i challenged him and he tried to talk me into giving myself up for a hanging i sipped my hot ale tempting as it was i declined the offer and made one of my own i decorated his fine cloak with arrow points siarles regarded me in the firelight with a look approaching appreciation did you kill him then i drew on him but did not loose weeping judas why not king raven prevented me i replied he appeared just as i was about to let fly and weve been running ever since and now that i think of it why did no one tell me about the treewalks and ladders siarles grinned readily oh thatwell its a secret we like to keep to ourselves as much as possible a mans life could depend on it as my own did this selfsame night it would have cheered me no end to know i wasnt about to end my days with a norman spear in my back so now you know now i know i agreed one of these days ill thank you to show me which of the other trails have been prepared this way and which trees oaks replied siarles taking the jar from me and helping himself to a sip oaks i repeated taking the cup back its always oak trees iwan confirmed look for a dangling vine as for the trails well show you next time we come out but that wont be for a while now we will let the trail grow cold it is plenty cold now i said quaffing down a hearty gulp if the snow keeps up by morning you wont be able to tell anyone passed this way at all iwan nodded and stood abruptly noinina he called a dry cloak for our man here one of the women turned away from the fire and withdrew a bundle from a wicker basket they had brought she came around the ring to where i sat untied the bundle and shook out a clean dry cloak oooh she cooed gently let me get that cold wet thing off you before you take a death leaning over me she deftly untied the laces and lifted off the wet garment the cold air hit my damp clothes and i shivered she spread the dry cloak over my shoulders and rubbed my back with her hands so as to warm me there now she said youll be warm and dry that soon many thanks i said craning my head around to see her better it was the woman who had come to cel craidd after being rescued from the ffreinc as it happens i had helped build a hut for her and her wee daughter noinina is it i asked though i knew well and good that it was aye thats me she gave me a fine smile and i realized that she was a right fetching woman now it might have been the heat of the fire after a long cold day or then again it might have been something else but i felt a certain warmth spread through me just then youre called will that i am she lingered close gazing down at me as i sat with my cup on my knees i helped build the hut for you and the little un i told her i know she smiled again and moved off and for that ill give you a barley cake she was back a few moments later with a jug of warm ale and a barley cake fresh from the griddle stone get that into you and see if you dont warm up im feeling better already i told her much better it didnt last long as soon as we all had a bite and drained our cups iwan put out the fire and we were away oh but it was a long slow trek back to the settlement through deepdrifting snow we tried to walk in one anothers footsteps as much as possible so as not to disturb the snow overmuch but that was tedious and taxing we were fair exhausted by the time we reached cel craidd and the night was far gone even so our folk had built up a big bright fire and were waiting for us with hot food and drink they let out a great cheer when first we tumbled through the hedgewall and slid down the bank well our trials were forgotten just that quick and we all gathered round the fire to celebrate our victory there was still a thing or two needin donethe oxen and wagons had been secured for the night but the wagons would have to be unburdened and the oxen would require attention before another day had run our work was far from finished even so the cares of tomorrow could fend for themselves a little while this night we could celebrate the mood was high we had fought the ffreinc and delivered a blow they would not soon forget as soon as we took our places at the fire cups were pressed into our hands and meat set to roast on skewers we drank the first of many healths to one and all and i was that surprised to find myself standing beside the widow woman once more hello again noinina i said my clumsy halfsaxon tongue attempting the lilt she had given it its a good night that ends well even with the snow call me noin she said indicating my cup with a quick nod of her head she said your jar big enough for two just big enough i replied and passed it to her she raised it to her lips and drank deep wiping her mouth with the back of her hand as she returned the jar ah now that is as it should behale and hearty and strong with a fine handsome head she leaned near and her lips curved with sweet mischief as she added just like our man here himself oh my stars it had been long since any woman had spoken to me with such invitation in her voice my heart near leapt out of my throat and i had to look at her a second time to make sure it was ol will scarlet she was talking about she gave me a wink with the smile and i knew my fortunes had just improved beyond all reason do not be leaving just yet she said and skipped away ill keep a place for you right here i called after her she returned with another jar and two skewers of meat for us to roast at the fire we settled back to share a stump and a cup and watch the snow drift down as the meat cooked sweet peters beard but the flames that warmed my face were nothing compared to the warmth of that fine young woman beside me an unexpected happiness caught me up and my heart took wing and soared through a winter sky ablaze with stars i was on the point of asking her how she came to be in the forest when lord bran raised his cup and called for silence around the fire ring heres a health to king raven and his mighty grellon who this night have plucked a tail feather from that stuffed goose de braose to king raven and the grellon we all cried lofting our cups mighty all when we had drunk and recharged our cups bran called again heres a health to the men whose valour and hardihood has the sheriff and his men gnashing their teeth in rage tonight we hailed that and drank accordingly swallowing down a hearty draught at the happy thought of the sheriff and count smarting from the wallop wed given them hear now bran called when we had finished this health is for our good will scarlet who heedless of the danger to himself snatched a poor man from the sheriff s grasp thanks to will that mans family will eat tonight and him with them raising his cup he cried to will a man after king ravens heart the shout went up to will and everyone raised their jars to me ah it was a grand thing to be hailed like that and just to make the moment that much more memorable to me as the king and all his folk drank my health i felt noin slip her hand into mine and give it a squeezeonly lightly mind but i felt the tingle down to my toes chapter eiwas the journey to wales seemed endless somehow although only a few days from his castle in englands settled heart bernard neufmarche baron of hereford and gloucester always felt as if he had travelled half a world away by the time he reached the lands of his vassal lord cadwgan in the welsh cantref of eiwas the country was darker and strangely uninviting with shadowy wooded keeps secret pools and lonely rivers the baron thought the closeset hills and hidden valleys of wales mysterious and more than a little forbiddingall the more so in winter it wasnt only the landscape he found threatening since his defeat of rhys ap tewdwr a wellloved king and the able leader of the southern welsh resistance the land beyond the march had grown decidedly unfriendly to him former friends were now hostile and former enemies implacable so be it if that was the price of progress neufmarche was willing to pay now however the baron made his circuits more rarely and where once he might have enjoyed an untroubled ride to visit his vassal lords these days he never put foot to stirrup in the region unless accompanied by a bodyguard of knights and menatarms thus he was surrounded by a strong wellarmed force not that he expected trouble from cadwgandespite their differences the two had always got along well enoughbut reports of wandering rebels stirring up trouble meant that even old friends must be treated with caution evereux called the baron as they came in sight of caer rhodl perched on the summit of a low rock crag halt the men just there he pointed to a stony outcrop beside the trail a short distance from the wooden palisade of cadwgans fortress you and i will ride on together the marshal relayed the barons command to the troops and upon reaching the place the soldiers paused and dismounted the baron continued to the fortress gatewhere as expected he was admitted with prompt if cold courtesy my lord will be informed of your arrival said the steward please wait in the hall but of course replied the baron my greetings to your lord the welsh kings house was not large and neufmarche had been there many times he proceeded to the hall where he and his marshal were kept waiting longer than the baron deemed hospitable this is an insult observed evereux do you want me to go find the old fool and drag him here by the nose we came unannounced the baron replied calmly although he was also feeling the slight we will wait they remained in the hall alone frustration mounting by the moment until eventually there came a shuffle in the doorway it took a moment for the baron to realise that lord cadwgan had indeed appeared gaunt and hollowcheeked a ghastly shadow fell across his face his clothes hung on his oncerobust form as upon a rack of sticks his skin had an unhealthy pallor that told the baron his vassal lord had not ventured outdoors for weeks or maybe even months my lord baron said cadwgan in the soft listless voice of the sickroom good of you to come his manner seemed to suggest that he imagined it was he who had summoned the baron to his hall neufmarche disregarded the inapt remark even as he ignored the sharp decline evidenced in cadwgans appearance a fine day the baron declared his voice a little forced and overloud i thought we might make a circuit of your lands of course agreed cadwgan perhaps once we have had some refreshment my son could accompany you i thought you might ride with me replied the baron it has been a long time since we rode together i fear i would not be the best of company said cadwgan i will tell garran to saddle a horse unwilling to press the matter further the baron said how is your lady wife when the king failed to take his meaning he said queen anorais she well aye yes well enough cadwgan looked around the empty room as if he might find her sitting in one of the corners shall i send someone to fetch her let it wait there is no need to disturb her just now of course sire the welsh king fell silent gazing at the baron and then at evereux finally he said was there something else you were going to summon your son i think neufmarche replied was i very well if you wish to see him without another word the king turned and padded softly away the man is ill observed the marshal that or senile obviously replied the baron but he has been a useful ally and we will treat him with respect as you say allowed evereux all the same a thought about the succession would not be amiss is the son loyal loyal enough replied the baron he is a young and supple reed and we can bend him to our purpose a few moments later they were joined by the young prince himself who with icy compliance agreed to ride with the baron on a circuit of eiwas the baron spoke genially of one thing and another as they rode out receiving nothing but the minimum required for civility in return upon reaching a stream at the bottom of the valley the baron reined up sharply know you we need not be enemies he said from what i have seen of your father today it seems to me that you will soon be swearing vassalage to me let us resolve to be friends from the beginning garran wheeled his horse and came back across the stream what do you want from me neufmarche is it not enough that you hold our land must you own our souls as well guard your tongue my lord prince snarled evereux it ill becomes a future king to speak to his liege lord in such a churlish manner the prince opened his mouth as if he would challenge this remark but thought better of it and glared at the marshal instead your father is not well the baron said simply have you sent for a physician garran frowned and looked away such as we have i will send mine to you offered the baron my thanks baron replied the prince stiffly but it will be to no purpose he pines for merian merian murmured the baron as if searching his memory for a face to go with the name oh but not a day had passed from the moment he first met her until now that he did not think of her with longing and stinging regret fairest merian stolen away from his very grasp how he wished that he could call back the command that had sealed her fate a clumsy and illadvised attempt to capture the welsh renegade bran ap brychan had resulted in the young hellion taking the lady captive to make good his escape from the barons camp neufmarche had lost her along with any chance he might have had of loving her mistaking the barons pensive silence prince garran said the king thinks her dead and i suppose she is or we would have had some word of her by now there has been nothing no demand for ransom nothing asked the baron his own efforts to find her had been singularly unsuccessful not a word confirmed garran we always knew bran for a rogue but this makes no sense if he only wanted money he could have had it long since my father would have met any demandas well he knows the young man shook his head i suppose my father is right she must be dead i only hope that bran ap brychan is maggotfood too following merians kidnapping the baron had sorrowfully informed merians family of the incident laying the blame entirely at brans feet while failing to mention his own considerable part in the affair all they knew was what the baron had told them at the time that a man thought to be bran ap brychan had come riding into the camp demanding to speak to the baron who was in council with two of his english vassals when the welshmans demands were denied he had grown violent and attacked the barons knights who fought him off to avoid being killed the cowardly rebel had seized the young woman and carried her away the barons men had given chase there was a battle in which several of his knights lost their lives in all likelihood the fugitives had been wounded in the skirmish but their fate was unknown for they escaped into the hills taking lady merian with them her loss has made my father sick at heart garran concluded gloomily i think he will not last the winter then said the baron a tone of genuine sympathy edging into his voice i suggest we begin making plans for your succession to your fathers throne will there be any opposition do you think garran shook his head there is no one else good replied neufmarche with satisfaction we must now look to the future of eiwas and its people chapter odo wants to know why i have never mentioned noin before some things are sacred i tell him what kind of priest are you that you dont know this sacred he blinks at me like a mole just popped from the ground and dazzled by a little daylight a sacred memory noin is more than a memory monk shes a part of me forever is she dead then ill not be telling the likes of you i say i am peeved with him now and he knows it noin may be a memory but even so she is a splendid pearl and not to be tossed to any ffreinc swine odo pouts i meant no disrespect he says rubbing his bald spot neither to you nor the lady i just wanted to know so you can run off and tell the blasted abbot i shake my head i may be crow food tomorrow but i ent a dunce today my scribe does not understand this and as i look at him it occurs to me that i dont rightly understand it either i protect her however i may i suppose so now i slide down the rough stone wall and assume my place once more where was i returned to cel craidd he says dipping his pen reluctantly it is the night after the raid and it is snowing snowing yes it was snowing i say and we press on it snowed all night and most of the next day clearing a little around sunset owing to angharads timely warning we were well prepared and weathered the storm in comfortsleeping eating taking our ease to us it was a holy day a feast day we celebrated our victory and rare good fortune around midday after wed had a good warm sleep and a little something to break our fast lord bran and those of us who had helped in the raid crowded into his hut to view the spoils in amongst the bags of grain and beans sides of smoked meat casks of wine and bundles of cloth that made up the greater part of the take the grellon had found two small chests the heavier goods had been hidden in the wood not far from the road to be retrieved later when the weather was better and the sheriff far away the wooden boxes however had been toted back to our snuggery with a nod from angharad standing nearby to oversee the proceedings bran said open them lets see what our generous baron has sent us siarles waiting with an axe in his hand stepped forward and gave the oak chest a few solid chops the lid splintered a few more blows and the box lay open to reveal a quantity of small leather bags that were quickly untied and dumped on a skin beside the hearth around which we all stood the bags were full of silver pennies which was more or less to be expected again said bran and siarles wielded the axe once more and the second chest gave way in it were more leather bags full of coins but also three other items of interest a pair of fine white leather calfskin gloves richly embroidered on the back with holy crosses and other symbols in gold braid a thick square of parchment folded bound with a blue cord and sealed with wax and in its own calfskin bag a massive gold ring a fine bauble that said siarles holding up the ring he handed it to bran who bounced it on his palm to judge the weight of gold before passing it on to angharad very fine work she observed holding the ring to her squint she passed it along saying much too grand for a mere count indeed the ring looked like something i imagined an emperor might wear the flat central stone was engraved with a coat of arms such as might be used by kings or other notables for imprinting their seal on important documents around the carved stone was a double row of glittering rubiestiny but bright as birds eyes and each glowing like a small crimson sun a most expensive trinket replied bran leaning close he examined the engraving whose arms i wonder have you ever seen them iwan the big man bent his head close and then shook it slowly not english i think probably belong to a ffreinc noblemana baron id say or a king i doubt if anyone in all britain has ever worn the like said siarles where do you think de braose got it and why send it here asked iwan these are questions that will require some thought replied angharad as bran slipped the ring onto his finger it was far too big so he put it on his thumb and even then it did not fit so he took a bowstring looped it through the ring and tied it around his neck it will be safe enough there he said until we find out more we counted up the silver and it came to fifty marksa splendid haul the gloves might be worth twenty or thirty marks all by themselves merian pointed out she had come in during the counting and stayed to see the result stroking the gauntlets against her cheek she remarked that they were the sort of thing a highplaced cleric might wear on festal days what about the ring wondered iwan aloud what would that be worth no one knew various sums were suggestedall of them fancies we had no more idea how much that lump of gold and rubies might be worth than the king of denmarks hunting hound some said it must be worth a castle a cantref maybe even a kingdom our ignorant speculation ran amok until angharad silenced us saying you would do better to ask why it is here why indeed said bran his fingers caressing the bauble we fell silent gazing at the thing as at a piece of the moon dropped from the sky why had it been sent to elfael in the bottom of a supply wagon oh aye said angharad her voice cracking like dry twigs a treasure like this will bring swarms of searchers on its trail she tapped it with a bony finger it might be as well to give it back this dropped us in the pickle pot i can tell you with these words the realisation of what wed done began to break over us and our triumph turned to ashes in our mouths we each crept away to our beds that night full of foreboding i hardly closed my eyes at all i was that restless with it god knows it may be deepest sin to steal and in ordinary times i would never take so much as a bean from a bag that was not mine but this was different this was a fight for survival rule of law kings justice these words are worth less to the ffreinc than the air it takes to breathe them out if we steal from those who seek ever to destroy us may the good lord forgive us but we ent about to stop and we ent about to start giving things back it does irritate the baron and his nephew no end i can say and the sheriff it upsets him most of all on account of the fact that hes the one who is meant to prevent our raiding and thieving shed no tears for richard de glanville he is a twisted piece of rope if ever there was one it is said he killed his wife for burning his sunday pork chop in the panstrangled her with his own bare hands personally i do not believe this not a word in the first place it means our richard ratface would have had to get someone to marry him and i heartily doubt there is a woman born yet who would agree to that even granting a marriage impossible as it seems it would mean that he had taken matters into his own handsanother fair impossibility right there you might better claim the sun spends the night in your barn and get more people to believe you than that the sheriff of the march ever sullied his lilywhites with anything so black see de glanville never lifts a finger himself he pays his men to do all his dirty deeds for him to the last man the sheriff s toadies are as cruel and vengeful as the day is long a more rancorous covey of plumeproud pigeons you never want to meet god bless me it is true the folk of derby still talk of the time when sheriff de glanville and three of his men cornered a poor tinker who had found his way into mischief the tale as i heard it was that one bright day in april a farmwife went out to feed the geese and found them all but one dead and that one not looking any too hearty who would do a mean and hateful thing like that well it came to her then that thered been a tinker come to the settlement a day or two before hoping to sell a new pot or get some patchwork on an old one sharptongued daughter of eve that she was shed sent him off with both ears burnin for his trouble now then wasnt that just like a rascal of a tinker to skulk around behind her back and kill her prize geese the moment she wasnt looking she went about the market with this news and it soon spread all over town everyone was looking for this tinker who wasnt hard to find because he wasnt hiding they caught him down by the river washing his clothes and they hauled him halfnaked to the sheriff to decide what to do with the goosekiller as it happened some other townsfolk had rustled about and found a serf whod broken faith with his norman lord from somewhere up north hed passed through the town a day or so before and the fella was discovered hiding in a cow byre on a settlement just down the road they bound the poor fella and dragged him to town where the sheriff had already set up his judgement seat outside the guildhall in the market square de glanville was halfway to hanging the tinker when the second crowd tumbles into town with the serf so now what to do both men are swearing their innocence and screaming for mercy they are raising a ruck and crying foul to beat the devil well the sheriff cant tell who is guilty of this heinous crime nor can anyone else but that ent no matter up he stands and says you call on heaven to help you so be it hang them both and let god decide which one shall go to hell so his men fix another noose on the end of the first rope and its up over the roof beam of the guildhall he hangs both men in the market square with the same ropeone wretch on one end and one on tother and that is richard bloody de glanville for you beginning and end whats that monk i say you think it unlikely odo sniffs and wrinkles his nose in disbelief if you please which one of them killed the geese which one id a thought that would be obvious to a smart fella like you odo so now you tell me which one did the deed the tinkerfor spite because the farmwife refused to buy his pots or give him work oh odo i sigh shaking my head and tutting his ignorance it wasnt the tinker no never him the serf then because he he scratches his head hungry i dont know it wasnt the serf either then who it was a sneakthief fox of course see odo a man cant kill a goose but that the whole world knows about it first you gotta catch the bloody bird and that raises the most fearsome squawk you ever heard and that gets all the others squawking too by adams axe its enough to wake the dead it is but a fox now a fox is nimble as a shadow and just as silent a fox works quick and so frightens the flock that none of them lets out a peep with a fox in the barn no one knows the deed is done till you walk in and find em all in a heap of blood and feathers odo bristles at this are you saying the sheriff hanged two innocent men i dont know that they were innocent mind but de glanville hanged two men for the same crime that neither could have done odo shakes his head hearsay he decides hearsay and slander and lies thats right i say you just keep telling yourself that priest keep on asaying it until they find a reason to tighten the rope around your fine plump neck and then well see how you sing chapter the snow continued through the night and over the next days covering all drifting deep on field and forest hilltop and valley throughout elfael as soon as the hard weather eased up a little we fetched the captured spoils back to cel craidd along with the four oxen kept in a pen not far from the road trusting to the windblown snow to remove any traces of our passing we kept a right keen watch for the sheriff and his scabby men but saw neither hank nor hair of them and so hurried about our chores the wagons we dismantled where they stood keeping only the wheels and iron fittings the animals were more useful to be sure one we kept to pull the plough in the spring the others would be given to farmers in the area to replace those lost in one way or another to the ffreinc it was the same with the money bran did not keep what he got from the raid but shared it out among the folk of his realm helping those who were most in need of itand there were plenty of them i can tell you for the normans had been in elfael going on two years by then and however bad it was in the beginning it was much worse now always worse with that hell crew never better so the money was given out and those who received it blessed king raven and his men oh but that great gold ring began to weigh heavy on the slender strap around brans princely neck worth a kings ransom it was and we all stoked a secret fear that one day the red king himself would come after it with an army we were all atwist over this when friar tuck showed up i had heard his name by then and some few things about himhow he had helped bran in his dealings with the king and cardinal but whatever i had heard did nothing to prepare me for the man himself part imp part oaf part angelthat is friar tuck his arrival was announced in the usual way one of the sentries gave out the shrill whistle of a crake this warned the grellon that someone was coming and that this visitor was welcome an intruder would have demanded a very different call for those few who were allowed to come and go however there was a simple rising whistle well we heard the signal and folk stopped whatever they were doing and turned towards the blasted oak to see who would appear through the hedge a few moments later a fat little dumpling rolled down the bank red face shining with a sheen of sweat despite the chill in the air the hem of his robe hiked up and stuffed in his belt to keep it from dragging through the snow happy christtide he called when he saw all the folk hurrying to greet him it is good to see you iwan siarles gaenor teleri henwydd he called out the names of folk he knew good to see you peace to one and all tuck shouted siarles hurrying to greet him hail and welcome with all this snow we did not think to see you again until the spring and where should i be at christtide but with my own dear friends no bag this time bag ive brought half of hereford with me he gestured vaguely toward the trail theres a pack mule coming along rhoddi met me on the trail and sent me on ahead bran and merian appeared then and angharad was not far behind the little friar was welcomed with laughter and true affection i glimpsed in this something of the respect and high regard this simple monk enjoyed amongst the grellon the king of england might receive similar adulation on his travels ill warrant but little of the fondness god with you friar said merian stepping forward to bless our visitor may your sojourn here well become you she smiled and bent at the waist to bestow a kiss on his cheek then taking that same round red cheek between finger and thumb she gave it a pinch that is for leaving without wishing me farewell the last time a mistake ill not be making twice replied tuck rubbing his cheek he turned as angharad pushed forward to greet him bless my soul angharad you look even younger than the last time i saw you wise and powerful she may be but angharad was still lady enough to smile at the shameless compliment peace attend thee friend friar she said her wrinkled face alight brother tuck cried iwan and instantly gathered the sturdy friar in a ribcracking embrace it is that good to see you and youwee john retorted the priest giving the warrior a clip round the ear ive missed you and all iwan set him down and the priest gazed at the ring of happy faces around him well bran and i see you and your flock have fared well enough without me adjusting his robe to cover his cold bare legs once more he then raised his hands in a priestly benediction gods peace and mercy on us all and may our kind redeemer send the comfort of this blessed season to cheer our hearts and heal our careworn souls everyone cried amen to that and when tuck turned back to bran he said some new faces i see one or two confirmed bran he grasped the priests hands in his own then presented the newcomers i found myself last among them and this one here he said pulling me forward is the newest member of our growing flock and as handy with a bow as king raven himself thats saying something that is remarked tuck will scatlocke at your service i said thrusting out my hand to him he took it in both his own and shook it heartily our lords abundant peace to you will scatlocke and to you friar see now two saxons fallen among welshmen i said in english he cast a shrewd eye over me is that the north country i hear in your voice oh aye i confessed deny it ill not your ear is sharp as queen megs needle friar born within sight of york minster was i not but tell me how did you come to take roost among these strange birds lost my living to william rufusmay god bless his backside with boilsand so i came west i told him and explained quickly how after many months of living rough and wandering bran had taken me in enough cried bran there is time for all that later we have christmas tomorrow and a celebration to prepare ah christmas how long had it been since i had celebrated the feast day of our sweet saviour in proper style years at leastnot since i had sat at table in thane aelreds hall with a bowl of hot punch between my hands and a huge pig aroasting on the spit over redhot coals in the hearth glad times i have always enjoyed the feast of christthe food and song and games everything taken together it is the best of all the holy days and that is how it should be i did not know how the cymry hereabouts celebrated the christ mass and nursed the strong suspicion that if friar tuck had not arrived when he did king brans pitiable flock would have had little with which to make their cheer but when his pack mule arrived a short while later it was clear that the friar had brought christmas with him within moments he seemed to be everywhere at once kindling the banked coals of the forestdwellers heartsa word of greeting here a song there a laugh or a story to lift the spirits of our downcast tribe bless him he fanned the cold embers of joy into a cracking fine blaze although they have adopted some of the more common saxon practices the britons appeared not to observe the trimming of pine boughs so it fell to tuck and me to arrange this part of the festivities the day had cleared somewhat with bright blue showing through the clouds so the two of us walked into the nearby wood to cut some suitable branches and bring them back this we did talking as we worked and learning to know one another better what we need now declared tuck when we had cut enough greenery to satisfy tradition is a little holly as good as got i told him and asked why he thought it needful why it is a most potent symbol and that is reason enough the priest replied see here prickly leaves remind us of the thorns our dear lamb of god suffered with silent fortitude and the red berries remind us of the drops of healing blood he shed for us the tree remains green all the year round and the leaves never diewhich shows us the way of eternal life for those who love the saviour then by all means i said let us bring back some holly too shouldering our cut boughs of spruce and pine we made our way back to the village pausing to collect a few of the prickly green branches on the way and will we have a yule log i asked as we resumed our walk i have no objection the friar allowed a harmless enough observance quite pleasant in its own way yes why not why not indeed of all the odd bits that go to make up this ageold fest i hold the yule log chief among them and was glad our friar offered no objection the way some clerics have it a fellad think it was lucifer himself dragged into the hall on christmas day for all its just a loga big one mind but a log all the same as thane aelreds forester it always fell to me to find the log wed walk out together lord and vassal of a christmas mornalong with one of the thanes sons or daughters astride a big oxand drag the log back to the hall where it would be pulled through the door and its trimmed end set in a hearth already ablaze then as the end burned wed feed that great hulk of wood inch by inch into the flame green as apples that log would sputter and crack and sizzle as the sap touched the flame filling the hall with its strong scent we always chose a timber too green to burn any other time for the simple reason that so long as that log was aroast none of the servants had to lift a finger beyond the simple necessities required to keep the celebration going a good yule log could last a fortnight i suspect it was the idleness of the vassals that got up so many priests noses they do so hate to see anyone taking his ease then again there was the ashes see when the feasting was over and the log reduced to cold embers those selfsame ashes were gathered up to be used in various ways we sprinkled some on cattle to ensure health and hearty offspring we scattered some in the fields to encourage abundant crops and of course sheep had their fleece dusted to improve the quality of their wool a little was mixed with the first brewing of ale for the year to aid in warding off sickness and ill temper and so on in all the ashes of a yule log provided a useful and necessary commodity over time a good few of the britons took up the yule log tradition just like many of the saxons succumbed to the ancient and honourable celtic rite of eating gammon on christs day to be sure a saxon never requires much encouragement where the eating of pigs is at issue less yet if there is also to be drinking ale so naturally a great many priests try to stamp out the practice of burning yule trees well now said tuck when i remarked on his obvious charity towards a custom most of his ilk found offensive they have their reasons do they not but i tell the folk who ask me that the fire provided is the flame of faith which burns brightest through the darkest nights of the year feeding on the logwhich is the holy sustaining word of god ever new and renewed day by day year by year the ashes then are the dust of death the residue of our sins when all has been cleansed in the refiners fire well said brother you seem a thoughtful sort of man will the cheerful cleric observed i hope i am i replied and dependable it would please me if folk considered me so and are you a loyal man will i stopped walking and looked at him on my life i am good bran has need of men he can trust as do we all friar as do we all he nodded and we resumed our walk the light was fading as the short winter day dwindled down you said you lost your living he said after a moment i would hear that tale now if nothing prevents you nothing to tell you havent heard before ill warrant i replied and explained how i had been in service to thane aelred who ran afoul of king william the red during the accession struggle as punishment the king burned the village and claimed the lands under forest law i went on to describe how i had wandered about working for bread and bed and hearing about king raven decided to try to find him if i could i found iwan and siarles first and they brought me to cel craidd where bran took pity on me what about you tuck how did an upright priest like yourself come to have a place in this odd flock they came to me he replied on their way to lundein they were and stopped for a night under the roof of my oratory he lifted a palm upward god did the rest by the time we returned to the settlement the first stars were peeking through the clouds in the east a great fire blazed in the ring outside brans hut and there was a fine fat pig asizzle on a spit a huge kettle of spiced ale was steaming in the coals the cauldron was surrounded by spatchcocks splayed on willow stakes and the savory scent brought the water to my mouth with the help of some of the children tuck and i placed pine branches over the doors of the huts and around the edge of the fire ring itself at brans hut and those of angharad and merian and iwan and siarles we also fixed a sprig or two of the holly we had cut a few of the smaller girls begged sprigs for themselves and plaited them into their hair as soon as the ale was ready everyone rushed to the fire ring with their cups and bowls to raise the first of a fair many healths to each other and to the day as wives and husbands pledged their cups to one another i lofted my cup to brother tuck was hale i cried ruddy face beaming he gave out a hearty drink hale and we drank to one another bran and merian i noticed shared a most cordial sip between them and the way those two regarded one another over the rim of the cup sent a pang of longing through me sharp and swift as if straight from the bow i think i was not the only one sensing this particular lack for as i turned around i glimpsed noin standing a little off to one side watching the couples with a wistful expression on her face a health to you fair lady i called raising my cup to her across the fire smiling brightly she stepped around the ring to touch the rim of her cup to mine health and strength to you will scarlet she said her voice dusky and low we drank together and she moved closer and wrapping an arm around my waist hooked a finger in my belt gods blessing on you this day and through all the year to come and to you and yours i replied glancing around i asked where is the little un playing with the other tads why there will be no keeping them abed tonight i suggested watching the excited youngsters kicking up the snow in their games nor perhaps their elders noin said offering me a smile that was both shy and seasoned oh she knew the road and where it led she had travelled it but was a mite uncertain of her footing just then it opened a place in my heart so well we talked a little and i remembered all over again how easy she was to be near and how the firelight flecked her long dark hair with red like tiny sparks she was the kind of woman a man would find comfortable to have around day in day out if he should be so fortunate i was on the point of asking her to join me at table for the feast when friar tuck raised his voice and declared friends gather around everyone come little and large come fill your cups it is time to raise a health to the founder of the feast our dear blessed saviourwho on this night was born into our midst as a helpless infant so that he might win through this world to the next and by his striving open the gates of heaven so that all who love him might go in lofting his cup tuck shouted to our lord and eternal master of the feast jesus to jesus came the resounding reply thus the feast of christ began the devil however is busy always observing neither feast nor fest our infernal tormentor is a harsh taskmaster to his willing servants the moment we dared lift cup and heart to enjoy a little cheer that moment the devils disciples struck and they struck hard chapter the first sign of something amiss came as our forest tribe gathered to share the festal meal we drank the abbots wine and savoured the aromas of roasting meat and fresh bread and then friar tuck led us in the christ mass offering comfort and solace to our exiled souls we prayed with our good priest and felt gods pleasure in our prayers it was as we were singing a last hymn the wind shifted coming around to the west and bringing with it the scent of smoke yes odo i sigh at his interruption it is not in any way unusual to smell smoke in a forest in most forests there are always people burning things branches and twigs to make charcoal or render lard clear land what have you but the forest of the march is different from any other forest ive ever known and thats a fact my monkish friend cannot understand what i am saying to him a forest is a forest one stand of trees is that much like another see here i say coed cadw is ancient and it is wilddark and dangerous as a cave filled with vipers the forest of the march has never been conquered much less tamed you would call a forest tame he wonders at this scratching the side of his nose with his quill oh aye most forests in the land have been subdued in one way or another mastered long ago by mencleared for farmsteads harvested for timber and husbanded for game but coed cadw is still untouched see why there are trees that were old when king arthur rallied the clans to the dragon flag and pools that have not seen sunlight since joseph the tin planted his church on this island its true i can see he doesnt believe me odo lad i vouch in my most solemn voice there are places in that forest so dark and doomful even wolves fear to treadbelieve that or dont i dont but i begin to see what you mean he says and we move on well as i say we are all of us in fine festive fettle and about to sit down to a feast provided mostly at abbots hugos expense when one of the women remarks that something has caught fire for a moment shes the only one who can smell it and then a few more joined her and before we knew it we all had the stink of heavy timber smoke in our nostrils soon enough smoke began to drift into the glade from the surrounding wood in grey snaking ropes it came feeling its way around the boles of trees flowing over roots and rocks searching like ghost fingers touching and moving on those of us seated at the table rose as one and looked to the west where we saw a great mass of slateblack smoke churning up into the winter sky even as we stood gaping at the sight ash and cinders began raining down upon us someone gave out a cry and bran climbed onto the board he stood with hands upraised commanding silence peace he said remain calm we will not fear until there is cause to fear and then we will bind courage to our hearts and resist turning to the men he said iwan siarles fetch the bows will tomas rhoddi follow me we will go see what mischief is taking place to the others he said those who remain behind gather supplies and make ready to leave in case we must flee cel craidd be careful will said noin biting her lip a little work before dinner i replied trying to make my voice sound light and confident although the smoke thickening and ash raining down on our heads filled me with dread ill be back before you know it iwan and siarles returned and passed out the bows and bundles of arrows i slung the strung bow over my chest and tied a sheaf of arrows to my belt leaving the folk in the care of angharad and the friar we departed on the run we followed the drift of the smoke as the wind carried it from the blaze and with every step the darkness grew as the smoke clouds thickened before long we had to stop and wet the edges of our cloaks and pull them fast around our faces to keep from breathing the choking stuff we pressed on through the weird twilight and soon began to see the flicker of orange and yellow flames through the trees ahead the fire produced a wind that gusted sharply and we felt the heat lapping at our hands and faces the roar of the blaze like the surge of waves hurled onto the shore drowned out all other sound this way urged bran veering off the track at an angle towards the wall of fire working quickly and quietly we came around to a place where the fire had already burned and there standing on the charred stillsmouldering earth stood a body of ffreinc soldierseight of them loitering beside a wagon pulled by two mules and heaped with casks of oil some of them carried torches the rest held lances and shields all were dressed for battle with round steel helmets and swords strapped to their belts their shields leaned against the wagon bed we dropped to the ground and wormed back out of sight behind the screen of smoke and flames sheriff s men spat siarles trying to burn us out observed tomas and on christmas day the sots not very friendly id say shall we take them bran asked rhoddi not yet bran decided not until we know how many more are with them turning to me and rhoddi he said you two go with iwan siarles and tomas come with me go all the way to the end and take a good lookhe pointed off into the wood where the wall of flame burned brightestand then come back here we will do the same rhoddi and i fell into step behind iwan and the three of us made our way along the inside of the fiery wall as it were until after a few hundred paces we reached the end keeping low to better stay out of the smoke we crawled on hands and knees to peer around the edge of the flames ten ffreinc soldiers were working this end of the blazetwo with torches and three with casks of oil they were sprinkling on the damp underbrush five more stood guard with weapons ready iwan pointed out the one who seemed to be the leader of the company and we withdrew hurrying back to the meeting place bran and iwan spoke briefly together we will take the first group here and now bran told us unslinging his bow then we will take the others iwan drew three arrows from the cloth bag fan out he told us indicating the spread with three jerks of his hand and loose on my signal we all drew three shafts and crept into position halting at the edge of the flame wall the ffreinc were still watching the fire their faces bright when i saw iwan fit an arrow to the string i did likewise when he stood i stood he drew and so did i now he said his voice low but distinct six shafts streaked out from the wood crossing the burned clearing in a wink four soldiers dropped to the ground the two remaining menatarms had no time to wonder what had happened to the other fellas before they could raise their shields or look around winged death caught them lifted them off their feet and put them on their backspierced through with two shafts each then it was a fleetfooted race to the further end of the flame wall the fire was burning hotter as more of the underbrush and wood took light drawing wind to itself and spitting it out in fluttering gusts the smoke was heavy we clutched our cloaks to our faces and made our way as best we could stumbling halfblind through the murk to take up new positions the flames were now between us and the ffreinc we could see the soldiers moving as through a shimmering curtain imagine their surprise when out from this selfsame curtain flew not frightened partridges to grace the christmas board but six sizzling shafts tipped with stinging death four of the arrows found their marks and three marchogi toppled into the snow a fifth shaft ripped through a soldiers arm and into the cask in the hands of the fella behind him the amazed soldier dropped the cask dragging down his companion who was now securely nailed to the top of the cask ready said iwan placing another arrow on the string and leaning into the bow as he drew and took aim now six more arrows sped through the highleaping flames and four more ffreinc joined the first four on the ground the remaining two however reacting quickly threw themselves down pulling their shields over them thinking to protect themselves this way but iwan and siarles pressing forward as far as the flames would allow each sent a shaft pelting into the centre of the shields one glanced off taking the edge of the shield with it the other shaft struck just above the boss and penetrated all the way through and into the neck of the soldier cowering beneath it the last fella crouching behind his shield tried to back away bran knelt quickly and holding the bow sideways loosed a shaft that flashed out of the flames speeding low over the ground it caught the retreating soldier beneath the bottom edge of the shield pinning the mans ankles together he fell screaming to the snow and lay there moaning and whimpering we held our breath and waited when no more soldiers appeared we began to imagine it safe to leave what are we to do about the fire i asked we cannot fight it siarles replied well have to let it go and hope for the best we will watch it iwan said if it spreads or changes direction we should know bran looked back through the curtain of flame towards the fallen soldiers i did not see the sheriff turning to us he said did anyone see the sheriff no one had seen him of course for just as the question had been spoken there came a shout and from the nightdark wood behind us mounted knights appeared lances couched crashing up out of the brush where they had been hidden chapter i saw the spearheads gleam sharp in the firelight and the fire glow red on the helmets of the knights and chamfers of the horses as they clattered up out of the brake i tried to count and made it eight or ten of them closing fast they were that near we had time but to pull once and loose in less time than it takes to catch a breath our arrows streaked out the stinging whine followed by a slap and crack like that of a whip as steel heads met padded leather jerkin and then ring mail piercing both the force of the blow lifted two hardcharging riders from the saddle and sent a third backwards over the rump of his horse before the onrushing knights could check their mounts we each had another shaft on the string iwan took the foremost knight and i took the one behind him bran changed his aim at the last instant and sent a shaft into the breast of a charger that had already lost its rider the oncoming horses legs tangled and it stumbled taking down the two horses behind it as well the knights tried to quit the saddle before their steeds rolled on them but only one avoided the crush the other was lost in a heap of horseflesh and churning hooves i pulled another arrow from my sheaf and nocked it but did not have time to aim i threw myself to the ground as a lance blade swept the place lately occupied by my head as i scrambled to my feet a trumpet sounded i looked to the sound as at least eight more knights came bounding from the wood with marshal gysburne leading the charge slow cart that i am it was only then that i understood we had been caught in a neatly spread net and the ends were about to close on us bran had already seen it fall back he shouted but there was nowhere to flee behind us was a wall of burning trees and brush ahead a swarm of angry soldierseach one in a bloodrage to take our heads the trumpet sounded again and there he was sir richard de glanville the devil himself looking powerfully pleased with his surprise he swept out of the darkness flanked by two knights holding torches and i do believe he imagined that at the very sight of him the fight would go out of us for as he emerged from the dark wood he called out in english the others looked to me he says we must surrender but that quarter will be given siarles spat and put an arrow on the string iwan said we ask no quarter raising his bow siarles said shall i make reply lord bran nodded give him our answer before bran had even finished speaking the shaft was on its way the sheriff anticipating such a response was ready having faced a welsh bowman before he had provided himself with a small round shield clad in iron plate as siarles arrow seared across the flameshot distance de glanville threw his heavy round shield before him taking the blow on the iron boss there was a spark as metal struck metal and the sturdy oak shaft shattered from the impact there was no time for a second flight for at that moment a second body of knights charged in on the flank i could not count them i saw only a rush out of the darkness as the horses appeared we all loosed arrows at will sending as fast as we could draw three knights were despatched that quick and two more followed before the first were clear of the saddle then with the horses on top of us it was time to flee this way cried bran edging back and back towards the burning trees and brusha place even the besttrained norman horses would not willingly go through there said bran already starting towards a gap between two burning elm trees pulling his cloak over his head he darted through the narrow firefilled space as through a flaming arch siarles and rhoddi followed iwan tomas and i made good their escape sending another shaft each into the mounted soldiers as they wheeled and turned to get a good run at us then it was our turn to face the fire pulling my cloak over my head i bent low and ran for the flames diving headlong between the two elms i felt the heat lick out scorching the cloth of my cloak and then i was through to the other side tomas was not so fortunate he got a little too close and his cloak caught fire he came through in a rush shouting and crying that he was burning alive i grabbed him and threw him down on the ground rolling him until the flames were out he was singed and his cloak was blackened a little along the hem in the back but he was unharmed to me shouted bran through the flames he had seen the marchogi regrouping as i took my place beside him i could hear the sheriff rallying his men on the other side of the flame wall take the horses with that he sent a shaft through the shimmering flames into the indistinct shapes that were the ffreinc knights and their horses the arrow found a target for at once a knight gave out a cry soon we were all at it braving the heat and smoke to stand and deliver death and havoc from out of the flames again and again i drew and loosed working in rhythm with the others we made good account of ourselves i thinkthough it was hard to be sure as we could not always see where our shafts went but by the time the soldiers had regrouped and come charging around the end of the flame wall there were far fewer than there had been just moments before away shouted bran pointing to the wood behind us siarles was already disappearing into the scrub at the edge of the clearing bran followed on his heels time to run for it said iwan loosing one last shaft he turned and fled i slung my bow and pushed tomas ahead of me saying go run dont lose them we crossed the smouldering ground leaping over the bodies of the soldiers we had killed before the sheriff had tipped his hand while tomas dived into the underbrush i cast a glance over my shoulder as the knights came pounding into the clearing by the time sheriff de glanville took command of the field he found it occupied only by his own dead menatarms lying where theyd fallen in the melted snow his voice sounded sharp in the cold night air i fancied i could hear the disappointment and frustration as he began calling for his men to start searching the area for our tracks that much i got anyway the luck of cain to em i thought the ground was that chewed upwhat with the soldiers setting fires and alli did not think theyd be able to find our trail in a month of christmases but we did not wait to find out from the cover of the wood we sent some more arrows into them killing some wounding others the sheriff realising the battle was now beyond winning called the retreat they fled back the way they had come and since our arrows were mostly spent we let them go they might return bran said and ordered us all to scatter and work our way around the blaze confuse your trail and make certain you are not followed then fly like ravens for the roost i put my head down and lit out through the dark winter wood keeping the blaze on my left i worked my way slowly and carefully around until id coursed half the circle then faded back along a deer run that took me near to the bottom of the ridge protecting cel craidd after a time picking my way carefully through a hedge of brambles and hawthorn i reached the foot of the ridge and paused to listen kneeling beside a rock to rest a moment before continuing i heard nothing but the night wind freshening the tops of the larches and pines the fire still stained the night sky tinting the smoke a dull rusty red but it was less fierce now already the blaze was dying out overhead there were patches of winter sky showing through the clouds and stars glimmering bright as needle pricks the air was cold and crisp as i started up the snowcovered slope it came to me that this attack signalled a change in our fortunes we had beaten the sheriff this time but it was just the beginning next time he would come with more men and still more there would be no stopping him now chapter in the bleak heart of midwinter with the snow deep and white the air cold and still it seemed as if the greenwood awaited the coming of the new year with breath abated we of the raven flock held our breath too waiting and watching through the night and all the next day bran doubled the number of watchers on the road and set others in a surrounding ring around coed cadw but the sheriff and his men did not return the evening of the day after the attack lord bran summoned his advisors to his hut wary and uncertain still we gathered iwan siarles merian tuck and myself took our places around the small hearth in the centre of his hut we have rattled the hornets in their nest iwan pointed out as we settled to discuss what had happened the night before and what it might mean that much is plain as your big feet replied siarles where is angharad wondered merian she should be with us so she should agreed bran but she has begged leave to absent herself not like her observed iwan not like her at all is she well asked tuck i could go see her she is well replied bran adding but the raid last night has disturbed her mightily she did not foresee it nor did any of us pointed out tuck no but our hudolion feels she should have sensed it she is going to her cave to learn the reason andhe lifted the ring on its string around his neckto learn more of this lovely trinket the gold shone with a fine lustre and the jewels gleamed even in the dim light of the hut tuck took one look at the heavy gold bauble and cried lord have mercy where did you get that bran explained about the raid on the supply train tuck sucked his teeth shaking his head all the while i do not wonder angharad is distressed you have called down the wrath of baron de braose upon your silly heads my friends tapping the ring with a finger to watch it swing he added he wants it back and now you have made it worth his while to find you this wasnt all said iwan show him the rest merian fetched a small box which she opened drawing out the richly embroidered gloves and passing them to the friar well well lookee here chirped the priest what a fine pair of mittens seizing them he pulled them tightly over his chubby hands and held them up for all to see goatskin if im not mistaken he said and made in france i shouldnt wonder he withdrew his hands and stroked the leather flat again someone will be missing these sorely aye but who asked bran abbot hugo for him wondered tuck possibly it would not surprise me that he holds himself so highly but see here he indicated the cross on the right hand and on the left glove a curious symbol shaped something like a cross but with two extra arms and a closed loop at its head that is the chi rho he told us and most often seen on the vestments of high priests of one kind or another he passed the gloves back to merian if you asked me id say these were made for a prince among priestsan archbishop or cardinal at least then what are they doing here asked iwan perhaps our humble abbot has more exalted ambitions replied bran was there ever any doubt quipped tuck his smooth brow wrinkled with thought ring and gauntlets he mused it must mean something but for the love of peter i cannot think what it might be we were hoping you would have an idea sighed merian nay lass replied the friar you will have to find a better and wiser man than the one that sits before you to get an answer there is one other thing said bran reaching into the box he brought out the square of parchment and passed that to the priest in the hurlyburly of the feast and later attack i had mostly forgotten all about that thick folded square of lambskin i looked at it nowi think we all didas the very thing needed to explain the mystery to us why didnt you say you had this said tuck he turned it over in his hands you havent opened it no answered bran you may have the honour we all edged close as the friars stubby fingers fumbled with the blue cord when he had untied it he laid it in his lap and looked around at the circle of faces hovering above him if we break this he said fingering the wax seal there is no going back break it commanded bran it has already cost the lives of a score of men or more we will see what it is that the abbot and sheriff value at such a high price drawing a breath tuck cracked the heavy wax seal and carefully unfolded the parchment spreading it before him on the rushstrewn floor of the hut what is it asked iwan what does it say said siarles shh hissed merian give the man a chance to tuck she said take your time then when he appeared to do just that she added well what does it say lifting his face he shook his head bad news wondered bran i dont know replied the priest slowly bran leaned close what then god knows tuck lifted the parchment to pass around it is written fair enough but not in latin i cannot read the bloody thing are you certain i think so i read little enough latin to be sure but i cannot make out a word of that he shook his round head i dont know what it is we passed the parchment hand to hand and as it came to me i saw the entire surface covered with a fine flowing script in dark brown ink as i had never acquired the knack of readingnot english nor latin eitheri had nothing to say about it but it seemed to me that the words were well formed the letters long and gracefulit put me in mind of ivy and how it loops and curls around all it touches the skin was finegrained and well prepared there were hardly any grease smudges or ink spatters at all i think it is ffreinc merian decided holding it up to the light and bending her head close i can speak it well enough but i have only seen it written once or twice mind she concluded it looks very like ffreinc to me yes well that would make sense mused tuck taking back the parchment the two of them proceeded to examine it closely tracing various letters with their fingers and muttering over it see here that is a d said tuck and that an i followed by e and u he paused to string together what hed found deeaoo he said god exclaimed merian dieu means god she put her finger on a letter what is that tuck peered hard at the script i think it might be an s he said with an a f ah no that might be an l u t he continued picking out letters one by one and uttered the word as he did so i followed some of this but my small store of ffreinc was of the more rough and ready sort spoken in the market not the court or church and it soon left me trailing far behind salutations said merian before he finished greetings she beamed happily salutations dans dieu she said greetings in godthat must be it tuck agreed i think so that would be expected said iwan what else the two continued trying to scry out the letters and make words of them that merian knew and though they succeeded in guessing several more they fell far short of the mark and were forced to give up in the end leaving us little the wiser for the effort we know it is ffreinc at least said bran that is something well whatever is in that letter said tuck tapping the sheepskin with his finger you can be sure the baron will be missing it i think de braose wants his treasures back oh aye affirmed iwan and hes willing to risk good men to get them tuck nodded thoughtfully mark me there is a dread mystery here you would be wise to return these things as soon as possible he concluded before any more blood is shed that i will not do declared bran at least not until i know what it is we have found if de braose considers it worth an army to recoverhe smiled suddenlyperhaps it is worth more a castle suggested siarles perhaps allowed bran maybe even a kingdom and no odo i say with a sigh i cannot read not even my own name when it is writ then again thane aelred couldnt read a whit either nor any of his vassals saving the monks at the abbey and he was a towering oak of a man bless him oh smirks he but there is nothing to it once you have the learning i could teach you he says hopeful as a puppy well then odo me lad i tell him one day when i have the leisure of a cleric as you most certainly do i shall let you teach me to read now where was i bran considered the ring of great value replies odo i lick my lips and rumble on the next day when angharad learned what tuck had revealed about the parchment she thanked bran for telling her gave him a few words of advice and took her leave pulling on her cloak she bunged a few leftovers from our truncated feast into a leather bag slung on her back took up her staff and departed cel craidd then and there some of us saw her leave is she angry tomas asked she seems fair put out with the world i dont know i replied maybe where is she going she has a cave somewhere in the greenwood said huw one of the elder grellon she goes there of a time to think well the sheriff s attack had cast a shadow of gloom over our nonetoohappy home i can tell you as soon as angharad left bran hived himself in his hut with iwan and tuck to decide what to do next god with you will said merian coming to stand beside me and with you my lady i answered she rubbed her hands to warm them i wonder what they will decide difficult to say weighty decisions require patience and pondering aplenty do you think it dangerous this ring i think it valuable and that is usually danger enough i nodded towards the hut i think tuck is right when he says there is a dread mystery in the thing as we were talking i caught sight of someone out of the corner of my eye i looked across the clearing to see noinina disappearing between two huts she cast a last look over her shoulder as she moved from view something about her expression as she passed out of sight gave me to think she had been watching merian and me and did not approve not one tiny little scrap it was just the merest glimmer of a glance to be sure still it gave me a curious warmth that lasted throughout the day the king and his advisors emerged a short time later what was decided i asked iwan as he came out to join us we will take the treasure to saint tewdrigs for safekeeping as angharad has advised he told me we will also show the letter to bishop asaph perhaps he or one of his monks can read it and tell us something about how and why this ring has come to elfael that sounds a sensible plan merian remarked i nodded my agreement good i said im glad you approve scarlet he answered turning on his heel and walking backwards a step or two because its you thats going chapter in less time than it takes a fella to lace up his boots i was on my way i suppose others reckoned that as a halfsaxon with a snip of ffreinc under my belt i could more easily pass among the normans as a wandering labourerwhich is what i was until joining king ravens flock this decision did not sit well with at least one member of our band siarles got it into his thick head that i was more affliction than remedy and asked to be allowed to accompany me after a brief discussion it was agreed that siarles who had been to the monastery before and knew the way would go with me to act as guide we were given a deerskin bundle containing the ring and gloves and the parchment in its wrap which we were to take to the bishop at saint tewdrigs and learn whatever we could from the monksthey being men of learning might know how to read the letter and could be trusted to hold their peace about whatever there was that might be gleaned the rest of the treasure was to be placed with them for safekeeping if the sheriff or any of his men catch you with these things bran warned the flat of his hand on the parcel as he handed it to siarles they will hang you for thievesand that is the least they will do stay sharp and hurry back with all speed my lord i replied this skin of mine may be poor quality as some would judge but it is my own and i have grown to love it rest assured i will not risk it foolishly i might have added that noin also had a definite interest in seeing me return hale and whole there is yet one thing more said tuck he had been standing beside bran listening to the instructions hear me if you will hear me everyone silence called bran friar tuck will speak when all had quieted he said the ring has value and therefore power does it not it may be that god has given it to us to aid in the redemption of elfael brothers and sisters all we must hold tight to this hope and guard it with a mighty strength of purpose therefore know that this is a solemn charge that has been laid upon you will and siarles he regarded siarles and me with a commanding stare you take our lives in your hands when you leave this place see you do nothing that would endanger them or there will be hell to pay is this understood we nodded our assent but he would have more say it he insisted pledge it on your honour this we did and tuck declared himself satisfied he turned to bran and said we have done what we can do now it is for god to do as he will do raising his hands high he said i pray the lord of hosts to send an army of angels to guard you every step of the way to smooth your path in the rough world and bring you safely home amen and god with you amen noin and i shared a kiss of farewell she clutched me tight and whispered come back to me will scarlet i have grown that fond of you i will come back noin never fear with that we took leave of our king and rode out taking a path that was only rarely used by the grellon the trail which was tangled and overgrown in many places would lead us north a fair distance where once well away from cel craidd we would double back to the norman lands of the south and east it was decided that we should stay off the kings road so as to avoid any travellers especially norman soldiers for two days we made our slow way through the winterland and shivered in a frosty silence as we moved through a world bleached white by the snow and coldthe stark bloodred berries of holly and the deep green strands of ivy twining round boles of elm and oak the only hues that met our colourstarved eyes the forest of the march seemed to slumber beneath its thick mantle although here and there we saw the tracks of deer and pigs sometimes those of wolves and other creaturesthe long slashing strides of the hare and the light skittery tracings of mice and squirrels overhead we heard the creak and crack of cold boughs and branches and the occasional twit and chirp of birds interested in our passing but these were the only things to relieve the dull sameness of the slumbering greenwood nor was siarles the easiest companion a man might choose shorttempered and quick to judge easily stirred to anger or despair in character steadfast in mood as changeable as waterhe is cymry through and through siarles is poor fella he is one of gods creatures that is happiest when most miserable and should he lack sufficient cause for misery an imaginary source is all too easily conjured for some reason he had taken against me from that first day i dropped out of the tree by days end i reckoned i had endured enough of his rudeness siarles my friend there is a boil of contention between us as wants lancing so you say i do say it you act like a fella with bees in his breeches every time we meet for the life of me i cannot think why that should be nevertheless i know an unhappy man when i see one and here i have one in my eye i am not unhappy he said his whole face puckered in a petulant scowl i think you are or if not unhappy then displeased tell me what youve got caught in your craw and i will do my best to help you he glared at me then turned away finish saddling your horse it is time we were on our way no i replied not until you tell me what is wrong with you he turned on me with sudden anger with me he said almost shouting you find fault with me when it is yourself you should be chiding me what have i done he made a sound like the growl of a frustrated dog and turned away again well this is going to be a long day astandin here i told him im not moving until i know your mind he glared at me balefully and i thought he would not speak well what is it to be either we make peace between us or stand here and glower at one another like two stubborn roosters in a yard he snarled again his frustration boundless and i could not help but laugh at the hopelessness of the situation see here siarles my contrary friend youre going to have to give me something more than grunts and growls if we are to get to the meat of the matter so you might as well tell me and get it done i dont like englishmen he grimaced through gritted teeth never have never will half an englishman only i corrected my mother was a briton mind as was your own if you had one you know what i mean bran had no business taking you in no it seems to me that a lord can take a vassal of any fella willing to swear fealty to him i bent the knee to bran right gladly and my word holds fast through fair or foul i declared you wanted to come along because you dont trust me you thought id steal the ring and fly away as soon as i got out of sight he glowered at me and i could see id hit near the mark you dont know what i think he muttered at last yes i do i told him you had a cosy little nest in the greenwood and then along comes this big ol englishman will scarlet stomping all over your tidy garden with his great boots and youre afraid hes going to squash you like a bug siarles frowned and climbed into the saddle but see here i ent about squashing you or anybody else nor usurping em from their rightful place neither am i leaving my sworn liege lord just because you dont like the cut of my cloth lord brans dealings are his own and if that sticks in your gizzard then talk to him dont punish me he turned his mount and rode away i followed a few paces behind giving him space and time hoping he would come round to a better humour sooner or later but though i tried my best to cheer him along and show him i bore no ill feelings over his churlishness his mood did not improve i resolved to ignore his sour disposition and get on with the chore at hand saint tewdrigs in the north is but a short distance beyond the border of elfaela new monastery tucked in the curving arm of a valley across the river close on the border of the cantref i counted five buildings including a small church all of timber arranged in a loose square and surrounded by a low whitewashed wall small fieldsflat squares of snow with barley stubble showing through like an unshaved chinflanked the monastery we crossed one of these and arrived at the gate and pulled the braided bell cord hanging at the gatepost a light clinking ring sounded in the chill air and presently a small door opened within the larger pax vobiscum how can i help you asked the porter he looked blandly at me and then at siarles and his eyes lit with recognition silidons welcome come in come in i will tell father asaph you are here he turned and hurried off across the yard leaving us to stand outside with our mounts which could not pass through the small door silidons i said what is that it was brans idea he said he thought it would be better for the monks if they did not know our real names true enough i reckoned for if the normans suspected the monks knew anything to help them find us they would be in danger deep and dire nor can they sell us out i considered not likely that you must have a high opinion of priests ive known one or two that would not spare a moments thought to trade their mothers to the danes for a jug of ale and two silver pennies the priests you know may be rogues he said but the brothers here can be trusted how do you know they wont go running to the sheriff behind our backs lord bran built this monastery he explained simply that is our bran gave the money so that it could be built asaph was the bishop of llanelli the monastery at caer cadarn before the ffreinc took it and drove the monks out and turned the place into a market town asaph accepts the patronage without asking who gives it i was not really concerned but if id had any fear of betrayal meeting bishop asaph removed even the most niggly qualm the man was like one of those saints of old who have churches named after them white haired and wispy as a willow wand the old man pranced like a goat as he swept us into the holy precinct of the monastery arms afly bare heels flashing beneath his long robe welcoming us even as he berated the porter for leaving us loitering at the gate gods peace my friends all grace and mercy upon you silidons it is good to see you again brother ifor how could you leave our guests standing outside the gate you should always insist they wait inside come in come in bishop asaph said siarles i present to you a friend of mine he hesitated a moment and then saidby the name of goredd odo has stopped to scratch his head he is confused yes i tell him siarles and silidons are one and the same the monks know him as silidons see they know me now as goredd can we get on just one question will one another question then this monastery you speak of in saint tewdrigs where would that lie specifically why it lies exactly on the spot where it stands not a foots breadth to the north nor to the south odo frowns i mean to say it sounds a pagan name would you know the french i let my temper flare at him noi would not if the ffreinc will insist on renaming every village and settlement willynilly it is unreasonable of them to expect honest men such as myself to commit them all to memory and recite them at the drop of a hat if your good abbot wishes to visit the place i suggest that he begin further enquiries in hell odo listens to this with a hurt doglike expression as i finish his hurt gives way to wryness honest men such as you he asks there is more honesty in me than there is in a gaggle of norman noblemen let us not be mistaken odo shrugs and dips his quill after allowing me to cool for a moment he repeats the last line written and we trudge on long robes flapping around his spindly shanks the old bishop led us across the yard for all his joy at seeing us a doleful mood seemed to rest heavy on the place and i wondered about it the brother stabler took our horses away to be fed and watered and the bishop himself prepared our rooms which i believe had never been used they were spare and smelled of whitewash and the beds were piled with thick new fleeces i see they dont get many visitors i observed to siarles when asaph had gone the monastery is new still he allowed and since the ffreinc came to elfael not many people travel this way anymore one of the brothers brought a basin of water and some soap for us to wash away the last few days of travel siarles and i took turns splashing our faces and rinsing our hands in the basin before joining the bishop for refreshment in his quarters above the building they called a refectory we eat a meal after evening prayers asaph informed us but travel is hungry work he stretched a hand towards the table that had been prepared for us so please my friends take a little something to keep body and soul together until then we thanked him and filled our wooden bowls from the fare on offer boiled eggs and sliced sheeps cheese and cold mutton there was some thin aleno doubt the best they hadand fresh buttermilk we sat down to eat and the bishop drew his chair near the table you must tell me the news he said his tone almost pitiful how does our benefactor fare never better siarles answered he looks forward to the day when he can visit you himself and he sends me with this token of his earnest goodwill for your work here with that siarles produced a small leather bag of coins from his purse and placed it on the table before the cleric the bishop smiled and thanking god and us both opened the bag and poured out a handful of silver pennies tell your lord that this will go far towards easing the burden of the poor hereabouts the ffreinc press everyone so very hard here he faltered and looked away father i said you look like a fella who has just bit his tongue rather than speak his mind why not tell us what is wrong things are bad just nowworse than ever before indeed asked siarles what has happened asaph tried to talk but could not siarles passed him a cup of the watery ale and said drink some of that down and maybe it will help loosen the words he drank and placed the cup carefully on the table before him as if he was afraid it might shatter i do not know how it came about he said when he had found his voice again but something of great value to the count has gone missing they are saying it was stolen by the creature called king raven we have heard of this i told him to encourage him and keep him talking now that he had begun what has the count done he has taken prisonersmen and boyspulling them out of their beds in the dead of night a decree has gone out he says he will start hanging them on twelfth night the great steaming pile exclaimed siarles the bishop turned large sad eyes on us one man or boy each day at sunset until what was stolen is returned that is what count de braose has said how this will end god only knows so that was it when their attempt to burn us out failed the cowardly ffreinc turned to those unable to defend themselves how many i asked how many has he taken i dont know said the bishop fifty or sixty they say the ageing cleric drew both hands down his face and shook his head in despair god help us he murmured you know what they say siarles told him king raven only takes back what was stolen in the first place no doubt it is the same with whatever was taken this time what is that odo did the old bishop know that king raven was his mysterious benefactor i give him a fishy smile do i look such a fool that you think you can trap me so easily think again my scribbling friend will cannot be drawn i regard him with his smoothshaved pate and his inkstained fingers what do you think i think he must have known odo says a man knows whose largess keeps him does he now i crow do you know who keeps you monk god keeps me replies the monk his sanctimony nigh insufferable ha its abbot hugo keeps you priestand youre as much a captive as will scarlet ever was hugo owns you as much as he owns the food you put in your mouth and the bed you sleep in at nightdont think he doesnt see here our bishop asaph is not a stupid man only a right fool would pry into things that could bring ruin if all was known then he is a sinner concludes odo loftily a sinner i repeat how so receiving the benefit of money acquired by theft makes a thief of any who accept it is that right i say is that what they teach in the monkery it is oh he is so smug in his righteousness sometimes i want to throttle him with the belt around his sagging middle well i allow you may be right but tell me which is the greater theftstealing a mans purse or his homeland stealing is stealing he replies smoothly it is all the same in gods eyes gods eyes i will give you gods eyes odo get out we are finished i will speak no more today he looks at me with a hurt expression out with you i roar leave me he rises slowly and blows on the parchment and rolls it you take offence where none was offered he sniffs i merely point out the churchs position in the matter of theft whichas we all know is a mortal sin well and good but this is war you scurvy toad and war makes thieves of all good men who would oppose the cruel invader there is no war declares my weakeyed scribe his sanctimony is boundless there is only rebellion to the established rule out i cry and pick up a handful of mouldy straw from the damp floor of my cell i fling the clump at him out and do not come back he turns to go showing as much haste as i have ever seen in him but at the door he hesitates if i do not return the hangman comes the sooner let him come i shout i welcome him i would rather listen to him raising his gibbet than you telling me about the established rule for the love of the holy virgin odo it is a rule established in blood on a stolen throne so now who is the saint and who the sinner he ducks his head as he steps through the ironclad door of my cell and slinks away into the darkness i lie back and close my eyes sweet lord jesus i pray let my enemies kill me or set me free chapter odo has not come today and i begin to think that he has taken me at my word perhaps he has gone to our false abbot with my rantings and hugo has decided to be done with me at last if odo does not come tomorrow i will send for him and make my shrift a lame piece of priesthood he may be but in truth i do not trust anyone else in this nest of vipers to hear my confession odo can do that at least and though he riles me no end i know he will see me right i hear from my keeper gulbertor is it gibbertthat the wet weather has passed and the sun has returned this is good news it may be that my damp pit will dry out a littlenot that olwill plans to wear out the world much longer even without my boneheaded outburst the abbots patience must be growing thin as his mercy from all accounts he was never a fella to suffer long to begin with so now my execution day must be drawing nigh but what is this there is a muffled scrabbling in the corridor beyond my cell hushed voices and then the familiar slow shuffling footfall good daywill scarlet says odo as he appears at the door god with you his voice is that much strained as if addressing a stroppy stranger this day is almost done my friend i say to put him at ease well he is the closest thing to a friend i have in this forsaken place ill say good evening and god bless he makes no move to open the door but stands in the narrow stone corridor are you coming in then i ask no it will be dark soon and i could not get any candles i see the abbot does not know i am here he has forbidden me to listen to you he has had enough of my ravings and ramblings i suppose oh no odo is quick to assure me it is that he has gone and does not want me talking to you while he is away gone where has he gone i am not to say odo replied but continued anyway there is an envoy from rome visiting some of the towns hereaboutsa spaniard a father dominic abbot wishes him to visit so he has ridden out to find him i see i suck my teeth and give him a shrug to show i will not try to pry any more out of him well then odo bites his lip he has something more to tell me but cannot yet trust himself to speak so i fish a little and see if i can tickle him into my net how long will the abbot be away i cannot say my lord says odo and i smile he does not know what he has said yet give him time he blushes as it comes to him will i mean i chuckle at his small mistake he has begun to think of me as a nobleman and his superior no harm monk i tell him it is just that there are a few things i do not understand only a few i laugh then you are a better man than i in your story i mean it is not a story odo i tell him it is a mans lifeim telling my life and we both know how its going to end see you remember that he looks at me blinking his big soft eyes well the abbot has said we are not to pursue our tale any further just now ah i see so i should be on my way he stands flatfooted and hunched in the cramped corridor he says he cannot stay and yet he will not leave something holds him here well perhaps i suggest lightly the abbot would not mind if you spent a little time stalking the understanding that eludes you it is for the abbots benefit after all odo brightens at once do you think so oh aye who else cares about the ravings of a wild outlaw this is exactly what i was thinking says he it would do no harm to clarify a few of the detailsclear up any misunderstandings for the abbots benefit for the abbots benefit of course odo nods making a firm decision for once in his soft pudding of a life good i will come tomorrow then he smiles pleased with himself and revelling in this milkmild defiance he turns to go but lingers gods peace this night will and also with you i reply as off he scuttles there may be hope for odo yet please god although the ending is in sight there is of course much more of this tale this life to be told how i came to be in this pinch for onebut i will not tell this to odo not yet distraction may be my best weapon just nowindeed my only weapon i must distract our ambitious abbot as long as i can to buy king raven time to work and achieve his purpose and it is all to do with that blasted ring and infernal letter jobs bones i would not be here now if not for that stupid bloody treasure it will be the death of me beyond a doubt truth be told i fear it will be the death of many before this dreadful tale is done chapter vale of elfael marshal guy de gysburne leaned against the freshly daubed wall of saint martins new tax house and took in his first sight of the latest arrivals sparring at the edge of the square seven soldiersthree knights and four menatarmsthey were the first muster of abbot hugos personal army arguing that no abbot worthy of the name could long exist without a bodyguard to protect him as he performed his sacred office in a blighted wilderness full of hostile and bloodthirsty barbarians abbot hugo had prevailed upon baron de braose to send troops for his protection and gysburne had no doubt prestige indeed the abbot seemed determined to create his own fiefdom within elfael right under de braoses long aristocratic nose having arrived while gysburne was away visiting his father in the north country the seven newcomers had spent the last few days practising and idling in the towns market square as sir guy watched them now he found little to dislike though they were young men judging from the way each deftly lunged and parried all were skilled in their weapons guy supposed that they had received their training in aquitaine or angevin before being recruited to join the barons forces indeed they reminded him of himself only a few short years ago keen as the steel in their hands for a chance to prove themselves and win advancement in the barons favour not to mention increased fortune for themselves all the same it would have surprised guy if any of the newcomers had ever drawn human blood with their painstakingly oiled and sharpened blades much less fought in a battle god willing that would come just now however it was time to make the acquaintance of his new army on a whim guy decided to take them hunting a day in the saddle would give him a chance to see what manner of men they were and it would do the fresh soldiers good to learn something of the territory that was their new home he walked out to meet his men in the square to me he called using the rally cry of the commander in the field the soldiers stopped their practice and turned to see the lanky fairhaired marshal striding across the square lord gysburne shouted one of the knights to his fellows put up lord gysburne has returned the others stopped their swordplay and drew together to meet their commander at your service lord said the foremost knight a bullnecked broadshouldered youth who like the others had the thick wrists and slightly bowed legs of one who has spent most of his short life on the back of a horse with a sword in his hand the others guy noted seemed to defer to him as leader of the band and spokesman the sergeant said you were away the young knight explained i thought best to keep our blades busy until you returned he smiled the sun lighting his blue eyes jocelin de turquetil at your service my best regards jocelin replied guy and to you all he said turning to the others welcome to elfael now then if any of the rest of you have names lets hear them they proceeded to introduce themselves around the ring alard osbertwarin ernald baldwin and hamo they spoke with the easy exuberance of men for whom the day held only possibilities never disappointment as guy had surmised two came from angevin and three from the barons lands in aquitaine the others had been born in england but raised in normandie this was their first sojourn in wallia but all had heard of the ferocity of the native britons and were eager to try their strength at arms against them sergeant jeremias appeared in the yard just then and seeing the marshal hurried to greet him god be good to you my lord weve been expecting you these last days i trust you had a peaceful journey entirely uneventful replied guy and your father is well he thrives regarding the soldiers gathered around him he said it seems our ranks have grown in my absence as you see lord marshal agreed jeremias and if i may say so they are second to none the abbot is well pleased then who am i to disagree with the abbot remarked guy and ordered his new cohort to saddle their horses and prepare for a days hunting the soldiers hurried off to ready their mounts leaving the marshal and sergeant in the yard see all is ready instructed guy i must go inform the abbot that i have returned ah said the sergeant no need he is away and not expected back before saint vincents day well then we will just have to struggle on as best we can said guy his heart lifting at the thought of not having to pay court to the abbot for a spell truth be told he did not care much for abbot hugoguy respected him and obeyed him and had vowed to serve him to the best of his ability but he did not like the arrogance vanity and evermoreinsistent demands that were becoming a burden he owed hugo a great deal for taking his part and saving him following that first disastrous encounter with king ravenas the abbot was ever swift to point out the baron would have had the young marshal horsewhipped and driven from his ranks if not for hugos intervention guy knew it was not out of sympathy or compassion for himself that the powergrasping cleric had acted but as with the newly acquired soldiers it was all part of a carefully devised scheme to gain a force of men who answered to no one but abbot hugo alone guy the abbots commander was liking the circumstances of his service less and less in fact the reason for braving the cold journey to the north riding was to see if there might be some place for him in his fathers retinue sadly the state of affairs that had sent him south and forced him to link his fortunes with baron de braose remained unaltered there was no living to be had in the north and as he had long ago discovered it was too far away from the dance of power and influence attending the king and his courtwhich was the only hope of the landless lord for advancement or even a living marshal guy de gysburne still needed the abbot because he still needed the baron and ultimately the king but he was determined that when a better situation presented itself he would not hesitate to seize it for now however the prospect of commanding a new company of men was an agreeable development and one he determined to bend to his own advantage after taking a few mouthfuls of wine and some bread the knights mounted their horses and rode out striking north from the town towards the shaggy hills and great encircling arms of the forest the day was brisk and the sky speckled with greyedged clouds which passed as shadows over the smooth green snowspattered hillsides before them the soldiers glad for a chance to explore the unfamiliar territory of their new home galloped through the long grass exulting in the strength of the horses beneath them they reached the edge of the forest found the entrance to a game run and entered the long dim treelined tunnel the path was wide and they rode easily along each with a spear ready in case they caught a glimpse of a stag or doe or some other creature to give them a good chase but though they followed the trail as it coursed deeper into the heart of the greenwood the wouldbe hunters found nothing worthy of their sport and as the day began to wane guy signalled to jocelin riding ahead that it was time to turn toward home loath to come away without bloodying his spear jocelin suggested my lord let us ride on to the top of the ridge just there if we havent found any fresh tracks by then we will turn back the trail is cold today guy replied and i am getting hungry leave it he said turning his mount to begin the ride back and save a stag or two for another day the soldiers followed reluctantly and as soon as they had quit the forest once more the ride became a race letting their horses have their heads they flew over the low hills towards the lowsinking sun guy unwilling to restrain their high spirits any longer let them go shall i call them back asked jeremias reining in beside the marshal as the last of the soldiers disappeared over the crest of the hill no sergeant it would serve no purpose guy answered they will have their ride and feel better for it the two proceeded at an easy trot until reaching the place where they had seen the last rider they heard shouts and cries echoing up from the valley below little more than a crease between two slopes the valley angled away towards the south and east broadening slightly before ending in a rocky outcrop there in the centre of this closeset defile was a welsh herdsman with his cattle the soldiers had the man and his few forlorn beasts surrounded and were attempting to separate them from each other darting this way and that their horses wheeling and plunging they charged and charged again as the frantic welshman tried to keep his frightened cows together as marshal guy and his sergeant watched one of the terrified animals broke from the herd and ran bawling along the valley floor jocelin gave out a wild whoop and set out after the beast he quickly closed on his quarry and with a quick thrust of his lance drove the spearhead into the cows side the poor creature bellowed the more as the soldier speared it again and yet again the cow crashed to its knees and still bawling rolled onto its side as the soldier galloped past wheeling his mount the knight returned to deliver the killing blow with a quick thrust between the dying cows ribs and into its heart seeing this was all the fun to be had the other knights followed their comrades example ignoring the shouts and cries of the herdsman the ffreinc soldiers quickly cut another cow from the herd and drove it screaming down the valley to its eventual slaughter the third a young bullock gave a good account of itself turning on its attacker and raking its horns along the pursuing horses flanks and causing the soldier to abandon the saddle before being killed where it stood by the uninjured but angry knight i shall stop this my lord before it goes too far said jeremias as a fourth cow was cut out and just as swiftly slaughtered he lifted the reins and made to ride on hold said guy putting out a hand to restrain him there is little enough harm in it and they are almost finished it is the only sport theyve had since they came out here the herdsman beside himself at what was happening to his cattle happened to glimpse the marshal and sergeant watching from the hilltop and decided to take his appeal to them he started up the slope shouting and waving his arms to be recognized one of the ffreinc knights saw the farmer starting away and rode him down the welshman tried to evade his pursuer but the knight was quicker turning his spear butt first he struck the fleeing herdsman from behind knocking him to the ground where he squirmed in pain until the knight gave him a solid thump on the head and he lay still when the last animal had been slaughtered lord guy rode down to join his troops bon chance he said regarding the carnage seven head of cattle lay dead on the valley floor along with a stunned herdsman who was holding his head and moaning gently it would seem our hunt has provisioned a feast after all jeremias you and the men gut that young bullock and well take it back with us he pointed to another young animal and that heifer as well ill ride ahead and tell the cook to prepare the roasting pit we will eat good welsh beef tonight jeremias looked around at the dead cattle and their wounded herdsman what about the welshman my lord what about him he might make trouble he is in no condition to make trouble that never seems to stop them my lord if he persists then i am certain you will deal with him accordingly marshal guy turned and rode back up the hillside leaving his sergeant and men to their work later gysburne sat on a stump behind the abbey cookhouse watching the bullock turn slowly on the spit while the cook and kitcheners boy basted the roasting meat with juices from the basin nestled in the glowing embers below the carcase the smell of the meat filled the air and made his mouth water he lifted his jar and drank down another healthy draught of new ale yes he thought at times like this he could almost forget that he was stranded in a backward noaccount province awaiting the pleasure of the abbot to advance or deny him although it might have been the ale making him feel benevolent and expansive guy considered that despite his frustration and disappointment perhaps life in the march was not so bad after all at that moment if only thenas the blue winter twilight deepened across the vale of elfael and the voices of the knights chorused rough laughter beneath the glow of a rising moonthat was true chapter i am explaining about bishop asaph and our visit to saint tewdrigs monastery and here is odo frowning it is the ring he wants to hear about only the ring whats wrong now monk i ask him sweet and innocent as a milkmaids smile you look like a fella that mistook a bolt of vinegar for ale i am certain that this bishop of yours is every bit as kind and holy as you claim he complains in that irritating whine that he uses when he thinks he is being longsuffering well then how did the bishop know about the stolen ring how did he know i say odo you dullard the good bishop did not know the first thing about it then why did you go to see him we went to find out what he knew i say and to show him the letter and give him the stolen goods for safekeeping i spread my hands wide in the end he knew nothing about the ring he could not read the letter and would not agree to keep the treasure for us then you discovered exactly nothing concludes odo a wasted journey gods mill grinds slowly my monkish friend but it grinds exceedingly fine our ways are not his ways and theres a rare fact odo makes a sour face then why tell all will come round in good time i say squashing his objection in the egg brother scribe sighs like a broken bellows and we trudge on well as we were alone in the bishops private quarters we soon got down to showing the churchman the letter he confirmed that it was indeed written in ffreinc can you tell us what it says asked siarles hopefully i am sorry my friend said the cleric with a thin smile that skill has defied this old head im afraid can you make nothing of it i said annoyed and more than a little disappointed at having risked so much to come so far for no purpose the old man bent his head to the square of parchment and studied it once more his nose almost touching the surface ah yes here he said stabbing at a word in the middle of the page that is carpe diem latin i said asaph nodded it means seize the dayyou might say an exhortation to be about your work perhaps or to make the most of your present opportunity he shrugged something like that anyway so aside from another scrap or two of latin we were no better off for our trouble save in one respect only we knew that count de braose was that anxious for the return of his stolen goods that he would dare to hang the population of elfael to get it is there nothing else you can tell us asked siarles i am sorry replied the old man as the bell sounded for evening prayers no one here can read ffreinc either he brightened with a thought perhaps one of the monks at saint dyfrigs could help you but having learned about de braoses cruel plans for the men and boys of elfael siarles and i were loath to waste even so much as a day extending a chase that might not succeed we must move on at once my companion told him could you take it father the old man did not like the idea who could blame him it was a cold and dangerous errand we were asking but he was too much in his benefactors debt to say no outright his pale eyes pleaded to be excused and my heart went out to the old fella yet there was no other way even if wed had the time to spare neither of us knew anyone at saint dyfrigs nor which of them might be trusted bishop asaph saw this too i think for in the end he allowed himself to be persuaded to take the letter for us but having agreed to that he would not in any wise agree to hold the rest of the treasure in safekeeping at the monastery this he had decided even though we had not yet shown him the parcel containing the ring and gloves it made no difference the old man would not be moved i dont know what you have or whence it came siarles opened his mouth to tell him but asaph held up his hand to prevent him speaking nor do i wish to know but if something happened and any of those things were found here my monks and those few forlorn souls under my care would suffer for it he shook his head his mouth firm as shepherd of my flock i cannot in good conscience allow it that was that so we ate a hearty supper and took a little nap resting ourselves as well as our horses we were awake again at midnight and lit out under a cold winter moon for cel craidd the twelfth night observance was six days away we had only that much time and no more before the hangings began chapter the sun was already down and a freezing mist was rising with the moon in the east by the time we reached our forest hideaway at cel craidd we had pushed the horses hard all the way and they were almost spent yet the welsh breed a hardy little beast as everyone knows and they lifted their dragging feet once we came in sight of the greenwood because they knew they were almost home the grellon greeted our return with keen interest assembling before the council oak as we rode into the glade i swung down from the saddle searching for the face i suddenly wanted to see above all others and before i could find it was taken by the shoulder and spun around noin i was all i got out before i was immediately folded into a sweetly robust embrace she kissed me once very hard and then again i have missed you will scarlet she put her cheek against mine as she held me close i could feel her shivering beneath her cloak and thought it was not merely from the cold i was afraid something might happen to you ah now nothing that a good nights sleep wont cure i replied lightly clutching her tight to me siarles will bran cried striding across the clearing to greet us tuck iwan and merian followed slipping in the welltrodden snow what news without wasting a breath siarles told bran and all the others about the hangings fifty or sixty stand to forfeit their lives if we do not act quickly it is for us to save them this caused an outcry among the grellon who raised a clamour to be allowed to march on castle truan and free the prisoners that we will not do bran said raising his voice above the shouting he called his council to attend him and for food and drink to be brought to help revive the travellers and we all trooped off to join him in his hut this began a lengthy session of rumination about what we had learned what it might mean and what might be done about it asaph refused to accept the ring and gloves for safekeeping siarles explained returning the leatherwrapped bundle to bran nor could he read the letter but we prevailed upon him to take the parchment to the abbey to see if someone there might help us i offered we would have taken it ourselves but seeing as the abbot means to start hanging half of elfael we thought best to hightail it home you did well bran said it is no doubt what i would have done iwan and the others agreed and they began to discuss the hangings and what could be done to prevent them i endured as long as i could but soon the warmth of the hearth and the food combined to club me over the head and pull me down bran noticed my yawning and thanking me for my diligence in bringing the news so quickly ordered me to go and get some rest creeping from brans hearth i went to noin and found her waiting at her own small fire in her hut little nia was asleep on her mat in the corner and noin was idly feeding twigs into the flames she turned and smiled as i entered they kept you long she said they did but i am here now i settled on the roebuck hide beside her ah i sighed there is nothing like a warm fire and a roof over your head at the end of the day and you a brave forester she chided lightly lifting a warm hand to my face well rest yourself will scarlet she paused and smiled you need not stir until tomorrows light if that is what you wish we kissed then and she nestled in my arms we talked a little thenbut try as i might i could not keep my eyes open i fell asleep with noin in my embrace i awoke the next morning wrapped in her cloak when i sat up who should be watching me but little nia her pixie face shining with some sort of happiness known only to herself hello blossom i said rolling up onto my elbow where has your mam gone the little darling giggled and pointed to the door come here sprite i said holding my arms out to her she needed no coaxing up she jumped and dashed into my arms her bare feet slapping the beaten earth i gave her a hug and settled her in my lap we sat together and broke branches and bits of bark into the coals on the hearth to build up the fire again by the time we had a small blaze going noin returned with freshly baked loaves of barley bread a knob of new butter and a jar of honey she planted a kiss on my rough cheek then busied herself preparing the food to break our fast i must have fallen asleep i said as she spread a cloth on the floor next to the hearth but i dont remember im not surprised she replied you were already halfway gone when you sat down it did not take much to send you on your way im sorry how so you were near worn through from your journey noin smiled more to herself than to me i have no cause to blame you will nor do i that was good enough for me she broke open a steaming loaf slathered it with butter and dribbled honey over it you know i said trying to sound as if i had just thought of it you are a right fine woman who needs a man and i am a fella without a wife if we got married that would fell two birds with a single stone oh would it now she said turning to regard me with a look i could not quite read she folded her hands in her lap what makes you think i care to get married well i i dont know do you she said nothing but tore off a bit of the prepared half loaf and passed it to nia handing the remaining portion to me noin im asking you to be my wife if if youll have me that is shush will i have you do you have to ask she smiled and began buttering the second half of the warm loaf was i not thinking the same thing the moment i laid eyes on you this was news to me were you if youre a man of your wordwill scarlet our friar could marry us tomorrow he could i agreed my head swimming a little at the turn this conversation had taken ive already spoken to him we talked while you were gone and i asked thinking this was all happening far faster than i could have imagined he said he could not do it she replied just like that he said that he would give up holy orders before he allowed the likes of you to tie the knot what he said that i started up climbing to my feet he has no cause to oh sit down you big ox she laughed what do you think he said well knowing him i conceded it might be anything he said he would be honoured to do it we have but to name the day and it is good as done she handed me the bread so what day shall we tell him tomorrow it is i said tomorrow said noin and now the doubt crept into her voice are you certain that is what you want no of course not today that is better still william she cried it cant be today why not i reached for her and pulled her close the sooner the better i say there are things to be done she exclaimed pushing me away eat your bread and stop talking nonsense tomorrow then i reached down and cupped nias face in my hand what do you say snowdrop shall your mam and me get married tomorrow the little mite laughed and hid behind her mothers shoulder see she likes the idea im going to go hunt the biggest stag in the forest for our wedding supperand a boar or two as well listen to you noin said beaming with pleasure at my bold talk eat she pushed a chunk of honeyed bread into my mouth and kissed the sweetness on my lips one day more then i murmured drawing her close and we will be together always oh would that i had said anything but that for the bread and honey was still warm in my mouth when iwan appeared at the door will scarlet are you in there will aye i am i called in reply come in if you can we have bread and honey if youre hungry he opened the narrow plank door and put his head into the hut i dont know what he expected to find oh he said when he saw noin beg pardon i he lowered his eyes with embarrassment i must pull will away lord bran has summoned a council of war that sounds right dire said i taking another bit of bread as i rose to follow him soldiers never rest i sighed and bent to steal another kiss go she said sending me on my way with a quick peck the sooner to return outside i fell into step beside iwan a handsome woman there he said thoughtfully youre that much a lucky man will and i know it pray god i never forget theres some as would have plucked that flower for themselves aye i allowed siarles for one i think but do you mean you would have done likewise the thought occurred to me he confessed but no no he sighed i am too old too old i scoffed jobs bones where did you ever pick up a twoheaded notion like that have you been listening to siarles something like that well it is a wicked falsehood iwan my friend stop up your ears to such odious blather it will fair addle what little is left of the brain god gave you the others were already gathered in brans hut by the time we arrived and we entered to take our places around the hearth angharad had not returned from her sojourn in the cave but tuck took her place on brans right hand with merian at his left i found a place beside the door and waited to see what the others would decide when we were all settled bran nodded to tuck and he began a long invocation tilting his round face towards the unseen heavens he said eternal encompasser fair redeemer holy friend the allwise three in one hear our prayer our enemies are many and their strength is mighty bless our deliberations on this fairest of mornings that we may search your will for us in the days to come and searching find and finding make fast protect us from the foul deceptions of the evil one and from the weapons of all who wish us harm be our fortress and our shield in the hour of our sorest trial his lips moved a moment longer but his voice could no longer be heard in the silence of the moment bran said by the power just bespoken we seek justice for our people and freedom from the usurper and all who would oppress we ask the almighty lord who is ever swift to aid his children to guide us in the task before us and grant us assurance of victory we all added our amens to that and then bran smiled oh he could change quick as water that smile was dark as the fearsome gleam in his eye he was steeped in mischief as any imp and itching to begin spreading discord and disorder among our enemies he was that keen i felt my own blood warm to the chase just the same as if wed been out tramping the forest runs and spotted a fine big stag to bring home there is much we do not know about this he said pulling up the loop on which the ring hung around his neck but i am persuaded that we will not learn more by keeping it here in the forest it has already caused death and destruction i will not stand by and let it harm the people of elfael more than it has already hear him hear him boomed iwan heartily no doubt it had chafed him to remain behind while siarles and i were away and disappointed as we were that our journey had been for naught now that there was a prospect of something to be done he was for it every british scrap of him well and good affirmed tuck and what do you propose to do we will give back the treasures taken in the raid give em back cried siarles my lord think what you are saying bran silenced him with a glance i propose to return them before the sheriff hangs anyone siarles huffed and rolled his eyes but brans smile deepened see here we still have five days until twelfth nightfive days before we give up the treasure he said five days to learn why the ffreinc place such high value on it good said merian that is the most sensible thing i have heard since christmas but if anyone thinks the sheriff will just let you walk into the castle and hand it over you best think again she regarded us with a high and haughty glance well does anyone have any idea how to give back what was stolen without getting hung for a thief does anyone have a plan bran heard the iron in her tone and said you are right to remind us of the danger my lady and have you conceived such a plan as it happens she answered her satisfaction manifest i have and will you yet tell us this plan gladly she answered lowering her shapely head a little in deference to him turning again to those of us gathered around the kings hearth she added however i am certain that once you have heard what i have to say you will contrive an even better banquet on the bare boards i lay before you what did she say asks odo he raises his head and rubs the side of his nose in anticipation that i say with a great gaping yawn must wait until tomorrow oh he whines you did that deliberately to spite me we have talked long brother monk and i am tired i reply drawing a hand down my face leave me to my rest you are a mean and spiteful man will scarlet grumps odo as he gathers up his inkpot and parchment i roll onto my side and face the damp stone wall close the door behind you i tell him as if already half asleep it does get cold down here of a night he hesitates at the door and says god with you this night will he shuffles off and i listen until his slow footfall has died away then i am alone in the dark with my thoughts once more chapter what did she say demands brother odo as he bustles breathless into my cell he is that much like an overgrown puppyall feet and foolish fervourit makes me smile it seems to me that my dull but amiable scribe is as much a prisoner of abbot hugos devices as will scarlet ever was here he sits most days scribbling away in this dim dank pit with its mud and mildew the reek of piss and stagnant water in his nostrils dutifully fulfilling his office never complaining what an odd friendship has grown between us i wonder what it can hold yes and how much it can bear god with you this morning odo i reply he settles himself in his place the short plank balanced on his knees and begins paring a new quill what did she say who merian he shrieks impatience making his soft voice shrill as an old fishwifes you rememberdo not pretend otherwise we were talking about king ravens council soup and sausages i sigh shaking my head in weary dismay are you certain thats what we were talking about i must have slept the memory right out of my head i have no recollection of it at all i remember he cries lord bran called a council and merian volunteered a plan she had devised yes go on i urge him what next but thats all i know he cries he is that close to throwing his inkhorn at me that is where you stopped you must remember what happened next peace odo i say trying to placate him all is not lost remind me of what you have written and well see soon enough if that stirs the pot odo busies himself with unrolling his scrap of parchment and unstopping his inkhorn read it out i say as he smoothes the sheepskin beneath his podgy palms perhaps that will help me remember he begins and i hear once again how he nips and crimps my words giving them all a monkish cast he bleeds them dry and makes them all grey and damp like the greenwood in the grip of november still and all he gets the gist of it and renders my ramblings rather more agreeable than many would find them what his highnosed infernal majesty abbot hugo makes of all this i cannot say the captive lady merian begged leave to reveal a plan she had made the rebels fell silent to hear what she would say he stops here and looks up expectantly that is where we ended for the night if you say i tell him shaking my head slowly it is all i can do to keep from laughing but my head is a cup scoured clean this morning odo makes a face and grinds his teeth in frustration well then what do you remember i remember something i pause and reflect a little ah yes how well i remember see now monk when the council finished i returned to noins hut i tell him and we go on noin was not in her hut when i returned nor was nia the council had taken the whole of the morning and they had gone out to do some chores so i went along to find them and lend a hand the snow still lay deep over our ragtag little settlement and the day though bright was cold many of king ravens ragfeathered flock were at work chopping and splitting wood for the many hearth fires needed to keep warm i could hear their voices sharp in the crisp air chirping like birds as they toiled to fill their baskets and drag bundles of cut wood back to their huts i saw this now as i had seen such work countless times since coming to cel craidd but this time something had changed maybe it was only ol will scarlet himself but i did see the place in a different way and did not much like what i saw it put me in an edgy uneasy mood and i did not know why perhaps it was only to do with the bad news i had just now to deliver oh it was that to be sure but perhaps there was something else as well even so thinking to make the bitter draught a little easier to swallow i put a big smile on my face and tried to take cheer in the sight of my beloved but my heart was weighty and cold as a stone in a mountain stream i saw noin bending low to pick up a split branch and thought how i would love nothing more than to carry her away this instant to leave this place and its demands and duties to flee far away from the bastard normans and their overbearing ways alas there was no longer such a place in all britain it made me sad and angry and disappointed and frustrated all at the same time because i did not know what to do about it and feared nothing could be done i gathered my thoughts and swallowing my disappointment strode to where noin was working here my love i said let me carry that basket for you heap it high now so you wont have to fetch any more today she stood and turned with a smile ah will she began then saw something in my face i was not able to hide what is it love she looked at me with such tender concern how could i tell her the council has decided i said hearing my voice as from the bottom of a well we have come to a decision noins smile faded she grew sombre well what is itwill speak it out i bent my head i have to leave again is that all she fairly shouted with relief mother mary i was afraid it was serious i thought you would be unhappy oh i am right enough she replied balling her fist on her hip but i would be more unhappy if i thought you had changed your mind about marrying but i do want to marry you noin i do then all is well between us she turned as if to go back to her work but paused when do you go as soon as all can be made ready i said go then and help them see it through we will fare as best we can while you are away she said lifting a hand to my face and count the days until your return i will bring our friar back with me if i have to carry him on my back and we will be wed the day i return this i told her kissing the palm of her hand we talked about our wedding day and the plans i had to build her a new house on my returnwith a big bed a table and two chairs so it was the five of us were set to leave the next morning friar tuck and myself bran of course iwan because we could use another pair of hands and eyes on the road merian because the plan was her idea entire and she would in no wise stay behind in any event however this notion was not without difficulties of its own and though i was loath to do it the chore fell to me to point this out forgive me my lord if i speak above myself i began but is it wise for a hostagebegging your pardon my ladyto well to be allowed to enter into affairs of such delicacy you doubt my loyalty challenged merian dark eyes all akindle with quick anger i thought i knew you better william scatlocke i do heartily beg your pardon lady i said raising my hands as if to fend off blows of her fists i only meant heres the pot calling the kettle black she fumed that is rich indeed my friend siarles smiled to see me handed my head so skilfully but bran waded into the clash merian peace will is right right she snapped he is a fool and so are you if you believe for even one heartbeat that i would ever do anything to endanger peace woman bran said shouting down her objection if you would listen for a moment you would consider that will has raised a fair point it is not she sniffed it is silly and insultingi dont know which the more no it is neither bran shook his head it goes to the heart of things between us the time has come for you to decide merian fair decide what she asked her eyes narrowing with suspicion are you a hostage or are you one of us she frowned you tell me bran ap brychan what am i to you you know that right well i would call you queen if you would but hear it her frown deepened and a crease appeared between her brows she was caught on the thorns this time no mistakeand she knew it see here she snapped do not think to make this about that say what you will my lady it comes round to the same place in the endeither you stand with us join us in heart and spirit or or she replied haughty in her indignation or what will you do or you must stay here like a good little hostage bran replied while we enact your plan that i will not do she snipped then those of us who stood round about found other places to look just then so as not to be drawn into what had become the latest clash in a royal battle of tempers and wills merian glared at bran she did not like having her loyalty questioned but even she could see the problem now what will you do bran pressed we are waiting oh very well she fumed giving in i will forswear my captivity and pledge fealty to you bran ap brychanbut ill not marry you she smiled with sour sweetness at the rest of us there are we all happy now i accept your pledge replied bran and release you from your captivity then i can go with you inquired merian just to make sure my lady you are a free woman granted bran gently and i could see how much the words cost him you can go with us or you can simply go should you choose to stay you will be in dangeras you already know i am not afraid she declared it is my plan remember and i will not have any clodfooted men mucking it up she was not finished yet for as we gathered to depart merian spied a woman named cinnia a slender darkeyed young widow a few years older than herself merians favourite amongst the forest dwellersanother of the normanwidowed brides of which there were so many my lady asked cinnia to join us she would serve as a companion for merian who explained a woman of rank would never travel alone in the company of men the ffreinc understand this cinnia will be my handmaid we loaded our supplies and weaponslongbows and sheaves of arrows rolled in deer hidesonto two packhorses when we were at last ready to depart tuck said a prayer for the success of our journey although he could have no idea what he was praying thus blessed we took our leave angharad was still gone so tomas and rhoddi were charged with keeping watch over cel craidd and elfael while lord bran was away and to reach us with a warning if the sheriff got up to anything nasty thus on a splendid winters day we rode out to beard the sleeping lion in his den what is that odo i have not told what we planned to do my weakeyed scribe thinks i have skipped too lightly over this important detail all in good time i tell him patience is also a virtue impetuous monk you should try it he moans and sighs rolls his eyes and dips his pen and we go on chapter coed cadw richard de glanville watched the forest rising before him like the rampart of a vast green fortress the colours muted and misty in the pale winter light just ahead lay the stream that ran along the valley floor at the foot of the rise leading to the forest he raised his hand and summoned the man riding behind him to his side we will stop to water the horses bailiff he said tell the men to remain alert of course replied the bailiff in a voice that suggested he had heard the command a thousand times and it did not bear repeating the mans tone of dry irritation piqued his superiors attention tell me antoin said the sheriff do you think we will catch the phantom today no sheriff replied the bailiff i do not think it likely then why did you come on this sortie i came because i was ordered thus my lord but of course allowed sheriff de glanville even so you think it a fools errand is that so i did not say that replied the soldier he was used to the sheriff s dark and unpredictable moods and rightly cautious of them i say merely that the forest of the march is a very big place i expect the phantom has moved on the sheriff considered this suggestion there is no phantom bailiff there are only a devils clutch of welsh rebels however that may be replied antoin blandly i have no doubt your persistence and vigilance has driven them away de glanville regarded his bailiff with benign disdain as always antoin your insights are invaluable king raven will be caught one day god willing but not todayis that what you think no sheriff not today confessed the soldier still it is a good day for a ride in the greenwood to be sure agreed the sheriff reining up as they reached the fording place the water was low and ice coated the stones and banks of the slowmoving stream sir richard did not dismount but remained in the saddle swathed in his riding cloak and leather gauntlets his eyes on the natural wall of bare timber rising on the slope of the ridge before him coed cadw the locals called it the name meant guardian wood or sheltering forest or some such thing he had never really discovered for certain whatever it was called the forest was a stronghold a bastion as mighty and impenetrable as any made of stone perhaps antoin was right perhaps king raven had flown to better pickings elsewhere when the horses had finished drinking and his soldiers had taken their saddles once more the sheriff lifted the reins and urged his mount across the ford and up the long slope in a little while he and the four knights with him passed beneath the bare snowcovered boughs of elm trees on either side of the road and entered the greenwood as through an arched doorway the quiet hush of the snowbound forest fell upon him and the winter light dimmed as he proceeded along the deepshadowed track into the wood the sheriff s senses pricked wary to a presence unseen his sight became keen his hearing more acute he could smell the faint whiff of sour earth that told him a red deer stag had passed a short while earlier or was lying in a hidden den somewhere nearby after a fair distance they came to a place where a narrow animal trail crossed their own here the sheriff paused he sat for a moment looking both ways along the ground the tracks of pigs and deer lay intertwined in the snow and here and there the spoor of wolvesand all were old just as he was about to move along his eye caught the sign that had no doubt caused him to stop in the first place the slender double hoofprint of a deer and behind and a little to one side a slight halfmoon depression without a word he climbed down from the saddle and knelt for a better look the halfmoon print was followed by another a short stride length away you have found something sire asked bailiff antoin after a moment it seems our ride is to be rewarded today replied de glanville deer poacher antoin raised his eyes and peered down the tunnel formed by the overhanging branches better still he replied the sheriff resumed his saddle and with a gesture to silence the chattering soldiers turned onto the narrow trail and began following his quarry the trail led up a low rise and then down into a dell with a little rockbound rill trickling along the bottom there in the soft mud were a half dozen depressionsincluding the mark of a knee where a man had knelt to drink de glanville raised a gauntlet to halt those coming from behind he caught the sheen of a damp glimmer where water had splashed onto a rock he was here not long ago observed the sheriff turning in the saddle he singled out two of his men stay here and be ready should he double back before we catch him he lifted the reins and urged his mount across the brook up the opposite bank and into a thicket of elder that formed a rough hedge along the streambed once beyond the hedge the trail opened slightly allowing the sun to penetrate the dense tangle overhead shafts of weak winter light slanted down through the naked branches above a few hundred paces further along the sheriff could see that the track entered a snowcovered glade he reined up and pointing to the clearing ahead motioned antoin and the remaining knights to dismount and circle around on foot when they had gone from sight sir richard proceeded on alone pausing again as he entered the clearing there across the snowy space kneeling beside the sleek ruddy stag he had just brought down was a swarthy welshman knife in hand he stooped to begin butchering his kill in a glance the sheriff saw the hunter the knife and the longbow leaning against the trunk of a fallen birch a few paces from the crouching man drawing his sword silently from its sheath with his left hand de glanville unslung his shield with his right tightening his grip on the pommel of his sword he drew a deep breath and called across the glade in the name of the king the shout rang clear in the chilly air shattering the quiet of the glade the startled welshman lurched and spun throw down your weapons shouted de glanville the hunter dived for his bow in the time it took the sheriff to swing his shield into place the hunter had an arrow on the string halt cried the sheriff as the poacher drew and loosed the arrow struck home with a jolt that rocked the sheriff in his highcantled saddle the arrow point pierced the solid ashwood planking that formed the body of the shield the iron point protruding a fingers width below the sheriff s eye the mans quickness was impressive but ultimately futile before he could nock another arrow two knights rushed into the clearing from either side the hunter whirled and loosed at the nearest of the two but the arrow merely grazed the top of the soldiers shield and careered away desperate the welshman swung the bow at the second knight and turned to flee the two soldiers captured him in a bound subduing him with a few skullcrushing blows before dragging him to where sheriff de glanville sat watching from his horse poaching deer in the kings forest the sheriff said his voice loud in the sanctuary of the glade is an offence punishable by death do you have anything to say before you are hanged the hunter who clearly did not understand the language of the ffreinc nevertheless knew the fate he faced just then he gave out a cry and with a mighty heave tried to shake off the two soldiers clinging to him they hung on however and showered blows upon his head until he subsided once more bailiff antoin said the sheriff you profess some proficiency in the tongue of these brutes ask him if he has anything to say the bailiff clinging to the mans right arm informed him of the charge against him the welshman struggled and shouted pleading and cursing as he flailed helplessly in the grasp of his captors until he was silenced with blows to the head and stomach it appears he has no defence bailiff antoin declared no i wouldnt think so remarked the sheriff the three remaining knights burst into the glade just then the rope bailiff de glanville ordered and antoin reached into the bag behind the sheriff s saddle and drew out a coiled length of braided leather the welshman saw the rope and began shouting and struggling again the sheriff ordered his knights to haul the man to the nearest tree the rope was lofted over a stout bough and the quickly fashioned noose pulled tight around the wretchs neck by order of his majesty king william of england in whose authority i am sworn i sentence you to death for the crime of poaching the kings deer said the sheriff his voice low and languid as if pronouncing such judgement was a dreary commonplace of his occupation he directed bailiff antoin to repeat his words in welsh the bailiff struggled lapsing now and again into french and finished with a shrug of indifference the sheriff satisfied that all had been done in proper order said carry out the sentence the knight holding the end of the rope was joined by two others and the three began pulling the leather stretched and creaked as the victims weight was lifted from the ground the poor welshman scrabbled with his hands as the noose tightened around his neck and his dancing feet swung free toes kicking up clods of snow then as the suffocated choking began the sheriff seemed to reconsider hold he said let him down instantly the rope slackened and the mans feet touched ground once more the wretch collapsed onto his knees and his hands tore at the constricting leather band around his neck his breath coming in great grunting gasps when the colour had returned to the welshmans face the sheriff said inform the prisoner that i will give him one more chance to live antoin standing over the gasping man relayed the sheriff s words the unfortunate looked up eyes full of hope and grasped the bailiff s leg as might a beggar beseeching a wouldbe benefactor tell him continued de glanville that i will let him go if he will but tell me where king raven can be found the bailiff duly repeated the offer whereupon the welshman rose to his feet speaking slowly and with care aware of the dire consequence of his reply the hunter folded his hands in supplication to the sheriff and delivered himself of an impassioned speech what did he say asked the sheriff when the hunter finished i cannot be certain began the bailiff but it seems that he is a poor man with hungry childrenfive in number his wife is deadno ill she is ill he says his cattle were killed by soldiers of the marshal they have nothing that is no excuse replied de glanville does he know that ask him the bailiff repeated the sheriff s observation and the welshman retorted with an impassioned plea he says offered antoin that they are starving the loss of his cattle has driven him to take the deer this he grieves ah no regretsbut always when hunger drove him to the wood he could take a deer with his lords blessing the sheriff considered this and then said the law is the law what about king raven make him understand that he can walk free and take the deer with him if he tells me where to find that rebel and thief this was told to the prisoner who replied in the same impassioned voice the bailiff listened then answered the poacher says if it is a crime to be hungry then a guilty man stands before you but if there be a thing such as mercy under heaven then he pleads to you before god to let him go for the sake of mercy he calls upon christ to be his witness for he knows nothing of king raven or where he might be found the sheriff listened to this impressed as he occasionally was with the welsh facility with expression if talking could save them they had nothing to fear alas words were but empty things devoid of power and all too easily broken discarded and forgotten i will ask one last time said the sheriff tell me what i want to know when the sheriff s words had been translated the captive briton drew himself up full height and gave his answer saying release me for the sake of christ before whom we all must stand one day but know this if it lay in my power to know the wiles and ways of the creature you call king raven i would not spare so much as a breath to tell you then save your breath for dying replied the sheriff when the captives reply had been relayed hang him the three knights began hauling on the end of the rope the welshmans feet were soon kicking and his hands clawing at the noose once more his strangled cries were swiftly choked off and his face now purple and swollen glared his dying hatred for the sheriff and all ffreinc invaders in a few moments the victims struggles ceased and his hands fell limp to his sides first one and then the other the sheriff leaned on the pommel of his saddle watching the poachers body as it swung twisting gently from side to side after a time the bailiff said he is dead sire what do you want us to do with the body let it swing said the sheriff it will be a warning to others of his kind with that he turned his mount and started from the clearing mildly satisfied with the days work true he was no closer to finding king raven but hanging a poacher was always a good way to demonstrate his authority and power over the local serfs a small thing perhaps as some would reckon but it was after all in the exercise of vigilance and attention to such small details that power was maintained and multiplied richard de glanville sheriff of the march knew very well the ways and uses of power he would find the rebel known as king raven one day and on that day all elfael would see how traitors to the crown were punished justice might be delayed but it could not be escaped king raven would be caught and his death would make that of the hanged poacher seem like a childs game he would not merely punish the rebel he would destroy him and snuff out his name forever that he considered would be a delight to savour chapter we rode hard for glascwm and passed through the gates of saint dyfrigs as a wet winter storm closed over the valleys rain stinging cold spattered into the hardpacked yard as the monks scurried to pull the horses into the stable and bundle us soggy travellers into the refectory where they could spoon hot soup into us they did not yet know who it was they entertainednot that it would have made a difference i reckon for the abbey yard was already full of local folk who having fled the ffreinc sought sanctuary within the walls of the abbey wet and wretched battered and beaten down they stood slumpshouldered in the rain before the low huts they had built in the yard watching us with the mute dulleyed curiosity of cattle as we trotted through the gate forlorn and past caring they huddled before their hovels shivering as the rain puddled in the mud at their bare feet the monks had made a fire in the middle of the yard to warm them but the damp fuel ensured that it produced more smoke than heat most were thin halfstarved farmers by the look of them and more than a few bore the signs of norman justice here a missing hand or choppedoff foot there an eye burned out by a redhot poker oh the ffreinc love lopping bits off the poor folk they are tireless at it and when a norman noble cannot find good excuse to maim some unfortunate who wanders across his path why hell concoct a reason out of spit and spider silk as soon as we dismounted the ladies were taken to the guest lodge where they could dry their clothes but the rest of us foreswore that comfort for a hot meal instead the abbot a stiff old stick with a face like a wild pigs rump huffed and puffed when he saw our lord and his rough companions puddling up his dining hall bran ap brychan he cried bursting into the long lowbeamed room they told me you were killed dead a year ago or more i am as you see me father replied bran standing to receive abbot daffyds blessing i hope we find you well well enough if the ffreinc would leave off harrowing the valleys and driving decent folk from their homes we would fare that much better i hope you do not plan on stayingwe are stretched tight as a drum head with caring for those we have already we will not trouble you any longer than necessary bran assured him good the old man did not waste words his forthright manner made me smile here was a fella who would listen to reason and give back the same im glad youre not dead what are you doing here and here i was thinking you would never ask replied bran iwan and siarles chuckled but bran silenced them with a stern glance a few days ago a letter was brought to you by bishop asaph that is so answered the abbot folding his hands over his chest his frown suggested he suspected grave mischief and he was not wrong what is that to you my sonif i may be so bold be as bold as you like answered bran only tell me that you have that letter i do and have you read it father i have not said daffyd but another has i hope he is a trustworthy man if he was not i would not have given him the task come then he put a hand to the abbots shoulder and turned him around we will hear it together youre soaking wet remarked the abbot shrugging off brans hand ill not have you shaking water all over my abbey stay here and finish your soup i will bring the letter here i began to appreciate the abbot right well he was a bluff old dog whose bark concealed the fact that he would never bite bran returned to his place on the bench with a rueful smile he knew me as a boy he explained when he was under asaph at llanelli the abbot returned as we were finishing our soup and bread he brought the folded square of parchment clutched tight in both hands as if he thought it might try to wriggle free with him was a darkhaired slender monk of middling years with a long face prominent nose and skin the colour of good brown ale this is brother jago announced the abbot he was born in genoa and raised in marseilles he speaks ffreinc far better than anyone here in the abbey he has read the letter the slender monk dipped his head in acknowledgement of his superiors wishes i am happy to serve he said and i discerned in his speech a lightly lisping quality id never heard before he turned to the abbot who still stood holding the parchment bundle father he said extending his hand abbot daffyd gazed at the letter and then at bran are you certain you wish to proceed with this bran nodded the abbot frowned i will not be a party to this you will excuse me i understand abbot replied bran no doubt it is for the best placing the bundle in brother jagos hands the abbot turned and left the room when the door had closed again bran nodded to the monk begin jago untied the blue cord and carefully unfolded the prepared skin he stood for a moment gazing at it then placed it on the board in front of him and leaning stiffarmed on his hands began to read in a slow confident voice i william by the grace of god baron of bramber and lord of brienze to the greatly esteemed and reverend guibert of ravenna greetings in god may the peace of christ our eternal saviour remain with you always pressed jago paused ah no rather urged by faith we are obliged to believe and to maintain that the church is one holy catholic and also apostolic we believe in her firmly and we confess with simplicity that outside of her there is neither salvation nor the remission of sins and she represents one sole mystical body whose head is christ and the head of christ is god although we understood little enough of what he said the musical quality of his speech drew us near as he continued to read we gathered around to hear him better in all our realms and whatsoever lands exist under our rule granted by god we venerate this church as one therefore of the one and only church there is one body and one head not two heads like a monster that is christ and the vicar of christ peter and the successor of peter since the lord speaking to peter himself said feed my sheep meaning my sheep in general not these nor those in particular whence we understand that he entrusted all to this same peter entrusting to him and him alone the keys of the kingdom well i never would have believed itthat bloody baron de braose should preach so about the nature of the church and whatnotwell it passed understanding therefore if anyone should say that they are not belongingjago broke off read to himself for a moment then raised his head and said i am sorry it has been some time since i read french like this you are doing well bran said pray continue ah that they are not under the authority of peter and his successors they must confess not being the sheep of christ since our lord says in the gospel of john there is one sheepfold and one shepherd therefore whoever resists this power thus ordained by god resists the ordinance of god unless he invent like manicheus two beginnings which is false and judged by us heretical since according to the testimony of moses it is not in the beginnings but in the beginning that god created heaven and earth furthermore we declare we proclaim we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the roman pontiff when jago broke off once more to collect himself iwan said what is the old rascal talking about shh hissed tuck let him read on and we will see jago resumed his reading be it known to all sons of our holy church present and future that we have heard the spirits admonition to seize the day of peace and have ordained this concord to be made between william and guibert formerly archbishop of ravenna merian and cinnia given dry robes by the monks entered just then you started without us merian said her voice sharp with disapproval shh said bran you have missed little enough he gestured to jago go on attendant with very sacred vows to uphold his holiness the pope and bind our powers to the throne of saint peter and the one church universal recognizing him as pontiff and holy father forsaking all other powers henceforth holding only to the authority invested in his holiness the patriarch of rome may the divinity preserve you for many years most holy and blessed father given at rouen on the third day of september before these witnesses roger bishop of rheims reginald des roches bishop of cotillon robert duke of normandy henry beauclerc joscelin bishop of vexin hubert de burgh justiciar of king philip gilbert de clare count of burgundy and argenton ralph fitznicholas our seneschal henry de capella baron of aquitaine and others in most solemn and august assembly jago glanced up quickly and seeing all eyes on him concluded written by the hand of his servant girandeau scribe to teobaldo archbishop of milan well i wont say i gleaned the full meaning of that letter just then then again no one did indeed we all sat looking a little perplexed at what wed heard iwan spoke for us all i think when he said that was worth a mans life on christmas day there is something in it we cannot yet see replied bran if we only knew where to look sighed tuck for all its folderol it is only a simple offer of support for the pope i confess i make nothing of it jago straightened and turned a thoughtful gaze to bran pray how did you come by this my lord he asked his voice quiet in the silence it was with some other items taken in a raid bran said simply jago nodded accepting this without comment these other itemsmay i see them bran considered for a moment then turned to tuck show him tuck rose and turned his back to one and all and from a hidden pocket in his robe produced a roll of cloth tied with a horsehair string he untied the string and unrolled the cloth on the table to reveal the rubystudded ring and the finely embroidered gloves jago took one look at the ring and picked it up he held it between thumb and forefinger turning it this way and that so that the light glinted on the gold and ring of tiny rubies do you know whose crest this is that of a ffreinc nobleman replied iwan beyond that said bran we know nothing jago nodded again replacing the ring he picked up the gloves lifting them to his nose to take in the scent of the fine leather almost reverently he traced the heavy gold thread of the cross and the looped whorl of the chi rho with a respectful fingertip i have seen gloves like this only once in my lifebut once seen it is never forgotten he smiled as if recalling the memory even then they were on the hands of pope gregory i saw him as a boy when he passed through the village where i was born but he said replacing the gloves i fear this does little to help you i am sorry i could not be of better service he placed the palm of his hand on the parchment i agree with the friar there is something in the letter that the baron does not wish known to a wider world well you could have knocked us down with a wren feather we all looked at each other the mystery deeper now than when we had begun lady merian found her voice first nevertheless it goes back whether we discover what it means or not she declared it must be returnedall of itas we agreed chapter what do you want me to do asked the abbot when after jago had been dismissed he returned to see if we would like to join the monks for vespers bran pressed the folded parchment into daffyds hands make a copy of this he commanded letter for letter word for word make it exactly the same as this one i cannot gasped the abbot aghast at the very suggestion you can bran assured him you will leave it to me said tuck stepping boldly forward this is an abbey is it not he took the abbot by the elbow turned him and led him to the door then let us go to your scriptorium and see what can be done odo is frowning again he does not approve of our king brans highhanded ways my scribe has put down his quill and folded his hands across his round chest copying a stolen letteryou had no right this makes me laugh out loud hells bells odo that is the least of the things we have done since this whole sorry affair began and it ent over yet you should not have done that he mutters it is a sin against the church well i suppose you could hold to that if you like i tell him but your friend abbot hugo was willing to burn defenceless folk in their beds to get that letter he sent men to their deaths to reclaim it and was only too willing to send more seems to me that if we start totting up sins his would still outweigh the lot in his indignation my podgy scribe has forgotten this he makes his sour face and pokes out his lower lip copying a stolen letter he says at last its still a sin perhaps undoubtedly very well i concede i suppose you have never stood on a battleground naked and alone while the enemy swarms around you like killing wasps with poison in their stings no he snorts and neither have you i grant him that maybe not but we are sorely outmanned in this fight the enemy has all the knights and weapons and he has already seized the high ground whatever small advantage comes our way we take it and thank god for it too you stole the letter he complains oh odo my misguided friend takes what refuge can be found in dull insistence well it is better than facing the truth i suppose but that truth is out now and it is working away in him i leave it there and we roll on there were but four days remaining before twelfth night when the hangings would commence at brans insistence and with tucks patient cajoling the monks of saint dyfrigs abbey prepared a parchment the same size and shape as that of the barons letter they then proceeded to copy the letter out exact matching pen stroke to pen stroke if they had been archers id have said they hit the mark nine times for ten and the tenth a near misswhich is right fair considering they didnt know what they were scribing true they were not able to use the same colour brown ink as the original the ink they made for their use at the abbey had a more ruddy appearance when it dried still we reasoned that since none of the ffreinc in elfael had ever seen the original they would not know the difference while the monks toiled away bran and iwan undertook to carve a seal of sorts out of a bit of ox bone working with various tools gathered from around the abbeyeverything from knife points to needlesthey endeavoured to copy the stamp that made the seal that was affixed to the letter and while they laboured at this merian and cinnia made a binding cord weaving strands of white satin which they then dyed using some of the ruddy ink and other stuff supplied by the abbey it took two days to finish our forgery and a fine and handsome thing it was too when it was done we placed the letters side by side and looked at them it was that difficult to tell them apart and i knew which was which no one who had not seen the genuine letter would be able to tell the difference i reckoned and anyone who did not know would never guess abbot daffyd held a special mass of absolution for the monks who had worked on the parchment and for the monastery itself for its complicity in this misdeed he sought the forgiveness of the high judge of the world for the low crimes of his followers i held no such qualms about any of this myself considering it a right fair exchange for the lives of those who awaited death in the counts hostage pit when the service was finished bran ordered everyone to make ready to ride to castle truan to return the stolen goods to the count and just how do you intend to do that asked daffyd if his voice had been a bodkin it could not have been more pointed i suppose he imagined he had caught bran in a mistake that would sink the plan like a millstone in a rowboat if you are caught with any of this the sheriff will hang you instead good abbot replied bran your concern touches me deeply i do believe you are right yet since we have no interest in providing fresh meat for the hangman we must make other arrangements warned by the devious smile on brans face daffyd said yes and those would be you shall return the treasures to the count me cried the abbot his face going crimson in the instant but see here i will do no such thing yes bran assured him i think you will you must well the abbot was the only real choice when all was said and done he was the only one who could come and go among the ffreinc as neatly as he pleased without rousing undue suspicion this will not do at all the abbot fumed it will countered bran if you listen well and do exactly as i say they will hail you as a champion and drink your health bran then explained how the stolen goods would be returned tomorrow you will awaken and go to the chapel for your morning prayers and there on the altar you will find a bag containing a box when you open the box you will find the letter and the ring and the gloves you will recognize them as the very items count de braose is missing and you will take them to him telling him precisely how you found them it hardly serves the purpose if they hang me instead daffyd pointed out if you can contrive to have the sheriff and abbot present when you hand over the goods continued bran that would be better still de glanville was there he knows you could not have been involved in the theft therefore you will remain above suspicion and since you did not see who left the bundle on the altar they cannot use you to get at us the abbot nodded it would all be true he mused you would not have to lie to them but it would pare the truth very narrowly my lord humphed abbot daffyd narrow is the gate chuckled tuck and strait is the way do as rhi bran says and they will sing your praises and i will give you silver enough to feed the hungry in your yard the abbot twisted and turned like a worm on a griddle but even he had to admit that it was the only way he agreed to do it stay long enough to see the prisoners released added bran once the abbot and count have received the goods they should set the captives free as promised i am not an imbecile sniffed the abbot i fully appreciate why were going to all this trouble as you say replied bran please do not take offence abbot i just wanted to make sure we were all working to the same end it is the lives of those men and boys we are saving lest anyone forget while the others worked on preparing the forged letter i had not been idle i had been gathering bits of this and that from the abbeys stores and supplies tuck merian and the others had helped too when they could and on the eve of twelfth night all was nearly ready we slept little that night and dawn was a mere rumour in the east when we departed the abbey there was no one about in the yard and i do not think we were observed but if any of the poor asleep in their miserable hovels had looked out they would have observed a far different group of travellers leaving than that which arrived chapter saint martins richard de glanville sat at table with a knife in one hand and a falcon on the other with the knife he hacked off chunks of meat from the carcase before him which he fed to the fledgling gyrfalconone of two birds the sheriff kept he had heard from abbot hugo that falconry was much admired in the french court now that king philip owned birds de glanville had decided in the interest of his own advancement to involve himself in this sport as well it suited him there was much in his nature like a preying bird he imagined he understood the hawks and they understood him the day newly begun held great promise the miserable wet weather of the week gone had blown away at last leaving the sky clean scoured and fresh a most impressive gallows had been erected in the town square in front of the stable and since there had been no communication on the part of the thieves who had stolen the abbots goods all things considered it was a fine day for a hanging he flipped a piece of mutton to the young bird and thought not for the first time in the last few days how to direct the executions for best effect he had made up his mind that he would begin with three since it was a holy day there was a symbolic symmetry in the number three and anyway more than that would certainly draw the disapproval of the church count falkes de braose insisted on waiting until sundown rather than sunrise as the sheriff would have preferred but that was a mere trifle the count clung doggedly to the belief that the threat of the hangings would yet bring results he wanted to give the thieves as much time as possible to return the stolen treasure in this the sheriff and count differed the sheriff held no such delusions that the thieves would give up the goods even so just on the wild chance that the rogues were foolish enough to appear with the treasure he had arranged a special reception for them if they cameand somewhere in the sheriff s dark heart he half hoped they would ride into saint martins with the treasurenone of them would leave the square alive when he finished feeding the hawk he replaced it on its perch and drawing on his riding boots threw a cloak over his shoulder and went out to visit his prisoners though the stink of the pit had long since become nauseating he still performed this little daily ritual to be sure he wanted the wretches in the pit to know well who it was that held their lives in his hands but the visits had another more practical purpose if as the death day lurched ever nearer any of the prisoners suddenly remembered the whereabouts of the outlaw known as king raven sheriff de glanville wanted to be there to hear it he hurried across the nearempty square it was early yet and few people were about to greet the blustery dawn he let himself into the guardhouse and paused at the entrance to the underground gaol where after waking the drowsy keeper he poured a little water on the hem of his cloak holding that to his nose he descended the few steps and proceeded along the single narrow corridor to the end pausing only to see if anyone had died in either of the two smaller cells he passed along the way the largest cell of the three lay at the end of the low corridor and though it had been constructed to hold as many as a dozen men it now held more than thirty there was not enough room to lie down to sleep so the prisoners took turns through the day and night some it was said had learned to sleep on their feet like horses at first sight of the sheriff one of the welsh prisoners let out a shout and instantly raised a great commotion as every man and boy began crying for release the sheriff stood in the dank corridor the edge of his cloak pressed to his face and patiently waited until they had exhausted their outcry when the hubbub had died down once moreit took less time each daythe sheriff addressed them using the few words of welsh that he knew rhi bran y hud he said speaking slowly so that they would understand who knows him tell me and walk free it was the same small speech he made every day and each time produced the same result a tense and resentful silence when the sheriff finally tired of waiting he turned and walked away to a renewed chorus of shouting and wailing the moment his back was turned they were a stubborn crowd but de glanville thought he could detect a slight wearing down of their resolve soon he believed one of his captives would break ranks with the others and would tell him what he wanted to know after a few of them had hanged the rest would find it increasingly difficult to hold their tongues it was he considered only a matter of time the sheriff did not care a whit about retrieving abbot hugos stolen goods despite what hugo told him about the importance of the letter it was the capture of king raven he desired and nothing short of king raven would satisfy after his morning visit to the gaol the sheriff returned to the upper rooms of the guardhouse to visit the soldiers and speak with the marshal to make certain that all was in order for the executions it was twelfth night and a festal day and the town would be lively with trade and celebration sheriff de glanville had not risen to his position by leaving details to chance he found guy de gysburne drinking wine with his sergeant de glanville called guy as the sheriff strolled into the guardhouse a fire burned low in the grate and several soldiers lolled halfasleep on the benches where they had spent the night empty cups lined the table and lay on the floor une sante vous sherif gysburne cried raising his cup join us as the sheriff took a seat on the bench the marshal poured wine into an empty cup and pressed it into de glanvilles hands they drank and the sheriff replaced his cup after only a mouthful saying i will expect you and your men to be battlesharp today but of course replied guy carelessly you cannot think there will be any trouble when the sheriff did not reply he adopted a cajoling tone come de glanville the rogues would never dare show their faces in town i bow to your superior wisdom lord marshal he replied his voice dripping honey i myself find it difficult to forget that a little less than a fortnight ago we lost an entire company of good men to these outlaws guy frowned nor have i forgotten sheriff he said stiffly i merely see nothing to be gained by wallowing in the memory then again he added taking another swig of wine if it was my plan that had failed so miserably perhaps i would be wallowing too batard muttered de glanville youre rotten drunk he glared at the marshal and then at the sergeant you have until sundown to get sober when you do i will look for your apology marshal guy mouthed a curse and took another drink the sheriff rose turned on his heel and strode from the room there was never but one batard in this room jeremias he muttered and he is gone now thank god i thought i smelled something foul remarked sergeant jeremias and both men fell into a fit of laughter in truth however the sheriff was right they were very drunk they had been drinking most nights since that disastrous christmas raid most nights they along with the rest of the soldiers in the abbots private force succeeded in submerging themselves in a winesoaked stupor to forget the horror of that dreadful christmas night alas it was a doomed effort for with the dawn the dead came back to haunt them afresh upon leaving the guardhouse the bell in the church tower rang to announce the beginning of mass the sheriff walked across the square to the church pushed open the door and entered the dim damp darkness of the sanctuary a few halfburnt candles fluttered in sconces on the walls and pillars and fog drifted over the mistslick stones underfoot de glanville made his way down the empty aisle to take his place before the altar with the scant handful of worshippers as he expected one of the monks was performing the holy service his voice droning in the hollow silence of the nearempty cave of the church the abbot was nowhere to be seen he watched as the mass moved through its measured paces to its ordained finish and with the priests benediction ringing in his ears left the church feeling calm and pleasantly disposed towards the world there were more people about now a few merchants were erecting their stalls and some of the villagers carried wood for the bonfire which would be lit in the centre of the square he stood for a moment watching the town begin to fill up then looked to the sky the sun was bright but there were dark clouds forming in the west there was nothing he could do about that so he hurried on pausing now and again to receive the best regards of the townsfolk as he progressed across the muddy expanse visiting some of the stalls along the way there were a few provisions he needed to procure for his own twelfth night celebration odd he was always ravenously hungry following a public execution he spent the rest of the morning going over the preparations with his men there were but four of them nowthe others had been killed in the raidand de glanville was concerned about the survivors falling into melancholy they had been caught off guard in the forest for which the sheriff took the blame he had not anticipated the speed with which the outlaws had struck nor the devastating power of their primitive weapons tonights executions would provide some redress he was sure and remove some of the lingering pain from the beating they had taken when he had determined that all was in order the sheriff returned to his quarters for a meal and a nap he ate and slept well if lightly and rose again late in the day to find that the sun had begun its descent in the west and the threatened storm was advancing apace it would be a snowy twelfth night he buckled his sword belt drew on his cloak and gloves and returned to the town square which was now filled with people torches were being lit and the bonfire was already ablaze judging from the sound alone most had already begun their celebrations spirits were high with song and the stink of singed hair in the air someone had thrown a dead dog onto the bonfire he noted with distaste it was an old superstition and one he particularly disliked he proceeded across the crowded square to the guardhouse to deliver final instructions to the marshal and his men out of the corner of his eye he noticed a group of travelling merchants setting out their wares the fools the feast about to begin and here they were arriving when everyone else was finishing for the day and making ready to celebrate two women he had never seen before lingered nearby attracted no doubt by the possibility of a bargain from traders desperate to make at least one sale before the hangings began at the guardhouse he delivered his message to the sergeant who seemed sober enough now that done he proceeded to the abbots quarters to share a cup of wine while waiting for the evenings festivities to begin so said abbot hugo as de glanville stepped into the room gysburne came to see me he doesnt like you very much no conceded the sheriff but if he would learn to follow simple commands we might yet achieve a modicum of mutual accord mutual accordha abbot hugo snorted you dont like him either he splashed wine into a pewter goblet and pushed it across the board towards de glanville personally i do not care how you two get on but you might at least accord me the respect of asking my permission before you begin ordering around my soldiers as if they were your own you are right of course abbot i do beg your pardon however i would merely remind you that i am aiding your purpose not the other way aroundand with the kings authority i require things to be done properly and the marshal has been lax of late tut the abbot fanned the air in front of his face and frowned as if he smelled something rancid you pretty birds get your feathers ruffled and pretend you have been ill used drink your wine de glanville and put these petty differences behind you they began to discuss the evenings arrangements when the porter interrupted to announce the arrival of count falkes who appeared a moment later wrapped head to heel in a cloak of double thickness thin face red after the ride from his castle his pale hair in windtossed disarray in all he gave the impression of a lost and anxious child the abbot greeted his guest and poured him a cup of wine saying the sheriff and i were just speaking about the special entertainment an expression of resigned disappointment flitted across count falkess narrow features then you think there is no hope that the stolen items will be returned countered the sheriff oh there is hope yes but i think we must stretch a few british necks first once they learn that we are in deadly earnest they will be only too eager to return the goods the sheriff smiled cannily and sipped his wine i still do not know what was in those stolen chests that is so important to you abbot hugo saw falkes open his mouth to reply and hastily explained that i think is for the baron to answer the count and i have been sworn to secrecy the sheriff pursed his lips thinking something the baron would prefer to remain hiddena matter of life and death perhaps trust that it is so offered the count even if it were not at first it is now we have you to thank for that the sheriff quick to discern disapproval stiffened i did what i thought necessary under the circumstances in fact if i had not anticipated the wagons we would not have had any chance of catching king raven at all you still maintain that it was the phantom he is no phantom declared the sheriff he is flesh and blood whatever else he may be once word reaches him that we have hung three of his countrymen hell be only too eager to return the barons treasure three wondered the count did you say three i thought we had agreed to execute only one each day yes well answered de glanville with a haughty and dismissive flick of his head i thought better to start with three tonightit will instil a greater urgency now see here objected the count i must rule these people it is difficult enough without you me we would not be in this quagmire if you had peace there is enough blame for all to enjoy a healthy share said the abbot breaking in holding the wine jar he refreshed the cups i for one find this continual acrimony as tiresome as it is futile turning to falkes he said sheriff de glanville has responsibility for controlling the forest outlaws why not trust him to effect the return of our goods in his own way the count finished his wine in a gulp and took his leave i must see to my men he said a good idea count said abbot hugo turning to the sheriff he said you must also have much to do i have kept you from your business long enough in the square outside gulbert the gaoler had assembled the prisonerssixty men and boys in allat the foot of the gallows they were chained together and stood in the cold most of them without cloaks or even shoes their heads bowedsome in prayer some in despair marshal guy de gysburne leading his company of soldiers established a cordon line to surround the miserable group and keep any from escapingas if that were possiblebut also to keep townspeople from interfering with the proceedings in any way a few of the wives and mothers of the cymry captives had come to plead for the release of their sons or husbands and sheriff de glanville had given orders that no one was to have even so much as a word with any of the prisoners guy nursing a bad headache wanted no trouble this night to a man the ffreinc knights were helmed and dressed in mail each carried a shield and either a lance or naked sword and though none were expecting any resistance all were ready to fight count falkes had brought a dozen menatarms and these all carried torches additional torches had been given to the townsfolk and two large iron braziers set up on either side of the gallowsalong with the bonfirebathed the square in a lurid light the mostly ffreinc population of saint martins had gathered for the twelfth night spectacle along with the residents of castle truan and the merchants who had traded in town that day abbot hugo appeared dazzling in his white satin robe and scarlet cloak two monks walked before himone carrying a crosier the other a gilt cross on a pole fifteen monks followed each carrying a torch the crowd shifted to accommodate the clerics richard de glanville sheriff of the march stepped up onto the raised platform of the gallows an expectant hush swept through the crowd in accordance with the rule of the march and under authority of king william of england he called his voice loud in the silence of fluttering torches we are come to witness this lawful execution let it be known to one and all here and henceforth that refusal to aid in the capture of the outlaw known as king raven and his company of thieves will be considered treason towards the crown for which the punishment is death the sheriff glanced up as the wind gusted bringing the first frigid splash of the promised rain he took a last look around the squareat the bonfire the torches the soldiers armed and ready the closegathered crowd it occurred to him to wonder what had become of those latearriving merchants who seemed to have disappeared finally satisfied that all was as it should be de glanville gave the order to proceed stepping to the edge of the platform he turned his gaze upon the cringing victims none dared raise their heads or glance up to meet his eye for fear of being the one singled out he raised his hand and pointed to an old man who stood shivering in a thin shirt two soldiers seized the man and as they were removing the wretchs shackles the sheriff s finger came to rest over another him too said the sheriff this victim shocked that he should have been chosen as well gave out a shout and began struggling with the soldiers as they removed his chains the man was quickly beaten into submission and dragged to the platform one more from among the younger captives de glanville chose a boy of ten or twelve years bring him the youngster dazed by his captivity was too brutalized to put up a fight but some of the men nearest him began pleading with their captors offering to take the lads place their desperate protests went unheeded by soldiers who did not speak welsh and did not care anyway excitement fluttered through the crowd as the captives were dragged onto the platform and the spectators realized they would be feted to three hangings this night ropes were produced and the ends snaked over the strong beam of the gallows arm sturdy nooses were looped around the necks of the three cymryone old one young and one in his primewhose only real crime under heaven was having been captured by the normans as the nooses were being tightened there came a shout from the crowd wait stop the execution those gathered in the square ffreinc and welsh alike heard the cry in priestly latin and upon turning towards the commotion saw a company of monks in dull grey robes pushing their way through the throng to the front of the gallows stop release these men the sheriff his interest piqued called for the crowd to let them through dare you interrupt the execution of the law he asked as they came to stand before him who are you i am abbot daffyd of saint dyfrigs near glascwm he called in a loud voice and i have brought the ransom you require the sheriff cast a quick glance at abbot hugo whose plump round face showed for once plain wideeyed astonishment on the ground count falkes shoved his way towards the newly arrived monks where is it he demanded let us see it it is here lord count said daffyd his face glistening with sweat from the frantic scramble to reach the town praise jesu we have come in time he turned to one of the priests behind him and took possession of a small wooden box which he passed to the count inside this casket you will find the items which were stolen from you here here cried abbot hugo make way he pushed through the crowd to the counts side let me see that seizing the chest from the counts hands he opened the lid and peered inside god in heaven he gasped withdrawing the gloves he took out the leather bag and shoving the casket into the counts hands fumbled at the strings of the bag opened it and shook the heavy gold ring into his hand i dont believe it the ring said the count looking up sharply he said where did you get this these are the things that were stolen in the forest raid at christtide yes daffyd asked they are confirmed count falkes i ask again where did you get them with god and the whole assembly of heaven bearing witness i went to the chapel for prayers this morning and the box was on the altar when it was left there no one knows we saw no one raising his arm the welsh abbot pointed to the gallows seeing that the goods have been returned and accepted i beg the release of all prisoners for the benefit of the cymry hovering at the edges of the crowd he repeated his request in gaelic this brought a cheer from those brave enough to risk being identified by the count and sheriff as potential troublemakers abbot hugo still examining the contents of the box withdrew the carefully folded bundle of parchment here it isthe letter he said holding it up so he could see it in the torchlight it is still sealed looking to the count he said it is all hereeverything excellent falkes replied my thanks to you abbot we will now release the prisoners not so fast my lord said hugo i think there are still questions to be answered he turned with sudden savagery on the welsh abbot who gave these things to you who are you protecting my lord abbot began daffyd somewhat taken aback by his fellow churchmans abrupt challenge i do not th come now you dont expect us to believe that you know nothing about this affair i demand a full explanation and i will have it by heaven or else these men will hang daffyd indignant now puffed out his chest i resent your insinuation i have acted in good faith believing that box was given to me so that i might secure the release of the condemned mendoomed i would add through no fault of their own it would seem that your threat reached the ears of those who stole these things and they contrived to leave the box where it would be found so that i might do precisely what i have done the abbot frowned and fumed unwilling to accept a word of it count falkes on the other hand appeared pleased and relieved he replied for my part i believe you have acted in good faith abbot turning towards the gallows where everyone stood looking on in almost breathless anticipation he shouted relacher les prisonniers marshal guy turned to the gaoler and relayed the command to release the prisoners as gulbert proceeded to unlock the shackles that would free the chain sheriff de glanville rushed to the edge of the platform what are you doing letting them go replied gysburne the stolen goods have been returned the count has commanded their release he gave de glanville a sour smile it would appear your little diversion is ruined oh is it he said his voice dripping venom the count and abbot may be taken in by these rogues but i am not these three will hang as planned i wouldnt no that is the difference between us gysburne i very much would he turned and called to his men proceed with the hanging youre insane growled the marshal you kill these men for no reason the murder of my soldiers in the forest is all the reason i need these barbarians will learn to fear the kings justice this isnt justice guy answered it is revenge what happened in the forest was your fault and these men had nothing to do with it where is the justice in that the sheriff signalled the hangman who with the help of three other soldiers proceeded to haul on the rope attached to the old mans neck there came a strangled choking sound as the elderly captives feet left the rough planking of the platform it is the only law these brute british know marshal remarked the sheriff as he turned to watch the first man kick and swing they cannot protect their rebel king and thumb the nose at us we will not be played for fools he was still speaking when the arrow sliced the air over his shoulder and knocked the hangman backwards off his feet and over the edge of the platform two more arrows followed the first so quickly that they seemed to strike as one and two of the three soldiers hauling on the noose rope simply dropped off the platform the third soldier suddenly found himself alone on the scaffold unable to hold the weight of the struggling prisoner he released the rope the old man scrambled away and the soldier threw his hands into the air to show that he was no longer a threat the sheriff his face a rictus of rage spun around searching the crowd for the source of the attack as an uncanny quiet settled over the astonished and terrified crowd no one moved for an instant the only sound to be heard was the crack of the bonfire and the rippling flutter of the torches and then into the flameflickering silence there arose a horrendous teethclenching bonegrating shriekas if all the demons of hell were tormenting a doomed soul the sound seemed to hang in the cold night air and as if chilled by the awful cry the rain which had been pattering down fitfully till now turned to snow de glanville caught a movement in the shadows behind the church there he cried there they go take them marshal gysburne drew his sword and flourished it in the air he called to his men to follow him and started pushing through the crowd towards the church they had almost reached the bonfire when out from its flaming centreas if spat from the red heat of the fire itselfleapt the black feathered phantom king raven one look at that smooth black skulllike head with its high feathered crest and the improbably long cruelly pointed beak and the cymry cried out rhi bran the soldiers halted as the creature spread its wings and raised its beak to the black sky above and loosed a tremendous shriek that seemed to shake the ground out from behind the curtain of flame streaked an arrow guy in the fore rank of his men caught the movement and instinctively raised his shield the arrow slammed into it with the blow of a masons hammer knocking the ironclad rim against his face and opening a cut across his nose and cheek gysburne went down rhi bran y hud shouted the cymry their faces hopeful in the flickering light of the twelfth night bonfire rhi bran y hud kill him kill him screamed the sheriff do not let him escape kill him the shout was still hanging in the air as two arrows flew out from the flames streaking towards the sheriff who was commanding the gallows platform as if it was the deck of a ship and he the captain the missiles hissed as they ripped through the slowfalling snow one struck the gallows upright the other caught de glanville high in the shoulder as he dived to abandon his post suddenly the air was alive with singing arrows they seemed to strike everywhere at once blurred streaks nearly invisible in the dim and flickering light fizzing and hissing through the snowfilled air they cameeach one taking a ffreinc soldier down with it three flaming shafts arose from the bonfire describing lazy arcs in the darkness the fire arrows fell on the gallows kindling the post and nowempty platform count falkes transfixed by the sight of the phantom stood as arrows whirred like angry wasps around him he had heard so much about this creature whom he had so often dismissed as the fevered imaginings of weak and superstitious minds yet here he wasstrange and terrible and god help us all magnificent in his killing wrath the last thing falkes de braose saw was sheriff de glanville eyes glazed clutching the shaft of the arrow that had pierced his shoulder passed through and protruded out his back the sheriff staggering like a drunk lurched forward dagger in his hand struggling to reach the phantom of the wood count falkes turned and started after the sheriff to drag him back away and out of danger he took but two steps and called out to de glanville the word ended in a sudden sickening gush as an arrow struck him squarely in the chest and threw him down on his back he felt the cold wet mud against the back of his head and then nothing chapter see now odo i tell my dull if dutiful scribe we did not plan to attack the sheriff and his menwe were sorely outmanned as you well knowbut we came ready to lend muscle to abbot daffyds demand to stop the hangings but you killed four men and wounded seven odo points out you must have known it would come to a fight bran suspected the sheriff would betray himself and he wanted to be there to prevent the executions if it came to that as it happens he was right so if youre looking for someone to blame for the twelfth night slaughter you need look no further than richard de glanvilles door odo accepts this without further question and we resume our slow dance towards my own appointment with the hangman bran was angry furious id never seen him so enragednot even in the heat of battle when fighting an icy calm descended over him with swift but studied motion he bent the belly of the bow and sent shaft after shaft of winged death to bite deep into enemy flesh he did not exult neither did he rage but this this was something differenta black impenetrable fury had swept him up and he shook with it as he stalked around the fire ring in his hut his face twisted into a rictus of ferocity like a terrible monstrous beast anger had consumed him completely seeing him now a body would not have known him as the same man from the night before for as we stood in the town square on twelfth night and the realisation broke upon us that sheriff bloody de glanville would hang those three men even after recovering the treasure bran simply turned to us as we gathered close about and said in a low voice string your bows then he calmly set about the destruction of our enemies as i said to odo it was no great surprise that the vile sheriff would betray his own promise truth be told we fairly expected it that is why we had hurried from the abbey to the town ahead of abbot daffyd to ensure that the sheriff would release the captives once the stolen goods were returned i reckon that each of us in some corner of our hearts knew it was all too likely de glanville would show his true colours that grim night now that it was over however bran had stewed and fretted and worked himself into a towering rampage the man is a craven butcher spat bran pacing around the hearth fleeing the town we had ridden all night to reach cel craidd none of us had slept nor could we though exhaustion heaved heavy rollers upon us we sat around the lowflickering fire and listened to our lord give voice to his anger in the time i had been among the grellon i had picked up hints and suggestions that our lord bran sometimes suffered from black unreasoning rages but i had never seen it for myself until now he must be stopped snarled bran smashing his fist against his thigh with each word god as my witness he will be stopped de glanville had no intention of keeping his word iwan pointed out he meant to kill as many as he could from the start id like to see him dance on the end of that leather rope it may be too late for that said tuck quietly as everyone turned toward him he yawned hugely and said he may be dead already i saw him struck did i not its true i affirmed i saw it too he took an arrow maybe allowed our incensed lord but i wont rest until ive seen his head on a pole for a certainty tuck insisted i saw him go down he might have been struck but was he killed bran glared around at us as if we were a troop of enemy soldiers sprung up to surround him was he killed bran demanded his voice aquiver with passion is he dead there was no way for any of us to know that beyond a doubt when the time came to flee we had all cleared off like smoke we had done what we could do the few of us and were in danger of overstaying our welcome so with the confusion at its height we used the chaos in the town square to cover our retreat i was not counting bodies remarked iwan he glanced around somewhat defiantly nor did i see anyone else with a tally stick de glanville must have been killed said merian if he took an arrow he must be dead by now bran calm yourself it is over and done you saved those men and the ffreinc have been dealt a blow be satisfied with that bran regarded her with a look of cruel disdain but he held his tongue when he could trust himself to speak again he said dead or alive we must know beyond a doubt one way or the other we must find out well know soon enough pointed out tuck word will spread aye but late in coming here suggested siarles unless someone went to llanelli to find out said bran using the welsh name for the place like all true sons of elfael our bran refused to dignify the norman name of saint martins by uttering it aloud none of us can go iwan said they know us now wed be caught and strung up on sight someone who has never been there then said tuck thinking aloud or added bran glancing up quickly someone who goes there all the time turning to siarles he said fetch gwion bach we have a chore for him well before anyone could gainsay the plan the boy was found and brought to sit with the council a quick intelligent lad he is as i say a mute and such a furtive little sneak that he easily flits from place to place with no one the wiser and so quiet folk dont often know hes around the townsfolk had long since grown used to seeing him here and there and it is a fair bet that no one thought anything of it when he appeared the evening following what the alarmed citizens of saint martins are now calling the twelfth night massacre iwan and i walked him to the edge of the forest and beyond as far as we dared go then left him to hurry on his way into town it was long past dark by the time we returned gwion stayed in town overnight god knows where and returned to cel craidd late the next day the winter sun was almost down when he appeared redcheeked from his run through the frosty air bran had food and drink ready and waiting for him but the boy would not sit down less yet touch a bite until he had delivered his charge he fairly danced with excitement at being included in the plans of his elders good lad good said bran kneeling down in front of him did you learn what we want to know gwion nodded so hard i thought his head might fall off is the sheriff alive asked iwan unable to restrain himself bran gave the big man a perturbed glance and said is he alive gwion is the sheriff still alive the boy nodded again with undimmed enthusiasm and the count asked tuck he was hit too did the count survive the boy turned wide eyes towards the friar and lifted his shoulder in an elegant shrug you dont know asked merian the boy shook his head he did not know how the count fared but the sheriff it seemed had indeed survived bran thanked the boy with a hug and dismissed him to his supper with a pat on the head and chuck under the chin so now he said when gwion had gone it seems the sheriff lives i think we must invite him to cel craidd and arrange a suitable welcome for him when he arrives the anger which i had allowed myself to imagine had burned itself out between times leapt uprenewed refreshed and just as poisonous as beforeall in that blinding instant i saw the darkness draw a veil across his eyes and his grin become malicious frightening hear me now he said his voice a smothered whisper this is what we are going to do when he had delivered his demands to us we were allowed to go rest and eat and prepare ourselves for the fight ahead i walked by noins hut and although it was early yet could discern no light from a welcome fire in the hearth i reckoned she had given up waiting for me and gone to sleep i was that tired myself that i left her and the mite to their rest and took myself off to my own cold bed thus i did not see noin until the next day she had heard all about the twelfth night battle of course and was that heartily glad we had freed the captives and lived to tell the tale she was not best pleased however to learn that we could not be wed just yet on account of lord brans plan to host a visit by the sheriff and how do you imagine the sheriff will agree to come she asked in all innocence i do not imagine for one moment that old richard ratface will agree to anything we say or do i replied then how she protested shh i laid a fingertip to her lips and then kissed them enough questions now i cannot tell you any more than i have but it is a secret until all is in order ive said too much already i whispered let us talk of something else very well she agreed with grudging reluctance let us talk of our wedding tuck is here now and ive been thinking that she must have seen my face fall just then for she said now what is the matter what have i said nothing i replied all is well truly love it is just that we cannot be married yet and why not noin frowned dangerously warning me that my explanation had better be good enough to save a hiding in the end since i could not tell her what bran was planning i simply replied it seems i must go away again go she asked where this time not far i said and it will only take a day or sobut we are leaving at once she sighed and tried to smile ah well i suppose i should be grateful you bothered to come back at all before i could think what to say to that she rose come back to me when you can staywill scarlet she said i saw the sheen of tears in her eyes as she turned away noin please dont but she was already gone iwan found me a short time later ready will it makes no matter i grumbled then let us be about our work our work was to reassemble the wagons we had taken apart in the christmas raid brans plan was simple but required a little preparation while iwan tomas siarles and i carried our tools and fittings into the wood and set about putting the wains back together some of the other grellon gathered the other items we would need in order to make brans plan succeed in all it took most of the day to make the wagons serviceable once more and fortify the woodland alongside the road when we finished bran inspected the work and declared that all was ready early the next morning as the others made their way to the wagons leading the oxen i enjoyed a warm dipbath and a change of clothesi was to pass as the servant of a saxon merchantand then armed with only a knife in my belt i lit out for saint martins after a brisk ride i approached the town on the kings road and entered the square as the bell in the church began tolling at first i imagined it was some kind of alarm and braced myself to ride away again in retreat but it was only the summons to midday prayers it drew few worshippers and no soldiers at all plucking up my courage i dismounted walked to the guardhouse and knocked on the door after a few moments standing in the cold the door opened and a young soldier looked out seeing no one but a rough saxon standing before him he said quel est que voulezvous mendiant this was spoken rudely as one would speak to a bothersome dog i do not think he even expected an answer for before i could make a reply he began to shut the door arreter sil vous plait un moment hearing his own language spat back at him like that he paused and opened the door once more please sire i said feeling the french words strange in my mouth i was told i would find the sheriff here you were told wrong he said then pointed to a large house across the square he lives there i thanked the soldier for his trouble and walked across the town square so far the plan was holding together now that i knew where the sheriff could be found and that i could trust myself in marketplace ffreinc it was time to get down to business i knocked on the door that opened onto the street a word if you please i said to the man who answered he appeared to be a servant onlywhoever he was i knew it was not the sheriff i have come to see the sheriff on an urgent matter what would that be inquired the fella it is a matter for his honour the sheriff himself alone i said are you sheriff de glanville no i am his bailiffwithout another word he opened the door wider and indicated that i was to come inside this way he said closing the door behind him he led me up stone steps to the single large room which occupied the upper floor a fire burned in a stone fireplace and near it a heavy table had been set up richard de glanville sat in a big thronelike chair facing the fire his legs and feet covered by a deerskin robe there was a young gyrfalcon perched on a wooden stand next to him what he said without taking his gaze from the fire i told you i was not to be disturbed antoin i noticed his voice was thick in his throat please my lord sheriff i said i have come from hereford with a message from my master i do not care if you have come from hell with a message from the devil he snarled with unexpected savagery go away leave me the bailiff called antoin gave me a half shrug as you see he is not feeling well come back another time maybe is he injured i asked trying to determine if in fact he had been wounded in the skirmish as tuck believed no replied antoin not that way bailiff growled the sheriff from his chair i said to leave me alone he did not turn from staring at the fire it would be best to come back another time antoin said turning me toward the door once more this is not possible i said you see my master is a gold merchant he and some other merchants are on the way to saint martins today he has sent me to beg soldiers to help us through the forest i lowered my voice and added we have been hearing worrisome tales about a ah phantom of the wood this king raven no we beg protection and we can pay antoin frowned i could see him wavering my master has said he will gladly pay anything you ask i told him anything reasonable where is your master now they were already entering the forest when i left them on the road how many four only i answered and two wagons he considered this a moment tapping his chin with his finger then he said a moment please leaving me by the door he walked to where the sheriff was seated and knelt beside the chair they exchanged a brief word and antoin rose quickly and returned to me he has agreed to provide you with an escort see to your horse and wait for me in the square outside i will summon the men and meet you there very well sire i said ducking my head like a dutiful vassal thank you i returned to the square and watered my mount in a stone trough outside the guardhouse then waited for the sheriff and his soldiers to appear while i waited i observed the square searching for any signs of the battle that had taken place only a few nights before there were none aside from a few hoofprints in the churnedup mud and here and there a darker stain which might have been made by blood there was nothing at all to suggest anything more than a twelfth night revel had taken place even what was left of the gallows had been removed i wondered about this why take away the gibbet was it merely that it was not needed now that the captives would not be executed or was there more to itan end to the sheriff s hanging ways perhaps i determined to find out if i could when bailiff antoin appeared a short time later i found my chance quickly scanning the double rank of knights i did not see the one man i wanted where is sheriff de glanville i asked he has asked me to lead the escort said antoin just like that our deception was dashed to pieces will he come later i asked climbing into the saddle mind whirling like a millwheel in the race i tried my best to think how to rescue our shattered plan no replied the bailiff he will remain here and await our return ride on lead the way that is how i came to be leading a company of six knights a bailiff and three menatarms into the forestand myself to my doom chapter ogof angharad it had taken far longer to reach the cave than she hoped the deep snow underfoot made for slow going and now as angharad toiled up the long steep track leading to the rock cave she wished she had left cel craidd earlier already there were stars peeping between the clouds to the east it would be dark before she could get a fire going exhausted she paused and sat on the cracked bole of a fallen tree to rest for a moment and catch her breath for the final climb up to the cave entrance she listened to the silence of the forest keen ears straining for wayward sounds all she heard was the tick of branches settling in the evening air and far off the rasping call of a rook coming in to roost the distant lonely sound moved her unexpectedly she loved the winter and the night she loved the forest and all its wondersjust one of innumerable gifts bestowed by a wildly benevolent creator before thee may i be forever bowing kindly king of all creation sighed angharad the prayer rising gently upward with the visible mist of her breath and then leaning on her staff much more heavily than before she continued on her way upon reaching the small level clearing halfway up the hill she paused again to catch her breath the day would come when she would no longer have the strength to climb up to her ogof her cave house the snow lay undisturbed deep and crisp and white before the open black entrance all was as it should be so she moved quickly inside throwing off her tuck bag and cloak at the threshold then gathering the dry kindling from its place by the cave mouth she carried it to the fire ring working in utter darkness her deft fingers found the steel and flint and wisps of birch bark and soon the rosy bloom of a fire was spreading up through the mass of broken twigs with patience born of long practice angharad shepherded the flames slowly feeding in larger branches until the fire spread its rosy glow over the interior of the cave rising from her knees she removed her shoes and her wet cold robe and drew the undershift over her head then hung the damp garments from hooks set in the rock walls of the cave so that they could dry she unrolled her favourite bearskin nearer the stillgrowing fire and lay down closing her eyes she luxuriated in the blessed warmth seeping into her ancient bones after a time she roused herself and wrapping herself in a dry cloak she kept in a basket in the cave she began to prepare a simple meal singing as she worked she sang o wise head rock and redeemerin my deeds in my words in my wishesin my reason and in the fulfilling of my desires be thou in my sleep in my dreams in my repose in my thoughts in my heart and soul always be thou and may the promised son of princely peace dwell aye in my heart and soul always may the longawaited son of glory dwell in me taking the stone lid from a jar she placed a double handful of barley meal into a wooden bowl adding a splash of water from the stoup and a bit of lard from the leather tuck bag she had brought with her she kneaded the dough and set it aside to rest while she filled her kettle and put it on the fire to boil next she formed the dough into small cakes and set them on the rounded stones of the fire ring then while waiting for the water to boil and the cakes to bake she resumed her song in my sleep in my dreams in my repose in my thoughts in my heart and soul always be thou thou a bright flame before me be thou a guiding star above me be thou a smooth path below me be and thou a stout shield behind me be today tonight and ever more this day this night and forever more come i to thee jesu jesu my druid and my peace she rested listening to the fire as the flames devoured the fuel and the water bubbled in the kettle when the water reached the boil she roused herself and turned the cakes then she rose and taking a handful of dried herbs and roots from another of her many jars and baskets she cast the stuff into the steaming bath removing the kettle from the fire to allow the mixture to steep and cool when it was ready she poured some of the potion into a wooden bowl and drank it savouring the mellow calming effect of the brew as it eased the stiffness in her old muscles she ate a few of the cakes and felt her strength returning the warmth of the fire and food combined with the exertions of the last days made her drowsy yawning she rose and carried some more wood to the hearth so that it would be close to hand then banking the fire for the night she lay down to sleep she stretched out on the bearskin and pulled her cloak over her and along with it a covering made from the downy pelt of a young fallow deer there was no special significance to these but like the wise women of old who esteemed the hides of the red ox for qualities friendly to dreams and visions angharad had always had good luck with this particular combination at once exhaustion from her long walk overwhelmed her and dragged her down into the depths of unknowing she fell asleep with the words of her song still echoing through her mind and heart in my sleep in my dreams in my repose in my thoughts in my heart and soul always be thou thou a bright flame before me be thou a guiding star above me be thou a smooth path below me be and thou a stout shield behind me be today tonight and ever more she had come to her cave to dream she had come to think and to spend time alone away from bran and the others in order to discern the possible paths opening before them into the future following the last raid the feeling had come upon her that bran stood at a crossing of the ways it may have been the appearance of the barons odd giftsthe gold ring and embroidered gloves and mysterious letterwhich filled her with sick apprehension but the counts swift retaliation in burning the forest indicated that the theft was far more damaging than any of them had yet suspected this did seem to be the case whatever value those particular objects possessed was far beyond silver or gold it was measured in life and death this is what concerned angharad most of all not since the coming of king raven to the greenwood had anything like this happened she did not know what it meant and not knowing made her uneasy so she had come to her snug ogof to seek an answer all along the way as she trudged through the deepdrifted snow she had turned this over in her mind as her aged body stumped along her agile mind ranged far and wide through time and realms of ancient lore searching out the more obscure pathways of knowledge and knowing means now largely forgotten as a child sitting at the feet of delyth her peoples wise hudolion little angharad had seen how the old woman had cast a pinch of dry herb powder into the flames as she stirred her porridge taking a deep breath she had announced that the hunting party that had been away for three days was returning go bee that was her nickname for young angharad go tell the queen to fill the ale vat and fire the roasting pit for her husband will soon arrive angharad knew better than to question her banfaith so she jumped up and darted off to deliver the message three pigs and four stags delyth called as the youngster scampered away tell her we will be entertaining strangers as well before the sun had quartered the sky the hunting party rode into the settlement leading pack animals bearing the dressed carcases of three big boars and four red deer stags with them as the banfaith had said were strangers three men and two boys from penllyn a cantref to the north who were to be their guests that was not the first or last time she had witnessed such foretelling of events but it was the time she asked how the banfaith gained this knowledge knowledge is easy the old woman told her wisdom is hard but how did you know she persisted was it in the smoke banfaith delyth smiled and shook her head when something happens little one it is like casting a rock into a poolit sends ripples through the subtle currents of time and being her fingers lightly bounced as if tracing such ripples if you know how you can follow all the rings back to where they began and see the rock that made them can you teach me she had said blissfully ignorant of what she was asking banfaith delyth had cupped her small face in her wrinkled hand and gazed deep into her eyes for a long time aye yes little bee i think i can in that moment angharads life and destiny had been decided the cave had been delyths ogof and that of the hudolion before her and so on now a lifetime or two later she was about to call on those same skills she had first learned from her wise teacher so many many years ago it would take all her considerable skill and experience to succeed events which had happened so far away were much more difficult to discern their ripplesshe still thought of it that waywere faint and diffused by the time they reached angharads cave in the forest she would have to be on her best mettle to learn anything useful at all but if she was right in thinking that the appearance of the barons curious gifts signalled an event of great significance the ripples cast in the pool of time and being would be more violent and she still might be able to learn something about what and who had caused them she slept and rose early but rested the herbal tincture had done its restorative work and she felt clearheaded and ready to proceed she built up the fire from coals smoored the night before and set about making some porridge on which to break her fast it was dark outside yet the sun would be late rising so she lit a few of the clay candle pots she had scattered around the cave and soon the dark interior was glowing with soft flickering light she had brought a bit of cooked meat with her and decided to warm it up too if all went well she would need a little flesh to carry her through until she could eat again after she had eaten angharad went outside knelt in the snow and as a pale pink sun broke in the east she lifted her hands in a morning prayer of thanksgiving guidance and protection when she finished she walked to an alcove deeper in the cave and took up the hidewrapped bundle thereher harp returning to the hearth she settled herself on her threelegged stool and began to play stroking the strings tuning them as needed limbering up fingers that were no longer as supple as they had once been after a time the music began to work its ancient magic she could feel her body relax as her mind began to drift on the music as a leaf drifts on the rivers flow she felt all around her the dip and swirl of time like the tiny flutters of butterfly wings causing minute eddies in the air she imagined herself standing to her thighs in a wide slowflowing stream and resting her fingertips lightly on the surface of the water so as to feel each tiny wave and ripple as it passed each of these she knew was some small happening in elfael or beyond it was always the same picture in her mind the broad easymoving water dense with the myriad particles of random happenstance glowing like pale gold beneath a sky of sunset bronze in the timebetweentimes she moved deeper into the warm wash and felt the water surge around her gently tugging against legs and gown as she stood therehead held to one side as if listening her face intent but calmtouching the sliding skin of the river as it flowed after a time her hands fell from the harp strings and found their way to a small jar she had placed beside her stool she withdrew a pinch of a pungent herb and dropped it into the flames just as delyth had done so long ago the smoke rose instantlya clean dry aromatic scent that seemed to sharpen her inner sight and touch she imagined she could feel the ripples more easily now as her fingers played among them there were so many so very many she shrank within herself to see how many there were and each one connected in some way to another and to many others it was impossible to know which of all those flowing ripples bore significance for her she lifted her fingers to the strings and began strumming the harp once more holding in her mind an image of the ring and the gloves demanding of the flowing stream to bring her only those waves and ripples where the ring and gloves could be felt it took monumental patience and ferocious concentration but at last the river seemed to change course slightlyas when the tide which has been rising all the while suddenly begins to ebb this it does between one wave and the next and while there is nothing to signal the change it is definite inexorable and profound the flow of time and being changed just as surely as the tide and she felt the inescapable pull of events flowing around hersome definite and fixed others halfformed and malleable and still others whose potential was long since exhausted for not everything that happened in the world was fixed and certain some events lingered long as potentialities influencing all around them and others were more transient mere flits of raw possibility as a child might dangle its fingers in the water to attract the tiny fish angharad trailed her fingers through the tideflow of all that was and is and is yet to be she imagined herself strolling through the water feeling the smooth rocks beneath her bare feet the shore moving and changing as she walked until she came to a familiar bend she had dabbled here before taking a deep breath she stretched out her hands tingling with the pulse of possibility there she felt a glancing touch like the nibble of a fish that struck and darted away an image took shape in her mind a host of knights past numbering all on the march swarming over the land burning as they advanced crushing and killing any who stood in their way black smoke billowed to the sky where they had passed at the head of this army she saw a bannerbloodred with two golden lions crouching their claws extendedand carrying the banner a man astride a great warhorse the man was broad of shoulder and gripped the pole of the banner in one hand and a bloody sword with the other he bestrode his battle horse like a champion among men but he was not a mere man for he had flames for hair and empty pits where his eyes should be the vast army arrayed behind this dread implacable lord carried lances upraiseda forest of slender shafts the steel heads catching the livid glimmer of a dying suns rays inwardly she shrank from this dread vision and half turned away instantly another image sprang into her mind a broadbeamed ship tossed high on stormy waves and a rainbattered coastline of a low dark country away to the east there were british horses aboard the ship and they tossed their heads in terror at the wildly rocking deck this image faded in its turn and was replaced by another bran bow in hand fleeing to the wood on the back of a stolen horse she could feel his rage and fear it seared across the distance like a flame he had killed there was blood behind him and a swiftly closing darkness she could not penetratebut it had a vague animal shape and she sensed a towering primitive and savage exultation the image so shocked her that she opened her eyes the cave was dark the fire had burned out she turned towards the cave entrance to see that it was dark outside the whole day had passed maybe more than one day she rose and began pulling on her dry clothes dressing to go out she wished she had thought to prepare something to eat but she had rested somewhat and that would have to keep her until she reached cel craidd if she left at once and walked through the night she could be there before nightfall tomorrow knowing she was already too late to prevent whatever had taken placesomething terrible she could feel it like a knife in her gutshe nevertheless had to go now if only to tend the wounded and gather up the broken pieces chapter well here i was twixt hammer and anvil no mistake i had little choice but to carry on as best i could hoping all the while that when we reached the meeting place in the forest i might alert bran to the disaster before the trap was sprung our plan to capture the sheriff when he arrived to escort the merchants wagons depended wholly on de glanvilles eagerness to catch king raven not one of us had foreseen the possibility that he would choose to stay home as i led those knights and soldiers into the wood on that clear bright day i felt as if i was leading them to my own funeral odo thinks this is funny he stifles a chuckle but i see his sly smirk tell me monk says i since you know so muchwhich is funnier a man about to die speaking of funerals or a priest laughing at death while the devil tugs at his elbow sorry my lor he catches himself again and amends his words sorry will i didnt mean anything i thought it amusing is all well we live to entertain our betters i tell him the condemned must be a constant source of pleasure for you and your bloody abbot hugo hugo is not my abbot this he says in stark defiance of the plain facts he is a disgrace to the cloth how now there is a small wound afestering and i poke it a little hoping to open it more odo i say shaking my head is that any way to talk about your spiritual superior abbot hugo is not my spiritual superior he sniffs even the lowest dog in the pack is superior to him this is the first time id ever heard him dishonour the abbot and i cannot help but wonder what has happened to turn this dutiful pup against his master was it something i said i do believe you are peevish my friend i say what has happened to set your teeth on edge odo sighs and rolls his eyes it is nothing he grunts and refuses to say more i coax but stubborn stump that he is odo will not budge so we go on we followed the kings road up from the vale of elfael and into the bare winter wood bailiff antoin was more than wary he was not a fool mind he knew only too well what awaited him if king raven should appear out of the shadows yet give him his due he showed courage and good humour riding into the forest to offer protection to the merchants all the soldiers did mind and most were eager to take arms against the phantom i was the judas goat leading these trusting sheep to the slaughter true i did not know what bran would do when he saw that the sheriff was not with us the bailiff noticed my fretful manner and tried to reassure me youre worrying for nothing he said the raven creature will not attack in daylight he only comes out at night where he had picked up this notion i have no idea you would know best sire i replied trying to smile the road rose up the long slope into the wood eventually following the crest a short distance before beginning the long descent into the valley of the wye the soldiers maintained an admirable wariness they talked little and kept their eyes moving they were learning if not to fear the wood and its black phantom then at least to show a crumb of respect the road is old and descends below deep banks for much of the way here and there it crosses streams and brooks that come tumbling out of the greenwood little humps of snow still occupied the shadows and places untouched by the sun the going is slow at the best of times and on that winter day with the weak sunlight spattered and splayed through bare branches little puffs of mist rising from the rocks or roots warmed by the sun eternity seemed to pass with every dragging step the men grew more quiet the deeper into the wood we went i was thinking that we must be near to meeting the wagons when i heard the low bellow of an ox and the creaking of wooden wheels i raised myself in the saddle to listen a moment later the first wagon hove into view i saw iwan walking beside the lead ox holding a long goad in his merchants clothinga long wool cloak tall boots and a broad belt to which a fat purse was attachedhe seemed only slightly more tame than usual he was shaved and his hair had been trimmed to make him appear more like a merchant or the guard of a travelling trader the other wagon was some distance behind and i could only just make it out as it lumbered toward us bumping along the rutted road i did not wait for bailiff antoin to make the first move there they are i called this way with a slap of the reins i rode on ahead leaving the ffreinc to come on at their own pace i wanted a word with bran before they arrived rhi bran was sitting in the second wagon which was being led by siarles i rode directly to bran he smiled when he saw me and raised his hand in greeting but the smile quickly faded trouble de glanville is not with us i said he would not come and sent his bailiff instead brans eyes narrowed as his mind began to work on the problem iwan joined us just then and i explained what i had just told bran do you think he suspected a trap i shook my head he is sick i thinkmaybe from the wound he took on twelfth night he would not leave his chamber iwan cast a glance at the advancing soldiers we had but a moment more before a decision would be needed siarles said we cannot send them back i suppose said i maybe you could go explain to them that they are no longer needed siarles frowned and gave a snort of derision then turned to bran to see what he would say we were all looking at bran by then it was time to decide well my lord i asked what will you do we will go on bran smiled and raised his hand as the bailiff came riding up come back and speak to me when we reach the town all is well i told antoin in my broken french they say there has been no sign of the phantom of the wood we will not see that black coward today the bailiff declared but i noticed he cast a hasty glance round about just to make certain he had not spoken too soon he called a command for some of his men to fall in behind the last wagon and guard the rear if you are ready he said wheeling his horse we will move along we must hurry if we are to reach saint martins by nightfall lead the way my lord i said and accompanied him to the front of the train only two wagons asked antoin as we began the return journey only two i confirmed why do you ask he shrugged i thought it would be more where are they from he asked from the north country i told him the southern ffreinc knew little about anything beyond the great ouse it is a hard winter up there trading is easier in the south this time of year antoin nodded as if this were well known and we made our way up the slope to the crest of the ridge once more the wagons rumbling slowly behind us every now and then the bailiff would ride off to one side and look back to reassure himself that all was as it should be as we started down into the vale of elfael i wondered what bran was thinking and how we would make good the deception we might have posed as the traders we professed to be but we had no goods to trade we had a few pelts and some other odds and ends but that was only for show once we reached the market square we would be discovered for the rascals we were now and again i found a chance to look back but bran was too far behind and i could not see him i tried slowing down so as to drop back to speak to him but the bailiff kept everyone moving saying step up step up dont fall behind we want to reach the town before dark indeed the sun was well down by the time we left the forest clouds were drifting in from the west and the wind was picking upa wild night in the offing we came to the fording place where the road crossed the stream that cuts through the floor of the valley the animals need water i called before the bailiff could say otherwise i slid down from the saddle and gave my horse to drink one by one the others joined us at the ford while the oxen drank i sidled over to where bran was standing what are we to do i asked smiling and nodding as though we talked of nothing more consequential than the weather it will be almost dark by the time we reach the square he said so much the better tell the bailiff we mean to make camp for the night behind the church and that we will set out our wares in the morning ill explain the rest when theyve left us alone i nodded to show i understood and then felt his hand on my shoulder nothing to fearwill he said well just have a little further to ride when we snatch de glanvillenothing more all will be well i nodded again and then walked back to my mount bailiff antoin called to his men to move the wagons on and we were soon rolling again down and down into the valley leaving the protection of the forest behind the clouds thickened and the wind sharpened the sun set as the first wagon passed castle truan the old caer brans former home though we were that close we could almost reach out and touch the wooden palisade bran gave no sign that he knew the place as we passed one of count de braoses men came out to meet us on the road and i feared he might make trouble he and antoin exchanged a brief word and he rode back up to the fortress we continued on to the town which we could see in the near distance the wind fell away as we rounded the foot of the fortress mount a silvery pall of smoke hung over the town folk were expecting a cold night and had already built their fires high i could well imagine the warmth of those flames burning brightly on the hearth and longed to stretch my cold bones beneath a tight roof the soldiers seeing we were within sight of the town and there were no bandits lurking on the hilltops asked to be relieved of duty the bailiff turned to me and said the town is just there you are safe now i thanked him for his good care and said we will make camp behind the church and offer trade tomorrow pray do not trouble yourself any longer on our account then i will bid you good night said antoin he made no move to leave until i dipped my fingers into the leather purse at my belt and drew out some silver i dropped the coins into his palm and his fist closed over them without a word he signalled to the others his men put spurs to their mounts and they all galloped for home i wheeled my mount and hurried back to the second wagon theyre away home i told iwan in the first wagon as i passed him keep moving reining in beside bran i said theyve gone on ahead to town i thanked them and explained that wed make camp behind the church i dont think they suspect anything good said bran we should have some time to work rising in his seat he turned and looked back the way wed come i thought he was looking at the fortress but he said now where did those other soldiers get to other soldiers i asked they all returned to saint martins all but three said bran there were five behind us and only two rode on now i looked back along the trail to see if i might catch sight of the missing three i saw nothing but a dull grey mist rising with the oncoming night i dont see anyone it would be good to know what happened to them could they have stopped at the caer i wondered bran shrugged more likely stopped to pee he turned around again and said lead on will lets get to the church it was well and truly dark by the time we reached the little town square no one was about the mud underfoot had hardened with the cold and crunched under the heavy wagon wheels a single torch burned outside the guardhouse and it fluttered in the rising wind of our escort of soldiers there was no sign no doubt they had already stabled their horses and gone in to their supper the thought of a hot meal brought the water to my mouth and made my stomach gurgle as we passed the stone keep of the guardhouse a burst of laughter escaped into the square it was the sound of soldiers at their drinka fella has only to hear that once to know it whenever he hears it again crossing the square we passed the church and made our way to the little grove behind we put the wagons in the grove unhitched the oxen and led them to the wall of the church where they might get some shelter from the wind we tethered them so they might graze and left them gather round said bran and we formed a tight circle around him as he explained how we were to proceed but before we go any further we must get some horses he concluded leave that to me said iwan siarles and i will get them bran nodded then willyou and i will fetch the sheriff tomas he said turning to the young welshman you wait here and ready our weapons pray all of you that we dont need them we all crept to the corner of the church and looked across to the stables god with you said bran and you said iwan then he and siarles moved out into the square they walked quickly but without seeming to hurry a halfmoon sailed high overhead shining down through rents in the low clouds they reached the stables and let themselves in bran turned to me his smile dark and sinister ready will i nodded and told him what to expect inside the sheriff s house maybe i should lead the way we hurried along the wall of the church and then passed in front of the entrance i thought i could hear the monks praying inside as we moved off towards the sheriff s house we paused at the door and as i put my hand to the latch bran eased the sword from where it had been hidden beneath his cloak sick or not i do expect de glanville to come along quietly he said but i would prefer not to kill him it may come to that i said pushing open the door we began to climb the stairs to the upper floor as quietly as we could even so de glanville heard us cela vous antoin he called out in ffreinc his words slurred in his mouth i hesitated and glanced at bran answer him he whispered antoin the sheriff called again oui cest i replied speaking low trying to make my voice sound as much like the bailiff s as i couldeasier to do i discovered in ffreinc than saxon venir he said le vin de boisson avec moi un moment i called to bran i whispered i think he wants us to come drink with him right friendly of him whispered bran let us not keep him waiting we started up the stairs i let my feet fall heavily on the wooden treads to cover the sound of brans lighter steps behind me we entered together pausing in the doorway to take in the room which was deep in shadow the only light came from the fire in the hearth which had burned low the sheriff was still sitting wrapped in his deerskin robe before the hearth the remains of a meal lay scattered over the nearby table remettre votre manteau antoin said de glanville et dessiner une chaise pres du feu take him now whispered bran in my ear i felt his hand on my back urging me forward as he sprang past me into the room de glanville sensed the sudden surge towards him but made no move to prevent us or call out he simply turned his head as we rushed to his chair bran on one side and myself on the other he did not seem especially surprised to see us but when he languidly raised his hand as if to fend us off with backward flick of his wrist i saw that he understood something of the danger descending upon him drunk as a bishop i said hes probably been sucking the bottle all day a lazy smile spread across the sheriff s narrow rat face vous netes pas antoin he said the wine rank on his breath ou est antoin look at him i said shaking my head with disgust doesnt even know who we are good replied bran it makes our chore that much easier taking de glanvilles arm he pulled the sheriff to his feet where he stood swaying like a willow wand in a gale he cant walk i said well have to carry him take his feet bran allowed the sheriff to topple gently backwards and caught him under the arms stooping i grabbed his ankles and together we slung him between us and started hauling him down the stairs and out the door de glanville unresisting allowed himself to be rough handled all the way to the bottom he revived somewhat as we stepped outside and the cold air hit him he moaned and rolled his head from side to side we started out across the square and as we passed in front of the church the door opened and out came a gaggle of monks carrying torches prayers finished i suppose they were returning to the abbey and were brought up short by the sight of two men makin off with a third tell them hes drunk and were taking him home bran said quick will tell them i did as he commanded and that might have succeededas indeed we thought for a fleeting moment that it hadbut for the knights that appeared out of the night we heard the sound of hooves and turned to see the three missing soldiers pounding into the square there we were bran and will scarlet with sheriff de glanville slung between us like a bag of wet cornthieves caught with the plunder in hand arret vous arretez labas shouted the foremost knight he says we are to halt i told bran i got that keep going urged bran well lose them when we get to the horses ils ont tue le sherif shouted another i might have misunderstood but that brought me up short theyve recognised the sheriff i gasped they think weve killed him tell them theyre wrong said bran tell them hes a friend of ours fallen drunk but for gods sake keep moving i shouted back as bran commanded but the knights came on regardless as they drew nearer i saw that one of them carried a bulky bundle across the back of his horse as the knight passed into the torchlight i saw a dark head of hair and small arms hanging limply down and knew at once what they had captured bran i hissed dropping the sheriff s heels theyve got gwion bach chapter the knights rode on drawing their weapons as they came one of them shouted for us to halt arret arret bran released the sheriff s shoulders de glanville landed heavily on the frozen ground which seemed to revive the fella somewhat he grunted and rolled over we streaked down the side of the church shouting to iwan and siarles that we were attacked we rounded the corner to discover that those two had not yet returned from the stables but tomas was there waiting with longbows strung and swords unsheathed we each grabbed a bow and a handful of arrows and spread out keeping the wall of the church behind us the soldiers did not stop to help the sheriffno doubt they thought him dead alreadybut came pounding around the corner of the church and into a sharp hail of arrows we loosed at will one rider was struck high in the chest and thrown over the rump of his mount the two remaining knights tried to swerve out of the way but horses are far from the nimblest creatures afoot as they slowed to turn we drew and loosed again a second knight went down and the thirdthe one with gwion bound to his saddlethrew his hands high in surrender get the horses shouted bran tomas and i ran to catch the two riderless mounts and bran took care of the third he gestured with a strung arrow for the knight to dismount and lay down flat on the ground then ever so gently lifted the head of the boy gwion gwion wake up the lad opened his eyes saw bran and began to cry bran untied him double quick lifted him down from the horse and began rubbing the warmth back into the little uns hands and feet will he shouted as i came running back go see what has happened to iwan and siarles i skittered down the side of the church towards the square the sheriff still lay where we had dropped him sound asleep again in his drunken stupor the square was empty the monks had disappearedeither back into the church or more likely theyd scurried off to the abbey i ran to the stables and quietly pulled open the door first to meet my eye were three ffreinc grooms lying on the floor of the stable dead or unconscious i could not tell iwan and siarles were cinching the saddle straps of the last two mounts hsst i said putting my head through the gap in the door what is taking so long iwan glanced around as he pulled the strap tight we had to put some fellas to sleep he said were ready now then hurry i said weve been attacked how many asked siarles gathering the reins of two fresh horses three knights i said two are down and the other surrendered hurry i pulled open the stable doors allowing iwan and siarles to lead the saddled horses out they headed down the short ramp and into the quiet square all was silent and dark just as we started across to the church however the door to the guardhouse opened and out swarmed six knights or more bloody blazes i said the monks must have told them fly the ffreinc saw us with the horses and cried for us to stop iwan leapt into the saddle of his mount and lit out for the church across the square with siarles right behind i paused to loose an arrow at the soldiers thinking to take at least one down i missed the mark but the arrow buried itself in the door frame one fella who was still inside slammed the door hard which briefly prevented any more ffreinc from spilling out that was the last of my arrows so i turned and hightailed it after the others i ran but a half dozen strides and my leg buckled under me and i fell in the same instant a pain like no other ripped through the meaty part of my thigh reaching down i felt the shaft of a lance the spear had hit the ground and caught me as it bounced up even as i lay clutching the wound with blood streaming through my fingers i thought that was lucky i could have been killed hard on the heels of this thought came the next will you bloody fool get up or theyll be carving your dull head from your shoulders i got to my feet and staggered forward my injured leg felt like a lump of wood on fire but i limped on bran and iwan mounted now came charging from around the back of the church bows in hand both loosed arrows at my pursuers and two soldiers fell screaming and rolling on the hard winter ground siarles cradling gwion in the saddle before him and holding the reins of one of the big ffreinc horses rode out to meet me time to go he said tossing the reins to me i caught the traces and tried to haul my foot to the stirrup but could not lift my leg i tried once and missed the ffreinc were almost upon us go on ride i said im right behind you siarles wheeled his mount and galloped away without a backward glance as i tried once more to get my clumsy foot into the stirrup i did catch the bar with my toe but the horse frightened by the noise and confusion jigged sideways my hands slippery with blood could not hold and the reins slipped from my grasp unbalanced on one leg i fell on my back squirming on the frozen ground i was still trying to get my feet under me when the ffreinc rushed up and laid hold of me i glimpsed a swift motion above me and the butt of a spear crashed down on my poor head so that odo is how they caught me i tell him he lifts his inkstained hand from the page and looks at me with his soft sad eyes i shrug all the rest you know the others got away he says and the resignation in his voice is that thick you could stuff it in your shoe they did got clean away i reply fortunate for me that the sheriff was sleeping like the drunken lump he was or i would have been strung high long since by the time he woke up abbot hugo already had me bound hand and foot and was determined to have his wicked way with me odo scratches the side of his nose with the feathered end of his quill he is trying to think of something or has thought of something and is trying to think how to say it i can see him straining at the thought but as i have all the time god sends me i do not begrudge him the time it takes to spit it out about that night he says at last did siarles leave you behind on purpose well ive asked myself the same thing once and again truth is i dont know could he have helped me get away he did bring the horse mind could he have helped me more than he did yes but remember he had gwion bach with him and any help he could have offered me would have risked all three of us could he have told iwan or bran to come back for me yes he could have done that for all i know maybe he did but then again the ffreinc were on me that quick i dont think anyone could save me getting captured i spread my hands and give him a shrug he did more or less what i would have done i suppose you would have made sure he got away will odo asserts why odo what a thing to say i reply a fellad think you cared what happened to ol will here he makes a worm face and looks down at his scrap of parchment you have to remember that it was dark and cold and everything was happening very fast i say i doubt anyone could have done more than they did it was bad luck is all bad luck from the beginning if you ask me i pause to reflect on that night no i conclude the only regret i have is that we didnt kill the sheriff when we had the chance why didnt you kill him we had some idea of holding him to justice i say and shake my head i suspect bran wanted to make him answer before the king god knows how we would have brought that about bran had a way i guess he has a way for most things odo nods he is thinking i can see the tiny wheels turning in his head what about the ring and the letter he wants to know what about them well says he who were they for now ive thought about that too the letter was addressed to the pope so i suppose they were for him which pope i stare at him the popehead of the mother church will there are two popes dunce that he is some of the most fuddling things come out of his mouth there are not two popes i tell him there are he seems quite certain of this i hold up two fingersmy bowstring fingersand repeat two popes ill wager a whole ham on the hoof that you didnt mean that just now it cannot happen it can he assures me it happens all the time see now odo have you been staring at the sun again i shake my head slowly two popes whoever heard of such a thing next youll be tellin me the moon is a bowl of curds and whey odo favours me with one of his smug and superior smirks i do not know about the moon but it happens from time to time that the church must choose between two popes so it is now i do not wonder that living in the forest as you do you might not have heard about this how in the name of holy peter james and john has it come about i have him now a wrinkle appears on odos smooth brow i do not know precisely what has happened aha you see you think to play me for a fool monk but i wont be played no no he insists there are two popes right enough it is he contends merely that the facts of such an event taking place so far away are difficult to obtain and more difficult still to credit all that can be said for certain is that there has been some kind of disagreement among the powers governing the holy church papal succession came under question he tells me how it fell out this time i cannot say but kings and emperors always try to influence the decision now that i can believe at least indeed this last did not surprise me overmuch it is all the same with kings of every stripe nothing they get up to amazes me anymore but as odo spoke i began to discern the glimmering of suspicion that this strange event and the appearance of the ring and letter in elfael might in some way share a common origin or a common end find the truth of one and i might well discover the truth of the other no doubt this is what has caused the rift this time go on i tell him im listening however it came about the disagreement has resulted in a dispute in which the two opposing camps have each chosen their own successor who claims to be the rightful pontiff two popes i mutter will wonders never cease odo has been toying with the scrap of parchment before him this is what made me think of it he says and holds up the ragged little shred there in one corner of the scrap someone has drawn a coat of arms i glance at it and make to hand it back my hand stops midway and i jerk back the parchment wait i study the drawing more closely ive seen this before i tell him it is on the ring odo do you know whose arms these are the arms of pope clement he says at least that is what the abbot has said abbot hugo told you that odo nods i regard him with an excitement i have not felt for months odo has never lied to me that is perhaps his singular virtue i think about what he has said before speaking again but see here i say slowly it is not clement we recognise as head of the church it is urban this is the difficulty he replies some hold with urban others with clement yes as you say now odo my faithful scribe tell me the truth always will which pope does baron de braose support he answers without hesitation his tone flat almost mocking clement of course i hear that in his tone which strikes a tiny spark of hope in my empty heart the way you say it a fellad think you didnt entirely approve it is not for me to approve or disapprove he counters perhaps not i allow slowly desperate to keep alive that wee spark perhaps not as you say probably it is better to let the kings and nobles fight it out amongst themselves no doubt they know best odo yawns and stretches he gathers his inkhorn and his penknife stands and shuffles to the door of my cell where he hesitates god with you will he says almost embarrassed it seems god with you odo i reply when he has gone i lie awake listening to the dogs bark and thinking that there is something very important in all this two popes business if this dull head of mine could only get a grip on what it might be chapter coed cadw the damage was done in a single illadvised ignorant stroke bran had dashed angharads carefully considered design for defeating the ffreinc invaders and driving them from elfael in a mad impulsive rush he had destroyed months of subtle labour and she could well imagine stirred the ire of the enemy to whitehot vengeance for this and much else the hudolion blamed branbut more she blamed herself angharad had allowed herself to believe that she had weaned bran away from that unreasoning rage that he had possessed when she first met him that she had at long last extinguished the allconsuming fire of an anger that like the awen of the legendary champions of old caused the lord of elfael to forget himself plunging him into the bloodred flames of battle madnessa worthy attribute for a warrior perhaps but unhelpful in a king no mistake it was a king she wanted for elfael not merely another warrior alas there was nothing for it now but to pick up the pieces and see if anything could be salvaged from the wreckage of that disastrous attempt to capture the sheriff what she had seen in the cave while testing the onrushing stream of time and events had caused her to return to cel craidd with as much haste as she could command her old bones could not move with anything near their former speed and she had arrived too late to prevent bran from acting on his ludicrous scheme the small warband had already departed for saint martins and the die was cast the wise hudolion was waiting when the raiders returned dressed in her bird spirit cloak she stood beneath the council oak and greeted them when they returned all hail great king she crowed the people of elfael can enjoy their peace this night because you have gained for them a mighty victory over the ffreinc as the rest of the forest tribe gathered she said i see a riderless horse where is will scarlet captured bran muttered there was a stifled cry from the crowd and noin rushed away from the gathering captured is he the hudolion cooed oh that is a fine thing indeed was that in your plan wise king heartsick over his failure he knew full well that he had made a grave and terrible mistake and was not of a mood to endure her mockerydeserved as it might be silence woman i will not hear it we will speak of this tomorrow yes she croaked the rising sun will make all things new and the deeds done in darkness will vanish like the shadows you go too far bran growled weary and grieving the loss of will he wanted nothing more than to slink away to his hut and like the beaten hound he was lick his wounds see here he said pointing to gwion bach as siarles eased the lad down from his mount we rescued the boy from the ffreinc they would have killed him oh indeed she queried her eyes alight with anger has it not yet occurred to you that the boy was caught only because he was following you bran drew breath to reply but realizing she was right closed his mouth again and turned away from her scorn when bran did not answer the old woman said too late you show wisdom o king too late for will scarlet go now to your rest and before you sleep pray for the man whose trust you have betrayed this night pray god to keep him and uphold him in the midst of his enemies that is exactly what bran did miserable in his failure he prayed the comfort of christ for will scarlet that the allsustaining spirit would keep his friend safe until he could be rescued or redeemed the next morning lord bran gathered the grellon and formally confessed his failure they had not succeeded in taking the sheriff and will scarlet had been captured instead noin who already knew the worst did not join the others but remained in her hut taking consolation with merian bran went to her to beg forgiveness and offer reassurance we will not rest until we have secured wills release he promised angharad soon learned of the vow and cautioned the sentiment is noble but word and deed are not one it will be long ere this vow is fulfilled why he asked what do you know only that wishing does not make doing easier my impetuous lord if our will is to be rescued then you must become wiser than the wisest serpent what does that mean by way of reply angharad simply said i will tell you tonight when the sun begins to set summon the grellon to council so as twilight claimed the forest stronghold the men stoked the fire in the fire ring and the people of cel craidd gathered once more to hear what their wise banfaith had to say as angharad took up her harp the children crowded close around her feet but their elders apprehensive and fearful now did not join them in their youthful eagerness wills fate cast a pall over everyone old enough to understand the likely outcome of his capture and every thought was on the captive this night looking out upon her audience angharad saw the faces grim in the reflected fire glow and they seemed to her in this moment not faces at all but empty vessels into which she would pour the elixir of the song which was more than a song they would hear and god willing the story would work in their hearts and minds to produce its rare healing fruit as silence descended over the beleaguered group she began to strum the harp strings letting the notes linger and shimmer in the air casting lines of sound into the gathering darknesslines by which she would ensnare the souls of her listeners and draw them into the story realm where they could be shaped and changed when at last she judged the fortuitous moment had arrived she began after the battle of the cauldron when the men of britain conquered the men of ireland she began her voice quavering slightly but gathering strength as she sang the head of bran the blessed was carried back to the island of the mighty and safely buried on the white hill facing east to protect forever his beloved albion recognition flickered among some of the older forest dwellers as the familiar names of long ago tugged at the chords of memory angharad smiled and closing her eyes began the tale known as manawyddans revenge as the warriors made their farewells and departed for their homes manawyddan chief of battle gazed down from the hill upon the muddy village of lundein and at his companions and gave a sigh of deepest regret woe is me said he woe upon woe my lord said pryderi a youth who was his closest companion why do you sigh so since you ask i will tell you replied manawyddan the reason is this every man has a place of his own tonight except one onlyand that one happens to be me pray do not be unhappy answered pryderi remember your cousin is king of the island of the mighty and although he may do you wrong you have never asked him for anything though well you might aye agreed the chieftain though that man is my kinsman i find it somewhat sad to see anyone in the place of our dead comrade and i could never be happy sharing so much as a pigsty with him then will you allow me to suggest another plan asked pryderi if you have another plan answered manawyddan i will gladly hear it as it happens the seven cantrefs of dyfed have been left to me said young pryderi it may please you to know that dyfed is the most pleasant corner of our manycoloured realm my mother rhiannon lives there and is awaiting my return then why do we linger here feeling sorry for ourselves when we could be in dyfed wait but a little and hear the rest my mother has been a widow for seven years now and grows lonely explained the youth i will commend you to her if you would only woo her and wooing win her and winning her wed her for the day you wed my mother the sovereignty of dyfed will be yours and though you may never possess more domains than those seven cantrefs there are no cantrefs in all of britain any better indeed if you had the choice of any realm in all the world you would surely have chosen those same seven cantrefs for your own i do not desire anything more replied manawyddan inspired by the generosity of his friend i will come with you to see rhiannon and this realm of which you boast so highly moreover i will trust god to repay your kindness as for myself the best friendship i can offer will be yours if you wish it i wish nothing more my friend pryderi said and the next morning as the red sun peeped above the rim of the sea they set off they had not travelled far when manawyddan asked his friend to tell him more about his mother well it may be the love of a son speaking here said the young warrior but i believe you have never yet met a woman more companionable than she when she was in her prime no woman was as lovely as queen rhiannon and even now you will not be disappointed with her beauty so they continued on their way and however long it was that they were on the road they eventually reached dyfed behold there was a feast ready for them in arberth where cigfa pryderis own dear wife was awaiting his return pryderi greeted his wife and mother then introduced them to his sword brother the great manawyddan and was it not as pryderi had said for in the battle chief s eyes the youth had only told the half rhiannon was far more beautiful than he had allowed himself to imaginemore beautiful in fact than any woman he had seen in seven years with long dark hair and a high noble forehead lips that curved readily in a smile and eyes the colour of the sky after a rain during the feast manawyddan and rhiannon sat down together and began to talk and from that conversation the chieftains heart and mind warmed to her and he felt certain that he had never known a woman better endowed with beauty and intelligence than she pryderi he said leaning near his friend you were right in everything you said but you only told me the half rhiannon overheard them talking and what was it that you said my son she asked lady said pryderi if it pleases you i would see you married to my dear friend manawyddan son of llyr an incomparable champion and most loyal of friends i like what i see of him she answered blushing to admit it and if your friend feels but the smallest part of what i feel right now i will take your suggestion to heart the feast continued for three days and before it had ended the two were pledged to one another before another three days had passed they were wed three days after the wedding they began a circuit of the seven cantrefs of dyfed taking their pleasure along the way as they wandered throughout the land manawyddan saw that the realm was exceedingly hospitable with hunting second to none and fertile fields bountiful with honey and rivers full of fish when the wedding circuit was finished they returned to arberth to tell pryderi and cigfa all they had seen they sat down to enjoy a meal together and had just dipped their flesh forks into the cauldron when suddenly there was a clap of thunder and before anyone could speak a fall of mist descended upon the entire realm so that no one could see his hand before his face much less anyone else after the mist the heavens were filled with shining light of white and gold and when they looked around they found that where before there were flocks and herds and dwellings now they could see nothing at all neither house nor livestock nor kinfolk nor dwellings they saw nothing at all except the empty ruins of the court broken and deserted and abandoned gone were the people of the realm gone the sheep and cattle there was no one left in all dyfed except the four of them and pryderis pack of hunting dogs which had been lying at their feet in the hall what is this said manawyddan i greatly fear some terrible tribulation has befallen us let us go and see what may be done though they searched the hall the sleeping nooks the mead cellar the kitchens the stables and storehouses and granaries nothing remained of any inhabitants and of the rest of the realm they discovered only desolation and dense wilderness inhabited by ferocious beasts then those four bereft survivors began wandering the land they hunted to survive and banked the fire high each night to fend off the wild beasts as day gave way to day the four friends grew more and more lonely for their countrymen and more and more desperate god as my witness announced manawyddan one day we cannot go on like this much longer yet unless we lie down in our graves and pull the dirt over our own heads pointed out pryderi i think we must endure it yet a while the next morning pryderi and manawyddan got up to hunt as before they broke fast prepared their dogs took up their spears and went outside almost at once the leader of the pack picked up the scent and ran ahead directly to a small copse of rowan trees as soon as the hunters reached the grove the dogs came yelping back all bristling and fearful and whimpering as if they had been beaten there is something strange here said pryderi let us see what hides within that copse they crept close to the rowan grove one trembling step at a time until they reached the border of the trees suddenly out from the cover of the rowans there burst a shining white boar with ears of deepest red the dogs with strong encouragement from the men rushed after it the boar ran a short distance away then took a stand against the dogs head lowered tusks raking the ground until the men came near when the hunters closed in the strange beast broke away retreating once more after the boar they went chasing it cornering it then chasing it again until they left the familiar fields and came to an unknown part of the realm where they saw rising on a great hill of a mound in the distance a towering caer all newly made in a place they had seen neither stone nor building before the boar was running swiftly up the ramp to the fortress with the dogs close behind it once the boar and the dogs had disappeared through the entrance of the caer pryderi and manawyddan pursued them from the top of the fortress mound the two hunters watched and listened for their dogs however long they were there they heard neither another bark nor whine nor so much as a whimper from any of their dogs of any sign of them there was none my lord and friend said bold pryderi i am going into that caer to recover our dogs you and i both know we cannot survive without them forgive me friend said manawyddan leaning on his spear to catch his breath but your counsel is not wise consider we have never seen this place before and know nothing about it whoever has placed our realm under this enchantment has surely made this fortress appear also we would be fools to go in it may be as you say answered pryderi but i will not easily give up my dogs for anythingthey are helping to keep us alive these many days nothing manawyddan could say would divert pryderi from this plan the young warrior headed straight for the strange fortress and reaching it looked around quickly he could see neither man nor beast nor the white boar nor his good hunting dogs neither were there houses or dwellings or even a hall inside the caer the only thing he saw in the middle of the wide empty courtyard was a fountain with marble stonework around it beside the fountain was a golden bowl of exquisite design attached by four chains so that it hung above the marble slab but the chains reached up into the air and he could not see the end of them astonished by the remarkable beauty of the bowl he strode to the fountain and reached out to touch its lustrous surface as soon as his fingers met the gleaming gold however his hands stuck to the bowl and his two feet to the slab on which he was standing he made to shout but the power of speech failed him so he could not utter a single word and thus he stood unable to move or cry out manawyddan meanwhile waited for his friend outside the entrance to the caer but refused to go inside late in the afternoon when he was certain he would get no tidings of pryderi or his dogs he turned and with a doleful heart stumbled back to camp when he came shambling in head down dragging his spear rhiannon stared at him where is my son she asked come to that where are the dogs alas he answered all is not well i do not know what happened to pryderi and to heap woe on woe the dogs have disappeared too and he told her about the strange fortress and pryderis determination to go inside truly said rhiannon you have shown yourself a sorry friend and fine is the friend you have lost with that word she wrapped her cloak around her shoulders and set off for the caer intending to rescue her son she reached the place just as the moon rose and saw that the gate of the fortress was wide open just as manawyddan had said furthermore the place was unprotected in through the gate she walked and as soon as she had entered the yard she caught sight of pryderi standing there his feet firmly planted to the marble slab his hands stuck fast to the bowl she hastened to his aid oh my son whatever are you doing here she exclaimed without thinking she put her hand to his and tried to free him the instant she touched the bowl however her two hands stuck tight and her feet as well queen rhiannon was caught too nor could she utter a single cry for help and as they stood there night fell upon the caer lo there was a mighty peal of thunder and a fall of shining mist so thick that the caer disappeared from sight when rhiannon and pryderi failed to return cigfa daughter of gwyn gloyw and wife of young pryderi demanded to know what had happened reluctantly manawyddan related the whole sorry tale whereupon cigfa grieved for her husband and lamented that her life to her was no better than death i wish i had been taken away with him manawyddan gazed at her in dumb disbelief you are wrong to want your death my lady as god is my witness i vow to protect you to my last breath for the sake of pryderi and my own dear wife do not be afraid he continued between me and god i will care for you as much as i am able as long as god shall wish us to remain in this wretched state of misery and the young woman was reassured by that i will take you at your word father what are we to do as to that i have been thinking said manawyddan and as much as i might wish otherwise i think this is no longer a suitable place for us to stay we have lost our dogs and without them to help in the hunt we cannot long survive however hard we might try though it grieves me to say it i think we must abandon dyfed and go to england perhaps we can find a way to support ourselves there if that is what you think best so be it cigfa replied through her tears for she was loath to leave the place where she and pryderi had been so happily married i will follow you so they left the comely valleys and travelled to england to find a way to sustain themselves on the way they talked lord manawyddan said cigfa it may be necessary while among the english to labour for our living if that be so what trade would you take our two heads are thinking as one replied manawyddan i have been contemplating this very thing it seems to me that shoemaking would be as good a trade as any and better than some lord the young woman protested think of your rank you are a king in your own country shoemaking may be very well for some and as good a trade as others no doubt deserve but it is far too lowly for a man of your rank and skill your indignation favours me replied manawyddan ap llyr nevertheless i have grown that fond of eating that it does me injury to go without meat and ale one day to the next i suspect it is the same with you lady cigfa nodded but said nothing therefore i have set my sights on the trade of making shoes he said and you can help by finding honest folk to buy the shoes i shall make if that is what you wish said the young woman that is what i will do the two travelled here and there and came at last to a town where they felt they might settle for a spell manawyddan took up his craft and though it was harder than he had imagined he perseveredat first making serviceable shoes then good shoes and after much diligence and hard labour fashioning the finest shoes anyone in england had ever seen he made buckle shoes with gilt leather and golden fittings and boots of reddyed leather and sandals of green with blue laces he made such wonderful shoes that the work of most other cobblers seemed crude and shabby when compared to his it was soon voiced aloud through all england that as long as either a shoe or boot could be got from manawyddan the welshman no others were worth having with lovely cigfa to sell his wares the nobles of the realm were soon refusing to buy from anybody else thus the two exiles spent one year and another in this way until the shoemakers of england grew first envious and then resentful of their success the english cobblers met together and decided to issue a warning for the welshman to leave the realm or face certain death for he was no longer welcome among them lord and father said cigfa is this to be endured from these illmannered louts not the least part of it manawyddan replied indeed i think it is time to return to dyfed it may be that things are better there now the two wayfarers set off for dyfed with a horse and cart and three good milk cows manawyddan had also supplied himself with a bushel of barley and tools for sowing planting and harvesting he made for arberth and settled there for there was nothing more pleasant to him than living in arberth and the territory where he used to hunt himself and pryderi and rhiannon and cigfa with them through the winter he fished in the streams and lakes and despite the lack of dogs was able to hunt wild deer in their woodland lairs when spring rolled around he began tilling the deep rich soil and after that he planted one field and a second and a third the barley that grew up that summer was the best in the world and the three additional fields were just as good producing grain more bountiful than any seen in dyfed from that day to this manawyddan and cigfa peacefully occupied themselves through the seasons of the year when harvest time came upon them they went out to the first hide and behold the stalks were so heavy with grain they bowed down almost to breaking we shall begin reaping tomorrow said manawyddan he hurried back to arberth and honed the scythe the following day in the green light of dawn he went out to begin the harvest when he arrived at the field he discovered to his shock and dismay nothing but naked stalks each and every stalk had been broken off and the ear of grain nipped clean away leaving just the bare stem it fair broke his heart to see it who could have done this he wailed thinking it must have been english raiders because there were no countrymen near and no one else around who could have accomplished such a feat in one night even as he was thinking this he hurried on to examine the second field and behold it was fully grown and ready to harvest god willing said he i will reap this tomorrow as before he honed the scythe and went out the next morning but upon reaching the field he found nothing except stubble o lord god he cried in anguish am i to be ruined who could do such a thing he thought and thought but reached only this conclusion whoever began my downfall is the one who is completing it he said my enemy has destroyed my country with me then he hurried to examine the third field when he got there he was certain no one had ever seen finer wheat fully grown and bending to the scythe shame on me he said if i do not keep guard tonight lest whoever stripped the other fields will come to carry off this one too whatever befalls i will protect the grain he hurried home and gathered his weapons then went out and began guarding the field the sun went down and he grew weary but he did not cease from walking around the borders of the grain field around midnight the mighty lord of dyfed was on watch when all of a sudden there arose a terrific commotion he looked around and lo there was a horde of miceand not just a horde but a horde of hordes so many mice it was not possible to count or reckon them though you had a year and a day to do it before manawyddan could move the mice descended upon the field and every one of them was climbing to the tip of a barley stalk nipping off the ear and bearing it away in less time than it takes to tell there was no stalk untouched then as quickly as they had come the mice scurried off carrying the ears of grain with them a mighty rage gripped the warrior he lunged out at the fleeing mice but he could no more catch them than he could catch the birds in the airexcept for one that was so fat and heavy manawyddan was able to spring upon it and snatch it up by the tail this he did and dropped it inside his glove then he tied the end of the glove with a string tucking the glove in his belt he turned and started back to where cigfa was waiting with a meal for the hungry guardsman manawyddan returned to the simple hut where he lived with cigfa and hung the glove on a peg by the door what have you there my lord asked cigfa brightening the fire a marauding thief replied mighty manawyddan almost choking on the words i caught him stealing the food from our mouths dear father wondered cigfa what sort of thief can you put in your glove since you ask sighed manawyddan here is the whole sad story and he told her how the last field had also been destroyed and the harvest ruined by the mice that had stripped it bare even as he was standing guard that mouse was very fat he said pointing to the glove so i was able to catch it and heaven and all the saints bear witness i will surely hang that rascal tomorrow upon my oath if i had caught any more of the thieves i would hang them all you may do as you please for you are lord of this land and well within your rights replied the young woman however it is unseemly for a king of your high rank and nobility to be exterminating vermin like that it can avail you little to trouble yourself with such a creature perhaps you might better serve your honour by letting it go your words are wise counsel to be sure answered manawyddan but shame on me if it should become known that i caught any of those thieving rascals only to let them go and how would this become known wondered cigfa is there anyone else save me to know or care i will not argue with you my daughter answered manawyddan but i made a vow and since i only caught this one i will hang it as i have promised that is your right lord she replied you know i hope that i have no earthly reason to defend this creature and would not deign to do so except to avoid humiliation for you there ive said it you are the lord of this realm you do what you will that was well said granted manawyddan i am content with my decision the next morning the lord of dyfed made for gorsedd arberth taking the glove with the mouse inside he quickly dug two holes in the highest place on the great mound of earth into which he planted two forked branches cut from a nearby wood while he was working he saw a bard coming towards him wearing an old garment threadbare and thin the sight surprised him so he stood and stared gods peace said the bard i give you the best of the day may god bless you richly called manawyddan from the mound forgive me for asking but where have you come from bard great lord and king i have been singing in england and other places why do you ask it is just that i havent seen a single person here except my dear daughterinlaw cigfa for several years explained the king that is a wonder said the bard as for myself i am passing through this realm on my way to the north country i saw you working up there and wondered what kind of work you might be doing since you ask replied manawyddan i am about to hang a thief i caught stealing the very food from my mouth what kind of thief lord if you dont mind my asking the bard wondered the creature i see squirming in your hand looks very like a mouse and so it is permit me to say that it poorly becomes a man of such exalted station to handle such a lowly creature as that thief or no let it go i will not let it go declared manawyddan bristling at the suggestion i caught this rascal stealing and i will execute the punishment for a thief upon itwhich as we all know is hanging do as you think best lord replied the bard but rather than watching a man of your rank stooping to such sordid work i will give you three silver pennies that i earned with song if you will only pardon that mouse and release it i will not let it goneither will i sell it for three pennies as you wish mighty lord said the bard and taking his leave he went away manawyddan returned to his work as he was busy putting the crossbeam between the two gallows posts he heard a whinny and looked down from the mound to see a brownrobed priest riding towards him on a fine grey horse pax vobiscum called the priest may our great redeemer richly bless you peace to you replied manawyddan wondering that another human being should appear so soon may the all wise give you your hearts desire forgive my asking said the priest but time moves on and i cannot tarry pray what kind of work occupies you this day since you ask replied manawyddan i am hanging a thief that i caught stealing the means of my sustenance what kind of thief might that be my lord asked the cleric a low thief in the shape of a mouse explained the lord of dyfed the same who with his innumerable comrades has committed a great crime against meso great that i have now no hope of survival at all though it be my last earthly act i mean to exact punishment upon this criminal my lord rather than stand by and watch you demean yourself by dealing so with that vile creature i will redeem it name your price and i will have it by my confession to god i will neither sell it nor let it go it may be true lord that a thief s life is worthless still i insist you must not defile yourself and drag your exalted name through the mud of dishonour therefore i will give you three pounds in good silver to let that mouse go between me and you and god manawyddan answered though it is a princely sum the money is no good to me i want no payment except what this thief is due its right and proper hanging if that is your final word it is then you do as you please picking up the reins the priest rode on manawyddan lord of dyfed resumed his work taking a bit of string he fashioned a small noose and tied the noose around the neck of the mouse as he was busy with this behold he heard the sound of a pipe and drum looking down from the gorsedd mound he saw the retinue of a bishop with his sumpters and his host and the bishop himself striding towards him he stopped his work lord bishop he called your blessings if you please may god bless you abundantly friend said the satinrobed bishop if i may be so bold what kind of work are you doing up there on your mound well replied manawyddan growing slightly irritated at having to explain his every move since you ask and if it concerns you at allwhich it does notknow that i am hanging a dirty thief which i caught stealing the last of my grain the very grain which i was counting on to keep myself and my dear daughterinlaw alive through the coming winter i am sorry to hear it answered the bishop but my lord is that not a mouse i see in your hand oh aye confirmed manawyddan and a rank thief it is now see here said the bishop it may be gods own luck that i have come upon the destruction of that creature i will redeem it from its welldeserved fate please accept the thirty pounds i will give you for its life for by the beard of saint joseph rather than see a lordly man as yourself destroying wretched vermin i will give that much and more gladly release it and retain your dignity nay lord bishop i will not since you will not let it go for that i will give you sixty pounds of fine silver man i beg you to let it go i will not release it by my confession to god for the same amount again and more besides money is no use to me in the grave to which i am going since the destruction of my fields if you free the mouse said the satinrobed one i will give you all the horses on the plain and the seven sumpters that are here and the seven horses that carry them i do not want for horses between you and me and god manawyddan replied i could not feed them if i had them since you do not want that name your price you press me hard for a churchman said the lord of dyfed but since you ask i want more than anything under heaven the return of my own dear wife rhiannon and my good friend and companion pryderi as i live and breathe and with god alone as my witness they will appear the moment you release that mouse did i say i was finished asked manawyddan speak up man what else do you want i want swift and certain deliverance from the magic and enchantment that rests so heavily upon the seven cantrefs of dyfed that you will have also promised the bishop if you release the mouse at once and do it no harm you must think me slow of thought and speech countered manawyddan his suspicions fully roused i am far from finished what else do you require i want to know what this mouse is to you that you should take such an interest in its fate i will tell you said the bishop though you will not believe me try me will you believe me if i tell you that the mouse you hold is really my own dear wife and were that not so we would not be freeing her right you are friend agreed manawyddan i do not believe you it is true nonetheless then tell me by what means did she come to me in this form to plunder this realm of its possessions the bishop answered for i am none other than llwyd cil coed and i confess that it was i who put the enchantment on the seven cantrefs of dyfed this was done to avenge my brother gwawl who was killed by you and pryderi in the battle of the cauldron after hearing that you had returned to settle in the land the false bishop continued i turned my lords warband into mice so they might destroy your barley without your knowledge on the first night of destruction the warband came alone and carried away the grain on the second night they came too and destroyed the second field on the third night my wife and the women of the court came to me and asked me to transform them as well i did as they asked though my dear wife was pregnant had she not been pregnant i doubt you would have caught her she was the only one i caught to be sure replied manawyddan thoughtfully but alas since she was caught i will give you pryderi and rhiannon and remove the magic and enchantment from dyfed llwyd the hud folded his arms across his chest and gazing up to the top of the mound at manawyddan he said there i have told you everythingnow let her go i will not let her go so easily now what do you want demanded the enchanter behold the mighty champion replied there is yet one more thing required that there may never be any more magic or enchantment placed upon the seven cantrefs of dyfed nor on my kinfolk or any other people beneath my care upon my oath you will have that the llwyd said now for the love of god let her go not so fast enchanter warned manawyddan still gripping the mouse tightly in his fist what now llwyd moaned this he said is what i want there must be no revenge against pryderi rhiannon cigfa or myself ever from this day henceforth forever all that i promise and have promised you shall get and god knows that last was a canny thought the enchanter allowed for if you had not spoken thus all of the grief you have had till now would be as nothing compared to that which would have soon fallen upon your unthinking head so if we are agreed i pray you wise lord release my wife and return her to me i will promised manawyddan in the same moment that i see pryderi and rhiannon standing hale and hearty in front of me look then and see them coming said llwyd the hud thereupon pryderi and rhiannon together with the missing hounds appeared at the foot of the gorsedd mound manawyddan beside himself with joy hailed them and welcomed them lord and king now free my wife for you have certainly obtained all of what you asked for i will free her gladly manawyddan said lowering his hand and opening the glove so the mouse could jump free llwyd the enchanter took out his staff and touched the mouse and she changed into a charming and lovely woman once morealbeit a woman great with child look around you at the land cried llwyd the hud to the lord of dyfed and you will see all the homesteads and the settlements as they were at their best instantly the whole of the country was inhabited and as prosperous as it had ever been manawyddan and rhiannon and pryderi and cigfa were reunited and to celebrate the end of the dire enchantment they made a circuit of all the land dispensing the great wealth rhi manawyddan had obtained in his bargain with the enchanter everywhere they went they ate and drank and feasted the people and no one was as well loved as the lord of dyfed and his lovely queen pryderi and cigfa were blessed with a son the next year and he became if possible even more beloved than his grandfather here angharad stopped she let the last notes of the harp fade into the night then added but that is a tale for another time setting aside the harp she stood and spread her hands over the heads of her listeners go now she said softly as a mother speaking to a sleepheavy child say nothing but go to your sleep and to your dreams let the song work its power within you my children bran no less than the others felt as if his soul had been cast adriftall around him washed a vast and restless sea that he must navigate in a toosmall boat with neither sail nor oars for him at least the feeling was more familiar this was how he always felt after hearing one of angharads tales nevertheless he obeyed her instruction and did not speak to anyone but went to his rest where the song would continue speaking through the night and through the days to come and although part of him wanted nothing more than to ride at once to llanelli storm the gaol and rescue the captive by force he had learned his lesson and resisted any such rash action instead bran bided his time and let the story do its work all through the winter and into the spring the story sowed and tended its potent seeds the meaning of the tale grew to fruition deep in brans soul until one morning in early summer he awoke to the clear and certain knowledge of what the tale signified more he knew what he must do to rescue will scarlet chapter i wake in the night all afever with the odd conviction that i know what it all means the letter the ring the glovesi know what this strange treasure signifies and why it has come to elfael for the first time i am afraid if i am right then i have discovered a way to save elfael and i fear i may not live to pass on this saving knowledge to those who can use it oh blessed virgin peter and paul i pray i am not too late i sit in the cold dark and damp of my cell waiting for daylight and hoping against hope that odo will come early and i pray to god that my scribe has true compassion in his heart i pray and wait and pray some more as it makes the waiting easier i am at this a long time when at last i see the dim morning light straggling along the narrow corridor to my cell i hear gulbert the jailer stumbling around as he strikes up a small fire to heat his room i content myself with the sorry fact that our jailer lives only a little better than his prisoners he is as much a captive of the abbot as i am if not the more at least i will leave this rank rat hole one day and he poor fella will remain odo is long in coming i shout for gulbert asking if the scribe has been seen but my keeper does not answer me he rarely does and i remain a tightly wrapped bundle of worry until i hear the murmur of voices and then the scrape of an iron door against the stone flags of the corridor in a moment i hear the familiar shuffling footfall and my heart leaps in my chest easy now will me lad i tell myself you dont want to scare the scribe hes skittery enough as it is without you gettin him up all nervous so to make it look like i have been doing anything but waiting for him i lie back on my musty mat and close my eyes i hear the jingle of a key and the door to my cell creaks open will are you asleep i open one eye and look around oh it is you odo i thought it might be the king of england bringing my pardon odo smiles and shakes his head no luck today i fear dont be too sure my friend i sit up what if i told you i knew a secret that could save our sovereign king from black treachery and murder or worse odo shakes his head i know i should be well accustomed to your japes by now the look in my eye brings him up short i do begin to believe you are in earnest aye that i am lad i am pleased to see that he is in a mood to humour me this morning he settles heavily into his accustomed place how will you save king william i will tell you my friend but you must promise me a right solemn oath on everything you hold most sacred in the worldpromise me that what i tell you will not pass your lips you cannot write it down nor in any other way repeat what i say to another living soul he glances up quickly i cannot you will or i will not say another word please will you do not understand what youre asking see here odo i am asking you to pledge your life with mineno more no less he would look away but i hold him with the strength of my conviction hear me now i continue after a moment if i am wrong nothing will happen but if i am right then a great treachery will be prevented and hundreds perhaps thousands of lives will be saved he searches my face for a way out of this unexpected dilemma all his natural timidity comes flooding to the fore i can see him swimming in it trying to avoid being swept away fight it odo boy it is time to become a man abbot hugo he begins then quits i could never he would find out anything you said he would know has he the ears of the devil now unless you told him he would never know he would find out how i counter here is where the battle will be fought is his desire to do right stronger than his fear of the black abbot after a moment i say only the two of us will know if you say nothing to him then i fail to see how hugo will ever know what i mean to tell you he looks at me his round face a tightpinched knot of pain it is life and death odo i tell him quietly he is that close to fleeing life and death in your hands he stands abruptly scattering pen and parchment and spilling his inkhorn i cannot he says and bolts from the cell i hear his feet slapping the stones in the corridor he calls gulbert to let him out and then hes gone well it was a risk doomed from the start i should have known better than to think he could help now escape is my only hope and it is such a starved and wretched thing it brings sad tears to my eyes i tug at the chain on my leg and feel the lump in my throat as frustration bites to hold the solitary answer to the riddle of the barons treasureto be entrusted with the key to free elfael and to be unable to use itthat fair makes the eyewater roll down my whiskered cheeks i lie on my filthy bed and think how to get word to bran and my headdull from these weeks and months of captivityfeels like a lump of useless timber i think and think and it always comes out at the same place i can do nothing alone i must have help oh god if it is true that you delight in a heartfelt prayer then hear this one and please send odo back chapter odo returns and so quickly that i am surprised he has not shown such clear and ready resolve before there is something on his minda blind man could see itand he has come back with all the bluster of a fella who has made up his mind to embark on a dangerous journey or a longneglected chore that will get him mucked up from heel to crown i do greatly wonder at the wild glint in his soft brown eyes this is not the odo i have come to know so here is odo standing outside the door of my cell like a faithful hound returning to a harsh master he would rather forgive than leave i see he has his parchment and goose feather in one hand and inkhorn in the other as always but the sharpness in his aspect gives me to know this is not like all the other times are you coming in odo i say he has made no move to join me i have to know something he says glancing down the corridor as if he fears we might be overheard gulbert if he hears anything from the cells at all is long past caring i have to know beyond all doubt that you will not betray me odo i reply have we known each other so long that you ask me that swear it he insists i hear in his voice what i have not often hearda little bone and muscle a little bit of iron swear it on your soul that you will not betray me as god is my witness i swear on my everlasting soul that i will not betray you this seems to satisfy him he opens the door to my cell and takes his customary place i see by the firm set of his soft mouth that he is chewing on something too big to swallow so i let him take his time with it it is the abbot he says at last it usually is i reply what has he done now he has been lying to me remarks odo lying from the very beginning i have caught him time and again but said nothing i understand no will replies my scribe you do not i have been lying to him too i stare at him odo you do amaze me that is why i rushed away if i am to do as you ask i had to make confession if i am killed i want to go to god with clean hands and a clean heart as do we all odo but tell me more about this deception he nods i knew you would not give up brannot even to save yourself truly i never would when i saw that you were a man of honour i decided to spin the abbot a tale that would keep us talking but would tell him little astonished at this turn i do not know what to say it seems best to just let him talk as he will oh that is what i did some of what you said i used but most i made up he shrugs it is easy for me the abbot knows nothing of merian or iwan siarles or tuck and what he knows of bran is mostly fancy he allows himself a sly smile the more you told me of the real bran the less i told the abbot well you have me odo i dont know what to say but odo is not listening abbot hugo has been lying to me from the beginning nothing he says can be trusted he thinks i am stupid that i cannot see through his veil of lies but i have from the start he pauses to draw breath i can see that he is working himself up to do the thing he has come to do like the letter bran stoleabbot says it was nothing a simple letter of introduction only but if that was true then why was he so desperate to get it back and they were that desperate i can tell you i said recalling the christmas raid a good many men died that night to recover it i think you can fair be sure it was far more than a letter of introduction what you said about treachery against the crown his voice falls to a creaky whisper knowing the abbot i do not doubt it still i cannot think what it might be nor could i odo nor could inot for the longest time i tell him but the answer was starin me in the face all along blind dog that i am i could not see it until you showed me where to look i showed you he says and smiles oh aye i tell him and then explain how i tumbled to what the bloody baron and black abbot were up to at last he listens nodding in solemn agreement as i conclude fortunately we are not without some tricks of our own yes he nods and licks his lips eager now to hear what i propose but as you made me swear on my solitary soul so must i hear your pledge my friend we are in this together now and you can tell no onenot even your confessor this i tell him in a tone as bleak as the tomb which will certainly claim us both if he fails to keep his vow odo hesitates he knows full well the consequence of what i am about to ask him then squaring his round shoulders he nods say it odo i say gently i must hear the words on my eternal soul i will do exactly as you say and breathe a word to no one good lad you have done the right thing i tell him it is not easy to go against your superior but it is the right thing what do you want me to do he says as if anxious now to get the deed done we must get a message to bran i say we must let him know what is about to happen so he can move against it odo agrees he unstops the inkhorn and pares his quill i watch him as he spreads the curled edge of parchment beneath his pudgy handsi have seen this countless times yet this time i watch with my heart in my mouth do not let us down monk he dips the pen and holds it poised above the parchment what shall i write not so fast i say it is no use writing in ffreinc as no one in cel craidd can read it can you write in saxon latin he says french and latin he shrugs thats all then latin will have to do i say and we begin in the end it is a simple message we devise and when we finish i have him read it back to me to see if weve left anything out see now we must think what word to add to let bran know that this has come from me and no one else it must be something bran will trust it takes me a moment to think of a word or twosomething only bran and i would know about tuck or one of the others then it comes to me odo my fine scribe at the end of the message add this the straw man was shaved twice that day once by error and once by craft wills the error brans the craft yet will took the prize this bran knows to be true odo regards me with a curious look write it i tell him he dips his quill and leans low over the parchment scrap now all but covered with his tight script what does it mean it is something known between bran and myself that is all very well says odo he bends to the task and then raises his head it is done good i say now tuck that up your skirt priest and keep it well out of sight it is my head if i fail he says and frowns but how am i to find rhi bran i smile at his use of the name it is more likely that he will find you i expect all you have to do is start down the kings road and if you do what i tell you hell find you soon enough i begin to tell him how to attract the attention of the grellon but he makes a face and i stop now what i am watched day and night he points out i cant go wandering around in the forest the abbot would catch me before i was out of sight of the town he has a point so then i stare at him and it comes to me then we will look for someone in towna welshman despite everything they must come to the market still sometimes odo allows would you trust a welshman someone from elfael would and do i reply all the more if the fella knew it was to serve king raven and elfael tomorrow is a market day odo announces and with the snows gone now there will likely be traders from hereford and beyond that always seems to bring a few of the local folk into town they dont stay long but if i was able to keep close watch i might entrust the message to someone who could pass it along bless me mother mary there are more things wrong with this plan than right but in the end we are left facetoface with the plain ugly fact that we can do no better i reluctantly agree and tell odo he is a good fella for thinkin of it this small praise seems to hearten him and he hides the scrap of parchment in his robes and then stands to leave i should like to pray before i go will he says another fine idea i tell him pray away odo bows his head and folds his hands and standing in the middle of the cell begins to pray he prays in latin like all priests and i can follow only a little of it his soft voice fills the cell like a gentle rain and if only for a moment i sense a warming presenceand sweet peace comes over me for the first time in a long time i am content chapter i make it five days since odo took the message out of the cell he has not come back and i fear he has been caught a weak choice to begin with true but if the poor fellad got even a thimbles worth o luck he might have got a fair chop at it i guess even that little was too much to hope for no doubt he did his best with the scant handful he was given but odo was not born to the outlaw life like ol will here i do not hold him to blame blame now there is a nasty black bog if ever there was one if i think about it long enough i come round to the conclusion that if blame must be spooned out to anyone at all the good lord himself must take the swallow for making it so fiendishly easy for the strong and powerful to crush down the weak and powerless would that he had foreseen the host of problems arising from that little error oh but that ent the world we got i suppose we dont deserve a better one i close my eyes on that bitter thought and feel myself begin to drift off when whats this now i hear the door open at the far end of the corridor i guess it is gulbert bringing me some sour water and the scrag end of a mutton bone to gnaw on i roll over and look up as he comes to my cell and its odo hes back but one look at his pasty face and doleful eyes tells me all is not cream and cakes in the abbey i feared theyd caught you monk i reckoned wed be soon enough sharing this cell ah but look at you now a face like the one youre awearin could bring clouds to a clear blue sky ohwill he sighs and his round shoulders slump even further i am so sorry they found the message i guess well i thought as much at least they didnt lock you up odo is shaking his head its not that then its something else he moans and its bad well tell me lad ol will is a brave fella he can take the worst you got to give him theyre going to hang you will that much i know already i say giving him a smile to jolly him along a bit if thats all then were no worse off than before odo will not look at me he stands there drooping like a beaten dog its today will he breathes unable to rise above a whisper what they mean to hang you today a dozen thoughts spin through my poor head at once and it fair steals the warm breath from my mouth well now i say when i have hold of myself once more that is something new i do confess odo lets loose another sigh and snivels a little bless him he feels that bad for me why not tell me whats happened i say for i would rather hear him talk than dwell on my predicament but first i have to knowdid you get the message out that is the most important thing anyway he nods it was not difficult he says brightening a little as he remembers the first welshman i found was brother to one of those the sheriff meant to hang on twelfth night he was only too happy to take the message for you the ghost of a smile brushes his lips the farmer said we were not to worry he said hed get the message to rhi bran without fail good i say feeling a little of my ruffled peace returning all is well then another thought occurs to me but that was five days ago as i make it why did you not come to tell me sooner the abbot has returned and said i could not come here anymore but the day before yesterday some important visitors arrived and the whole town has gone giddy everyone is busy preparing a special reception and feast who i wonder could have come instead i ask him then why did they let you come today i begged the abbot to be the one to tell you he says and adds ever so softly and to shrive you so now my death is to be for the entertainment of important guests well that is the normans first and last the devils can think of nothing better than a good hanging to impress their betters the notion makes me right angry it does so there it is i say odo cannot find his voice he just stands there suddenly miserable once more aye there it is i could have wished it had all turned out better i could have wished noin and me had got married that id had the chance to love that good woman as she deserves that little nia had known a doting father and on and on but then a man can wish all he likes his whole life through and its like flinging a raindrop into the raging sea and just as much use when is it to be before the feast he says and still will not look at me at midday well that takes some of the wind out of my sails to be sure at least i say trying to swallow around the lump in my throat i will not have long to think on it i offer a smile but it is a thin simpering thing sitting here dwellin on a thing like thatwhy a fella might lose heart odo smiles as quickly as it comes it is gone again they will come soon we should begin will you come in and sit with me i was told not to he says odo please i say after all the days weve spent together at least let us sit together one last time as friends he doesnt have it in him to disagree he opens the door and steps in but this time judging by his mournful expression it is as if he is entering a tomb in a way i suppose he is i know i grumbled and growled like a bear with a sore head most days i tell him but i did enjoy our talks i did you did all the talking odo points out true i agree i reckon a fella never knows what hes got stored up in his purse until it comes time to pay the tax man he smiles again tax man we all owe a debt to nature odo never forget pay we must he nods sadly i can see his feelings are running on a razors edge hes fighting to keep from melting into a puddle of grief on the floor shrive me odo i dont want to go to meet our maker filthy in sin and stinkin of brimstone lets get it done so i can go in peace he brings out a little roll he has tucked into his sleeve it contains the proper words for a mans last rites this makes me happier than i could have imagined i knew i could trust him to see me right i know our black abbot would never have troubled himself as much and thats a fact if left to him id be knockin at heavens gates one dirty naked sinner instead of standing in the clean white robe of a saint odo has ensured that will not happen now and for that i am forever grateful aye and i am that close to forever odo bends his round head and offers a prayer his voice is gentle and humble as a priests should be although he speaks to god in latin i hear that in it that puts me at ease when he finishes he says in english god our father longsuffering full of grace and truth you create us from nothing and give us life man born of woman has but a short time to live we have our fill of sorrow we blossom like the lowly flowers of the field and wither away we slip away like a shadow and do not stay in the midst of life we are in death where can we turn for help only to you lord who are justly angered by our sins though we are weak and easily led astray you do not turn your face from us nor cast us aside when we confess you are right glad to forgive hear loving god the final confession of william scatlocke he glances up and says repeat the words as i say them i nod and we go on almighty and most merciful father maker of all things judge of all people like a poor lost sheep i have wandered from your ways i have followed too much my own will and ways i have offended against your holy laws odo pauses at each hurdleand i climb over after him the words are simple and sincere not like those most priests use and i know he is trying his best to do right by me we have left undone those things that we ought to have done and we have done those things that we ought not to have done and there is no righteousness in us he says and i notice that he is including himself in my prayer now and it makes me smile we confess that we have sinned against you and our brothers we acknowledge and confess the wickedness which so often ensnares us o lord have mercy upon us sinners you spare those who confess their faults we earnestly repent and are deeply sorry for all our wrongdoings great and small eternal and merciful judge both in life and when we come to die let us not fall away from you do not abandon us to the darkness and pain of death everlasting have mercy upon us gracious redeemer restore us as you have promised and grant o merciful father that we may enter your peace hear us for the sake of your son and bring us to heavenly joy in the name of jesus christ our lord amen i add my amen as he has directed and then we sit in silence a moment i feel the thing was squarely done there is no more to be said nor need be i am content from down the corridor i hear the grating whine of the iron door opening and know that my time has run its course they are coming for me my heart lurches at the thought and i draw a deep breath to steady myself i have thought about this day every day since i was dragged into black hugos keep truth to tell i thought it would be different somehow that i would meet the evil hour with a smile and a tip o my hat instead my bowels squirm and ache and i feel deaths cold hand resting heavy on my shoulder there was so much i meant to do and now the end has come it is all done but the dyin and thats a true fact chapter saint martins the pavilion look here he comes cried count de braose his voice fluttering high with excitement as the shambling heap of a man appeared at the door of the guardhouse the counts visitors turned to see a number of ffreinc soldiers spilling out of the keep armed with lances and led by marshal guy they started across the market square dragging a ragged wreck between them the mans hands were bound and his legs were unsteady he kept listing to one side as if the ground were constantly shifting beneath his feet oh he is a rogue continued count falkes you can tell that simply by looking at him the counts words were directed to the visiting dignitaries whose arrival two days before had surprised and thrilled the entire population of the emerging town of saint martins the counts words were translated and conveyed to the others by a priest named brother alfonsoa tall sallow somewhat sombre and officious monk in a new brown robe while count falkes looked on smiling his guests exchanged a brief word amongst themselves being spanish they were strangers to england and to the rough ways of the march most of them bore the swarthy complexion of their countrymen and the black hair and dark inquisitive eyes they professed to find everything fascinating and in the brief time they had been with him had shown themselves to be enthusiastic and appreciative guests then again one might expect no less from the personal envoy of none other than pope clement himself the ambassador father dominic was far younger than the count would have imagined for one in such an important nay exalted position dark and slender in his impeccable black robes he held himself with a solemn almost melancholy reserve as if the thoughts inside him bore on body and soul alike and he sagged a little beneath their weight though there was dignity and reverence in his glance his natural expression was the pensive reflection of a man who despite his youth had seen and suffered much at the hands of an unrepentant world his black hair was trimmed short and his tonsure newly shaved he moved with deliberation his steps measured and sure as he dispensed priestly blessings to those who looked on attending father dominic were two servantsmost likely lay brothers but of a hardy sort tall and strong and none too genteel they had no doubt been chosen to protect the envoy on his journey besides the interpreter brother alfonso there were two young women a young highborn woman of unmistakable nobility and her maidservant the lady was quiet wellspoken gracious and possessed of a warm and winsome manner but also alas undeniably plain with poor skin dull hair and discoloured teeth drab as a farmyard drudge was guy of gysburnes assessment i prefer her maid the sheriff had expressed a similar judgment if in less kindly terms even so count falkes found himself attracted to her despite her plainness and the difficulty imposed by the language divide he even allowed himself to fancy that she regarded him with something more than passing affection oh gasped lady ghisella averting her eyes at the sight of the condemned man her maid followed the ladys example never fear my lady offered the count mistaking her reaction he cannot escape you may rest assured this one will soon trouble the world no longer unexpected visitors their abrupt arrival had initially roused the counts suspicions on second thought however it was more than reasonable given the circumstances a small party travelling together without an extensive entourage of servants and courtiers might more easily pass unmolested through the countryside and considering who they represented would more easily elude the notice of the king such a group would not likely draw the unwanted attentions of rival factions and potential adversaries abbot hugo who had been south with count falkess uncle baron de braose at bramber had returned to find the dignitaries already established in his abbey all well and good he had complained to falkes but we should have received word of their coming this is awkward to say the least it is nothing of the sort the count reassured him you worry too much hugo and you not enough i suspect it is merely clements way of judging the faith and loyalty of those who have pledged to him before you know he let the rest remain unspoken abbot hugo fixed him with an ominous stare no he replied stiffly i do not know before the fighting begins said the count must i shout it from the rooftop think man the king will have spies everywhere it is open rebellion we are talking about the abbots frown deepened but he held his tongue see here offered count falkes adopting a lighter tone the envoy and his people will only be here another day or two we will simply entertain them with good grace reassure them of our intentions and send them on their way wheres the harm in that why are they here demanded the abbot thats what i want to know his holiness has given no indication of sending an envoy to england and does the pope now confide his every private thought to you abbot falkes gave an airily dismissive wave of his hand the movement caused a twinge of pain in his chesta lingering reminder of the arrow wound that had nearly taken his life all will be well i propose that we host a feast in their honour and send them on their way a feast murmured hugo yes i think we might do just that we could also hang that tiresome rogue for themthat should give them something to talk about hang the rebel wondered falkes are you finished with him then long since answered the abbot it was folly to hope he would tell us anything worth hearing its all a morass of confusion and lies and so tedious it makes my teeth ache well it cost us little enough to find out falkes countered in any event it hurts nothing to try i suppose allowed the abbot i should hang him twice over for wasting my time well you would have hanged him anyway in the end concluded falkes de glanville and i had our disagreements over the twelfth night executions god knows but i cannot say i will be sorry to see this one dangle the sooner we rid ourselves of these bandits the better now with the feast about to begin they were all seated in a hastily erected pavilion facing the open ground behind the church where some of marshal guys knights and a few of the sheriff s men were performing mock battle manoeuvres in a show of military might the great galloping destriers hooves threw clots of turf high churning up the soft earth the glint of sword blade and lance head blazed like lightning strokes in the bright sunlight the resounding crack of oak lance shafts the clank of heavy steel and the shouts of the soldiers lent excitement to an otherwise ordinary display the feastday crowd swarmed the square behind the canopycovered platform their voices filling the air with loud if somewhat forced levity as they bellowed rude songs and screamed with laughter at the antics of the wandering troupe of tumblers minstrels and storytellers the count and abbot had procured especially for the occasion at the entrance to saint martins churchyard a new gibbet had been erected from which to hang the criminal whose execution was now to mark the occasion of the papal envoys visit one sight of the captive as he was escorted from the guardhouse sent the crowd scampering for places from which to view the spectacle some cheered others blew their noses and still others threw rotten apples and eggs at the bearded dishevelled prisoner as he was hauled across the square on the arms of his guards as the wretch neared the pavilion father dominic summoned his interpreter and whispered something into his ear brother alfonso leaned close nodded then turned to the count and said my lord count the envoy says that he is most interested in this case he would like to know what crime this unfortunate has committed pray tell his eminence that he is a traitor to the crown the count explained he along with other desperate rebels has sought to pervert the course of the kings justice and has on numerous occasions attacked the kings men and prevented them from engaging in their lawful duties he has incited rebellion against the crown this of course is treason a very grave crime indeed observed the envoy through his interpreter is that not so indeed agreed the sheriff intruding into the conversation but if that was not enough this criminal is also a thief he has stolen money and other valuables from travellers passing through the forest a very rogue agreed the envoy that and more said count falkes we have good reason to believe that he was part of a gang of outlaws that have plagued this commot since we established our rule in this lawless region indeed we have it from his own lips that he has violated forest law by killing the kings deeralso a capital offence as these words were delivered to the envoy the sheriff added these murderers have been responsible for the deaths of many good men they answer to one known as king raven who styles himself a phantom of the greenwood at this the special ambassador of pope clement turned suddenly clapped his hands and exclaimed rhi bran y hud both count and sheriff were taken aback by this unexpected outburst and regarded the priest with alarm after a quick word with the ambassador alfonso the interpreter confided his eminence says that word of this phantom has reached him truly wondered count falkes greatly amazed it must be the same said father dominic through his interpreter there cannot be more than one surely surely not confirmed the sheriff but never fear your eminence these outlaws cannot elude us much longer we will bring them to justice they will all hang before another year is out the condemned man was brought to stand before the nobles and dignitaries in the pavilion he stared dulleyed his expression slack hair and beard matted and filthy the sheriff splendid in his green velvet cloak and belt of gold discs rose and held up a gloved hand for silence from the swiftly gathering crowd be it known he called out his voice cutting through the chatter that on this day in accordance with the rule of law the criminal william scatlocke also known as scarlet is put to death for crimes against the crownnamely treachery rebellion robbery and the abuse of the kings sheriff richard de glanville the sheriff s eyes narrowed none other than myself he paused to allow these words to be translated for the foreigners then continued saying the hour of your death is upon you thief and murderer have you anything to say before justice is served the outlaw known as will scarlet glowered at the sheriff and spat do your worst de glanville he growled his voice low we all know who the real rogues are with a disinterested flick of his hand the sheriff said take him away it is said that the welshmen are cunning archers observed father dominic as the prisoner was dragged away to the gibbet so they would have their ignorant countrymen believe sneered the sheriff believe me they are nothing more than a rabbleunruly as they are untrained even so i have heard a welsh archer can put an arrow into the eye of a blackbird in flight tales for children said falkes with a small hollow laugh although i daresay the welsh appear to believe it themselves i understand replied the envoy through his interpreter as it happens i myself am an archer indeed my lord said falkes feigning interest oh yes said the envoy his enthusiasm plain even through the remove of a translator i count the days spent with a bow in my hand blessed it helps ease the burden of my office you see well i suppose granted the count it must be pleasant for you it is the one secular pursuit i allow myself continued the envoy confiding his observations to alfonso who dutifully passed them along as a child i myself often enjoyed hunting with a bow on my fathers estate in spain i know well enough what such a weapon can do in the hands of one well schooled in its use you are right to fear the rebels we do not fear them insisted the sheriff it is merely that unable to finish this assertion in a convincing way he paused then concluded lamely they do not fight fairly the prisoner was brought to stand beneath the gallows and the rope was knotted and thrown over the short stout gibbet arm the soldiers began tying the victims legs with short bands of cloth i see replied father dominic when the sheriff s words had been made clear to him he shrugged then smiled turned to lady ghisella beside him and exchanged a brief word whereupon the envoy suddenly announced my cousin would like to see the welshman ply the bow what asked the sheriff looking around suddenly the request caught him off guard but that is not possible your eminence said count de braose a man like thathe flung his hand towards the group at the gallowsmust not be given a deadly weapon under any circumstances ah i understand said father dominic through his translator it is that you fear him too greatly i understand perhaps there is something in this childrens tale you speak of after all no no said abbot hugo at the counts silent urging pray do not misunderstand it is not that we fear him but merely that it would be unwise to allow him to lay hands to the very weapon he has used to kill and maim our soldiers he is a condemned man and must be executed according to the law at this the papal envoys ordinarily woeful features arranged themselves in a wide grin of pleasure brother alfonso turned and announced his eminence wishes to assure you that he is looking forward to the execution as much as anyone but suggests that there is good sport to be had before it takes place these affairs are after all very shortlived shall we say the sallow monk smiled at his wordplay it is a commonplace in italy and elsewhere that wagers are placed on such things as how many kicks the condemned will produce how long he will swing before he succumbs or whether he will piss himself things like this a good wager heightens the enjoyment of the occasion yes i see replied the count coolly what sort of wager does your master think appropriate here after a quick consultation brother alfonso replied his eminence suggests that a demonstration of some sort would be amusing perhaps granted the count what sort of demonstration as an archer himself father dominic is especially keen to see this prisoners skill well i suppose something might be arranged count falkes conceded at last if it is what our guest wants i see no good reason to deny him no wager or no it is impossible declared the sheriff out of the question but the discussion had already moved on his eminence suggests that as his own skill with the bow is exceptional he begs the boon of participating in an archery contest with the condemned and that in accordance with the best tradition the prisoner be allowed to draw for his freedom what wondered the sheriff in slackjawed dismay at the insane proposal brother alfonso continued his eminence says that the contest can have no meaning or excitement without consequences and of course the only prize to rouse the poor wretchs interest would be the chance to draw for his life if his eminence should fail a dangerous criminalone who has attacked me personally mindwould be spared the consequences of his crimes justice would be made a laughingstock the man has been in your dungeons for how long five months or so replied the sheriff why five months is a very great punishment in itself observed brother alfonso aside from that father dominic will no doubt hold the advantage over the prisoner and wishes to assure you that the wretch will hang this day nevertheless there must be a prize at stakeotherwise the sport is meaningless it took a moment for the emissarys meaning to become absolutely clear an archery contest considered count falkes carefully with freedom of the prisoner as the prize it is what the popes ambassador wants answered brother alfonso lady ghisella would be much amused as well they are certain to carry back a good report to his holiness both sheriff and count appealed to abbot hugo who had suddenly become very quiet and thoughtful well speak up hissed the sheriff tell his eminence it is impossible the rogue hangs here and now and that is that but it is not whispered the abbot sharply in reply our guest seems determined to have his way and baron de braose would not be pleased to hear that we refused the envoy any simple request it was in our power to grant any simple request muttered the sheriff in a strangled voice we cannot risk setting that rogue free nor will we hugo assured him let the popes fool have his contest all we need do is make certain the welshman does not win he is right concluded falkes my uncle would not look kindly on anything that threatened his good favour with clement we must find a way to please his eminence however strange the request need i remind you that we are not in favour with the baron just now letting the legate have this ridiculous contest might be just what we need to return ourselves to the barons good graces the sheriff gazed at the other two as at men bereft of their reason find a bow and let the contest begin commanded the count meanwhile de glanville i think you should gohe paused so the sheriff would not mistake his meaningand prepare the prisoner yes added the abbot see to it nothing is left to chance very well answered the sheriff catching their meaning at last i will attend the prisoner personally turning to his guests count falkes adopted a grand and gracious air and announced please convey to his eminence and his entourage that i am pleased to grant his request i have therefore arranged for the contest to take place however i fear it may not be as entertaining as his grace might wish as we shall see these bandits are not as skilled as they make out my thanks to you lord count said the envoy and immediately climbed down from the pavilion and began making his way across the grounds towards the gibbet wait your eminence a moment if you please cried the count hurrying after him you must allow us to ready the contest the papal envoy was led back to his place in the pavilion to be entertained by abbot hugo meanwhile the count hurried on to order a target to be made up and a bow and arrows to be found and brought to the field this is absurd growled marshal guy when falkes explained what was going to take place is he insane no doubt remarked the count but he has pope clements ear and goodwill we dare not upset him or give him cause to complain of his reception while he was here the marshal glanced at the pavilion across the greensward what do you want me to do just make it look like a reasonable competition between two archers the sheriff is taking measures to make certain our prisoner is in no way able to win this contest said the count stepping away do your best to make it look fair and all will be well guy de gysburne looked across to the bound captive with the rope around his neck as he stood waiting beneath the gallows knowing the sheriff the contest is well in hand chapter saint martins the green to will scarlet it seemed as if all of elfael had turned out to see him swing a bright and festive air hung over the little town which was alight with flags and the coloured banners of a wandering troupethe same that was performing tricks in the square to the bawdy laughter of the crowd of all those in attendance only will himself failed to rise to the full mirth of the occasion he had other things on his mind as the soldiers half walked half dragged him out of the guardhouse and across the thronging square only a few of the towns citizens left off their merrymaking to watch the condemned man hauled to his doom and these few were welshmen who dared come into town braving the scorn and ridicule of the townsfolk to witness the death of one of those who had risked his life to prevent the twelfth night hangings of their countrymen will scarlet did not notice the silent britons looking on from the margins of the celebration he did notice how very bright the sunlight was and how soft and impossibly fresh the breeze that bathed his shaggy features how sad really that his last moments should be lived out on such a fine hopeful day in direct opposition to the black gloom that filled his soul just his luck he thought unhappily to go down to the grave while all the rest of the world was awash in singing and dancing and the glad feast aroast on the fire not to taste a lick of that handsome fare nor a drop of the ale that would be served up in cups overflowingnow there was real pity as the rough procession passed along the side of the stone church he saw that a platform had been set up for the visiting dignitaries a pavilion with a splendid blue canopy from which the nobles and their guests could watch him kick his last as the cruel rope choked out his life the idea of providing sport for these highborn scum roused a fleeting flame of anger he thought might sustain him in his last moments alas this was not to be for the moment the cold length of braided leather touched his neck and the soldiers began lashing his legs together anger fled and was replaced by a stark empty bottomless fear lord have mercy he thought looking up at the gibbet arm and the clear blue boundless sky beyond christ have mercy on my soul this swift prayer had no sooner winged through his mind than sheriff de glanville was standing before him his sharp features set in a malicious sneer untie him he commanded the soldiers it seems we are to have a little sport before he hangs will whose french stretched at least this far understood from what the sheriff said that death had been delayed a little and was grateful for even that little he drew a deep breath as the noose was removed and the bands loosed from behind the sheriff he saw two dark figures approachinga tall slender priest in long black robes and another a monk in brown beside him behind these two came the count hurrying to keep up with the blackrobed priests long eager strides this is your lucky day traitor de glanville told him in a low menacing voice our guest desires an archery contest your life is the prize the sheriff eyed him closely do you understand it took will a moment to work out what the sheriff had said there was to be a contest for his life he nodded i understand he replied in ffreinc good said the sheriff taking wills bound hands in his gauntleted fist he seized the fingers of his right hand and began to squeeze just so there will be no mistake de glanville added before will knew what was happening the sheriff gave his fingers a sudden vicious twist there was a pop and crack like that of dried twigs as his finger bones snapped we will make certain you understand who is to win this contest pain streaked up his arm and erupted in a fiery blast that stole wills breath away tears instantly welled up in his eyes distorting his vision he sank to his knees whimpering with agony and struggling to remain conscious there said de glanville with a satisfied nod now there will be no surprises the condemned man glowered up at the sheriff mouthing a silent curse as he cradled his ruined fingers to his chest tears streaming from his eyes he was jerked to his feet again and marched between two knights out onto the centre of the green there he stood upright as best he could shaking with the effort he struggled to keep from weeping from the humiliation of being so easily bettered by his enemiesas much as from the physical pain itself while will was trying to regain some small part of his composure marshal guy of gysburne appeared with a longbow and bag of arrows the sight of the bow cast will into a dismal allembracing despair here was the instrument of his salvation now useless to him because of the sheriff s wicked ploy he could no more draw a bow with broken fingers than he could have walked across the sea to ireland but what was this guy was handing the bow to the tall dark priest forcing the pain from his mind will brought all his concentration to bear on what was being said because the marshals instructions had to be repeated for the visiting priest will could just about work out what was happening they were each to loose three arrows in turn and the closest to the mark would be declared the winner the priest gave a sign that he understood and accepted the terms of the contest no one asked will if he understood or accepted anything then while a hastily constructed straw man was set up a hundred paces or so down the greensward the two contestants walked out to take their places followed by a large excited crowd of onlookers two soldiers stood at wills elbow watching his every move guy who was supervising the contest handed the bow to the priest saying you will each use the same bow your eminence here is the weapon the young priest took the offered bow and tried the string bending the bow tentatively back stiff elbows awry the action while not entirely awkward lacked something of the confidence of great skill will even in his agony was not slow to see it and the gesture kindled a flicker of hope in his woeful heart that hope leapt up the higher when the priest turned to him and offered the bow indicating that he should try it as well my thanks muttered will through teeth clenched against the pain in his throbbing fingers although it had been some time since he had held a bow will found the instrument balanced well enough but the draw when tested with his thumb was far too loose clearly this was a toy the ffreinc had either made themselves or found somewhere it was not the war bow of a welshman still it might serve for a simple contest if both of them were to use it there could be no advantage to either party will made to pass the bow back to his smiling adversary who waved him off and taking an arrow from guy handed it to the captive and then stepped back to allow him the honour of loosing first sweating now his jaw clenched so hard he thought his teeth would shatter will tried to nock the arrow onto the string but the injured fingers would not obey and the arrow slipped from his grasp and fell at his feet the priest was there in an instant to retrieve it for him with a flourish of his hand and a smile to the sheriff and marshal guy who stood looking on with unmitigated malice the envoy indicated that he would allow the condemned man another chance to draw will with great difficulty and much fumbling at last fitted the arrow to the string and held it there with his left hand while attempting to hook his swollen mangled fingers into some semblance of an archers grip sweating and shaking with the effort he did not so much draw back the string as simply hold it and press the bow forward the arrow flew from the string with little conviction and described a lacklustre curve to plant its point in the turf a good many yards short of the straw target the injured criminal passed the bow to the priest and bent down arms on his knees gasping trying to remain conscious as the pain coursed up through his arm like a firespitting snake meanwhile his blackrobed rival took up the bow and with far more aplomb nocked the arrow to the string marshal guy gave de glanville a knowing nudge with his elbow and smiled as the visiting dignitary pulled back and loosed his first arrow somehow what seemed an easy draw suddenly went wildly wrong the missile flew not out as it should have but almost straight up spinning sideways in a loopy spiral to land behind the onlookers on the green some of the townspeople gathered around laughed the priest still smiling shrugged and held out his hand for another arrow marshal guy gave him another arrow with the admonition to take his time and aim nodding the priest made a gesture of dismissal and handed the bow and arrow back to his opponent will his face white and beaded with sweat took up the bow once more and strained with every nerve the target swimming before his eyes as he strove to pinch the string between thumb and forefinger when he could hold the string no longer he released it and sent the arrow forward in a low arc to skid along the grass almost reaching the foot of the target full of confidence and beaming with bravado the priest took the bow and received an arrow from guy who repeated his counsel to take time draw and aim properly the priest made a reply which the translator passed along saying his eminence is aware of the problem and will adjust his stance accordingly taking the arrow he placed it on the string and gazing hard at the target narrowed his eyes and drew the string to his cheek holding the bow straight and strong in front of him he released after the briefest pause and the crowds eyes followed the path of the arrow as it seemed to streak towards the target but wonder of wonders the arrow did not arrive a second glance confirmed that it had not in fact left the string at all but there remained dangling caught somehow one of its feathered flights ripped off and sent halfway across the green the arrow fell at the embarrassed priests feet its iron point in the ground more people laughed now the idiot grumbled the sheriff this is no contest neither one of them can draw worth a fart i will draw for the priest suggested marshal guy i can do no worse than he has done the sheriff stared at him dont be stupid the contest has begun he grumbled we cannot change now it would not be seemly why not demanded the marshal you broke that wretchs fingersthat was not seemly how did you ever agree to such a thing anyway he said he could draw replied the sheriff he forced a sour smile and nodded at the envoy he is hopeless insisted guy once more let me take his place too late answered the sheriff everyone is watching now we cannot be seen to force the outcome scanning the pavilion he caught sight of count falkes and abbot hugo frowning furiously at the disaster slowly unfolding before them one more arrow he said make certain the envoy understands what is at stake here taking the last arrow guy of gysburne handed it to brother alfonso saying this is his last chance to win the contest make him understand brother alfonso made a bow and turned to confer with the papal emissary who frowned and snatched the offered arrow with a gesture of haughty impatience as before the papal cleric stepped close and passed the bow and arrow to will scarlet who drew a long breath as he took the weapon one more will whispered the priest it is almost over i will not let you fail it was all scarlet could do to catch himself shouting bran for the first time he looked into the face of the man he had been drawing against and recognized his lord and friend shh said the priest with a wink bloody de glanville broke my fingers whispered will his voice tight and quivering with pain do your best will bran whispered try a lefthanded pull the condemned man took the bow and with a groan and gritting of teeth wrapped his discoloured fingers around the belly of the bow this time and took the strain against the cradle of his palm and thumb then even as the pain sent flags of ragged black misery fluttering before his eyes he drew with his left hand steadied the trembling weapon and loosed the arrow slanted up flashing into the air higher and higher it seemed to hang momentarily before falling spent to the ground at the straw mans feet this brought a murmur from the crowd most of whom had by now worked out what was unfolding before their eyes the priest still gracious took the bow and waited for the final arrow to be passed to him along with the marshals stern caution to take care and aim properly this time nodding he nocked an arrow to the string and even as he bent the bow guy stepped in behind him and placed his hands over the priests steadying his aim as the priest let fly the envoy shocked at this bold intrusion gave out a yelp and jerked back but the arrow was already on its way this time it flew true but the distance was woefully misjudged for the missile sang over the straw mans head and flew on swiftly disappearing into the long grass far beyond the greensward the condemned man saw it knew that he had won the contest and sank to his knees tears of relief and agony rolling down his bewhiskered cheeks before anyone could intervene the blackrobed envoy summoned his aide brother alfonso to take the injured criminal under his care stupid roared the sheriff at guy what did you do i was only trying to help said the marshal it would have worked too if he hadnt pulled so hard the black priest accepted his failure with good grace beaming with pleasure he offered his hand to the condemned man raising him to his feet placing his arm around the criminals shoulders the slender priest proclaimed in a loud voice so all could hear i declare the contest was fair and the results are conclusive this man is the winner he paused so that brother alfonso could relay his words to the gathering i do not know what he has done to merit his punishment but let his example teach us the humility of forgiveness and redemption for all men stand in need of salvation therefore as our lords vicar on earth i stand ready to absolve him of guilt and lead him into the paths of righteousness i accept full responsibility for his life and will do all in my power to redeem him from his reprobate ways as the startled ffreinc looked on aghast at what had just taken place he whispered never fearwill i have you now and will not let you go will scarlet dabbing at his eyes with the back of his hand clung to the blackrobed envoy as to a kinsman long lost god bless you my lord he murmured god bless you right well chapter hamtun docks merian gently tied the ends of the rag binding will scarlets wounded hand and tucked the ends under if angharad was here she apologized she would know better what to do for you she had carefully straightened his swollen and discoloured fingers and bound each one to a bit of hazel twig iwan had cut and shaped to serve for splints she surveyed her work with a hopeful smile does it hurt much not muchwill replied grimacing even as he said it i am that glad to be feeling anything at all just now it reminds me i am alive and back with those who love you she said brushing his fingertips with her lips as she released him i do thank you my lady he said his voice thick with sudden emotion he raised his hand and regarded his bandaged fingers amazed that something so small could hurt so much despite the throbbing insistence of the pain however he remained overawed at his rescue and his friends continued deception they had risked all for him and his gratitude could not be contained my heart has no words to say thanks enough i only wish we could have come sooner said siarles who had been hovering at merians shoulder and thanks to you siarles replied will acknowledging the foresters presence it does a body good to see you again gods truth i did not recognise any of you course i had other things on my mind just then when bran said what we were to do replied siarles i told him it would never workwe could never dupe the sharpeyed sheriff he chuckled but bran would not be moved he was determined to steal you away and right from under their long ffreinc noses we collected brother jago from saint dyfrigs and we all dressed up like priests and such andhe smiled againhere we are iwan who had been standing watch on the little bower hurried to rejoin them theyre coming back he announced be on your best guard we are not safe home yet following the archery contest father dominic had thanked the count and abbot for their inestimable hospitality and announced his desire to resume his journey in taking their leave of the count the next morning the papal envoy was surprised to learn that the count had decided to send an escort of knights and menatarms to see them safely to their ship at hamtun docks despite the envoys protestations that this was in no way necessary the counthis own resolve bolstered by the insistence of an increasingly suspicious sheriffwould not allow his guests to depart on their own it is the least i can do for our mother church he insisted if anything should happen to you on the roadmay heaven forbid iti would never be forgiven especially since it is so easily prevented bloody meddler muttered iwan when he learned of the plan there is no ship waiting for us weve never been anywhere near hamtun docks they dont know that bran replied we will go on as weve begun and look for the first opportunity to send them on their way and if we dont find such an opportunity demanded iwan what then we can always disappear into the wood bran told him leave it to me you keep your eyes on the soldiers and remain alert if anything goes wrong i want you ready to break some heads oh aye agreed iwan grimly if it comes to that ill be ready right enough they had set off with count de braose sheriff de glanville and ten norman soldiersfour knights and six menatarmsto provide protection from king raven and his outlaw minions who haunted the greenwood and preyed on unwary travellers the papal envoy and his small entouragethe lady ghisella and her maidservant brother alfonso the interpreter and the two lay brothers surrounded by heavily armed ffreinc men kept to themselves for the most part outwardly they behaved much as beforecheerful if quiet and appreciative of the largess lavished on them by their everwatchful hosts i do not trust that priest the sheriff had said as the travelling party prepared to set off he is no more an ambassador of pope clement than my horse mark me there is some deception playing out here and we are fools if we let them get away with it you may be right conceded count de braose but we dare not risk a confrontation until we are more than certain this way at least we can keep a close watch on them be sure of it growled the sheriff the first time any one of them looks sideways ill have him you are not to antagonise them falkes warned if word of any mistreatment were to reach my unclenot to mention pope clementwed be peeled and boiled in our own blood never fear my lord replied the sheriff i will be nothing but courtesy itself to our esteemed guests but i will watch themby the rood i will thus a forced and wary pleasantness settled over the travellers because of the small coach in which lady ghisella and her maid rode and which carried the tents used by the envoy and his company they could not travel as quickly as the normans might have wished at night they made camp separately each side watching the other wary and suspicious across the distance the only time the foreigners were able to confer openly with one another was when the ffreinc were occupied with picketing the horses and establishing the guard for the night it was during one of these times that bran moved among the members of his disguised flock speaking words of encouragement and hope he also apologized to will and begged the foresters forgiveness i am sorrywill it was my fault you were taken and i grieve that you suffered because of it i suffered a little true will granted but gwion bach would have suffered more i reckon still i forgive you free and fair i wont say i didnt think ill of that night all the same he smiled but youve more than made up for it by saving my scrawny neck from that hide noose and for that i truly thank you my lord were not out of danger yet bran said so you might want to wait until we say farewell to our nosey friends before thanking me whatever happens replied will were square my lord and no hard feelings the party endured four more days of anxious watching until at last coming in sight of the bluffs overlooking the river estuary at hamtun what if there is no ship iwan wondered what will we do then you should pray there is no ship siarles observed then we can at least say they have gone to get supplies or some such thing the ffreinc are not about to wait around many days to see us away but what if there is a ship demanded iwan plainly worried we will take it concluded bran either way it could not be simpler simple as the choices may have been the doing was only slightly more difficult when the next day as they followed the road over the bluff and started down into the river valley they caught sight of the docks on the waterfront below the town the travellers could see there was indeed a ship waiting therea sturdy broadbeamed vessel built for hauling men and horses across the sea to all appearances it was just the sort of vessel that the patriarch of rome might provide for his personal ambassador well there is your boat muttered iwan now what bran glanced around the sun was low and the wind freshening out of the west the count and sheriff had picked up the pace and were drawing closer expressions of keen anticipation lighting their watchful eyes ride to the ship and secure it take siarles and jago with you go now before the ffreinc prevent you and what do you suggest i tell them when i take their ship tell them the popes ambassador needs it replied bran tell them we will buy our passage tell them anything but just secure it and keep the sailors out of sight when we get there scowling with determination iwan signalled to siarles and jago and all three galloped away bran turning to will merian and cinnia quickly explained that they were to continue on in the wagon and upon reaching the ship they were to go aboard as if that was what had been intended from the start whatever happens he said hurriedly the two of you get down below deck and stay there merian he said dismounting and helping her down from the wagon you come with me will from his seat in the wagon cast a last backward glance at the sheriff then turned and set his face towards the river and the freedom waiting there seeing the monks gallop off count falkes and the sheriff rode directly to father dominic for an explanation where are they going demanded de glanville suspiciously que replied the envoy with a smile of incomprehension he gestured towards the ship waving and nodding as if to indicate that they had arrived at last and all was well lady ghisella who possessed a smattering of french tried to explain they go to make ready the sailing she said you mean to leave tonight asked the count but of course replied the lady pleasantly it is the wish of his eminence to leave at once the sheriff unable to think of any reason why this should not be perfectly reasonable looked to the count to mount an objection are you certain falkes said lamely it will be getting dark soon it is the wish of his eminence the lady repeated as if this was all the explanation required well said the sheriff we will attend you to see that nothing is amiss he lifted the reins and started down the road once more please lord count said lady ghisella you must not trouble yourself but it is no trouble at all my lady replied the count if anything should happen to you while you remained in our care he allowed the thought to go unfinished never fear he said with a stiff somewhat condescending laugh we will see you safely aboard and properly under sail we could do no less for the popes personal confidant that is a relief to be sure replied ghisella crisply i will tell his eminence although it made her uncomfortable to speak to the ffreinc her reticent regal manner went a long way towards easing the counts suspicions his attraction to her despite her undeniable plainness made him more willing to overlook his doubts she relayed the counts sentiments to father dominic who gave a nod of approval what are we to do now she asked keeping her voice low to avoid being overheard we see it through bran told her and hope for the best thank them and walk on she smiled revealing her unfortunate offcolour teeth his eminence is delighted with your diligence and care he will speak of it to his holiness the delight is ours alone my lady replied the count they are getting away and we sit here trading pleasantries muttered the sheriff i dont like this i cannot forbid their departure they have done nothing wrong this whole affair is wrong grumbled the sheriff then find a way to stop them if you can said count falkes but unless you discover something very soon they will be away on the tide the travellers moved on descending the narrow road into the valley passing quickly through the town and its lowbuilt dark houses and single muddy street to the large timber wharf on the river where the ship was moored all seemed quiet aboard the vesselno screams or shouting no evidence of a struggle or fightalthough there was no sign of iwan or any of the others bran his stomach tightening with every step prayed that they might yet make good their escape as they drew near the dock there appeared on deck a man in a red cap and brown tunic which reached past his knees he was barefoot and carried a knotted rope in his hand he scanned the wharf quickly and then hurried to greet the new arrivals mes seigneurs ma dame joffre vous accueille etre bienvenu ici sil vous plait venir a bord et etre a laise tout est pret at this the french speakers fell silent dumbstruck lady ghisella gave a little gasp of pleasure saints and angels whispered bran tensely what did he say we are welcome to come aboard merian told him he says everything is ready for us peter and paul on a donkey exclaimed bran how did they accomplish that before she could answer he said hurry now get on board send jago back to help me get rid of our friends here and tell iwan and siarles to make ready to cast off when merian hesitated he said quickly before something goes wrong bran alone now turned to his obliging if suspicious hosts and summoning up his little store of latin attempted to sever the last ties and bid them farewell vicis pro sententia deus volo est hic vae gratias ago vos vobis hospitium quod ignarus caveo ut tunc nos opportunus this might have lacked the polish of a senior churchman but it was more than either sheriff de glanville or count falkes possessed at any rate the two frenchmen stared at him unable to comprehend what had just passed his eminence says the time has come to bid you farewell explained the one known as brother alfonso hastening to join father dominic on the dock just then his grace thanks you for your hospitalitya debt he can never repayand wishes you a most wonderfully pleasant and uneventful journey home be assured that owing to your kind and attentive service your praises will ring in the popes ears the man in the red hat who it turned out was master of the ship hurried to greet the papal emissary he knelt to receive a blessing which was deftly delivered then rose saying my apologies your grace but if we are to take the tide we must hurry the horses must be secured and the ship made ready to cast off now see here protested the sheriff still unwilling to see the suspicious foreigners slip away so easily was there something inquired the ships master no said the count be about your business to the sheriff he said come de glanville there is no more to be done here when this was translated for his eminence father dominic gave his norman hosts a blessing and with a last promise to mention their care and attention to the pope released them from their duty of guarding him and his entourage he walked onto the ship and went below deck a moment later the two lay brothers appeared and helped the ships master lead the horses on deck and secure them for the voyage when this was done they helped the master cast off and using stout poles pushed the craft away from the dock and out into the river where it drifted for a little while before finding the current then as they entered the stream father dominic lady ghisella and will scarlet came back onto the deck and waved farewell to the normans who although they could not be sure thought they heard the sound of laughter carried on the wind as the ship entered the centre of the channel and was carried along by the slowly building tideflow and away chapter rouen king william rufus wet and miserable in the driving rain rode at the head of a company of his best and most loyal knights the royal ranks were followed by sixty menatarms grimly slogging through the sticky mud water streamed down from a low sky of seamless grey from horizon to horizon falling in steady rivulets from helmet shield and lance blade puddling deep in the wheelrutted road the farms and villages flung out around the low squat city of rouen appeared just as cheerless and desolate as the king and his dreary entourage curse his fool of a stiffnecked brother he thought it should be duke robertnot himself the king of englandwho was saddle sore and catching his death in the rain blast the imbecile and his infernal scheming why could robert not accept his divinely appointed lot and be happy ruling the familys ancestral lands william told himself that if that had been his own particular fate he would have embraced it and worked to make something of his portion and not be forever wasting his substance fomenting rebellion and inflaming the rapacious ambitions of frances endless supply of muttering malcontents these thoughts put the already irritated king in a simmering rage and when he contemplated the time and money wasted on keeping his idiot brother appeased and under control his thin blue blood began to boil thus william arrived in the yard of the archbishops palace at rouen already angry and spoiling for a fight the palace a solid square of cut stone three floors high and studded with woodshuttered windows occupied the top of a prominent hill a mile or so beyond the city wherein stood the cathedral williams cool and indifferent welcome by the current incumbent of the palace did little to mollify the king or sweeten his disposition ahwilliam intoned archbishop bonneame good of you to come heavily robed and leaning on his bishops staff the old man puffed out of breath from his short walk across the vestibule an honour guard of six knights and two earls entered with the king the water from their cloaks dripping on the polished stone floor which sent a bevy of clerical servants scampering for rags to mop up the mess my pleasure grumbled william shedding his sopping cloak and tossing it to a waiting servant where is he whats it to be this time come lets get to it the archbishops pale hand fluttered up like an agitated bird oh my lord king this is to be a most serious conclave i hope you understand the gravity of the moment i understand that my brother is as worthless quipped william as is anyone who sides with him beyond that there is only the money it will take to buy him off the archbishop stiffened and lowered his head in a bow this way your majesty the archbishop turned and started away with king william a step or two behind the kings men threw off their wet cloaks and assembled in a double rank behind him and as servants rushed to pick up the sodden garments the ageing archbishop led them down a lofty corridor to a large audience room where the king found assembled a few minor lords standing around the blazing hearth at one end of the room they looked around guiltily as the king of england and his men entered duke robert was not among them nor anyone william recognised where is he demanded the king i have ridden hard for three days in the rain i am not playing at games this is what i wanted to tell you majesty explained the archbishop duke robert is not here indeed few of those summoned to attend have arrived its the weather you see but we expect them at any moment do we snapped the angry king do we indeed sir we do majesty the old cleric assured him i have ordered chambers to be prepared for you if you would like to rest a little before the proceedings i will have refreshment sent to you william gave a last scowl around the nearempty room and allowed himself to be persuaded very well he said have wine brought to me in my chambers to one of his men he said leicester fetch me dry clothes ill change out of these blasted wet things of course sire at once replied the earl of leicester with a nod and flick of his hand he sent one of his men to carry out the errand will there be anything else no said the king feeling a great weariness settling upon him he started after the archbishop saying you and warwick will attend me the others are to see to the horses then take food and rest for themselves at once sire the earl gave quick instructions to the rest of the kings guard and sent them away he and the earl of warwick accompanied the king to the apartment that had been prepared for hima large room with a bed and a square oak table with four chairs archbishop bonneame pushed open the heavy door and stepped into the room glancing around to assure himself that all was in order for his tetchy guest a fire burned in the small hearth and on the table sat a jug of wine with four cups and beside these a platter with loaves of bread and soft cheese wrapped in grape leaves william walked to the table and poured wine into three of the cups thank you archbishop he said offering a cup to the nearest earl we are well satisfied with our arrangements you may go bonneame bowed his old white head and retreated closing the door i leave you to your rest my brother is planning mischief observed the king his nose in his cup as he gulped down a healthy draught i can feel it in my bones do you know le bellay asked the earl of leicester i know my brother replied william if there is to be bloodshed began young lord warwick the king cut him off with an impatient wave of his hand it wont come to that i think william said handing him a cup at least not yet he drank again and said i wish i knew what he and his sycophants were up to though those men down there said leicester who were they god knows answered the king never seen the rascals before you i might have met one or another difficult to say he replaced his cup on the board and said i think i might just go and see if i can find out never mind said the king drawing out a chair he dropped heavily into it then shoved a second chair towards the earl here sit you must be as tired as i am sit well drink and rest with respect sire i would rest easier if i knew who those men are and what theyre doing here the king shrugged go then but hurry back and tell the chamberlain we need some meat to go with this bread and cheese of course my lord said the earl of leicester moving quickly towards the door he hoped to catch the archbishop for a private word before the old man disappeared into the cavern of his palace and more wine called the king after him william leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes sire said the earl of warwick setting aside his cup he came to stand before the king if you would allow me he offered indicating the monarchs feet i think we might dry those boots a little william nodded and with a sigh raised his foot so that the young man might pull off the sodden shoe he guzzled down another draught as the young nobleman attended to the other boot there now said warwick when he had finished better no mmmm murmured william into the cup much the earl carried the wet boots to the hearth and put them on the warm stones to dry then returned to the table and sat down he and the king sipped their wine in silence for a time feeling the tensions of the road begin to ease beneath application of the sweet dark liquid this is all my fathers fault mused william after a time if he had not promised my ninny of a brother the throne of england all would be well he roused roberts hopes and fool that he is the duke has set the value too highthinks it worth more than it is he drained the cup and then filled it again truth is he continued the blasted island costs more than you can ever get out of it it was ever thus warwick suggested king harold never had two pennies to rub together one day to the next as my father used to say and aelfred was in debt from the day he took the crown till the day they took it off him in the grave this is supposed to cheer me warwick grumbled the king i merely suggest that your condition is neither more nor less than that which all english rulers have endured god knows it is difficult enough even for an earl much less a duke or a king duke robert does right well william pointed out he took up a loaf of bread broke it and stuffed half into his mouth he chewed heavily for a moment to be sure most of what he has he got from me cut him off sire suggested warwick or make him sign a settlement treaty in exchange for his promise never to raise rebellion again get him to put his name to it robert would have nothing if it wasnt for me propping him up growled william the bread halfeaten in his mouth no more no more hear this is the end with your permission sire ill have a treaty drawn up at once the earl suggested raising his cup well get robert to sign it and be done with him once and for all if he thinks ill buy him off again hes woefully mistaken said william if he demands another penny from me ill march on him curse the devil i will i swear it well replied warwick judiciously trying to calm the agitated monarch perhaps he will listen to reason this time would you like me to arrange for a treaty lord leicester returned with another jug of wine and behind him a servant bearing a platter of cold roast duck and chicken his grace the archbishop says that he is retiring for the night he wishes you a good nights rest and sleep he will conduct a mass in the morning and break fast after and my brother when is he expected the archbishop could not say sire tomorrow i expect well then decided william we could do worse than make a night of it here bring that platter im famished they ate and drank talking long into the night both lord leicester and his brother warwick remained with the king sleeping in chairs beside the hearth while william snored in his feather bed as dawn cracked the damp grey sky in the east the chapel bell sounded calling the faithful to mass william and his noblemen stirred at the sound then went back to sleep awaking again when they heard a clatter in the courtyard below warwick got up and walked to the narrow window pushed open the wooden shutter and looked out he could see seven men on horseback or perhaps five men and two women on closer inspection at least two of them appeared to be priests although the day was still new their mounts appeared fresh and fairly unsoiled by the mud on the rainsoaked roads they had not travelled far the earl surmised he watched for a moment scanning the group but failed to recognise anyonein any event they were certainly not duke robert and his entourage turning from the window he went to the kings bed and gave a polite cough when this failed to rouse his majesty he took hold of the royal shoulder and gave it a shake sire he said i think the vultures are gathering we should be ready for them william opened his eyes and tried to raise his head the effort was too much and he lay back with a groan who has come is my brother finally here i do not know my lord i did not see him replied warwick a priest or two have arrived but unless the duke travels in the company of priests now he is not yet here oh sighed william struggling upright why did you let me drink so much it is a fault of mine majesty the earl of warwick assured him i must try to do better then again the archbishops wine is very good it is agreed william swinging his short stout legs off the bed is there any left do you think henry walked to the table and began examining the jugs and cups where is leicester asked the king stretching his back and yawning he has gone to masswarwick reported i expect him to return soon shall i have someone fetch him for you no no decided the king let him be heaving his bulk up onto unsteady legs he tottered to the table and the cup which lord warwick now held out to him the king took a sip tasted it then drained the cup ah thats better the young earl disappeared momentarily to summon a servant lurking in the corridor to prepare a basin of water for the king and commanded another to bring the kings chest to the room presently the servant appeared with a basin of hot water and while william washed warwick supervised the cleaning of the kings boots get all that muck off there and brush them well he ordered so that his majesty would not look like a common farmhand before the other noblemen the chamberlain meanwhile appeared with the kings chest and a message that some people had come and were seeking audience on a most urgent matter what do they want asked william raising the hem of his tunic and drawing it over his head warwick opened the chest and withdrew a clean white tunic they did not say your majesty replied the chamberlain i was told only that it was of utmost importance that they speak to you at once and before you speak to anyone else today impertinent lot observed william pulling the tunic over his head the garment though handsomely wrought was made for a slightly smaller frame the fine fabric stretched over his expansive gut warwick he said go see who it is and find out what they want i have not broken fast yet and im not in a humour to brook any silliness to be sure sire replied the young earl william nodded picked up a scrap of bread from the remains of last nights supper sniffed it and took a bite seeing the servant still stood staring at him he threw the rind of dried bread crust at him bring me my food the servant ducked the missile and darted for the door and be quick about it william called after him important people have come we must not keep them waiting chapter s truth id never make a sailor even the smallest stretch o water seen from the deck of a ship brings me out in a sweat if a wave should rock the boat its me there hanging onto the rail and spilling my supper into the briny deep oh and i had cause enough even the master of the ship said it was the worst storm in many a year o sailing and he should knowhes crossed that narrow sea more times than a rooster with a henhouse across the road our own small voyage might not have been so bad and indeed i had allowed myself to imagine that the worst was over when we entered the wide estuary of the thames and sallied slowly upriver to the white tower of lundein to pay our ruddy king william a visit alas the king was not in residence gone to rouen they told usgone to parley with his brother not to return till saint matthews day maybe not till christmas never mind said bran weve come this far whats a little further master ruprecht he called and i can still hear those fateful words cast off and make sail for france as it had turned out our man ruprecht the ships owner and master was flanders born and raised and could speak both french and english into the bargain his ship was a stout ploughhorse of a vessel and he was kept right busy fetching and carrying ffreinc noblemen and their knights back and forth to england from various ports on the coast of normandie thus he knew the coasts of both lands as well as any and far better than most seizing his ship had been easier than rolling off a stump we lifted nary a finger nor ruffled a hairwe simply bought his services this easy conquest was not without its moment of uncertainty however for as we came in sight of the docks at hamtun that day and bran gave iwan siarles and jago the command to secure the ship those three hastened down to the wharf cinnia and i arrived close behind and scrambled onto the dock hard on their heels let me talk to them first offered brother jago as they dismounted do nothing until we see how things stand hurry then iwan said we do not have much time before the others get here what will you tell them asked siarles swinging down from the saddle maybe it would be better to take them by surprise force is the first resort of the coward suggested jago lightly peace brother we have enjoyed great success with our disguises until now we can trust them a little further i think go then iwan told him see if they will talk to you whatever you do make it quick said i urging them on all the same we will be ready to stifle any objections with our fists siarles called after him i myself could not have stifled so much as a sneeze with my fists weak and miserable as i was just then my months of captivity had left me exhausted and the last few days of travel had all but killed me it took my last strength to clamber down from the wagon and on cinnias tender arm hobble onto the dock and make my slow aching way aboard the waiting vessel where if it had not happened i would not have believed it the ships master himself welcomed us with open arms greetings friends he called leaping lightly to the rail to help me aboard my ship and myself are at your service i am master ruprecht and this is the dame havik his english was flat and toneless but clear and the ruddy face beneath his floppy red hat was friendly as it was windburned the good brother has told me of your urgent mission never fear i will see you safely to your destination he paused to wave at the approaching ffreinc and to father dominic what jago had told him in the first part was that father dominic was a papal legate which was no more than de braose and his lot already believed jago merely added that we were all on a secret embassy to england bearing a message of utmost importance for the king as it happens this last part was true enough bran did indeed bear an important message for the kingthe one i had sent him through odo from my prison cell concerning the letter we had stolen in the christmas raid now as a result of his sojourn with count falkes and abbot hugo our king raven knew better what that letter meant the importance of reaching king william might have been overstated somewhat but in light of the mounting suspicions of falkes and the sheriff it was simple good sense to make the captain think our errand urgent even so that excuse was closer to the truth than any of us could have guessed and it was to be the saving of us the dame haviks master had only one small impediment towards our leaving straightawayhe had no crew he had come to england shorthanded and with a cargo of fine cloth which he had sold days before he had put in at hamtun to pick up more sailors and a load of hides and wool we will have to wait until i can find some more hands to help with the sails and such i hope you understand it should not take long he hastened to add no more than three or four days maybe even that is too long jago as brother alfonso informed him perhaps you would allow my fellow monks and me to serve as your crew at least as far as lundein if you tell us what to do we will do it and he added the king will reward you well when we tell him how you have helped us ruprecht of flanders pulled on his chin and cast a weather eye at the sky then to the river the tide is beginning to run and the wind is in a favourable quarter he made up his mind with a snap of his fingers well why not as soon as his eminence is aboard we will cast off here i will show you what to do step to the music friends and just like that iwan and siarles were no longer lay brothers but sailors under ruprechts direction they hauled on the ropes and picked up the poles and in as much time as it takes to tell it we were away leaving the ffreinc standing on the shore mouths agape eyes aboggle at the swiftness of our departure the ship light of its load spun out into the deeper channel the tide lifted her and carried her off we saw the dock and hamtun town growing small behind us and laughed out loud we were so relieved to have done with those treacherous ffreinc we laughed until the tears streamed down our cheeks we made for lundein sailing along the coast and up the wide thames until we came in sight of the white towera splendid thing it is too all gleaming pale and tall like an enormous horn rising from the bank of the muddy river but we had no sooner made anchor and summoned a tender alongside to carry us to shore than we learned that the king was not in england gone to france said the tenderman he counted the days on his fingers a week or more ago give or take are you certain asked jago show him this said bran handing jago a silver penny give it to him if he answers well jago questioned the man closely and at the end declared himself satisfied that the man was telling the truth he tossed the boatman the coin what is your wish my lord we have no choice bran replied i saw the keen glint in his eye and knew hed already decided merian saw it too you mean we cant why not said bran ive been thinking and the sooner we get this out in the open the sooner we can reclaim elfael what are you talking about said iwan bran turned and called master ruprecht cast off and make sail for france france scoffed the big warrior i wouldnt set foot beyond the high tide mark on the word of an englishman careful friend i warned smiling as i said it some of us englishmen are that touchy when our honour is called into question iwan pawed the air at me with his hand you know what i mean he has a point siarles put in france is a fair size so im told and full of ffreincmen i added we might want to know where were going if we aim to meet up with red william bran agreed and with brother jago for company ordered ruprecht to hire the men to crew the ship and get whatever provisions might be necessary for a voyage to france and then climbed down into the waiting tender boat rhi bran and jago went ashore to learn what they could of the kings whereabouts and we were soon occupied with securing provisions and fodder for the horses and hauling water aboard seeing as how his passengers were ambassadors of the pope the ships master also bought a cask of wine and two of ale and a barrel of smoked herrings two bags of apples four live chickens two ducks and a basket of eggs these he bought from the merchant boats plying the wide river bartering for a price and then hauling the various casks crates and cages up over the rail he then went in search of sailors to make the voyage with us while he was gone we stowed all of the cargo away in the little rooms below deck and then waited for bran and jago to return we waited long watching the river sink lower and lower as the tide ebbed out the bare mud of the upper bank was showing and the sun had disappeared below the horizon and iwan was almost ready to swim ashore to storm the tower he was that sure bran and jago had been taken captive when merian called out here they are theyre coming now indeed they were already in a boat and making their way out to where dame havik rode at anchor moments later we were pulling them aboard we all gathered around to hear what they had learned ashore the king has gone to attend a council at rouen bran said he left with sixty men ten days ago i know not where rouen may be but i mean to go there and lay before him all that we know and suspect i know rouen volunteered ruprecht when he returned a short while later leading four flemish sailors to crew the ship ten days you say he tapped his chin thoughtfully if they were travelling overland on horseback we may still be able to catch them before they arrive truly wondered iwan how is that possible my ship draws lightly he said we can easily go upriver as far as the bridge it is but a short ride from there to the town the tide was on the rise so we had to wait until it had begun to ebb again we settled down to a good meal which the ships master and jago prepared for us then slept a little rising again when the tide began to flow as a dim halfmoon soared overhead we upped anchor and set out once more dawn found us skirting the high white cliffs of the southern coast and as the sun rose the clouds gathered and the wind began to blow at first it wasnt so bad that a fella couldnt stand up to it but by midday the waves were dashing against the hull and splashing over the rail ruprecht allowed that we were in for some rough water but assured us that we would come to no harm a summer storm nothing more he called cheerfully do not fret yourselves brothers see to the horsesthere are ropes to lash them down so they cannot hurt themselves throughout the day the storm grew wind howled around the bare masttheyd long since taken down the sailsand the waves tossed the ship like thistledown now up now down now tail over top it was all i could do to hold on for dear life and keep my poor bandaged fingers from smashing against the hull as i tried to keep from getting battered bloody as evening fell on that wild day our ships master was the only one still cheerful ruprecht alone maintained his usual good humour in the teeth of the storm moreover he was the only one still standing the rest of ushis sailors includedwere hunkered down below the deck clinging to the stout ribs of the ship as she bucked and heaved in the rowdy waves more than once my innards tried to leave the wretched confines of their piteous prisonand i without strength or will to stop them my stomach heaved with every wave that rolled and tried to sink our vessel along with my miserable companions i shut my eyes against the dizzying pitch and twist and stopped my ears against the shriek of the wind and the angry seas bellowing roar this seagoing calamity continued for an eternity so it seemed when at last we dared lift our heads and unclasp our limbs and venture onto the deck we saw the clouds torn and flying away to the east and rays of sunlight streaming through all bright gold and glowing like the firmament of heaven have we died then asked siarles greyfaced with the sickness we all shared the front of his robe was damp from his throwing up and his hair was slick and matted with sweat no such luck groaned iwan his appearance likewise had not improved with the ordeal i can still feel the beast bucking under me in heaven there will be no storms and no ships either muttered merian pale and shaky she tottered off to find water to wash her face and hands bran was least affected by the storm but even he strode unsteadily to where ruprecht stood smiling and humming at the tiller summoning jago to him bran said ask him how many days we have lost only one your grace came the reply the storm blew itself out overnight the sea has been running high but it is calming now och that was a bad oneas bad as any ive seen in a month of years are we still on course asked bran more or less affirmed the master more or less but we will be able to raise the sails soon until then have your men see to the horses unbind them and give the poor beasts a little food and water while iwan and siarles saw to that chore two of the sailors began preparing a meal for us bran and i watched this activity as we leaned heavily on the rail neither of us feeling very bold or hearty just then what a night bran sighed how is the hand not so bad i lied hardly feel it at all looking out at the stillrumpled sea i asked what will happen when we get to rouen if we should be so fortunate i mean to get an audience with red william as lord bran i wondered or father dominic he showed me his lopsided smile whichever one the king will agree to see it is the message that is important here not the messenger leaving that aside i said im beginning to think were mad for risking our necks aboard this mad ship and stormstirred sea to save a king we neither love nor honour he regarded me curiously is that you talking will it was you who put us onto it after all yes but i didnt think if youre right then it is well worth the risk of a kingdom bran said whose kingdom my lord i wondered williams or yours we talked until cinnia called us to our food which following a little goodnatured teasing by the sailors we were able to get down after we had eaten ruprecht gave orders to his crew for the sail to be run up once this was done the ship began to run more smoothly we had no more trouble with the evercontrary weather and reached the french mainland that evening we dropped anchor until morning then proceeded up the coast until reaching the estuary of a wide inland river at a place called honfleur although some of our provisions had been damaged by seawater in the storm we did not stop to take on more provisions because ruprecht assured us that rouen was only a day or so upriver and we could get all we needed there at half the cost of the harbour merchants so we sailed on the storm we had endured at sea had gone before us and was now settled over the land through a haze of rain we watched the low hills of normandie slowly slide by the rail although we could not escape the rain the river remained calm and it was good to see land within easy reach on either side of the ship i confess it did feel strange to go into the enemys land and i did marvel that no one tried to apprehend us or attack us in any way but no one did and we spent the night anchored in the middle of the stream resuming our slow way at sunrise the next day as promised we reached the city of rouen while it was still morning and made fast at the wharf that served the city iwan and siarles readied the horses and bran meanwhile arranged with ruprecht to provision the boat and wait for our return then pausing only to ask directions of one of the harbour hands we set off once more beneath clearing skies on blessed dry land oh it was that good to be on solid ground again and it was but a short ride to the palace of the archbishop where it was said the english king had arrived the previous day here is the way it will be bran said as we entered the palace yard to anyone who asks we are still ambassadors of the pope with an urgent message for the king aye agreed iwan dryly but which pope pray we do not have to explain beyond that bran told him at all events do not any of you speak to anyone let jago here do the talking for us he put his hand on the priests shoulder brother alfonso knows what to say what if someone asks us something wondered siarles looking none too certain about this part of the enterprise just pretend you dont speak french i told him the others laughed at this but siarles bless him was worried and did not catch my meaning but i dont speak a word of french he insisted then pretending should be easy merian chirped lightly she patted her hair working in the ashes that greyed it then took out the small wooden teeth that were part of her disguise and slipped them into her mouth they were an off colour and made her jaw jut slightly giving her face an older far less comely appearance bran and the others straightened their monkish robes and prepared to look pious i had no disguise but since no one in france had ever seen me before it was not thought to matter very much then standing in the rainwashed yard of the archbishop of rouens palace brother jago led us in a prayer that the plan we set in motion would succeed that bloodshed could be avoided and that our actions would bring about the restoration of elfael to its rightful rule when he finished bran looked at each of us in turn head to toe then satisfied said the downfall of baron de braose is begun my friends it is not something we have done but something he has done to himself he smiled come let us do all we can to hasten his demise chapter we were given a beggars greeting by the archbishops porter who at first thought us english and then despite his misgivings was forced to take bran at his word for standing on his threshold was a legate of the pope and his attending servants and advisors what else could he do but let us in thus we were admitted straightaway and shown to a small reception room and made to wait there until someone could be found who might more readily deal with us there were no chairs in the room and no fire in the hearth the board against one wall was bare clearly it was not a room used to receive expected or welcome visitors pax vobiscum said a short keeneyed cleric in a white robe bona in sanctus nomen pax vobiscum replied bran he nodded to brother jago who stepped forward and with a little bow of respect began to translate for father dominic and his companions the man it turned out was a fella named canon laurent and he was the principal aid to archbishop bonneame his grace has asked me to express his regrets as he is unable to welcome you personally your arrival has caught us at a very busy and eventful time please accept our apologies if we cannot offer you the hospitality you are certainly due and which it would be our pleasure to provide under more ordinary circumstances the priest was as slippery and smooth as an eel in oil but beneath the mannered courtesy i sensed a staunch and upright spirit how may i be of service to you he said folding his hands and tucking them into the sleeves of his robe we have come bearing an important message for king william from his holiness the pope indeed the canon replied raising his eyebrows perhaps if i knew more about this message it would aid your purpose our message is for the king alone explained bran through jago yet i have no doubt that his majesty will explain all to you in the time and manner of his choosing if you would inform him that we are waiting we will be in your debt that was plain enough the canon unable to wheedle more from our bran conceded and promised to take our request to the king if you wish i can arrange for you to wait somewhere more comfortable he offered jago thanked him and said that will not be necessary but if you could have some food brought here that would be a mercy it will be done replied the canon as he withdrew that went well bran observed cheerfully jobs bones bran muttered iwan you are a bold one how can you think of food at a time like this im hungry bran said im with iwan said siarles give me a fair fight any day this skulking around the enemy camp fair gives me the pip steady on boys said merian her voice altered by her wooden teeth all you need do is keep your eyes open and your mouths shut let bran do the rest our lord smiled at her quick defence of him and you she said to him see you get us out of here in the same condition we came in and i might consider marrying you after all oh if i thought that was possible my love he answered taking her hand and kissing it then you would be amazed to see what i can do how this little dance might have continued we would never learn for at that moment the door opened and three servants bearing platters of bread and sausage and jars of watered wine entered the room and hard on their heels none other than king william of england in the very solid flesh we knew straightaway that it was rufus the fiery red hair the high ruddy complexion the squat slightly bowed legs the spreading belly and beefy armsall of which had been reported by anyone whod met him well who else could it be attending the king were two noblemen and our man canon laurent who seemed unable to hold himself out of the proceedings the king of england was a younger man than i had imagined but the life he ledthe fighting and drinking and what allwas exacting a price still he was formidable and with long thick arms heavy shoulders and a deep chest would have made a fearsome enemy on a battlefield his short legs were slightly bent from a life in the saddle as his fathers were well reputed to have been and like his father his hair was red but grizzled now and thinning he looked like one of those fighting dogs id seen in market squares where their owners set them on bears or bulls for the wagering of a feastday crowd oh hed seen a few fights had bloody red william and won his share to be sure as he stumped into the room the glance from his beady bloodshot eyes sweeping quickly left and right he seemed as if he expected to meet an enemy army like that marketplace bulldog he appeared only too ready to take a bite out of whomever or whatever got in his way quel est cette intrusion impolie the king demanded puffing himself up he spoke quickly and i had trouble understanding his somewhat pinched voice pax vobiscum meus senior rex regis said brother alfonso bowing nicely latin said the king which even i could understand latin mary and joseph someone tell him to speak french paix mon roi de seigneur offered brother alfonso smoothly and went on to introduce the king to his visitor when you learn why we have come said bran taking his place before the king as jago translated his words for the frenchspeaking monarch you will forgive the intrusion will i by the rood growled the king try me then but i warn you i rarely forgive much and fools who waste my timenever if it be foolish to try to save your throne bran replied his voice taking an edge the king did not mistake then fool i am i have been called worse who are you demanded the king leicester warwick do you know this man no my lord answered the younger of the two knights i have never seen him before nor i answered the elder any of them save my throne eh said the king i could see that despite his bluster he was intrigued my throne is not in danger is it not countered bran i have good reason to believe otherwise your brother duke robert is raising rebellion against you tell me something i do not know snorted the king if this is your message you are the very fool i thought this time lord king replied bran quickly he has the aid and support of pope clement and your brother henry beauclerc and many others it is my belief that they mean to force your abdication in favour of duke robert or face excommunication this stole the swagger from the english monarchs tail i can tell you i knew it he growled to his knights he said i told you they were scheming against me then just as quick he turned to bran and demanded you have proof of this i do lord king said bran a document has come into my possession which has been signed by those making conspiracy against you you have this document do you said the king i do sire replied bran william thrust out a broad calloused hand give it to me bran put his hand inside his robe and brought out the folded parchment which had been so painstakingly copied by the monks at saint dyfrigs abbey it was wrapped in its cloth and bran clutched it firmly in both hands before i deliver it to you he said i ask a boon ha sneered the king i might have guessed that was coming you priests are always looking to your own interests well what is it you want rewardis that what you want money no sire said bran still holding out the document i want yes said the king impatience making him sharp what speak man justice said bran quietly i want justice jago gave our lords reply to which william shouted you shall have it as he snatched the document away unwrapping the thick folded square he opened it out and stared at it long and hard glancing at canon laurent hovering nearby he lifted a hand to the cleric and said this should be spoken in the presence of witnesses some have said he never learned to readat least he could not read french as it lays pray you he said thrusting the letter into the clerics hands spare us nothing the canon took a moment to study the document collected himself cleared his throat and began to read it out in a clear strong voice moi guillaume par le pardon de dieu de bramber et seigneur et brienze qux tres estimer et reverend guibert et ravenna salutations dans dieu mai les tranquillite de christ notre eternelle sauveur rester a vous toujours it was the letter jago had read to us that day in saint dyfrigs following the christmas raid that laurent read it with far more authority could not be denied still though i could understand but little of what he read i remembered that day we had gathered in brans greenwood hut to see what we had got from the ffreinc the memory sent a pang of longing through me for those who waited there still would i ever hold noin in my arms again canon laurent continued and his voice filled the room it seemed that i heard with new ears as i listened to him read the letter again adding what id learned from odo to my own small store the dual purposes behind the words became plain yet the thing still held the mystery i had first felt when kneeling in brans greenwood hut and staring in quiet wonder at that great gold ring and the fine gloves and that wrapped square of expensive parchment if i failed to see the sense i had only to look at king williams face hardening into a ferocious scowl to know that whatever he heard in the highflown words he liked it not at all by the time laurent reached the letters conclusion and began reading out the names at the end william was fair grinding his teeth to nubbins blood and thunder he shouted as the cleric finished do they think to cast me aside like a gnawed bone turning he glared at the two knights with him this is treason mark me i will not abide it by the virgin i will not bran who had been closely watching red williams reaction to the letter glanced at merian who gave him a secret smile straight and tall in the black robe of a priest hands folded before him as he awaited the kings judgement he appeared just then more lordly than the ruddyfaced english monarch by a long walk the king continued to fume and foam awhile and then as is natural to a fella like him he swiftly fell to despatching his enemies how came you by this letter he said retrieving the parchment from the clerics hands where did you get it bran calm and unruffled as a dove in a cote simply replied i stole it sire stole it cried william when brans words were translated for him ha i like that stole it by the rood who did you steal it from asked one of the knights stepping forward it was found among items sent by baron de braose to his nephew count falkes in elfael the letter along with a pair of gloves and a papal ring was taken in a raid on the wagons carrying provisions you attacked the wagons and stole the provisions asked the knight speaking through jago i did yes the other items were returned to de braose along with a careful copy of the letter just read you have before you the original and they are none the wiser the knight stared at bran mystified thievery and you a priest yet you stand here and admit it i am not as you see me replied the dark welshman i am bran ap brychan rightful ruler of elfael i was cheated out of my lands by the deceit of baron de braose on the day my father rode out to swear fealty to your majesty the baron killed my father and slaughtered his entire warband he established his nephew count falkes de braose on our lands and continually supplies him with soldiers money and provisions in order to further his rule together they have made slaves of my people and forced them to help build fortresses from which to further oppress them they have driven me and my followers into the forest to live as outlaws in the land our people have owned since time beyond reckoning all this has been possible through the collusion of cardinal ranulf of bayeux who acts with the blessing and authority of the crown and in the kings own name bran paused to let this dagger strike home then concluded i have come before you this day to trade that which bears the names of the traitorshe pointed to the letter still clutched in the kings tight graspfor the return of my throne and the liberation of my people into the silence that followed this bold assertion bran added a throne for a throneenglish for welsh a fair trade i think and justice is served oh that was well done pride swelled in me like a rising sun and i basked in its warmth and glory it was that sweet to me just then you shameless and impudent rogue snarled the elder of the two knights you stand in the presence of your king and insinuate leicester shouted king william leave off this man has done me a service and though the circumstances may well be questionablehe turned again to brani will honour it in the same spirit in which it has been rendered at this merian who had been able to follow most of what was said clasped her hands and gave out a little gasp of joy god be praised she sighed see here my lord protested the one called leicester you cannot intend hold your peace cautioned william i do not yet know what i intend first i must know what my roguish friend bran ap brychan presumes to bran he said you have presumed so much already what do you propose for these traitors all eyes were on bran as jago conveyed the kings words and bran answered his voice steady i leave their punishment in your hands sire for myself i ask only the return of my lands and the recognition of my right to rule my people in peace you ask a very great deal thief observed the second nobleman and yet it is no more than my due bran countered how do we know this letter is even genuine demanded the young knight do not be an ass the king growled the thing is genuine the imbecile de braose affixed his seal i know it well enough we must think now what is to be done and that quick we have a day likely less before the others arrive in force we must work quickly if we are to save ourselves from the trap they have laid for us king william folded the parchment and tucked it under his arm then stepped forward extending his hand to bran my thanks and my friendship you and your men are forthwith pardoned from any wrongdoing in this matter come friend we will sit and break fast together and decide what is to be done with those who would steal my kingdom chapter such palaver with the high and mighty was hard on this simple forester i can tell you ol will has had his fill of ffreinc enough to last him all his allotted days thrice over if every last one of those horsefaced foreigners were to hop ship back to normandie this son of britain would sing like a lark for joy till the crack o doom nevertheless here we were up to our neck bones in normans of every kind and most of them with sharp steel close to hand it fair made me wish for the solace of the greenwood it did and i wasnt the only one with my teeth on edge poor siarles was about as rattled as a tadpole in a barrel of eels the fella could neither sit nor stand but that he had to be jumping up every other breath to run to the door to see if any ffreinc were lurking about ready to pounce on us still though we could hear men moving about the palace both inside and out as more of the nobles arrived for their council they left us to ourselves the morning passed into midday and the waiting began to wear on us for myself the pain in my throbbing hand and the toils of the past few days rolled over me like a millstone and i curled up in a corner and closed my eyes we should go find out what is happening i heard merian say and iwan agreed aye replied the big man bran might need our help the two had just about worked themselves up to go and see what they could discover siarles was fussing and fretting and cinniatoo frightened to know what to dohad come to sit beside me when the door opened and bran and jago strolled into the room youd be forgiven for thinkin theyd been twice around the moon and back the way we ran to greet them before either one of them could speak iwan swooped in well he demanded what did the king say asked merian will he help us will he give back our lands said siarles joining the tight cluster around bran when can we go i roused myself and cinnia helped me to my feet and we joined the others come tell us bran said iwan what did the king say he said a great many things bran replied his voice a sigh of resignation not all of them seemly or even sensible to my weary eye our bran and brother jago seemed a little frazzled and frayed from their encounter with the english monarch king william keeps a close counsel jago added he gives away little and demands much yet i believe he has a mind to help us insofar as it helps him to do so beyond that who can say who could say indeed we had risked all to bring word of high treason to the kingand now that he had it we were to be swept aside like the crumbs of yesterdays supper he didnt give us back our lands whined siarles no he did not bran confirmed at least not yet we are to wait here for his answer siarles blew air through his nostrils to think that after all this we are beholden to that fat toad of a king he grumbled we should have supported duke robert instead no we made the right choice bran was firm on that point listen to me all of you and do not forget we made the right choice william is king and only william has the power to give us back our lands the king is justice for the people who must live beneath his rule our only hope is red william duke robert would have been king and returned our lands to us siarles insisted if we had supported him he would have supported us in turn and wed have what is ours by rights merian gave siarles a glance that could have cut timber the rough forester glared back at her but mumbled if i have spoken above myself i am sorry my lord and i do beg your pardon it just seems that for all our trouble we are no better off than before bran clapped his hand to the back of siarles neck drew him close and said siarles my friend if you truly think supporting robert would avail us anything you might as well join those traitors who are even now gathering to work their wiles bran spoke softly but there was no mistaking his resolve but while you are thinking on it remember that baron de braose is one of the chief rebels it is his hand squeezing our throats and his arm supporting robert if duke robert were to become king of england bloody de braose would become more powerful still and he would never surrender his grip on our lands bran is right iwan declared the only way to get rid of de braose is to expose him to the king we have warned red william in good time and now he can move to disarm the traitors bran explained releasing siarles i have put our case before the king and we must hope he succeeds in punishing those who have conspired against him well said siarles rubbing his neck he was still not completely convinced it seems we have no other hope it has been this way from the start bran said we have done all we can it is in gods hands see now bran was right never doubt it we had no other hope for redress in this world save william and william alone but siarles bless his thick head was not wrong to raise the question truth to tell it was something i wondered at first myselfand it was not until odo told me about the two popes that i began to see my way through that tangled wood why would baron de braose write a letter like that who was it for then i remembered who had signed that letter and although i could not recall all the names i remembered duke robert right enough and wondered why the kings brother and one of red williams dearest barons should be makin up a letter like that oh it was a right riddle to be sure but the answer was there starin us in the face all along we just didnt see it yet sitting there in that rank pit of a gaol a fella begins to see lots of things in a different way if you know what i mean ol will had time to think and little else even so when my monkish scribe let out there were two popes god knows i didnt believe him odo was so convinced his conviction carried me along in the end i considered it a mite curious that baron de braose should take up with clement when the whole of england so far as i knew answered to a pope named urban what could it mean two popes one throne what else could it mean but that the men who signed the letter had bartered their support for pope clement in order to gain the throne of england for their favourite duke robert outright rebellion had been tried and had failed robert could not be trusted to enter the fray even in his own interest as many an upright englishman discovered to his hurtmy old master aelred included god rest him so this time they meant to use the church somehow although i could not rightly say how they meant to force the abdication the more i thought about it the more certain i became that the men who had put their names to that letter had formed a conspiracy with the aim of plucking the crown from williams round grizzled head and placing it on luckless brother roberts this is why de braose was so murderously desperate to get that letter back more valuable by far than the big gold ring or fine leather glovesmere fancies after allthat sealed square of parchment exposed the traitors and if i guessed aright was well worth a throne gods hands or no merian was saying i could wish we knew what was happening now to have come this far only to be shut out sits ill so it does never fear brother jago replied gods ways may be mystery past finding out but he hears all who call upon his name therefore be of good cheer god alone is our rock and our fortress our friend and very present help in times of trouble that was a sermon entire brother observed iwan he turned to bran and asked how much longer are we to loiter here some little time i reckoned as the day wore on though we heard men moving in the corridors and rooms round about the palace no one darkened our doorway one by one we settled back to wait i sat propped against the wall in one corner and after a time bran joined me how are the fingerswill he asked sliding down into his place beside me not so bad i told him the pain comes and goes but not so much as before i did not like dwelling on that so i asked what do you think red william will do bran was quick to reply i expect hell give back our lands he said an edge to his voice brother jago was eloquent on our behalf and i think we made him understand in the end he promised justice and we will hold him to it that of course was deeply to be hoped we owe you a debtwill scarlet he said your quick thinking gave us the chance we needed to save elfael well it took me long enough i allowed but we got here in time that is all that matters theres still one thing i wonder bran said how did you work out the nature of the conspiracy well now i said running back over the events of the last days in my mind it was all those days talking to odo and getting an idea how those normans thinkthats what started it then when i learned about the two popes it seemed to me that the letter was intended as a treaty of sortswhy else write it all down a treaty mused bran i never thought of that you mean duke robert and baron de braose agreed to support clements claim to the throne of peter if the pope would support roberts claim to the throne of england our william is not well loved i added and as i know from my old master aelred his barons almost succeeded in unseating the king last time they rebelled i reckoned things have only got worse for them since then i know william is no lover of the church he uses it as his own treasure store bran said helps himself whenever he can aye he doesand thats the nub our william milks it like a cow keeping all the cream for himself but if that was to stop his throne would begin to totter if you see what i mean with both the barons and the church against him the king could not stand observed bran i got that much from your message a bit o blind luck that i told him shaking my head at the remarkable string of events that small patch of parchment had set off i wasnt sure what youd make of it or what youd be able to do about it i didnt even dare hope that scrap would reach you i had only odo to depend on mind hes a norman but he gave good service in the end id like to do something for him one day i paused and looked around the bare room and at our unlikely company gods own truth my lord i never dreamed it would come to thissquattin in the palace of the archbishop of rouen and waitin for the king of england to decide our fate my lord said siarles speaking up from his place across the room are we to be expected to sit here all day like moss on a log as if to answer his question there was a bustle in the corridor and the door to our chamber opened canon laurent strode into the room with two clerics dressed in robes similar to his own with them were three knights from king williams force all wore solemn expressions the knights carried swords at their belts and two gripped lances the canon held a scrap of parchment and carried it flat between his hands as if the ink was still wet on the surface of the page peace and grace said the canon which i understood i have come directly from private council with king william who expresses his highest regards and sends this message to you merian stepped beside bran and slid her hand into his they stood side by side an unlikely pair in their disguises the rest of us drew near too taking our places beside our lord and his lady to receive the judgement of the king whatever the kings decision might be whether for good or ill we would take it standing together as one hear the kings words said laurent raising the parchment be it known that in gratitude for his good service to our crown and throne william by the grace of god king of england does hereby bestow the sum of thirty pounds in silver to be used to aid and assist lord bran ap brychan and his company to return home by the way he has come what complained iwan when this much had been translated for us hes sending us home what about the return of our lands peace iwan bran held up his hand for silence he nodded to jago pray continue jago said to the canon further resumed laurent his majesty king william serves notice that you are commanded to attend him at the royal residence at winchester on the third day after the feast of the archangels known as michaelmas at that appointed place and time you will receive the kings judgement in the matters laid before him this day here laurent broke off looking up from the proclamation he said do you understand what i have read to you when jago had finished translating these words bran said with all respect to the king we will stay here and await his judgement it may be that we can help bear witness against the rebels no answered the cleric after today it will be too dangerous for you to remain here and the king cannot ensure your safety the king has commanded that you are to be escorted to your ship at once and you are to make your way home by the swiftest means possible his majesty the king wishes you a pleasant journey and may god speed you in all safety to your destination steal breath from a baby we were stunned we had come all this way prepared to bargain plead fight tooth and nail for the return of our lands only to be tossed lightly onto the midden heap like so much dung it beggared belief i can tell you though bran tried to get the canon to see the thing as we did and though the cleric sympathised in his way laurent could do nothing the king had allowed him no room to wiggle there was nothing for it but to take the money and go red william is every inch as much a rogue as any of his bloody barons no mistake the kings knights escorted us to our horses and accompanied us back down the hill and through the town to the river wharf and our waiting ship we rode in silence all the way and my own heart was heavy until we came in sight of the dame havik at her mooringand then i remembered noin suddenly i cared no longer about the doings of the high and mighty my sole aim and desire was to see my love and hold her in my armsand each moment i was prevented from doing that was a moment that chafed and chapped me raw from the instant i set foot on the deck of that ship to the day i stepped off it and onto solid english earth once more i was a man with an itch i could not scratch when on that fine sunny day we bade our friend ruprecht farewell and took our leave a little lighter in the pocket to be surefor we paid that flemish sailor well for his excellent and praiseworthy careit was all i could do to keep from lashing my poor mount all the way back to elfael i counted the quarters of the days until i at last saw the greenwood rising in the distance on the slopes of the ridge beyond the vale of wye and then i counted the steps as i watched that great shaggy pelt bristling beneath a sky of shining blue and my heart beat faster for the sight struth only the man who has journeyed to far distant lands and returned to his native earth after braving dangers toil and hardships aplenty can know how i felt just then i was seized by joy and flown to dizzy heights of elation only to be dashed to the rocks again with the very next thought for as glad as i was to be going home i was that afraid something might yet prevent me reaching the one i loved all saints bear witness our little company could not move fast enough for me i fair wore out the goodwill of my companions long before we reached the blasted oak at the entrance to cel craidd when i came in sight of that black stump i threw myself from the saddle and was halfway to the lightningriven oak as through heavens own gate before i noticed someone standing there noin i could scarce believe my eyes she was there waiting for me is that you will scarlet her voice held a quiver surprise uncertainty but she made no move toward me i stepped nearer my heart beating high up in my throat and put out a hand to her it is i replied unable to speak above a whisper just then it is will come home she regarded me with an almost stern expression her eyes dry have you will have you come home at last that i have my love i stepped nearer now that i see you i know i am home at last as many times as i saw this glad reunion in my mind i did not see it this way she nodded i saw her swallow then and guessed something of what this confrontationfor such it wascost her but she did not back down she held me with her uncompromising gaze i have to know will she said if youve come back to stay i cannot wait for you any longer i have to know noin my love with god as my witness i will nevermore part from you dont she cried dont you say that you dont know what do you want me to say i asked if it is a pledge you seek tell me what pledge you will accept and i will give it gladly as she considered this i added i love you noin i loved you every blessed day i lay in that dark hole and if i could have come to you even a heartbeat sooner i would have been back at your side long ere you knew id gone she bent her head then and her long hair fell down around her face i could see her lips trembling noin i said moving closer if you no longer want me you have only to say the word and i will leave you be is that what you want she shook her head but did not look at me i raised my arms and held them out to her then come to me my love let us return to the happiness we once knew or if that be not possible anymore let us begin a new and better joy when she raised her head this time i saw the tears streaking her fair cheeks oh will she sobbed ive missed you so much so much i did not dare to hope she came into my arms and i crushed her to my chest with all the strength i did possess i held her and felt the hardness in her melt away as she clung to me her tears soaking into my shirt will dear sweet will im so sorry she said i had to be sure i couldnt live thinking forgive me there is nothing to forgive i am here now and i love you more than ever i did the day i left and will you yet wed me she asked looking tearfully into my face the sight of those tears glistening on her cheeks melted any shreds of dignity i might have had left i sank to my knees before her and clasped her around the waist marry me noin i want you so bad it hurts my heart the words were still fresh on my lips when i felt her arms encircle my neck she raised me to my feet and her warm lips bathed my scruffy face in kisses noin i gasped when i could breathe again oh noin i will never leave you i swear shh she hushed dont speak will just hold me i was happy to do that no mistake we stood there in the heart of the greenwood clutching one another so tight we could hardly draw a breath between us and we were clinging still when the others reached the riven oak where we stood they dismounted and bran let out a wild withering screech instantly the grellon began pouring up out of the bowl of cel craidd to greet the return of their king and kinsmen the next thing i knew i was half pulled half pushed through the oak and tumbled down the hillside into the bowl of our hidden settlement at first glance everything appeared just as i remembered itonly it was early summer now and i had left in the dead of winter still all was as it should be i reckoned until i began to tell the little differences the forest folk were right glad to see us but there was a hollow sound to their laughter and their smiles though genuine and heartfelt held more pain than pleasure the faces gathered round us were greyer than i remembered the bodies thinner winter had been hard for them yes and spring no better i reckoned many were gaunt with skin pinched around their deepset eyes their clothes were that much more tattered and frayed the dirt on their hands and faces was there for good and always my heart went out to them i had endured captivity in the sheriff s odious hellhole but they were no less captive here the wildwood of coed cadw had become as much a prison as any that the vile de glanville held key to it was clear to me then if never before this sorry state could not be endured much longer god willing our bold king william would soon give us redress and bran and all us forest folk could move out into the light once more in amongst the young uns i saw little nias face poking out i turned and scooped her up she did not cry out but twisted in my arms to see who held her weo she squealed grabbing my beard with both hands weeo bless her she was trying to say my name its me dear heart ol will is here from among the flock gathering to greet our return i glimpsed angharad hobbling forward on her long staff her wrinkled face alight with pleasure i bid thee glad homecoming william scatlocke she crowed her old voice quavering slightly the lord of hosts is smiling on this day greetingswise banfaith i said offering her a bow and touching the back of my hand to my forehead it is that good to see you again and youwill she drew close and stood for a moment smiling up at me then closing her eyes she raised her hand and touched two fingers lightly to my forehead all wise and loving father we thank you for redeeming the life of our friend delivering him from his enemies and bringing him back to us in answer to our prayers bless him and prosper him for your names sake and bless all who think well of him this day and all days henceforth as she prayed i felt noins hand squeeze my arm i thanked our bard and then turned to the others who were crowding in to make good my welcome here now here now came a shout and i was enwrapped and lifted off my feet in a ribcracking embrace tuck i said are you here too where else should i be but among my own dear flock on the day of your miraculous return weve been waiting for this day with a greedy impatience my friend he said his round face beaming god bless him there were tears in his eyes brother i said pulling noin close if you are not too busy this lady and i are that keen to be married if you have no objection i want you to perform the ceremony today today replied tuck today says he well to noin he said is this also your desire it is my deepest desire she replied her arm around my waist well then concluded tuck i do not see any reason to delay he glanced around what have you done with bran and the others casting a glance behind me i saw my travelling companions standing on the top of the low natural rampart that surrounded cel craidd i called to them why were you standing there i asked when they had joined us we wanted you to have a proper greeting all to yourself iwan explained and would you leave me standing here alone on my wedding day i said ohwill noin cried merian she pressed noins hands in hers then kissed me lightly on the cheek this is such good news we then endured the good wishes of bran iwan and the others in turn and i was pummelled goodnaturedly by one and all when the festive drubbing was finished i turned to tuck and said friar id be much obliged if you could perform the rites without delay i glanced at noin and saw the desire in her dark eyes as soon as may be tuck nodded and adopted a solemn air is it your wish to be married to this man he asked it is friar she replied i would have done it long since and there is no better day that i know than this and i would mark it always in my heart as the day my man was given back to me then so be it turning to the grellon crowding around the little friar called hear now will and noin have declared their desire to be married let us give them a wedding they will never forget if i had any notion of simply saying a few words before the priest and carrying off my bride to a little greenwood bower in the manner of my english father that idea was dashed to pieces quicker than it takes a fella to spit and say i do the forest folk fell to with a will i suppose the safe and successful return of the rescue party was the best excuse any of them had had to celebrate anything in many a month and the people were that eager to make a fair run at it noin and i were immediately caught up in the preparations for this sudden celebration the cooking fire was built up partridges and quail were pulled from the snares then plucked and spitted along with half a young wild pig and six coneys and a score of barley loaves set to bake the children were sent into the thickets to gather raspberries and red currants which were mixed with honey and made into a deep red compote asparagus and wild mushrooms were likewise picked chopped and boiled into a stew with borage and herbs the last of the walnuts which had been dried over the winter were shelled into a broth of milk and honey and many another dish to make the heart glad whatever stores had been set aside against even leaner days were brought out for our wedding feast and it did rightly make a humble man of me i can tell you while the men constructed a bower of birch branches for us to enjoy our first night together some of the women gathered flowers to strew our path and for noin to carry and one or two of the younger ones helped dress the bride and make her even more lovely in my eyes as for myself with little else to do i set about trying to drag a razor through the tough tangle of my beard i succeeded in cutting myself in such extravagant fashion that our good friar took the blade from my hand sat me down and expert barber that he was shaved me clean as a newborn he also combed and cut my hair so that i appeared almost a nobleman when my clothes were brushed and my shoes washed he found a new belt for me and a clean cloak of handsome green there now he declared like god regarding adam with a critical eye i have made me a man i thanked him kindly for his attentions and observed that my only regret was that i had no ring to give my bride a ring is a fine thing is it not he agreed but it is by no means necessary a coin will do and some i have heard have a smith bend the coin to make a ring you might easily do this this cheered me no end you are a wonder no mistake i told him i can get a coin and leaving the friar to his own preparations i set off to do just that the first person i went to was bran my lord i said i do not think i have asked a boon of you since swearing the oath of fealty lord bran allowed that as he could not think of any occasions either then if it please you my lord i continued i will make bold to request the small favour of a coin to give my bride i quickly went on to explain that i had no ring but that tuck had said a coin would serve as a suitable token indeed wondered bran then leave it to me well we were soon caught up in countless small activities and the mood was high before i knew it the sun had already begun its descent when our good friar declared that all was finally ready and we gathered beneath the council oak to speak our vows before our friends tuck scrubbed until he gleamed and beaming like a cherub fresh from the radiant presence took his place before us and called all to solemn purpose this is a holy time he said and a joyous celebration our heavenly father delights in love in all its wondrous forms especially dear to him is the love between a husband and wife may such love increase this brought a rousing chorus of agreement from the onlookers and tuck waited for silence before continuing therefore he said let us ask the author and sustainer of our love and life to bless the union of these two dear people who have pledged life and love to one another with that he began to pray and prayed so long i feared we would not finish the ceremony until the sun had gone down or possibly the next morning eventually he ran out of words to say to bless and beseech and moved on to the vows which we spoke out as tuck instructed there in the greenwood beneath that venerable oak we pledged life to life come what may and i took noin to be my wife when the time came to give my bride a token of honour i turned to bran and taking my one good hand in both of his he pressed a coin into my palm with greatest esteem and pleasure he said i looked down and saw that he had given me a solid gold byzant gleaming dull and heavy in my hand i gazed at that rare coin as at a fortune entire truly i had never had anything worth so much in all my life that he should think so much of me made the tears come to my eyes the long months of my captivity were somehow redeemed in that moment as i placed that matchless coin in the hand of my beloved pledging to honour and keep her through all things forever more then it was another prayerthis one for children aplenty to bless us and keep us in our old ageand we knelt together as tuck placed a hand on each of our heads and proclaimed i present to you master william scatlocke and his wife noinina all praise to our lord and kind creator for his wise provision of the feast i remember little i am told it was very good and i must have tasted some of it but my appetite was elsewhere by then and i could not wait until noin and i could be together we sat on the bench at the head of the board and received the good wishes of our friends merian with lord bran in tow came by twice to say how much she had longed for this day on our behalf iwan and siarles came to give us an old poem that they knew full of words with double meanings which soon had everyone screaming with laughter the celebration was so light and full of joy that i clean forgot about my mangled fingers and i cannot recall giving them a solitary thought all that fine and happy day when the moon rose and the fire was banked high angharad brought out her harp and began to sing she sang a song unknown to me as to most of us i suppose about a beautiful maiden who conceived a love for a man she had seen passing by her window one day the young woman decided to follow the stranger braving great hardship crossing mountain and moor in her quest to find him once more and declare her love for him she persevered through many terrors and misfortunes and at last came into the valley where her love lived he saw her approachingher beautiful gown begrimed and bedraggled her fine leather shoes worn through and wrapped in rags her beautiful hair dull with dust from the road her oncefair cheeks sunken with hunger her slender fingers worn her full lips chapped and bleedingand ran to meet her as she came near however she chanced to see her own reflection in a puddle in the road and horrified at what she saw she turned and ran away the man pursued her and caught her and knowing what she had endured to find him his heart swelled with love for her and in that moment he saw her as she was and the power of his love transformed her broken form into one even more beautiful than that which had been i confess there might have been more but i was only listening with half an ear for i was gazing at my own lovely bride and wishing we could steal away to the birch bower in the wood bran must have guessed what was in my mind for as the song concluded and the people called for another he came up behind me and said go now both of you merian and i will take your places we did not need urging that quick i was up and out of my seat and taking noin by the hand we flitted off into the wood leaving bran and merian at the board by the light of a summer moon we made our way along the path to the bower where candles were already lit and the mead in a jar warming by a small fire fleeces had been spread on a bed of fresh rushes there was food beneath a cloth for us to break our fast in the morning oh will said noin when she saw it it is lovelyjust as i always hoped it would be and so my lady are you i told her and pulling her close kissed her with the first of countless kisses we would share that night as for the rest i need not say more if you have ever loved anyone then you will know full well if not then nothing i can say will enlighten you chapter caer rhodl even though he had known this day was coming the news caught baron neufmarche off his guard he had just returned from a short trip to lundein and afterward gone to his chapel to observe mass and to offer a prayer of thanks for his safe return and a season of gainful commerce father gervais was officiating and the old priest who usually mumbled through the service in a low unintelligible drone perked up when the lord of hereford appeared in the doorway of the small stone church tucked inside the castle wall priest and worshipper acknowledged one another with a glance and a nod as the baron slipped into the enclosed wooden stall which served his family during their observances in the chapel the priest moved through the various sequences of the daily office lifting his voice and lingering over the scripture passages so that the baron whose latin he knew to be limited could follow more easily he chanted with his eyes closed saying deus qui omnipotentiam tuam parcendo maxime et miserando manifestas his old voice straining after the notes that once came so easily at those long familiar strains bernard felt himself relax the toil of his recent journey overtook him and he slumped back on the bench and rested his head against the high back of the stall he was soon asleep and remained happily so until some inner prompting woke him at the beginning of the dismissal upon hearing the words dominus vobiscum he roused himself and sat up father gervais was making the sign of the cross above the altar of the nearempty sanctuary benedicat vos omnipotens deus pater et filius et spiritus sanctus he intoned his deep voice loud in the small stone chapel and neufmarche joined him in saying amen the service concluded the elderly priest stepped down from the low platform to greet the baron dear bernard he said extending his hands in welcome you have returned safely i trust your journey was profitable it was father answered the baron he stifled a yawn with the back of his hand very profitable the old man took his arm and the two walked out into the brilliant light of a glorious latesummer day and how are things with you father he said as they stepped into the shaded path between the castle rampart and the rising wall of the tower keep about the same my son oh yes well he paused a moment to collect his thoughts ah now then but perhaps you havent heard yet i fear i may be the bearer of bad news bernard bad news father the baron had not heard anything on the road nor in the town when he passed through none of the household servants had hinted that anything was amiss he had not seen lady agnes since his return otherwise he would certainly have been informed his wife delighted in ill tidingsthe worse the better he glanced at the old man beside him but father gervais did not appear distraught in the least i have heard nothing a rider arrived this morning from your foreign estateswhat do you call them eyeass eiwas the baron corrected gently it is a commot in wales father ruled by my client lord cadwgana local nobleman enfeoffed to me ah your liegeman yes the doddering priest nodded the messenger father prompted neufmarche gently what did he say he said that the king has died said the priest would that be the same one king kad kadeuka no that cant be right cadwgan corrected neufmarche king cadwgan is dead you say i am sorry bernard but yes there is to be a funeral and they are wanting to know if you would attend i asked the fellow to wait for you but we didnt know when you would return so he went on his way when is the funeral to be held well the priest smiled and patted his temple this old head may not work as swiftly as once it did but i do not forget he made a calculation tapping his chin with his fingertips two days from tomorrow i believe yes something like that in three days exclaimed the baron i think thats what he said yes agreed the priest affably is it far this eyeas place far enough sighed the baron he could reach caer rhodl in time for the funeral but he would have to leave at once with at least one night on the road having just spent six days travelling the last thing he wanted was to sit another three days in the saddle a brief search led the baron to the one place he might have guessed his wife would be found she was sitting in the warmest room of castle hereforda small square chamber above the great hall it had no feature other than a wide southfacing window which during the long summer admitted the sunlight the whole day through lady agnes dressed in a gauzy fluff of pale yellow linen had set up her tapestry frame beside the wideopen window and was plying her needle with a fierce almost vengeful concentration she glanced up as he came in needle poised to attack saw who it was and as if stabbing an enemy plunged the long needle into the cloth before her you have returned my lord she observed pulling the thread tight pleasant journey pleasant enough said neufmarche you have fared well in my absence i trust i make no complaint her tone suggested that his absence was the cause of no end of tribulations too tiresome to mention now that he was back why did she always do that he wondered and decided to ignore the comment and move straight to the meat of the matter at hand cadwgan has died at last he said i must go to the funeral of course she agreed how long will you be away this time six days at least he answered eight more like id hoped id seen the last of the saddle for a while then take a carriage suggested agnes striking with the needle once more a carriage he stared at her as if hed never heard the word before i will not be seen riding in a carriage like an invalid he sniffed you are a baron of the march his wife pointed out you can do what you like there is no shame in travelling in comfort with an entourage as befits a man of your rank and nobility you could also travel at night if need be the baron spied a table in the corner of the room and on it a silver platter with a jar and three goblets he strode to the table and took up the jar to find that it contained sweet wine he poured himself a cup then poured one for his lady wife if i got a carriage you could come to the funeral with me he said extending the goblet to her mewhat little colour she had drained from the baronesss thin face the needle halted in midflight go to wales perish the thought cest impossible no it is not impossible answered her husband urging the cup on her i go there all the time as you know she shook her head pursing her thin lips into a frown i will not consort with barbarians they are not barbarians the baron told her still holding out the cup of wine they are crude and uneducated true and given to strange customs god knows but they are intelligent in their own way and capable of many of the higher virtues lady agnes folded her spindly arms across her narrow bosom that is as may be she allowed coolly but they are a contentious and bloody race who love nothing more than carving norman heads from norman shoulders she shivered violently and reached for the shawl that was perpetually close to hand you have said as much yourself in the main that may be true the baron granted warming to the idea of his wifes company as he contemplated the more subtle nuances of the situation to arrive at the funeral on horseback leading a company of mounted knights and menatarms would certainly reinforce his position as lord and master of the cantrefbut arriving with the baroness beside him in a carriage accompanied by a domestic entourage would firmly place his visit on a more social and personal footing this he was increasingly certain was just the right note to strike with cadwgans family kinsmen countrymen and heir in short he was convinced it was an opportunity not to be missed placing the goblet firmly in her hand he drank from his cup and declared ordinarily i would agree with you however my welsh fiefdom is an exception we have been on productive and peaceful terms for many years and your appearance at this time will commence a new entente between our two noble houses lady agnes frowned and glared into her cup as if it contained poison she did not like the way this conversation was going but saw no way to disarm the baron in his fullgallop charge may it please you my lord she said shoving back her chair and rising to her feet i will send with you a letter of condolence for the women of the house and my sincere regret at not being able to offer such comforts in person she stepped around the tapestry frame to where the baron was standing rose up on her toes and kissed his forehead then bade him good afternoon bernard watched his wifehead high back stiffas she walked to the door oh she could be stubborn as a barnyard ass in that she was her fathers daughter to the last drop of her angevin blood she might balk but she would do as she was told he hurried to his chambers below and called for his seneschal remey he said when his chief servant appeared carrying a tray laden with cold meat cheese bread and ale i need a carriage lady agnes and i will attend the funeral of my welsh client cadwgan my ladys maidservants will attend her and tell my sergeant to choose no fewer than eight knights and as many menatarms tell them to make ready to march before nightfall it will be done sire replied the seneschal touching the rolled brim of his soft cap thank you said neufmarche with a gesture of dismissal as the ageing servant reached the door the baron called out and remey see to it that the carriage is good and stout the roads are rocklined ruts beyond the march i want something that will get us there and back without breaking wheels and axles at every bump to be sure my lord replied remey will you require anything else spare no effort i want it ready at once the baron said we must leave before the day is out if we are to reach caer rhodl in time the seneschal withdrew and the baron sat down to his meal in solitude his thoughts already firmly enmeshed in grand schemes for his welsh commot and his longcherished desire for expansion in the territory prince garran would take his fathers place on the throne of eiwas and under the barons tutelage would become the perfect tool in the barons hand together they would carve a wide swathe through the fertile lowlands and grasscovered slopes of the welsh hill country the britons possessed a special knack with cattle it had to be admitted when matched with the insatiable norman appetite for beef the fortune to be made might well exceed even the barons more grandiose fancies the carriage remey chose for the journey was surprisingly comfortable muffling the judders and jolts of the deeply rutted roads and rocky trackways making the journey almost agreeable accompanied by a force of sixteen knights and menatarms on horseback and a train of seven pack mules with servants to attend them they could not have been more secure the baron noted that even lady agnes once resigned to the fact that there was no escaping her fate had perked up after the second day a little colour showed in her pale cheeks and by the time the wooden fortress that was caer rhodl came into view she had remarked no fewer than three times how good it was to get out of the perpetual chill of the castle merveilleux she exclaimed as a view of the distant mountains hove into view simply glorious i am so glad you approve my dear remarked the baron dryly i had no idea it could be like this she confessed so wild so beautiful and yet yes and yet so so very very empty it makes me sad somehowthe melancolie no do not tell me you do not feel it my love oh but i do answered the baron taking unexpected delight in his headstrong wifes rare reversal of opinion i do feel it no matter how often i visit the lands beyond the march i always sense a sorrow i cannot explainas if the hills and valleys hold secrets it would break the heart to hear yes perhaps granted agnes quaint yes and perhaps a little mysterious but not frightening i thought it would be more frightening somehow well as you see it today with the sun pouring bright gold upon the fields it does appear a more cheerful place god knows that is not always the way in due course the travelling company was greeted on the road by riders sent out from the caer to welcome them and provide a proper escort into cadwgans stronghold upon entering the circular yard behind the timber palisade they were met by prince garran and his three principal advisorsone of his own and two who had served his father for many years baron neufmarche called garran striding forth with his arms outspread in welcome as his guests stepped down from the carriage pax vobiscum my lord god be good to you and to you replied the baron i could wish this a happier time but i think we all knew this day would come now that it is here my sympathies are with you and your mother you have suffered much i think the past two years we struggle on replied the prince you do agreed the baron and it does you credit he turned to his wife and presented her to the young prince baroness neufmarche said garran accepting her hand rest assured that we will do all in our power to make your stay as pleasant as possible lady agnes if you please she replied delighted at the princes dark good looks and polite mannernot to mention his facility in her own language the baroness thanked her handsome young host and was in turn presented to cadwgans widow queen anora my lady may god be gracious to you in your season of mourning agnes said speaking in simple french though she suspected the queen did not fully comprehend prince garran smoothly translated for his mother who smiled sadly and received the baronesss condolences with austere grace please come inside said garran directing his guests towards the hall we have prepared a repast to refresh you from your journey tonight we will begin the feast of remembrance and the funeral ceremony inquired the baron that will take place later today at twilight the feast follows the burial they were led to the hall where a number of mourners were gathered lady agnes who had imagined the welsh to be dressed in rough pelts their faces tattooed in weird designs and feathers in their hair and necklaces made from the bones of birds and small animals was pleasantly impressed with not only the general appearance of the barbariansmost of whom were dressed neither better nor worse than the typical english or french serf of her limited acquaintancebut with their solemn almost stoic dignity as well the room was festooned with banners of various tribes and illumined by the light of countless beeswax candles the warm scent of which mingled with that of the clean rushes bestrewing the floor on trestles set up in the centre of the room on a board covered with fresh juniper branches lay king cadwgan himself covered in his customary cloak on which was placed a large whitepainted wooden cross lady agnes blanched to see him but no one else seemed to consider it odd that the deceased should reside in the hall surrounded as in life by his subjects and kinsmen indeed every now and then one of the mourners would come forward to stroke the head of the dead king whose hair had been washed and brushed to form a wispy nimbus around his head one by one the new arrivals were introduced to the other notables in the room and they were given shallow bowls of mead to drink kitchen servants and young girls circulated with trays of small parcels of spiced meat nuts and herbs wrapped in pastry which they served to the funeral guests the baroness although unable to understand anything that was said around heror perhaps because of itbegan watching these courtesies intently what she saw was a people whether highborn or low who seemed to enjoy one anothers company and crude as they undeniably were revelled in the occasion a time of sadness of course yet the funereal room rang with almost continual laughter in spite of any previous notions she found herself drawn to the unabashed sincerity of these folk and was moved by their honest displays of kindness and fellowship thus the mourners occupied themselves until the sun began to set at which time a body of priests and monks arrived as if on signal the mourners began to sing and though the words were strange and there were no musical instruments agnes thought she had never heard music so sweetly sad after a lengthy stint of singing a greyrobed priest who seemed to be in charge of the proceedings stepped to the bier and bowing three times stretched his hands over the corpse and began to pray he prayed in latin which the baroness had not expected the prayer while curious in its expression was more or less like any she might have heard in angevin when the prayer was finished the priest was given a crosierby which agnes was given to know that he was actually a bishop striking the crosier on the floor three times he gestured to the board six men of the tribe stepped forward and taking their places around the dead king lifted the board from the trestles and carried it from the hall the mourners all fell into place behind them and in this way they were led out into the yard and down from the fortress mound into the valley eventually arriving in the yard of a small wooden church where a grave had been dug within the precinct of the low stonewalled yard the grave was lined with large flat flagstones some of which had been roughly shaped for the purpose the mourners paused to remove their shoes before entering the churchyard which lady agnes considered very odd but entering the holy precinct barefoot stirred her soul more profoundly than anything which had happened thus far when the body on its board was carefully lowered into the hole prepared to receive it by six barefoot men her everwatchful eyes grew a little moist at the corners there were prayers over the grave and still more when the earth was replaced in the hole covering the dead king then this part of the service concluded the people began drifting away in small clumps of two or three it was simple but genuine and heartfelt and the sincerity of the people winsome agnes more intensely affected by the experience than she could possibly have imagined became very thoughtful and silent on the way back to the caer and when as they mounted the hill and saw the first stars beginning to shine the mourners began singing lady agnes for whom life presented nothing more than a series of challenges and hardships to be overcome felt something tight loosen in her heart and the tears began to flow she heard in the melody such indomitable spirit and courage that she was ashamed of her former disparagement of these fine and dignified people she walked along slippers in hand listening to the voices as they mingled in the sweet summer air tears of joy and sadness glistening on her cheeks the baron walking with prince garran and his mother did not see his wife or he might well have been alarmed later as they sat down to the first of several feasts in honour of the dead king he did note that lady agnes seemed subdued but pleasantly so her smile unforced her manner more calm and peaceable than he could recently remember no doubt he thought she is tired from the journey but as she smiled at him when she saw him regarding her from his place near the prince he returned her smile and thought to himself that he had been right to insist she come the next days were given to preparations for the coronation of prince garran who as the baron had long ago determined should follow his father to the throne this decision was roundly ratified by the people of eiwas so there was no awkwardness or difficulty regarding the succession and the coronation took place in good order with little ceremony but great celebration by those who having laid to rest the old king had stayed to welcome the new when baron neufmarche and his wife took their leave of king garran two days later they urged the new monarch to come to visit them in hereford come for michaelmas the baron said his tone gently insistent we will hold a feast in your honour and talk about our future together as if in afterthought he added you know i think my daughter would like to know you betteryou have not met sybil i think the young king shook his head no then it is arranged you must come added the baroness pressing his hand as she stepped to the carriage and bring your mother too do promise to bring her i will send a carriage so she will travel more comfortably my lady replied the newmade king unable to gainsay his lords wife it will be my pleasure to attend you at michaelmas later as the carriage climbed the first of many hills that would take the caer from view lady agnes said king garran and our sybil so you have not mentioned this to me ah um the baron hesitated uncertain how to proceed now that his impromptu plan had been revealed i meant to tell you about that but ah well the notion just came to me a day or so ago and there wasnt time to i like it she told him cutting short his stuttering he stared at her as if he could not think he had heard her right you would approve of such a union wondered bernard greatly amazed at this change in his wifes ordinarily dour humour it would be a good match she affirmed good for both of them i should think yes i do approve i will speak to sybil upon our return see to it that you secure garrans promise it will be done said the baron still staring at his wife in slight disbelief are you feeling well my love never better she declared she was silent a moment musing to herself then announced i think a christmas wedding would be a splendid thing it will give me time to make the necessary plans baron neufmarche unable to think of anything to say in the presence of this extraordinary transformation of the woman he had known all these years simply gazed at her with admiration chapter noin and i spent the rest of the summer luxuriating in one anothers love and talking talking talking like two blackbirds sitting on a fence we filled the air morning to night with our chatter she told me all the greenwood gossipall the doings large and small that filled the days we were apart i told her of my captivity and passing the time with odo scribbling down my ramblings i should like to read that noin said then smiled that alone would make it worth learning to read odo tells me that reading is not so difficult i explained but the only things written are either for lawyers or priests and not at all of interest to plain folk like you and me i should like it all the same noin insisted as the days passed i considered making good on my promise to build my wife and daughter a new house i found a nice spot on a bit of higher ground at one end of cel craidd and marked out the dimensions on the ground with sticks i then went to our lord bran to beg his permission to clear the ground and cut a few limbs of stout oak for the roof beam lintel and corner posts why build a house he asked holding his head to one side as if he couldnt understand before i could point out that i had promised it to my bride and that her own small hut was a bit too snug for three or more he added we will be gone from here come michaelmas i know but i promised noin i began come hunting with us instead bran said weve missed you on the trails my broken fingers were slowly healing but as my usefulness with a bow was still limited i served mainly to beat the bushes for game dont worry siarles told me after that first time we went out youll be drawing like a champion again in no time rest those fingers while you can in this he was a prophet no mistake i did not know it then but would have cause to remember his words in times to come thus the summer slowly dwindled down and golden autumn arrived i began counting the days to michaelmas and the time of leaving we called the day of judgement bran and angharad held close counsel and determined that we would go with as many of the grellon as could be spared leaving behind only those who could not make the journey and a few men to protect them we would go to caer wintanknown to the english as winchesterand receive the kings decision on the return of our lands the king must see the people who depend on his judgement for their lives angharad said we must travel together and stand before him together what if he will not see us all in a herd wondered iwan when he learned this he will speak to all or none bran replied for then he will judge what is right and for the good of all and not for me only the next day bran sent siarles with an extra horse to saint dyfrigs abbey to fetch brother jago and twelve days before the feast of saint michael we set off it is no easy thing to keep so many people moving i can tell you we were thirty folk in all counting young ones we went on foot for the most part the horses were used to carry provisions and supplies none of us rode save angharad for whom the walk would have been far too demanding her old bones would not have lasted the journey i believe for it is a fair distance to caer wintan from elfael the weather stayed goodwarm days nights cool and dry we camped wherever we would with that many people and enough of them bearing longbows we had no great fear of being harassed by englishmen or normans either one the only real danger was that we would not reach caer wintan in time for as the days of travel drew on the miles began to tell and the people grew weary and had to rest more often we moved more slowly than bran had reckoned do not worry counselled friar tuck you can always take a few with you and ride ahead can you not you will get there in time never fear bran rejected this notion outright we would arrive together each and every last one he said or we would not arrive at all it was for the people we were doing this he said so the king must look into the eyes of those for whom his judgement is life or death there was nothing for it but that we would simply have to travel more quickly that night he gathered us all and told us again why we were going to see the king and what it meant he explained how it was of vital importance that we should arrive in good time saying king william must have no grievance against us nor any cause to change his mind we must endure the hardships of the road my friends for what we do we do not for ourselves alone but for the sake of all those in elfael who cannot join us we do it for the farmers who have been driven from their fields and families from their homes for the widows who have lost their men and those who stood in the shadow of the gallows we do it for all who have been made to labour on the barons hateful strongholds and town for those who have fled into bleak and friendless exile we do it for those who will come after us to help shoulder the burden of reclaiming that which we have lost to the enemy yes and for all who have gone before us we do this theirs the sacrifice ours the gain he gazed at all of those clustered around him holding their eyes with his we do not do this for ourselves alone but for all who have suffered under the oppression of the ffreinc thus he braced our flagging spirits speaking words of encouragement and hope the next day he became tireless in urging each and every one of us to hasten our steps and when anyone was seen to be dragging behind he hurried to help that one sometimes he seemed to be everywhere at oncenow at the front of the long line of travellers now at the rear among the stragglers he did all this with endless good humour telling one and all to think what it would be like to be free in our own lands and secure in our own homes once more the next day he did the same and the next he coaxed and cajoled until he grew hoarse and then friar tuck took over leading our footsore flock in songs when we ran out of those he started in on hymns and little by little all the urging and singing finally took hold we walked easier and with lighter hearts the miles fell behind us at a quicker pace until at last we reached the low lumpy hills of the southlands caer wintan was a thriving market town helped no doubt by the presence of the royal residence nearby not wishing to risk trouble we skirted the town and did not draw attention to ourselves beyond sending tuck and a few men to buy fresh provisions we arrived with a day to spare and camped within sight of the kings strongholdan old english hunting lodge that had once belonged to an earl or duke i suppose it was the place where red william spent those few days he was not racing here or there to shore up his sagging kingdom in one place or another it reminded me of aelreds manor my old earls house but with two long wings enclosing a bare dirt yard in front of the blackandwhite halftimbered hall the only defence for the place was a wooden palisade with a porters hut beside the timber gate with a day to spare we spent it washing our clothes and bathing ridding ourselves of the road and making ourselves ready to attend the king at sunrise on the third day after saint michaels day we rose and broke fast then laundered and brushed washed and combed we walked to the kings house with bran in the lead followed by angharad leaning on her staff and beside her iwan holding his bow and a sheaf of arrows at his belt siarles and merian came next and then the rest of us in a long double rank i carried nia and walked with noin as we passed through the gate i felt her slip her hand into mine and give it a squeeze i am glad to be here today she murmured i will remember it always me too i whispered it is a great day this and right worthy to be remembered we assembled in the kings yard and bran had just asked brother jago to inform the kings porter that we had come in answer to the kings summons as commanded and were awaiting his pleasure when who should appear but count falkes de braose and abbot hugo accompanied by marshal guy de gysburne and no fewer than fifteen knights they swept in through the gates heedless of our folk who had to scatter to let them through one look at our straggled lot and the ffreinc drew their swords our own men set arrows on their strings and took a mark we all stared at one another eyes hard faces grim until count falkes broke the silence bran ap brychan intoned the count in his high nasal voice et tous vos compatriotes foule quune surprise desagreable brother jago taking his place at brans shoulder whispered the counts greeting in our lords ear i needed no translation to know that he had insulted bran by calling us all filthy countrymen and a disagreeable surprise count falkes your arrival is as untimely as it is unwelcome replied bran lightly what are you doing here one could ask the same of you countered falkes i thought you were dead i am as you see me returned bran but it would seem you still irk the earth with your presence i asked why you have come marshal gysburne muttered an oath at this reply when jago had delivered it and several other knights spat at us i saw a flicker of anger flit across the counts face but his reply was restrained we are obeying the kings summons i cannot think you are here by accident we likewise have been summoned returned bran therefore let us resolve to hold the peace between us for at least as long as we must stand before the king with some reluctance it seemed to me count falkes agreed although he really had no better choice starting a battle in the kings yard would have gained him little and cost him much very well he said at last we will keep the peace insofar as you keep your rabble subdued i could not tell how much the count knew about our bran and his busy doingsvery little i guessed for his remark about bran having been killed seemed to signify that falkes did not recognise bran as father dominic or as king raven either i thought the whole contest would be over once he recognised me though but after bandying words with bran he feigned disinterest in us and turned his face away as if we were beneath his regard i suppose i appeared just a married man with a child in his arms and a wife by his side so now an uneasy truce was establishedbut it was that thin i can tell you a single lance point or arrow tip could have pierced it anywhere along the line we waited there in the yard wary and watching one another noin bless her stood with her head high and shoulders straight returning the glare of the marshal and his hardeyed knights and little nia found a pile of pebbles to keep her busy moving them from one place to another and singing to them all the while when it seemed that we must all snap under the strain the great oakandiron door of the kings royal residence opened and out stepped the kings man accompanied by two other household servants his majesty the king has been informed of your arrival he announced in good english he begs the boon of your patience and will give audience as soon as may be taking in the horde of welshmen standing with bran in the yard he added it will not be possible for all of you to enter the hall is not large enough you must choose representatives to attend you the rest will wait here when jago had relayed these words to our lord bran replied with respect as the kings judgement will serve all my people we will hear it together perhaps the king will not mind delivering his decision to us here as we wait so patiently the fella made no answer but simply bent his head turned on his heel and scuttled back inside all stand together sneered count falkes how very welsh the word was a slur in his mouth all hang together too observed abbot hugo his eye fell on me just then and recognition came to him his ruddy face froze you there he shouted hold up your hands dont do it will warned bran glancing quickly over his shoulder he may suspect but we need not feed his suspicion i stood my ground silently returning his gaze but i kept my hands well out of the black abbots sight it was then i saw odo sitting most uncomfortably on the back of a brown mare he saw me too knew me andbless himheld his tongue he would not betray me to his masters i say cried the abbot growing angry order your man to show me his hands as he is my man said bran he is mine to command i will make no such demand by the virgin it is him insisted the abbot what are you talking about wondered count falkes the prisoner cried hugo jabbing his finger at me scatlockethe one they called scarlet that is him i tell you count falkes turned his gaze my way and studied me for a moment no he decided that is not the man no doubt my haircut and shave and change of clothes and fleshing out a little on my wifes good cooking had changed me enough to make them just that little uncertain it is him put in gysburne he looked at bran and concluded and the last time we saw that one he gave his name as father dominic i would swear to it he gazed at the rest of us his eyes passing back and forth along the ranks by the rood theyre all here he pointed at iwan i know ive seen that one before i know it you are imagining things remarked the count they all look alike anyway these welsh say nothing advised angharad speaking mostly to bran but to the rest of us as well let them think what they willit no longer matters what they say let them rail we will not stoop to satisfy their accusations so bran ignored the ffreinc taunts and fingerpointing which continued to be cast at him and some of the rest of us instead he and angharad turned their faces to the ironbound door and waited the sun rose slowly higher and still we waited growing warm beneath the bright autumn rays some of the ffreinc grew tired of waiting in the saddle and sheathing their weapons climbed down from their horses others led their mounts away to water them most however remained to glare and frown and mutter curses at us but that is the worst of what they did and we braved it in silence without giving them cause for greater anger then as the sun climbed toward midday the door to the royal residence opened once more and the kings man appeared with the two servants hear hear he called his majesty william king of england out from the house came the red king and five attendants one of them a priest of some exalted kind robed in red satin with a gold chain and cross around his neck and another the young lord leicester we had met in rouen the rest were knights carrying lances the king himself surrounded by his bodyguard seemed smaller than i remembered him his stocky form was wrapped in a blue tunic that stretched tight across his bulging stomach his short legs were stuffed into dark brown trousers and tall riding boots his flamecoloured hair glowed with bright fire in the sunlight but he seemed tired to me almost haggard and there were chapped patches on his cheeks in his hand he carried a rolled parchment which one is the king is it the one in red whispered noin and i realised that like most people shed never set eyes to the king of england before and had no idea how william or any other king might appear when not tricked out in their regal frippery no the fat one with orange hair i told her thats our william rufus this information was repeated down the ranks along with other pungent observations de braose and his lot seeking an advantage somehow called out greetings to the king who ran his eye quickly over them but did not respond to their bald attempt at flattery after this had gone on for a time the king gestured to his man who cut short the speeches and called for silence with a somewhat distracted air the king held the parchment roll out to the priest cardinal ranulf of bayeux will read out the royal judgement proclamation at this time he declared brother jago relayed these words to the welsh speakers the cardinal known as flambard stepped forward and with a short bow received the scroll from williams hand he took his time untying it and unrolling it holding it high he stepped forward and began to read it out it was latin of course and i could make nothing of it fortunately i was standing near enough to brother jago to catch most of what he said as he translated the words for bran and angharad tuck was close by to offer his understanding as well iwilliam by the grace of god king of england greets his subjects with all respect and honour according to their rank and station be it known that this day the third day after the feast of saint michael this judgement was made public by the reading hereof in the presence of the same king and those persons summoned by the crown to attend him owing to the perfidious nature of certain noblemen known to the king and because of dissensions and discords which have arisen between the king and the lord kings brother duke robert of normandie and a company of rebellious barons of the kingdom concerning williams lawful right to occupy the throne and to rule unimpeded by the slanders and allegations of traitorous dissenters this recognition has been made before the chief justiciar of england and henry earl of warwick and other great men of the kingdom and has been signed and sealed in their presence here the cardinal paused to allow the crowd to unravel the mean ing of this address we were by no means the only ones struggling to keep up the ffreinc in count de braoses camp were having their own difficulties with all that highflown latin and were being aided by abbot hugo who was interpreting for the count and others when cardinal flambard decided that all had caught up with him he continued accordingly iwilliam under authority of heaven do hereby set forth my disposition in the matters arising from the recent attempt by those rebellious subjects aforementioned to remove his majesty from his throne and the rightful rule of his realm and subjects be it known that william de braose baron of bramber for his part in the rebellion has forfeited his lands and title to the crown and is henceforth prohibited from returning to england under ban of condemnation for treason and the penalty thereof regarding his son the earl philip de braose and his nephew the count falkes de braose being found to have no part in the wicked rebellion against their lawful king but owing to their familial proximity to the traitors it is deemed prudent to extend the ban to them and their households therefore they are to follow the baron into exile to whatever lands will receive them the ffreinc moaned and gnashed their teeth at this while at the same time it was all we could do to keep from cheering oh it was all wed hoped forbaron de braose was banished and his noxious nephew exiled with him the throne of elfael was freed from the normans and victory was sweet in our mouths but as the good lord giveth with his right hand and taketh with his leftso with kings further continued the cardinal it pleases his majesty to assume those lands now vacated to be placed under forest law as a protectorate of royal privilege to be administered for the crown by a regent chosen to serve the interests of the crown namely abbot hugo de rainault as our regent and an officer of the crown he will exercise all authority necessary to hold maintain and prosper those lands and estates and with the aid of our sheriff richard de glanville to more firmly establish the realm in the fealty due its rightful monarch here the cardinal broke off to allow the translators to catch up while we were struggling to work out what had just happened cardinal flambard concluded saying all others professing grievance in this matter having been rewarded according to their service are herewith disposed no further action in regard to this judgement shall be countenanced under the sign and seal of william king of england owing to the slight murkiness of courtly latin it took us a while to get to grips with the outrage that had just been revealed in our hearing tuck and jago held close council with bran and angharad count falkes de braose astonished beyond words stared at the king as if at the devils own manservant abbot hugo and marshal guy put their heads together already preparing to seed more mischief in both camps ffreinc and british there were dire mutterings and grumblings along with many another i pressed forward to hear what the clerics among us were saying and caught part of the discussion so it comes to this tuck said baron de braose and all his kith and kin have been banished never to return to english soil on pain of deathwell and good but see here pointed out jago abbot hugo is made regent and remains in possession of the lands granted to de braose by the king but the bloody abbot keeps elfael growled tuck dangerously a dull damp sickness descended over me some of those around me swore and called down curses on the head of the english king what does it mean said noin pressing close beside me it means we have been used and cast aside i spat it means that redhaired rogue has gutted us like rabbits and thrown us to the dogs that cannot be said bran already starting forth heaven will not allow it he stepped forward three long paces and halted calling upon the king to hear him my lord king he said with jagos help am i to understand that you have allowed abbot hugo to keep our lands in elfael the king has decreed that the abbot will serve as his regent replied cardinal ranulf his eyes narrowed as he gazed at bran i remember you right well he said and i warn you against trying any such foolishness as you attempted last time we met then pray remind the king that i was promised the return of our lands and the rule of our people bran countered speaking through jago this i was promised by the king himself in recognition of our part in exposing the traitors the king heard this of course but glanced away a pained expression on his face i cannot answer for any promises which might or might not have been made in the past responded the cardinal making it sound as if this had all taken place untold years ago and could have no part in the judgement now after a suitable season of reflection the king has determined that it does not serve the interests of the crown to return elfael to welsh rule at this time what is to become of us cried bran growing visibly angry that is our landour home we were promised justice justice replied the silkrobed cardinal coolly you have received your king has decreed his word is law bran holding tight to the reins of his rage argued his case i would remind his majesty that it was from within the abbots own stronghold that we learned of the conspiracy against him your regent is as guilty of treason as those you have already condemned and punished so you say countered the cardinal smoothly there has been no proof of this and therefore the right practice of justice decrees no guilt shall be laid at the abbots feet call it what you will my lord but do not call it justice said bran his voice shaking with fury sweet jesus i had never seen him so angry his face was white his eyes flashing quick fire this is an offence against heaven the people of elfael will not rest until we have gained the justice promised to us you and your people will conform yourself to the regents rule flambard declared as regent abbot hugo is charged with your care and protection henceforth he will provide you with the comfort and solace of the kings law with all respect cardinal bran called fighting to keep his rage from devouring his reason we cannot accept this judgement the king has spoken concluded cardinal bayeux the continued prosecution of this dispute has no merit the matter is herewith concluded king william impervious to our lords anger nodded once and turned away he and his soldiers and confidants walked back to the house and went inside the cardinal rolled up the parchment and turned to follow his monarch with that our day of judgement was over as the door closed on the backs of the royal party a wide double door opened at the far end of the yard and soldiers who had been awaiting this moment streamed out to encircle us weapons ready they formed a wall shouldertoshoulder around the perimeter of the yard we must leave here at once said angharad bran he was no longer listening we will not be denied he shouted starting forth this is not the end do you hear she pulled brans sleeve restraining him shaking off her grasp he started after the swiftly retreating cardinal iwan siarles she snapped see to your lord the two leapt forward and took hold of bran one on either side come away my lord said iwan dont make things worse they only want half a reason to attack us you do well to drag him away called marshal guy laughing drag the beaten dog away gysburne was the only one to find amusement in this disaster mindhe and a few of the less astutelooking soldiers with him the rest appeared suitably grim realising that this was no good news for them either count falkes looked like a man who has had his bones removed and it was all he could do to remain in the saddle his pale countenance was more ghastly still and his lips trembled no doubt in contemplation of his ruin iwan and siarles were able to haul bran back merian rushed to his side to help calm him meanwhile tuck and angharad fearful of what the ffreinc might do next moved quickly to turn everyone and march them from the yard before bloodshed could turn the disaster into a catastrophe obeying cooler heads we turned and started slowly away under the narrowed eyes and naked weapons of the kings soldiers as we passed count de braoses company i looked up and saw odo his round owlish face stricken on impulse i raised my hand and beckoned him to join us come monk i told him if you would quit the devil and stand on the side of the angels you are welcome here to my surprise he lifted the reins and moved out from the ffreinc ranks some of those around him tried to prevent him but he pulled away from their grasp the abbot sneering down his long nose told them to let the craven judas go let him leave if he will said marshal gysburne snatching the bridle strap and halting odos mount but he goes without the horse so my dear dull scribe took his life in his hands plucked up his small courage and slid down from the saddle to take his place among the grellon as we marched from the yard the soldiers tightened the circle and drew in behind us to make certain we would depart without causing any trouble abbot hugo called out one last threat do not think to return to elfael he said his voice ringing loud in the yard we have marked you and we will kill you on sight should you or any of your rabble ever set foot in elfael again when jago translated the abbots challenge for us i saw bran stiffen turning to address the abbot he said in latin enjoy this day vile priestit is the last peace you will know from this day hence it is war abbot hugo shouted something in reply and the ffreinc soldiers made as if they might mount an attack they drew swords and lowered their shields preparing to charge but bran snatched up a bow and quick as a blink planted an arrow between the abbots legs pinning the hem of his robe to the hard ground the next arrow finds your black heart abbot bran called tell the soldiers to put up their weapons hugo heeded the warning and wisely called for the kings men to hold and let us depart slowly bran lowered the bow turned and led his people from the kings stronghold heads held high we strode out through the gate and into our bloodtinged fate epilogue are you sure hes the one asked marshal guy of gysburne absolutely certain muttered abbot hugo there is no doubt bran ap brychan was heir to the throne of elfael that idiot de braose killed his father and he himself was thought to be deadbut of course that was bungled along with everything else the baron and his milksop nephew touched to think we had him in our grasp and didnt recognise him gysburne observed curious hugo took a deep breath and fixed his marshal with a steely gaze king raven the socalled phantom and bran are one and the same id stake my life on it we should have taken him when we had the chance remarked gysburne still puzzling over the deception played upon them a mistake spat hugo we will not repeat count falkes de braose had been escorted from the yard by knights of the king to be taken to lundein and there put on a ship to normandie abbot hugo and his marshal were left to consider the unexpected rise in their fortunes and the threats to their rule their first thoughts turned to bran and his followers they quickly decided that so long as bran and his men remained at large they would never enjoy complete control over the people and lands that king william had entrusted to their stewardship i can take him now said guy not here said hugo not in sight of the king and his court that will not do no let the upstart and his rabble get down the road a pace and follow them they wont get far on foot wait until they make camp for the night and then kill them all there are women and children and at least one priest guy pointed out what shall we do with them spare no one the abbot replied but my lord objected guy he was a knight of the realm and did not fancy himself a murderer we cannot slaughter them like cattle bran ap brychan said it himself countered the abbot it is war his words not mine gysburne if it is war he wants this is where it begins before marshal guy could argue further the abbot called his knights and menatarmsand as many of the counts men who wished to join his armyto gather in a corner of the yard on your knees men he said bow your headswith a clatter of armour the knights under guy gysburnes command drew their swords and knelt in a circle around the abbot folding their hands over the hilts of their unsheathed swords they bowed their heads raising his right hand hugo made the sign of the cross over the kneeling soldiers lord of hosts he prayed i send these men out to do battle in your name shield them with your hand and protect them from the arrows of the enemy let their toil be accounted righteousness for your names sake amen the soldiers raised their heads as the abbot said for any and all acts committed in carrying out the charge laid upon you this day you are hereby absolved in heaven and on earth obey the will of your commander who serves me even as i serve god almighty for the sake of gods anointed king william the holy church and the lord jesus christ himself show no mercy to those who rebel against their rule and do so with the full knowledge that all of your deeds will be accounted to your favour on the earth and in heaven and that you bear no stain of guilt or sin for the shedding of blood this day with that guy and his men mounted their horses and silently rode from the yard in pursuit of king raven and his flock
