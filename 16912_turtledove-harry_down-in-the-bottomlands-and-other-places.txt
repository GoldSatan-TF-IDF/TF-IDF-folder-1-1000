harry turtledove l sprague de camp down in the bottomlands and other places dedication from harry turtledove to l sprague de camp with thanks for the inspiration down in the bottomlands harry turtledove a double handful of tourists climbed down from the omnibus chattering with excitement from under the long brim of his cap radnal vez krobir looked them over comparing them with previous groups hed led through trench park about average he decided an old man spending money before he died younger folks searching for adventure in an overcivilized world a few who didnt fit into an obvious category and might be artists writers researchers or anything else under the sun he also looked over the women in the tour group with a different sort of curiosity he was in the process of buying a bride from her father but he hadnt done it legally and morally he remained a free agent some of the women were worth looking over too a couple of tall slim dark highheads from the eastern lands who stuck by each other and another of radnals own strongbrow race shorter stockier fairer with deepset light eyes under heavy brow ridges one of the highhead girls gave him a dazzling smile he smiled back as he walked toward the group his wool robes flapping around him hello friends he called do you all understand tarteshan ah good cameras clicked as he spoke he was used to that people from every tour group wasted pictures on him though he wasnt what theyd come to see he went into his usual welcoming speech on behalf of the hereditary tyranny of tartesh and the staff of trench park im pleased to welcome you here today if you havent read my button or if you just speak tarteshan but dont know our syllabary my name is radnal vez krobir im a field biologist with the park doing a twoyear stretch of guide duty stretch said the woman whod smiled at him you make it sound like a sentence in the mines i dont mean it like thatquite he grinned his most disarming grin most of the tourists grinned back a few stayed soberfaced likely the ones who suspected the gibe was real and the grin put on there was some truth in that he knew it but the tourists werent supposed to he went on in a bit ill take you over to the donkeys for the trip down into the trench itself as you know we try to keep our mechanical civilization out of the park so we can show you what all the bottomlands were like not so long ago you neednt worry the donkeys are very surefooted we havent lost one or even a tourist in years this time some of the chuckles that came back were nervous probably only a couple of this lot had ever done anything so archaic as getting on the back of an animal too bad for the ones just thinking about that now the rules were clearly stated the pretty highhead girls looked particularly upset the placid donkeys worried them more than the wild beasts of the trench lets put off the evil moment as long as we can radnal said come under the colonnade for half a daytenth or so and well talk about what makes trench park unique the tour group followed him into the shade several people sighed in relief radnal had to work to keep his face straight the tarteshan sun was warm but if they had trouble here theyd cook down in the trench that was their lookout if they got heatstroke hed set them right again hed done it before he pointed to the first illuminated map twenty million years ago as youll see the bottomlands didnt exist a long stretch of sea separated whats now the southwest section of the great continent from the rest notice that what were then two lands masses first joined in the east and a land bridge rose here he pointed again this time more precisely this sea now a long arm of the western ocean remained he walked over to the next map drawing the tourists with him things stayed like that until about six and a half million years ago then as that southwest section of the great continent kept drifting northward a new range gradually pushed up here at the western outlet of that inland sea when it was cut off from the western ocean it began to dry up it lost more water by evaporation than flowed into it from its rivers now if youll come along the third map had several overlays in different shades of blue the sea took about a thousand years to turn into the bottomlands it refilled from the western ocean several times too as tectonic forces lowered the barrier mountains but for about the last five and a half million years the bottomlands have had about the form we know today the last map showed the picture familiar to any child studying geography the trench of the bottomlands furrowing across the great continent like a surgical scar requiring colors needed nowhere else on the globe to show relief radnal led the tourists out to the donkey corral the shaggy animals were already bridled and saddled radnal explained how to mount demonstrated and waited for the tourists to mess it up sure enough both highhead girls put the wrong foot in the stirrup no like this he said demonstrating again use your left foot then swing over the girl who had smiled at him succeeded on the second try the other balked help me she said breathing out through his beaky nose in lieu of sighing radnal put his hands on her waist and all but lifted her into the saddle as she mounted she giggled youre so strong hes so strong evillia the other highhead girl presumably evillia giggled too radnal breathed out again harder tarteshans and other folk of strongbrow race who lived north of the bottomlands and down in them were stronger than most highheads but generally werent as agile so what either way he went back to work now that weve learned to mount our donkeys were going to learn to dismount the tourists groaned but radnal was inexorable you still have to carry your supplies from the omnibus and stow them in the saddlebags im your guide not your servant the tarteshan words carried overtones of im your equal not your slave most of the tourists dismounted but evillia stayed up on her donkey radnal strode over to her even his patience was fraying this way he guided her through the necessary motions thank you freeman vez krobir she said in surprisingly fluent tarteshan she turned to her friend youre right lofosa he is strong radnal felt his ears grow hot under their coat of down a brownskinned highhead from south of the bottomlands rocked his hips back and forth and said im jealous of you several tourists laughed lets get on with it radnal said the sooner we get the donkeys loaded the sooner we can begin and the more well see that line never failed you didnt become a tourist unless you wanted to see as much as you could as if on cue the driver brought the omnibus around to the corral the baggage doors opened with a hiss of compressed air the driver started chucking luggage out of the bins you shouldnt have any problems radnal said everyones gear had been weighed and measured beforehand to make sure the donkeys wouldnt have to bear anything too bulky or heavy most people easily shifted their belongings to the saddlebags the two highhead girls though had a night demon of a time making everything fit he thought about helping them but decided not to if they had to pay a penalty for making the supply donkeys carry some of their stuff it was their own fault they did get everything in though their saddlebags bulged like a snake that had just swallowed a halfgrown humpless camel a couple of other people stood around helplessly with full bags and gear left over smiling a smile he hoped was not too predatory radnal took them to the scales and collected a tenth of a unit of silver for every unit of excess weight this is an outrage the dark brown highhead man said do you know who i am i am moblay sopsirks son aide to the prince of lissonland he drew himself up to his full height almost a tarteshan cubit more than radnals then you can afford the four and three tenths radnal answered i dont keep the silver it all goes to upkeep for the park grumbling still moblay paid then he stomped off and swung aboard his animal with more grace than radnal had noticed him possessing down in lissonland the guide remembered important people sometimes rode stripehorses for show he didnt understand that he had no interest in getting onto a donkey when he wasnt going down into trench park as long as there were better ways of doing things why not use them also guilty of overweight baggage were a middleaged tarteshan couple they were overweight themselves too but radnal couldnt do anything about that eltsac vez martois protested the scale at home said we were all right if you read it right nocso zev martois said to her husband you probably didnt whose side are you on he snarled she screeched at him radnal waited till they ran down then collected the silver due the park when the tourists had remounted their donkeys the guide walked over to the gate on the far side of the corral swung it open and replaced the key in a pouch he wore belted round his waist under his robe as he went back to his own animal he said when you ride through there you enter the park itself and the waivers you signed come into play under tarteshan law park guides have the authority of military officers within the park i dont intend to exercise it any more than i have to we should get along just fine with simple common sense but i am required to remind you the authority is there he also kept a repeating handcannon in one of his donkeys saddlebags but didnt mention that please stay behind me and try to stay on the trail he said it wont be too steep today well camp tonight at what was the edge of the continental shelf tomorrow well descend to the bottom of the ancient sea as far below mean sea level as a mediumsized mountain is above it that will be more rugged terrain the strongbrow woman said it will be hot too much hotter than it is now i visited the park three or four years ago and it felt like a furnace be warned everyone youre right freelady ah radnal said im toglo zev pamdal she added hastily only a distant collateral relation i assure you as you say freelady radnal had trouble keeping his voice steady the hereditary tyrant of tartesh was bortav vez pamdal even his distant collateral relations needed to be treated with sandskink gloves radnal was glad toglo had had the courtesy to warn him who she wasor rather who her distant collateral relation was at least she didnt seem the sort who would snoop around and take bad reports on people back to the friends she undoubtedly had in high places although the country through which the donkeys ambled was below sea level it wasnt very far below it didnt seem much different from the land over which the tourists omnibus had traveled to reach the edge of trench park dry and scrubby with thornbushes and palm trees like longhandled feather dusters radnal let the terrain speak for itself though he did remark dig a couple of hundred cubits under the soil hereabouts and youll find a layer of salt same as you would anywhere in the bottomlands its not too thick here on the shelf because this area dried up quickly but its here thats one of the first clues geologists had that the bottomlands used to be a sea and one of the ways they map the boundaries of the ancient water moblay sopsirks son wiped his sweaty face with a forearm where radnal like any tarteshan covered up against the heat moblay wore only a hat shoes and a pocketed belt to carry silver perhaps a small knife or toothpick and whatever else he thought he couldnt do without he was dark enough that he didnt need to worry about skin cancer but he didnt look very comfortable either he said were some of that water back in the bottomlands radnal tartesh would have a better climate youre right radnal said he was resigned to foreigners using his familial name with uncouth familiarity wed be several hundredths cooler in summer and warmer in winter but if the barrier mountains fell again wed lose the great area that the bottomlands encompass and the mineral wealth we derive from them salt other chemicals left by evaporation and the petroleum reserves that wouldnt be accessible through deep water tarteshans have grown used to heat over the centuries we dont mind it i wouldnt go that far toglo said i dont think its an accident that tarteshan air coolers are sold all over the world radnal found himself nodding you have a point freelady what we get from the bottomlands though outweighs fuss over the weather as hed hoped they got to the campsite with the sun still in the sky and watched it sink behind the mountains to the west the tourists gratefully descended from their donkeys and stumped about complaining of how sore their thighs were radnal set them to carrying lumber from the metal racks that lined one side of the site he lit the cookfires with squirts from a squeeze bottle of starter fuel and a flintandsteel lighter the lazy mans way he admitted cheerfully as with his skill on a donkey that he could start a fire at all impressed the tourists he went back to the donkeys dug out ration packs which he tossed into the flames when their tops popped and began to vent steam he fished them out with a longhandled fork here we are he said peel off the foil and you have tarteshan food not a banquet fit for the gods perhaps but plenty to keep you from starving and meeting them before your time evillia read the inscription on the side of her pack these are military rations she said suspiciously several people groaned like any other tarteshan freeman radnal had done his required two years in the hereditary tyrants volunteer guard he came to the ration packs defense like i said theyll keep you from starving the packs mutton and barley stew with carrots onions and a heavy dose of ground pepper and garlic werent too bad the two martoisi inhaled theirs and asked for more im sorry radnal said the donkeys carry only so many if i give you another pack each someone will go hungry before we reach the lodge were hungry now nocso zev martois said thats right eltsac echoed they stared at each other perhaps surprised at agreeing im sorry radnal said again hed never had anyone ask for seconds before thinking that he glanced over to see how toglo zev pamdal was faring with such basic fare as his eyes flicked her way she crumpled her empty pack and got up to throw it in a refuse bin she had a lithe walk though he could tell little of the shape of her body because of her robes as young or even not so young men will he wandered into fantasy suppose he was dickering with her father over bride price instead of with markaf vez putun who acted as if his daughter wello shat silver and pissed petrol he had enough sense to recognize when he was being foolish which is more than the gods grant most toglos father undoubtedly could make a thousand better matches for her than a nonetoospecial biologist confrontation with brute fact didnt stop him from musing but did keep him from taking himself too seriously he smiled as he pulled sleepsacks out of one of the pack donkeys panniers the tourists took turns with a foot pump to inflate them with the weather so warm a good many tourists chose to lie on top of the sleepsacks rather than crawl into them some kept on the clothes theyd been wearing some had special sleep clothes and some didnt bother with clothes tartesh had a moderately strong nudity taboo not enough to give radnal the horrors at naked flesh but plenty to make him eye evillia and lofosa as they carelessly shed shirts and trousers they were young attractive and even wellmuscled for highheads they seemed more naked to him because their bodies were less hairy than those of strongbrows he was relieved his robe hid his full response to them speaking to the group he said get as much sleep as you can tonight dont stay up gabbing well be in the saddle most of the day tomorrow on worse terrain than we saw today youll do better if youre rested yes clanfather moblay sopsirks son said as a youngster might to the leader of his kith grouping but any youngster who sounded as sassy as moblay would get the back of his clanfathers hand across his mouth to remind him not to sound that way again but since radnal had spoken good sense most of the tourists did try to go to sleep they did not know the wilds but with the possible exception of the martoisi they were not fools few fools accumulated for an excursion to trench park as he usually did the first night with a new group radnal disregarded his own advice he was good at going without sleep and being familiar with what lay ahead would waste no energy on the trip down to the trench itself an owl hooted from a hole in a palm trunk the air smelled faintly spicy sage and lavender oleander laurel thyme many local plants had leaves that secreted aromatic oils their coatings reduced water loss always of vital importance here and made the leaves unpalatable to insects and animals the fading campfires drew moths every so often their glow would briefly light up other larger shapes bats and nightjars swooping down to take advantage of the feast set out before them the tourists took no notice of insects or predators their snores rang louder than the owls cries after a few trips as tour guide radnal was convinced practically everyone snored he supposed he did too though hed never heard himself do it he yawned lay back on his own sleepsack with hands clasped behind his head looked up at the stars displayed as if on black velvet there were so many more of them here than in the lights of the big city yet another reason to work in trench park he watched them slowly whirl overhead hed never found a better way to empty his mind and drift toward sleep his eyelids were getting heavy when someone rose from his no her sleepsack evillia on her way to the privy shed behind some bushes his eyes opened wider in the dim firelight she looked like a moving statue of polished bronze as soon as her back was to him he ran his tongue over his lips but instead of getting back into her sack when she returned evillia squatted by lofosas both highhead girls laughed softly a moment later they both climbed to their feet and headed radnals way lust turned to alarm what were they doing they knelt down one on either side of him lofosa whispered we think youre a fine chunk of man evillia set a hand on the tie of his robe began to undo it both of you he blurted lust was back impossible to disguise since he lay on his back incredulity came with it tarteshan women even tarteshan tarts werent so brazen he thought how evillia had reminded him of smoothly moving bronze nor were tarteshan men not that tarteshan men didnt enjoy lewd imaginings but they usually kept quiet about them the highhead girls shook with more quiet laughter as if his reserve were the funniest thing imaginable why not evillia said three can do lots of interesting things two cant but radnal waved to the rest of the tour group what if they wake up the girls laughed harder their flesh shifted more alluringly lofosa answered theyll learn something radnal learned quite a few things one was that being on the far side of thirty his nights of keeping more than one woman happy were behind him though he enjoyed trying another was that what with sensual distractions trying to make two women happy at once was harder than patting his head with one hand and rubbing his stomach with the other still another was that neither lofosa nor evillia carried an inhibition anywhere about her person he felt himself flagging knew hed be limp in more ways than one come morning shall we have mercy on him evillia asked in tarteshan so he could understand her teasing i suppose so lofosa said this time she twisted like a snake brushed her lips against radnals sleep well freeman she and evillia went back to their sleepsacks leaving him to wonder if hed dreamed they were with him but too worn to believe it this time his drift toward sleep was more like a dive but before he yielded he saw toglo zev pamdal come back from the privy for a moment that meant nothing but if she was coming back now she must have gone before when he was too occupied to notice which meant she must have seen him so occupied he hissed like an ocellated lizard though green wasnt the color he was turning toglo got back into her sleepsack without looking either at him or the two highhead girls whatever fantasies hed had about her shriveled the best he could hope for come morning was the cool politeness someone of prominence gives an underling of imperfect manners the worst what if she starts screaming to the group he wondered he supposed he could grit his teeth and carry on but what if she complains about me to the hereditary tyrant he didnt like the answers he came up with ill lose my job was the first that sprang to mind and they went downhill from there he wondered why moblay sopsirks son couldnt have got up to empty his bladder moblay would have been envious and admiring not disgusted as toglo surely was radnal hissed again since he couldnt do anything about what hed already done he tried telling himself he would have to muddle along and deal with whatever sprang from it he repeated that to himself several times it didnt keep him from staying awake most of the night no matter how tired he was the sun woke the tour guide he heard some of the group already up and stirring though still sandyeyed and clumsy with sleep he made himself scramble out of his sack hed intended to get moving first as he usually did but the previous nights exertion and worry overcame the best of intentions to cover what he saw as a failing he tried to move twice as fast as usual which meant he kept making small annoying mistakes tripping over a stone and almost falling calling the privy the campfire and the campfire the privy going to a donkey that carried only fodder when he wanted breakfast packs he finally found the smoked sausages and hard bread evillia and lofosa grinned when they took out the sausages which flustered him worse eltsac vez martois stole a roll from his wife who cursed him with a dockwallopers fluency and more than a dockwallopers volume then radnal had to give breakfast to toglo zev pamdal thank you freeman she said more at ease than hed dared hope then her gray eyes met his i trust you slept well it was a conventional tarteshan morning greeting or would have been if she hadnt sounded no radnal decided she couldnt have sounded amused er yes he managed and fled he knew only relief at handing the next breakfast to a strongbrow who put away a sketch pad and charcoal to take it thank you the fellow said though he seemed polite enough his guttural accent and the striped tunic and trousers he wore proclaimed him a native of morgaf the island kingdom off the northern coast of tartesh and the tyrannys frequent foe their current twentyyear bout of peace was as long as theyd enjoyed in centuries normally radnal would have been cautious around a morgaffo but now he found him easier to confront than toglo glancing at the sketch pad he said thats a fine drawing freeman ah the morgaffo held out both hands in front of him in his peoples greeting i am dokhnor of kellef freeman vez krobir he said thank you for your interest he made it sound like stop spying on me radnal hadnt meant it that way with a few deft strokes of his charcoal stick dokhnor had picked out the features of the campsite the fire pits the oleanders in front of the privy the tethered donkeys as a biologist who did field work radnal was a fair hand with a piece of charcoal he wasnt in dokhnors class though a military engineer couldnt have done better that thought triggered his suspicions he looked at the morgaffo more closely the fellow carried himself as a soldier would which proved nothing lots of morgaffos were soldiers although far smaller than tartesh the island kingdom had always held its own in their struggles radnal laughed at himself if dokhnor was an agent why was he in trench park instead of say at a naval base along the western ocean the morgaffo glowered if you have finished examining my work freeman perhaps you will give someone else a breakfast certainly radnal answered in a voice as icy as he could make it dokhnor certainly had the proverbial morgaffo arrogance maybe that proved he wasnt a spy a real spy would have been smoother or maybe a real spy would think no one would expect him to act like a spy and act like one as a disguise radnal realized he could extend the chain to as many links as his imagination could forge he gave up when all the breakfast packs were eaten all the sleepsacks deflated and stowed the group headed over to remount their donkeys for the trip into trench park itself as he had the night before radnal warned the trail will be much steeper today as long as we take it slow and careful well be fine no sooner were the words out of his mouth than the ground quivered beneath his feet everyone stood stock still a couple of people exclaimed in dismay the birds on the other hand all fell silent radnal had lived in earthquake country his whole life he waited for the shaking to stop and after a few heartbeats it did nothing to get alarmed at he said when the quake was over this part of tartesh is seismically active probably because of the inland sea that dried up so long ago the crust of the earth is still adjusting to the weight of so much water being gone there are a lot of fault lines in the area some quite close to the surface dokhnor of kellef stuck up a hand what if an earthquake should how do you say it make the barrier mountains fall then the bottomlands would flood radnal laughed freeman if it hasnt happened in the last five and a half million years i wont lose sleep worrying that itll happen tomorrow or any time im down in trench park the morgaffo nodded curtly that is a worthy answer carry on freeman radnal had an impulse to salute him he spoke with the same automatic assumption of authority that tarteshan officers employed the tour guide mounted his own donkey waited until his charges were in ragged line behind him he waved lets go the trail down into trench park was hacked and blasted from rock that had been on the bottom of the sea it was only six or eight cubits wide and frequently switched back and forth a motor with power to all wheels might have negotiated it but radnal wouldnt have wanted to be at the tiller of one that tried his donkey pulled up a gladiolus and munched it that made him think of something about which hed forgotten to warn his group he said when we get lower into the park youll want to keep your animals from browsing the soil down there has large amounts of things like selenium and tellurium along with the more usual minerals they were concentrated there as the sea evaporated that doesnt bother a lot of the bottomlands plants but it will bother and maybe kill your donkeys if they eat the wrong ones how will we know which ones are which eltsac zev martois called he fought the urge to throw eltsac off the trail and let him tumble down into trench park the idiot tourist would probably land on his head which by all evidence was too hard to be damaged by a fall of a mere few thousand cubits and radnals job was riding herd on idiot tourists he answered dont let your donkey forage at all the pack donkeys carry fodder and therell be more at the lodge the tour group rode on in silence for a while then toglo zev pamdal said this trail reminds me of the one down into the big canyon through the western desert in the empire of stekia over on the double continent radnal was both glad toglo would speak to him and jealous of the wealth that let her travel just a collateral relation of the hereditary tyrants eh ive only seen pictures he said wistfully i suppose there is some similarity of looks but the canyon was formed differently from the bottomlands by erosion not evaporation of course she said ive also only seen pictures myself oh maybe she was a distant relative then he went on much more like the big canyon are the gorges our rivers cut before they tumble into what was deep seabottom to form the bitter lakes in the deepest parts of the bottomlands theres a small one in trench park though it often dries up the dalorz river doesnt send down enough water to maintain it very well a little later when the trail twisted west around a big limestone boulder several tourists exclaimed over the misty plume of water plunging toward the floor of the park lofosa asked is that the dalorz thats it radnal said its flow is too erratic to make it worth tarteshs while to build a power station where it falls off the ancient continental shelf though weve done that with several other bigger rivers they supply more than three fourths of our electricity another benefit of the bottomlands a few small spunsugar clouds drifted across the sky from west to east otherwise nothing blocked the sun from beating down on the tourists with greater force every cubit they descended the donkeys kicked up dust at every footfall does it ever rain here evillia asked not very often radnal admitted the bottomlands desert is one mountains pick off most of the moisture that blows from the western ocean and the other mountain ranges that stretch into the bottomlands from the north catch most of whats left but every two or three years trench park does get a downpour its the most dangerous time to be there a torrent can tear through a wash and drown you before you know its coming but its also the most beautiful time toglo zev pamdal said pictures of trench park after a rain first made me want to come here and i was lucky enough to see it myself on my last visit may i be so fortunate dokhnor of kellef said i brought colorsticks as well as charcoal on the off chance i might be able to draw postrain foliage the odds are against you though the freelady was lucky before radnal said dokhnor spread his hands to show his agreement like everything he did the gesture was tight restrained perfectly controlled radnal had trouble imagining him going into transports of artistic rapture over desert flowers no matter how rare or brilliant he said the flowers are beautiful but theyre only the tip of the iceberg if youll let me use a wildly inappropriate comparison all life in trench park depends on water the same as everywhere else its adapted to get along with very little but not none as soon as any moisture comes plants and animals try to pack a generations worth of growth and breeding into the little while it takes to dry up about a quarter of a daytenth later a sign set by the side of the trail announced that the tourists were farther below sea level than they could go anywhere outside the bottomlands radnal read it aloud and pointed out rather smugly that the salt lake which was the next most submerged spot on dry land lay close to the bottomlands and might almost be considered an extension of them moblay sopsirks son said i didnt imagine anyone would be so proud of this wasteland as to want to include more of the great continent in it his brown skin kept him from roasting under the desert sun but sweat sheened his bare arms and torso a little more than halfway down the trail a wide flat rest area was carved out of the rock radnal let the tourists halt for a while stretch their legs and ease their weary hindquarters and use the odorous privy he passed out ration packs ignored his charges grumbles he noticed dokhnor of kellef ate his meal without complaint he tossed his own pack into the bin by the privy then a couple of cubits from the edge of the trail peered down onto the floor of the bottomlands after one of the rare rains the park was spectacular from here now it just baked white salt pans gray brown or yellow brown dirt a scattering of faded green vegetation not even the area around the lodge was watered artificially the tyrants charter ordained that trench park be kept pristine as they came off the trail and started along the ancient sea bottom toward the lodge evillia said i thought it would be as if we were in the bottom of a bowl with mountains all around us it doesnt really feel that way i can see the ones we just came down and the barrier mountains to the west but theres nothing to the east and hardly anything to the south just a blur on the horizon i expected it would look like a bowl too the first time i came here radnal said we are in the bottom of a bowl but it doesnt look that way because the bottomlands are broad compared to their depth its a big shallow bowl what makes it interesting is that its top is at the same level as the bottom of most other geological bowls and its bottom deeper than any of them what are those cracks toglo zev pamdal asked pointing down to breaks in the soil that ran across the tour groups path some were no wider than a barleycorn others like open lidless mouths had gaps of a couple of digits between their sides in arid terrain like this youll see all kinds of cracks in the ground from mud drying unevenly after a rain radnal said but the ones youve noticed do mark a fault line the earthquake we felt earlier probably was triggered along this fault it marks where two plates in the earths crust are colliding nocso zev martois let out a frightened squeak do you mean that if we have another earthquake those cracks will open and swallow us down she twitched her donkeys reins as if to speed it up and get as far away from the fault line as she could radnal didnt laugh the tyranny paid him for not laughing at tourists he answered gravely if you worry about something that unlikely you might as well worry about getting hit by a skystone too the one has about as much chance of happening as the other are you sure lofosa sounded anxious too im sure he tried to figure out where she and evillia were from probably the krepalgan unity by their accent krepalga was the northwesternmost highhead nation its western border lay at the eastern edge of the bottomlands more to the point it was earthquake country too if this was all lofosa knew about quakes it didnt say much for her brains and if lofosa didnt have a lot of brains what did that say about her and evillia picking radnal to amuse themselves with no one cares to think of a sexual partners judgment as faulty for that reflects upon him radnal did what any sensible man might have done he changed the subject well be at the lodge soon so youll want to think about getting your things out of your bags and into your sleep cubicles what i want to think about is getting clean moblay sopsirks son contradicted youll each be issued a small bucket of water every day for personal purposes he said and overrode a chorus of groans dont complain our brochures are specific about this almost all the fresh water in trench park comes down the trail we rode on the backs of these donkeys think how much youll relish a hot soak when we come out of the park think how much well need a hot soak when we come out of the park said the elderly strongbrow man radnal had tagged as someone spending the silver hed made in his earlier years to his embarrassment hed forgotten the fellows name its not so bad for these highheads here since their bodies are mostly bare but all my hair will be a greasy mess by the time this excursion is done he glared at radnal as if it were his fault toglo zev pamdal said dont fret freeman vez maprab benter vez maprab thats who he was radnal thought shooting toglo a grateful glance she was still talking to the old strongbrow i have a jar of waterless hair cleaner you can just comb out its more than id need ill share some with you well thats kind of you benter vez maprab said mollified maybe i should have brought some myself you certainly should you old fool instead of complaining radnal thought he also noted that toglo had figured out what shed need before she started her trip he approved he would have done the same had he been tourist rather than guide of course if hed arranged to forget his own waterless hair cleaner he could have borrowed some from her he exhaled through his nose maybe hed been too practical for his own good something small and duncolored darted under his donkeys hooves then bounced away toward a patch of oleander what was that several people asked as it vanished among the fallen leaves under the plants its one of the species of jerboa that live down here radnal answered without more than two heartbeats look i couldnt tell you which there are many varieties all through the bottomlands they lived in arid country while the inland sea still existed and evolved to get the moisture they need from their food that preadapted them to succeed here where free water is so scarce are they dangerous nocso zev martois asked only if youre a shrub radnal said no actually thats not quite true some eat insects and one species the bladetooth hunts and kills its smaller relatives it filled the small predator niche before carnivores proper established themselves in the bottomlands its scarce today especially outside trench park but it is still around often in the hottest driest places where no other meat eaters can thrive a little later the tour guide pointed to a small nondescript plant with thin greenishbrown leaves anyone tell me what that is he asked that question whenever he took a group along the trail and had only got a right answer once just after a rain but now benter vez maprab said confidently its a bottomlands orchid freeman vez krobir and a common type at that if youd shown us a redveined one that would have been worth fussing over youre right freeman it is an orchid it doesnt look much like the ones you see in more hospitable climates though does it radnal said smiling at the elderly strongbrow if he was an orchid fancier that probably explained why hed come to trench park benter only grunted and scowled in reply evidently hed had his heart set on seeing a rare red veined orchid his first day at the park radnal resolved to search his bags at the end of the tour carrying specimens out of the park was against the law a jerboa hopped up started nibbling on an orchid leaf quick as a flash something darted out from behind the plant seized the rodent and ran away the tourists bombarded radnal with questions did you see that what was it whered it go that was a koprit bird he answered fast wasnt it its of the butcherbird family but mostly adapted to life on the ground it can fly but it usually runs because birds excrete urea in more or less solid form not in urine like mammals theyve done well in the bottomlands he pointed to the lodge which was only a few hundred cubits ahead now see theres another koprit bird on the roof looking around to see what it can catch a couple of park attendants came out of the lodge they waved to radnal sized up the tourists then helped them stable their donkeys take only what youll need tonight into the lodge said one fer vez canthal leave the rest in your saddlebags for the trip out tomorrow the less packing and unpacking the better some tourists veteran travelers nodded at the good advice evillia and lofosa exclaimed as if theyd never heard it before frowning at their naivetй radnal wanted to look away from them but they were too pretty moblay sopsirks son thought so too as the group started from the stable to the lodge he came up behind evillia and slipped an arm around her waist at the same moment he must have tripped for his startled cry made radnal whirl toward them moblay sprawled on the dirt floor of the stable evillia staggered flailed her arms wildly and fell down on top of him hard he shouted again a shout which lost all its breath as she somehow hit him in the pit of the stomach with an elbow while getting back to her feet she looked down at him the picture of concern im so sorry she said you startled me moblay needed a while before he could sit let alone stand at last he wheezed see if i ever touch you again in a tone that implied it would be her loss she stuck her nose in the air radnal said we should remember we come from different countries and have different customs being slow and careful will keep us from embarrassing one another why freeman were you embarrassed last night lofosa asked instead of answering radnal started to cough lofosa and evillia laughed despite what fer vez canthal had said both of them were just toting their saddlebags into the lodge maybe they hadnt a lot of brains but their bodies those smooth oh so naked bodies were something else again the lodge was not luxurious but boasted mesh screens to keep out the bottomlands bugs electric lights and fans which stirred the desert air even if they did not cool it it also had a refrigerator no ration packs tonight radnal said the tourists cheered the cooking pit was outdoors the lodge was warm enough without a fire inside fer vez canthal and the other attendant zosel vez glesir filled it with chunks of charcoal splashed light oil over them and fired them then they put a disjointed lamb carcass on a grill and hung it over the pit every so often one of them basted it with a sauce full of pepper and garlic the sauce and melting fat dripped onto the coals they sputtered and hissed and sent up little clouds of fragrant smoke spit streamed in radnals mouth the refrigerator also held mead date wine grape wine and ale some of the tourists drank boisterously dokhnor of kellef surprised radnal by taking only chilled water i am sworn to the goddess he explained not my affair radnal answered but his sleeping suspicions woke the goddess was the deity the morgaffo military aristocracy most commonly followed maybe a traveling artist was among her worshipers but radnal did not find it likely he did not get much time to dwell on the problem dokhnor presented zosel vez glesir called him over to do the honors on the lamb he used a big pair of eating sticks to pick up each piece of meat and transfer it to a paper plate the martoisi ate like starving cave cats radnal felt guilty maybe ordinary rations werent enough for them then he looked at how abundant flesh stretched the fabric of their robes guilt evaporated they werent wasting away evillia and lofosa had poured down several mugs of date wine that soon caused them difficulties krepalgans usually ate with knife and skewer they had trouble manipulating their disposable pairs of wooden eating sticks after cutting her meat into bitesized chunks lofosa chased them around her plate but couldnt pick them up evillia managed that but dropped them on the way to her mouth they both seemed cheerful drunks and laughed at their mishaps even stiffnecked dokhnor unbent far enough to try to show them how to use sticks his lesson did not do much good though both highhead girls moved close enough to him to make radnal jealous evillia said youre so deft morgaffos must use them every day dokhnor tossed his head in his peoples negative our usual tool has prongs bowl and a sharp edge all in one the tarteshans say we are a quiet folk because we risk cutting our tongues whenever we open our mouths but i have traveled in tartesh and learned what to do with sticks let me try again evillia said this time she dropped the piece of lamb on dokhnors thigh she picked it up with her fingers after her hand lingered on the morgaffos leg long enough to give radnal another pang she popped the gobbet into her mouth moblay sopsirks son began singing in his own language radnal did not understand most of the words but the tune was wild and free and easy to follow soon the whole tour group was clapping time more songs followed fer vez canthal had a ringing baritone everyone in the group spoke tarteshan but not everyone knew tarteshs songs well enough to join in as they had for moblay those who could not sing clapped when darkness fell gnats emerged in stinging clouds radnal and the group retreated to the lodge whose screens held the biters away now i know why you wear so many clothes moblay said theyre armor against insects the dark brown highhead looked as if he didnt know where to scratch first of course radnal said surprised moblay had taken so long to see the obvious if youll hold still for a couple of heartbeats we have a spray to take away the itch moblay sighed as radnal sprayed painkiller onto him anyone want another song he called this time he got little response being under a roof inhibited some people it reminded others of their long day toglo zev pamdal was not the only tourist to wander off to a sleeping cubicle dokhnor of kellef and old benter vez maprab had discovered a war board and were deep in a game moblay went over to watch so did radnal who fancied himself a war player dokhnor who had the blue pieces advanced a footsoldier over the blank central band that separated his side of the board from his opponents across the river moblay said is that what lissonese name the gap radnal said with us its the trench and in morgaf its the sleeve after the channel that separates our islands from tartesh dokhnor said no matter what we call it though the games the same all over the world its a game that calls for thought and quiet benter said pointedly after some thought he moved a counselor that was the name of the piece on the red side of board its blue equivalent was an elephant two squares diagonally the old tarteshans pauses for concentration grew more frequent as the game went on dokhnors attack had the red governor scurrying along the vertical and horizontal lines of his fortress and his guards along the diagonals to evade or block the blue pieces finally dokhnor brought one of his cannons in line with the other and said thats the end benter glumly nodded the cannon the red piece of identical value was called a catapult was hard to play well it moved vertically and horizontally but had to jump over one other piece every time thus the rear cannon not the front threatened the red governor but if benter interposed a guard or one of his chariots that turned the forward cannon into the threat nicely played benter said he got up from the war table headed for a cubicle care for a game either of you dokhnor asked the spectators moblay sopsirks son shook his head radnal said i did till i saw you play i dont mind facing someone better than i am if i have some chance even when i lose i learn something but youd just trounce me and a little of that goes a long way as you will dokhnor folded the war board poured the disks into their bag he replaced bag and board on their shelf im for bed then he marched off to the cubicle hed chosen radnal and moblay glanced at each other then toward the war set by unspoken consent they seemed to decide that if neither of them wanted a go at dokhnor of kellef playing each other would be rude another night radnal said fair enough moblay yawned displaying teeth that gleamed all the whiter against his brown skin he said im about done over no its done in in tarteshan isnt it anyhow see you in the morning radnal again the tour guide controlled his annoyance at moblays failure to use the polite particle vez at first when foreigners forgot that trick of tarteshan grammar hed imagined himself deliberately insulted now he knew better though he still noticed the omission a small light came on in dokhnors cubicle a batterypowered reading lamp the morgaffo wasnt reading though he sat with his behind on the sleeping mat and his back against the wall his sketch pad lay on his bent knees radnal heard the faint skritchskritch of charcoal on paper whats he doing fer vez canthal whispered a generations peace was not enough time to teach most tarteshans to trust their island neighbors hes drawing radnal answered as quietly neither of them wanted to get dokhnors attention the reply could have come out sounding innocent it didnt radnal went on his travel documents say hes an artist again tone spoke volumes zosel vez glesir said if he really were a spy radnal vez hed carry a camera not a sketch pad everyone carries a camera into trench park he wouldnt even get noticed true radnal said but he doesnt act like an artist he acts like a member of the morgaffo officer caste you heard him hes sworn to their goddess fer vez canthal said something lewd about the morgaffo goddess but he lowered his voice even further before he did an officer from morgaf who heard his deity offended might make formal challenge then again in tartesh where dueling was illegal he might simply commit murder the only thing certain was that he wouldnt ignore the insult we cant do anything to him or even about him unless we find out he is spying zosel vez glesir said yes radnal said the last thing tartesh wants is to hand morgaf an incident he thought about what would happen to someone who fouled up so gloriously nothing good that was sure then something else occurred to him speaking of the tyrant do you know whos in this group freelady toglo zev pamdal thats who zosel and fer whistled softly good thing you warned us zosel said well stay round her like cotton round cut glass i dont think she cares for that sort of thing radnal said treat her well yes but dont fall all over yourselves zosel nodded fer still had dokhnor of kellef on his mind if he is a spy whats he doing in trench park instead of somewhere important i thought of that myself radnal said cover maybe and who knows where hes going after he leaves i know where im going zosel said yawning to bed if you want to stay up all night fretting about spies go ahead no thanks fer answered a spy would have to be crazy or on holiday to come to trench park if hes crazy we dont have to worry about him and if hes on holiday we dont have to worry about him then either so im going to bed too if you think ill stay talking to myself youre both crazy radnal said all three tarteshans got up dokhnor of kellefs reading lamp went out plunging his cubicle into blackness radnal dimmed the lights in the common room he flopped down onto his sleeping mat with a long sigh he would sooner have been out in the field curled up in a sleepsack under gnat netting this was the price he paid for doing what he wanted most of the time he knew his own snores would soon join the tourists then two female shapes appeared in the entrance to his cubicle by the gods not again he thought as his eyes opened wide which showed how tired he was he said dont you believe in sleep evillia laughed softly or maybe lofosa not when there are better things to do lofosa said we have some new ideas too but we can always see who else is awake radnal almost told her to go ahead and take evillia with her but he heard himself say no instead the night before had been educational beyond his dreams the stuff people imagined when they talked about the fringe benefits of a tour guides job until last night hed reckoned those stories imaginary in his two years as a guide hed never cavorted with a tourist before now he grinned as he felt himself rising to the occasion the highhead girls came in as theyd promised the threesome tried some new things he wondered how long their inventiveness could last and if he could last as long he was sure hed enjoy trying his stamina and the girls ingenuity flagged together he remembered them getting up from the mat he thought he remembered them going out into the common room he was sure he didnt remember anything after that he slept like a log from a petrified forest when the scream jarred him awake his first muzzy thought was that only a few heartbeats had passed but a glance at his pocket clock as he closed his robe told him sunrise was near he dashed out into the common room several tourists were already out there some dressed some not more emerged every moment as did the other two trench park staffers everyone kept saying whats going on though no one directly answered the question no one needed to as naked as when shed frolicked with radnal evillia stood by the table where benter vez maprab and dokhnor of kellef had played war dokhnor was there too but not standing he lay sprawled on the floor head twisted at an unnatural angle evillia had jammed a fist in her mouth to stifle another scream she took it out quavered is is he dead radnal strode over to dokhnor grabbed his wrist felt for a pulse he found none nor was the morgaffo breathing hes dead all right radnal said grimly evillia moaned her knees buckled she toppled onto radnals bent back when evillia fainted lofosa screamed and ran forward to try to help nocso zev martois screamed too even louder moblay sopsirks son hurried toward radnal and evillia so did fer vez canthal and zosel vez glesir so did toglo zev pamdal so did another tourist a highhead whod spoken very little on the way down to the lodge everyone got in everyone elses way then the quiet highhead stopped being quiet and shouted i am a physician the six million gods curse you let me through let the physician through radnal echoed sliding evillia off him and to the ground as gently as he could check her first freeman golobol he added pleased hed hung onto the doctors name im afraid youre too late to help dokhnor now golobol was almost as dark as moblay but spoke tarteshan with a different accent as he turned to evillia she moaned and stirred she will be all right oh yes i am sure he said but this poor fellow as radnal had he felt for dokhnors pulse as radnal had he failed to find it you are correct sir this man is dead he has been dead for some time how do you know radnal asked you felt of him not the physician said surely you noticed his flesh has begun to cool it has oh yes thinking back radnal had noticed but hed paid no special attention hed always prided himself on how well hed learned firstaid training but he wasnt a physician and didnt automatically take everything into account as a physician would his fit of chagrin was interrupted when evillia let out a shriek a hunting cave cat would have been proud of lofosa bent by her spoke to her in her own language the shriek cut off radnal started thinking about what to do next golobol said sir look here if you would golobol was pointing to a spot on the back of dokhnors neck right above where it bent gruesomely radnal had to say i dont see anything you strongbrows are a hairy folk that is why golobol said here though see this ah discoloration is that the word in your language it is good yes this discoloration is the sort of mark to be expected from a blow by the side of the hand a killing blow despite bottomlands heat ice formed in the pit of radnals stomach youre telling me this was murder the word cut through the babble filling the common room like a scalpel there was chaos one heartbeat silence the next into that abrupt intense silence golobol said yes oh by the gods what a mess fer vez canthal said figuring out what to do next became a lot more urgent for radnal why had the gods though he didnt believe in six million of them let someone from his tour group get murdered and why by all the gods he did believe in did it have to be the morgaffo morgaf would be suspicious if not hostile if any of its people met foul play in tartesh and if dokhnor of kellef really was a spy morgaf would be more than suspicious morgaf would be furious radnal walked over to the radiophone whom will you call fer asked first the park militia theyd have to be notified in any case and then radnal took a deep breath then i think id best call the hereditary tyrants eyes and ears in tarteshem murder of a morgaffo sworn to the goddess is a deeper matter than the militia can handle alone besides id sooner have an eye and ear notify the morgaffo plenipo than try doing it myself yes i can see that fer said wouldnt want morgaffo gunboats running across the sleeve to raid our coasts because you said something wrong or the lodge attendant shook his head no not even the island king would be crazy enough to start tossing starbombs over something this small fers voice turned anxious would he i dont think so but radnal sounded anxious too politics hadnt been the same since starbombs came along fifty years before neither tartesh nor morgaf had used them even in war against each other but both countries kept building them so did eight or ten other nations scattered across the globe if another big war started it could easily become the big war the one everybody was afraid of radnal punched buttons on the radiophone after a couple of static bursts a voice answered trench park militia subleader vez steries speaking gods bless you liem vez radnal said this was a man he knew and liked vez krobir here over at the tourist lodge im sorry to have to tell you weve had a death im even sorrier to have to tell you it looks like murder radnal explained what had happened to dokhnor of kellef liem vez steries said why couldnt it have been anyone else but the morgaffo now youll have to drag in the eyes and ears and the gods only know how much hoorah will erupt my next call was to tarteshem radnal agreed it probably should have been your first one but never mind liem vez steries said ill be over there with a circumstances man as fast as i can get a helo in the air farewell farewell radnals next call had to go through a human relayer after a couple of hundred heartbeats he found himself talking with an eye and ear named peggol vez menk unlike the park militiaman peggol kept interrupting with questions so the conversation took twice as long as the other one had when radnal was through the eye and ear said you did right to involve us freeman vez krobir well handle the diplomatic aspects and well fly a team down there to help with the investigation dont let anyone leave the lodge did you call it farewell the radiophone had a speaking diaphragm in the console not the more common and more private earandmouth handset everyone heard what peggol vez menk said nobody liked it evillia said did he mean were going to have to stay cooped up here with a murderer she started trembling lofosa put an arm around her benter vez maprab had a different objection see here freeman i put down good silver for a tour of trench park and i intend to have that tour if not i shall take legal measures radnal stifled a groan tarteshan law which relied heavily on the principle of trust came down hard on those who violated contracts in any way if the old strongbrow went to court hed likely collect enormous damages from trench park and from radnal as the individual who failed to deliver the service contracted for worse the martoisi joined the outcry a reasonably upright and upstanding man radnal had never had to hire a pleader in his life he wondered if he had enough silver to pay for a good one then he wondered if hed ever have any silver again once the tourists the courts and the pleader were through with him toglo zev pamdal cut through the hubbub lets wait a few heartbeats a man is dead thats more important than everything else if the start of our tour is delayed perhaps trench park will regain equity by delaying its end to give us the full touring time weve paid for thats an excellent suggestion freelady zev pamdal radnal said gratefully fer and zosel nodded a distant thutter in the sky grew to a roar the militia helo kicked up a small dust storm as it set down between the stables and the lodge flying pebbles clicked off walls and windows the motor shut down as the blades slowed dust subsided radnal felt as if a good god had frightened a night demon from his shoulders i dont think well need to extend your time here by more than a day he said happily how will you manage that if were confined here in this godsforsaken wilderness eltsac vez martois growled thats just it radnal said we are in a wilderness suppose we go out and see what there is to see in trench park where will the culprit flee on donkeyback if he tries to get away well know who he is because hell be the only one missing and well track him down with the helo the tour guide beamed the tourists beamed back including radnal reminded himself the killer among them liem vez steries and two other park militiamen walked into the lodge they wore soldierly versions of radnals costume their robes instead of being white were splotched in shades of tan and light green as were their longbrimmed caps their rank badges were dull even the metal buckles of their sandals were painted to avoid reflections liem set a recorder on the table dokhnor and benter vez maprab had used for war the night before the circumstances man started taking pictures with as much abandon as if hed been a tourist he asked has the body been moved only as much as we needed to make sure the man was dead radnal answered we the circumstances man asked radnal introduced golobol liem got everyones statement on the wire first evillia who gulped and blinked back tears as she spoke then radnal then the physician and then the other tourists and lodge attendants most of them echoed one another theyd heard a scream run out and seen evillia standing over dokhnors corpse golobol added the woman cannot be responsible for his death he had been deceased some while between one and two daytenths possibly she unfortunate one merely discovered the body i understand freeman liem vez steries assured him but because she did her account of what happened is important the militiaman had just finished recording the last statement when another helo landed outside the lodge the instant its dust storm subsided four men came in the hereditary tyrants eyes and ears looked more like prosperous merchants than soldiers their caps had patent leather brims they closed their robes with silver chains and they sported rings on each index finger i am peggol vez menk one of them announced he was short and by tarteshan standards slim he wore his cap at a dapper angle his eyes were extraordinarily shrewd as if he were waiting for someone around him to make a mistake he spotted liem vez steries at once and asked whats been done thus far subleader what youd expect the militiaman answered statements from all present and our circumstances man senior trooper vez sofana there has taken some pictures we didnt disturb the body fair enough the eye and ear said one of his men was flashing more photos another set a recorder beside the one already on the table well get a copy of your wire and well make one for ourselves maybe well find questions you missed you havent searched belongings yet no freeman liem vez steries voice went wooden radnal wouldnt have wanted someone to steal and duplicate his work either eyes and ears though did as they pleased why not they watched tartesh but who watched them well take care of it peggol vez menk sat down at the table the photographer stuck in a fresh clip of film then followed the two remaining eyes and ears into the sleeping cubicle nearest the entrance it was golobols be careful oh please i beg you the physician exclaimed some of my equipment is delicate peggol said ill hear the tale of the woman who discovered the body he pulled out a notepad glanced at it evillia a little calmer now evillia retold her story using so far as radnal could tell the same words she had before if peggol found any new questions he didnt ask them after about a tenth of a daytenth it was radnals turn peggol did remember his name without needing to remind himself again his questions were like the ones liem vez steries had used when he asked the last one radnal had a question of his own freeman while the investigation continues may i take my group out into the bottomlands he explained how benter vez maprab had threatened to sue and why he thought even a guilty tourist unlikely to escape the eye and ear pulled at his lower lip he let the hair beneath it grow out in a tuft which made him seem to have a protruding chin like a highheads when he released the lip it went back with a liquid plop under his tilted cap he looked wise and cynical radnals hopes plunged he waited for peggol to laugh at him for raising the matter peggol said freeman i know you technically enjoy military rank but suppose you discover who the killer is or he strikes again do you reckon yourself up to catching him and bringing him back for trial and decapitation i radnal stopped before he went any further the ironic question reminded him this wasnt a game dokhnor of kellef might have been a spy he was dead now and whoever had killed him might kill again might kill me if i find out who he is he thought he said i dont know id like to think so but ive never had to do that sort of thing something like approval came into peggol vez menks eyes youre honest with yourself not everyone can say that hmm it wouldnt be just your silver involved in a suit would it no of course not it would be trench parks too which means the hereditary tyrants just what i was thinking radnal said with luck patriotically his own silver came first with him he was honest enough with himself to be sure of that but he didnt have to tell it to peggol im sure you were the eye and ear said his tone dry the tyrants silver really does come first with me hows this then suppose you take the tourists out as youve contracted to do but suppose i come with you to investigate while my comrades keep working here does that seem reasonable yes freeman thank you radnal exclaimed good peggol said my concubine has been nagging me to bring her here now ill see if i want to do that he grinned knowingly you see i also keep my own interests in mind the other eyes and ears had methodically gone from one sleeping cubicle to the next examining the tourists belongings one of them brought a codex out of lofosas cubicle dropped it on the table in front of peggol vez menk the cover was a color photo of two goodlooking highheads fornicating peggol flipped through it variations on the same theme filled every page amusing he said even if it should have been seized when its owner entered our domains i like that lofosa sounded indignant you sanctimonious strongbrows pretending you dont do the same things and enjoy them too i ought to know radnal hoped peggol would not ask how she knew he was certain she would tell him in detail she and evillia might have been many things but not shy but peggol said we did not come here to search for filth she might have worn out dokhnor with that volume but she didnt kill him with it let her keep it if she enjoys telling the world what should be kept private oh rubbish lofosa scooped up the codex and carried it back to her cubicle rolling her hips at every step as if to contradict peggol without another word the eyes and ears brought out nothing more from her sleep cubicle or evillias for their chief to inspect that surprised radnal the two women had carried in everything but the donkey theyd ridden he shrugged theyd probably filled their saddlebags with feminine fripperies and junk that could have stayed behind in their tarteshan hostel if not in krepalga then he stopped thinking about them the eye and ear whod gone into dokhnors cubicle whistled peggol vez menk dashed in there he came out with his fist tightly closed around something he opened it radnal saw two sixpointed gold stars morgaffo rank badges so he was a spy fer vez canthal exclaimed he may have been peggol said but when he got on the radiophone to tarteshem he found dokhnor of kellef had declared his battalion leaders rank when he entered the tyranny the eye and ear scowled a soldier yes but not a spy after all it would appear benter vez maprab broke in i wish youd finish your pawing and let us get on with our tour i havent that many days left so i hate to squander one peace freeman peggol said a man is dead which means hell not complain if i see the muchtalkedabout wonders of trench park benter glared as if he were the hereditary tyrant dressing down some churlish underling radnal seeing how benter reacted when thwarted wondered if hed broken dokhnors neck for no better reason than losing a game of war benter might be old but he wasnt feeble and he was sure to be a veteran of the last war with morgaf or the one before that against morgaf and the krepalgan unity both he would know how to kill radnal shook his head if things kept on like this hed start suspecting fer and zosel next or his own shadow he wished he hadnt lost the tour guides draw he would sooner have been studying the metabolism of the fat sand rat than trying to figure out which of his charges had just committed murder peggol vez menk said we shall have to search the outbuildings before we begin freeman vez krobir already told you wed go out tomorrow my professional opinion is that no court would sustain a suit over one days delay when compensational time is guaranteed bah benter stomped off radnal caught toglo zev pamdals eye she raised one eyebrow slightly shook her head he shifted his shoulders in a tiny shrug they both smiled in every group someone turned out to be a pain in the backside radnal let his smile expand glad toglo wasnt holding his sport with lofosa and evillia against him speaking of outbuildings freeman vez krobir peggol said theres just the stables am i right that and the privy yes radnal said oh yes the privy the eye and ear wrinkled his nose it was even more prominent than radnals most strongbrows had big noses as if to counterbalance their long skulls lissonese whose noses were usually flattish sometimes called tarteshans snouts on account of that the name would start a brawl in any port on the western ocean fer vez canthal accompanied one of peggols men to the stables the eye and ear obviously needed support against the ferocious bloodcrazed donkeys inside that was what his body language said anyhow when peggol ordered him out hed flinched as if told to invade morgaf and bring back the kings ears you eyes and ears dont often deal with matters outside the big cities do you radnal asked you noticed that peggol vez menk raised a wry eyebrow youre right were urbanites to the core threats to the realm usually come among crowds of masking people most that dont are a matter for the army not us moblay sopsirks son went over to the shelf where the war board was stored if we cant go out today radnal care for the game we didnt have last night maybe another time freeman vez sopsirk the tour guide said turning moblays name into its nearest tarteshan equivalent maybe the brown man would take the hint and speak a bit more formally to him but moblay didnt seem good at catching hints as witness his advances toward evillia and this even more poorly timed suggestion of a game the eye and ear returned from the stable without the solution to dokhnors death by his lowvoiced comments to his friends he was glad hed escaped the den of vicious beasts with his life the trench park staffers tried to hide their sniggers even a few of the tourists only two days better acquainted with donkeys than the eye and ear chuckled at his alarm something on the roof said highighig in a loud strident voice the eye and ear whod braved the stables started nervously peggol vez menk raised his eyebrow again whats that freeman vez krobir a koprit bird radnal said they hardly impale people on thornbushes no eh thats good to hear peggols dry cough served him for a laugh the midday meal was ration packs radnal sent liem vez steries a worried look the extra mouths at the lodge would make supplies run out faster than hed planned for understanding the look liem said well fly in more from the militia outpost if we have to good between them peggol vez menk and liem vez steries spent most of the afternoon on the radiophone radnal worried about power but not as much even if the generator ran out of fuel solar cells would take up most of the slack trench park had plenty of sunshine after supper the militiamen and eyes and ears scattered sleepsacks on the common room floor peggol set up a watch schedule that gave each of his and liems men about half a daytenth each radnal volunteered to stand a watch himself no peggol answered while i do not doubt your innocence freeman vez krobir you and your colleagues formally remain under suspicion here the morgaffo plenipo could protest were you given a post which might let you somehow take advantage of us though that made some sense it miffed radnal he retired to his sleeping cubicle in medium dudgeon lay down and discovered he could not sleep the last two nights hed been on the edge of dropping off when evillia and lofosa called now he was awake and they stayed away he wondered why theyd already shown they didnt care who watched them when they made love maybe they thought he was too shy to do anything with militiamen and eyes and ears outside the entrance a few days before they would have been right now he wondered they took fornication so much for granted that they made any other view of it seem foolish whatever their reasons they stayed away radnal tossed and turned on his sleepsack he thought about going out to chat with the fellow on watch but decided not to peggol vez menk would suspect he was up to something nefarious if he tried that annoyed him all over again and drove sleep further away than ever so did the martoisis furious row over how one of them eltsac said nocso nocso said eltsac had managed to lose their only currycomb the tour guide eventually dozed off for he woke with a start when the men in the common room turned up the lights just before sunrise for a heartbeat or two he wondered why they were there then he remembered yawning he grabbed his cap tied the belt on his robe and headed out of the cubicle zosel vez glesir and a couple of tourists were already in the common room talking with the militiamen and the eyes and ears conversation flagged when lofosa emerged from her sleeping cubicle without dressing first a tough job this tour guide business must be peggol vez menk said sounding like everyone else who thought a guide did nothing but roll on the sleepsack with his tourists radnal grunted this tour he hadnt done much with lofosa or evillia but roll on the sleepsack its not usually like that he wanted to say he didnt think peggol would believe him so he kept his mouth shut if an eye and ear didnt believe something hed start digging if he started to dig hed keep digging till he found what he was looking for regardless of whether it was really there the tour guide and zosel dug out breakfast packs by the time they came back everyone was up and evillia had succeeded in distracting some of the males from lofosa here you are freelady radnal said to toglo zev pamdal when he got to her no one paid her any particular attention she was just a tarteshan woman in a concealing tarteshan robe not a foreign doxy wearing nothing much radnal wondered if that irked her women in his experience did not like being ignored if she was irked she didnt show it i trust you slept well freeman vez krobir she said she did not even glance toward evillia and lofosa if she meant anything more by her greeting than its words she also gave no sign of that which suited radnal perfectly yes i trust you did likewise he answered well enough she said though not as well as i did before the morgaffo was killed a pity hell not be able to make his sketches he had talent may his goddess grant him wind and land and water in the world to come thats what the islanders pray for not so i believe so yes radnal said though he knew little of morgaffo religious forms im glad youve arranged for the tour to continue despite the misfortune that befell him radnal vez she said it can do him no harm and the bottomlands are fascinating so they are fr radnal began then he stopped stared and blinked toglo hadnt used formal address but the middle grade of tarteshan politesse which implied she felt she knew him somewhat and didnt disapprove of him considering what shed witnessed at the first nights campsite that was a minor miracle he grinned and took a like privilege so do i toglo zev about a tenth of a daytenth later as he and fer carried empty ration packs to the disposal bin the other trench park staffer elbowed him in the ribs and said you have all the women after you eh radnal vez radnal elbowed back harder go jump in the bitter lake fer vez this groups nothing but trouble besides nocso zev martois thinks im part of the furniture you wouldnt want her fer replied chuckling i was just jealous thats what moblay said radnal answered having anyone jealous of him for being sexually attractive was a new notion one he didnt care for by tarteshan standards drawing such notice was faintly disreputable as if hed got rich by skirting the law it didnt bother evillia and lofosa they reveled in it well he asked himself do you really want to be like evillia and lofosa no matter how ripe their bodies are he snorted through his nose lets go back inside so i can get my crew moving after two days of practice the tourists thought they were seasoned riders they bounded onto their donkeys and had little trouble guiding them out of their stalls peggol vez menk looked almost as apprehensive as his henchman whod gone to search the stable he drew in his white robe all around him as if fearing to have it soiled you expect me to ride one of these creatures he said you were the one who wanted to come along radnal answered you dont have to ride you could always hike along beside us peggol glared thank you no freeman vez krobir he pointedly did not say radnal vez will you be good enough to show me how to ascend one of these perambulating peaks certainly freeman vez menk radnal mounted a donkey dismounted got on again the donkey gave him a jaundiced stare as if asking him to make up his mind he dismounted once more and took the snort that followed as the asinine equivalent of a resigned shrug to peggol he said now you try freeman unlike evillia or lofosa the eye and ear managed to imitate radnals movements without requiring the tour guide to take him by the waist just as well radnal thought peggol wasnt smooth and supple like the highhead girls he said when back in tarteshem freeman vez krobir i shall stick exclusively to motors when im in tarteshem freeman vez menk i do the same radnal answered the party set out a daytenth after sunrise not as early as radnal would have liked but given the previous days distractions the best he could expect he led them south toward the lowlands at the core of trench park under his straw hat moblay sopsirks son was already sweating hard something skittered into hiding under the fleshy leaves of a desert spurge what did we just nearly see there freeman golobol asked radnal smiled at the physicians phrasing that was a fat sand rat its a member of the gerbil family one specially adapted to feed off succulent plants that concentrate salt in their foliage fat sand rats are common throughout the bottomlands theyre pests in areas where theres enough water for irrigated agriculture moblay said you sound like you know a lot about them radnal not as much as id like to freeman vez sopsirk radnal answered still trying to persuade the lissonese to stop being so uncouthly familiar i study them when im not being a tour guide i hate all kinds of rats nocso zev martois said flatly oh i dont know eltsac said some rats are kind of cute the two martoisi began to argue everyone else ignored them moblay said hmp fancy spending all your time studying rats and how do you make your livelihood freeman radnal snapped me flatnosed dark and smooth moblays face was different from radnals in every way but the tour guide recognized the blank mask that appeared on it for a heartbeat the expression of a man with something to hide moblay said as i told you i am aide to my prince may his years be many he had said that radnal remembered it might even be true but he was suddenly convinced it wasnt the whole truth benter vez maprab couldnt have cared less about the fat sand rat the spiny spurge under which it hid however interested him he said freeman vez krobir perhaps you will explain the relationship between the plants here and the cactuses in the deserts of the double continent there is no relationship to speak of radnal gave the old strongbrow an unfriendly look try to make me look bad in front of everyone will you he thought he went on the resemblances come from adapting to similar environments thats called convergent evolution as soon as you cut them open youll see theyre unrelated spurges have a thick white milky sap while that of cactuses is clear and watery whales and fish look very much alike too but thats because they both live in the sea not because theyre kin benter hunched low over his donkeys back radnal felt like preening as if hed overcome a squadron of morgaffo marine commandos rather than one querulous old tarteshan some of the spines of the desert spurge held a jerboa a couple of grasshoppers a shoveler skink and other small dead creatures who hung them out to dry peggol vez menk asked a koprit bird radnal answered most butcherbirds make a larder of things theyve caught but havent got round to eating yet oh peggol sounded disappointed maybe hed hoped someone in trench park enjoyed tormenting animals so he could hunt down the miscreant toglo zev pamdal pointed to the impaled lizard which looked to have spent a while in the sun do they eat things as dried up as that radnal vez no probably not radnal said at least i wouldnt want to after he got his small laugh he continued a koprit birds larder isnt just things it intends to eat its also a display to other koprit birds thats especially true in breeding season its as if the male says to prospective mates look what a hunter i am koprits dont display only live things theyve caught either ive seen hoards with bright bits of yarn wires pieces of sparkling plastic and once even a set of old false teeth all hung on spines false teeth evillia looked sidelong at benter vez maprab some of us have more to worry about than others stifled snorts of laughter went up from several tourists even eltsac chuckled benter glared at the highhead girl she ignored him high in the sky almost too small to see were a couple of moving black specks as radnal pointed them out to the group a third joined them another feathered optimist he said this is wonderful country for vultures thermals from the bottomlands floor make soaring effortless theyre waiting for a donkey or one of us to keel over and die then theyll feast what do they eat when they cant find tourists toglo zev pamdal asked humpless camels or boar or anything else dead they spy radnal said the only reason there arent more of them is that the terrain is too barren to support many largebodied herbivores ive seen country that isnt moblay sopsirks son said in duvai east of lissonland the herds range the grasslands almost as they did in the days before mankind the past hundred years though hunting has thinned them out so the duvains say at any rate i wasnt there then ive heard the same radnal agreed it isnt like that here he waved to show what he meant the bottomlands were too hot and dry to enjoy a covering of grass scattered over the plain were assorted varieties of succulent spurges some spiny some glossy with wax to hold down water loss sharing the landscape with them were desiccated looking bushes thorny burnets oleander tiny bottomlands olive plants they were too small to be trees smaller plants huddled in shadows round the base of the bigger ones radnal knew seeds were scattered everywhere waiting for the infrequent rains but most of the ground was as barren as if the sea had disappeared yesterday not five and a half million years before i want all of you to drink plenty of water radnal said in weather like this you sweat more than you think weve packed plenty aboard the donkeys and well replenish their carrying bladders tonight back at the lodge dont be shy heatstroke can kill you if you arent careful warm water isnt very satisfying to drink lofosa grumbled i am sorry freelady but trench park hasnt the resources to haul a refrigerator around for anyones convenience radnal said despite lofosas complaint she and evillia both drank regularly radnal scratched his head wondering how the krepalgan girls could seem so fuzzbrained but still muddle along without getting into real trouble evillia had even brought along some flavoring packets so while everyone else poured down bloodtemperature water she had bloodtemperature fruit punch instead the crystals also turned the water the color of blood radnal decided he could do without them they got to the bitter lake a little before noon it was more a salt marsh than a lake the dalorz river did not drop enough water off the ancient continental shelf to keep a lake bed full against the tremendous evaporation in the eternally hot eternally dry bottomlands salt pans gleamed white around pools and patches of mud dont let the donkeys eat anything here radnal warned the water brings everything from the underground salt layer to the surface even bottomlands plants have trouble adapting that was emphatically true despite the water absent everywhere else in trench park the landscape round the bitter lake was barren even by bottomlands standards most of the few plants that did struggle to grow were tiny and stunted benter vez maprab whose sole interest seemed to be horticulture pointed to one of the exceptions whats that the ghost of a plant abandoned by the gods it looks like it radnal said the shrub had skinny almost skeletal branches and leaves rather than being green it was white with sparkles that shifted as the breeze shook it its a saltbush and its found only around the bitter lake it deposits the salts it picks up from ground water as crystals on all its aboveground parts that does two things it gets rid of the salt and having the reflective coating lowers the plants effective temperature it also probably keeps the saltbush from getting eaten very often toglo zev pamdal said yes but with a couple of exceptions radnal said one is the humpless camel which has its own ways of getting rid of excess salt the other is my little friend the fat sand rat although it prefers desert spurges which are juicier the strongbrow woman looked around one of the things i expected to see when i came down here both the first time and now was lots of lizards and snakes and tortoises i havent and it puzzles me id have thought the bottomlands would be a perfect place for coldblooded creatures to live if you look at dawn or dusk toglo zev youll see plenty but not in the heat of the day coldblooded isnt a good term for reptiles they have a variable body temperature not a constant one like birds or mammals they warm themselves by basking and cool down by staying out of the midday sun if they didnt theyd cook i know just how they feel evillia ran a hand through her thick dark hair you can stick eating tongs in me now because im done all the way through its not so bad as that radnal said im sure its under fifty hundredths and it can get above fifty even here and trench park doesnt have any of the deepest parts of the bottomlands down another couple of thousand cubits the extreme temperatures go above sixty the nontarteshans groaned so did toglo zev pamdal and peggol vez menk tarteshem had a relatively mild climate temperatures there went past forty hundredths only from late spring to early fall with morbid curiosity moblay sopsirks son said what is the highest temperature ever recorded in the bottomlands just over sixtysix radnal said the tourists groaned again louder radnal led the line of donkeys around the bitter lake he was careful not to get too close to the little water actually in the lake at this time of year sometimes a salt crust formed over mud a donkeys hoof could poke right through trapping the animal and slicing its leg against the hard sharp edge of the crust after a while the tour guide asked do you have all the pictures you want when no one denied it he said then well head back toward the lodge hold on eltsac vez martois pointed across the bitter lake what are those things over there i dont see anything eltsac his wife said you must be looking at a whatdoyoucall it a mirage then grudgingly a heartbeat later oh its a herd of humpless camels radnal said quietly try not to spook them the herd was a little one a couple of longnecked males with a double handful of smaller females and a few young ones that seemed all leg and awkwardness unlike the donkeys they ambled over the crust around the bitter lake their hooves were wide and soft spreading under their weight to keep them from falling through a male stood guard as the rest of the herd drank at a scummy pool of water golobol looked distressed that horrid liquid surely it will poison them he said i would not drink it to save my life his round brown face screwed up in disgust if you drank it it would end your days all the sooner but humpless camels have evolved along with the bottomlands their kidneys are wonderfully efficient at extracting large amounts of salt why dont they have humps lofosa asked krepalgan camels have humps by her tone what she was used to was right i know krepalgan camels have humps radnal said but the camels in the southern half of the double continent dont and neither do these with the bottomlands beasts i think the answer is that any lump of fat which is what a hump is is a liability in getting rid of heat in the days before motors we used to ride our krepalgan camels evillia said has anyone ever tamed your humpless ones thats a good question radnal said beaming to hide his surprise at her coming up with a good question he went on it has been tried many times in fact so far its never worked theyre too stubborn to do what a human being wants if we had domesticated them youd be riding them now instead of these donkeys theyre better suited to the terrain here toglo zev pamdal scratched her mounts ears theyre also uglier than donkeys freelady uh toglo zev i cant argue with you radnal said theyre uglier than anything i can think of with dispositions to match as if insulted by words they couldnt have heard the humpless camels raised their heads and trotted away from the bitter lake their backs went up and down up and down in time to their rocking gait evillia said in krepalga we sometimes call camels desert barques now i see why riding on one looks like it would make me seasick the tourists laughed so did radnal making a joke in a language that wasnt evillias took some brains then why radnal wondered did she act so emptyheaded but he shrugged hed seen a lot of people with brains do impressively stupid things why dont the camels eat all the forage in trench park benter vez maprab asked he sounded as if his concern was for the plants not the humpless camels when the herds get too large for the parks resource we cull them radnal answered this ecosystem is fragile if we let it get out of balance it would be a long time repairing itself are any herds of wild humpless camels left outside trench park radnal vez toglo asked a few small ones in areas of the bottomlands too barren for people the tour guide said not many though we occasionally introduce new males into this herd to increase genetic diversity but they come from zoological parks not the wild the herd receded rapidly shielded from clear view by the dust it kicked up im glad we had a chance to see them if at a distance thats why the gods made long lenses for cameras but now we should head back to the lodge the return journey north struck radnal as curiously unreal though peggol vez menk rode among the tourists they seemed to be pretending as hard as they could that dokhnor of kellef had not died that this was just an ordinary holiday the alternative was always looking over a shoulder remembering the person next to you might be a murderer the person next to someone was a murderer whoever it was he seemed no different from anyone else that worried radnal more than anything it even tainted his pleasure from talking with toglo zev pamdal he had trouble imagining her as a killer but he had trouble imagining anyone in the tour group a killersave dokhnor of kellef who was dead and the martoisi who might want to kill each other he got to the point where he could say toglo zev without prefacing it with uh he really wanted to ask her but lacked the nerve how she put up with him after watching him at play with the two highhead girls tarteshans seldom thought well of those who made free with their bodies he also wondered what hed do if evillia and lofosa came into his cubicle tonight hed throw them out he decided edifying a tour group was one thing edifying the park militia and the eyes and ears another but what they did was so edifying maybe he wouldnt throw them out he banged a fist onto his knee irritated at his own fleshly weakness the lodge was only a couple of thousand cubits away when his donkey snorted and stiffened its legs against the ground earthquake the word went up in tarteshan and other languages radnal felt the ground jerk beneath him he watched and marveled at the martoisi clinging to each other atop their mounts after what seemed a daytenth but had to be an interval measured in heartbeats the shaking ceased just in time too peggol vez menks donkey panicked by the tremor was about to buck the eye and ear into a thornbush radnal caught the beasts reins calmed it thank you freeman vez krobir peggol said that was bad you didnt make it any better by letting go of the reins radnal told him if you were in a motor wouldnt you hang on to the tiller i hope so peggol said but if i were in a motor it wouldnt try to run away by itself moblay sopsirks son looked west toward the barrier mountains that was worse than the one yesterday i feared id see the western ocean pouring in with a wave as high as the lion gods mane as ive said before thats not something youre likely to have to worry about radnal said a quake would have to be very strong and at exactly the wrong place to disturb the mountains so it would moblay did not sound comforted radnal dismissed his concern with the mild scorn you feel for someone who overreacts to a danger youre used to over in the double continent they had vast and deadly windstorms radnal was sure one of those would frighten him out of his wits but the stekians probably took them in stride as he lost no sleep over earthquakes the sun sank toward the spikes of the barrier mountains as if bloodied by their pricking its rays grew redder as bottomlands shadows lengthened more red sparkled from the glass and metal and plastic of the helos between the lodge and the stables noticing them made radnal return to the hereandnow he wondered how the militiamen and eyes and ears had done in their search for clues they came out as the tour group approached in their tan speckled robes the militiamen were almost invisible against the desert the eyes and ears with their white and gold and patent leather might have been spotted from ten thousand cubits away or from the mountains of the moon liem vez steries waved to radnal any luck do you have the killer tied up in pink string do you see any pink string radnal turned back to face the group raised his voice lets get the donkeys settled they cant do it for themselves when theyre fed and watered we can worry about ourselves and about everything thats been going on he added to himself the tourists dismounting groans were quieter than theyd been the day before they were growing hardened to riding poor peggol vez menk assumed a bowlegged gait most often seen in rickets victims i was thinking of taking yesterday off he said lugubriously i wish i had someone else would have taken your call you might have drawn a worse assignment radnal said helping him unsaddle the donkey the way peggol rolled his eyes denied that was possible fer vez canthal and zosel vez glesir came over to help see to the tour groups donkeys under the brims of their caps their eyes sparked with excitement well radnal vez we have a good deal to tell you fer began peggol had a sore fundament but his wits still worked he made a sharp chopping gesture freeman save your news for a more private time a smoother motion this time with upturned palm pointed out the chattering crowd still inside the stables someone may hear something he should not fer looked abashed your pardon freeman no doubt you are right no doubt peggols tone argued that he couldnt be anything but from under the shiny brim of his cap his gaze flicked here and there measuring everyone in turn with the calipers of his suspicion it came to radnal and showed no softening resentment flared in the tour guide then dimmed he knew he hadnt killed anyone but the eye and ear didnt ill get the firepit started fer said good idea eltsac vez martois said as he walked by im hungry enough to eat one of those humpless camels raw and without salt we can do better than that radnal said he noted the itoldyouso look peggol sent fer vez canthal if a tourist could overhear one bit of casual conversation why not another liem vez steries greeted peggol with a formal military salute he didnt use five times a year his body went tetanus rigid while he brought his right hand up so the tip of his middle finger brushed the brim of his cap freeman my compliments weve all heard of the abilities of the hereditary tyrants eyes and ears but until now ive never seen them in action your team is superb and what they found unlike fer vez canthal liem had enough sense to close his mouth right there radnal felt like dragging him into the desert to pry loose what he knew but years of slow research had left him a patient man he ate supper sang songs chatted about the earthquake and what hed seen on the journey to and from the bitter lake one by one the tourists sought their sleepsacks moblay sopsirks son however sought him out for a game of war for politeness sake radnal agreed to play though he had so much on his mind that he was sure the brown man from lissonland would trounce him either moblay had things on his mind too or he wasnt the player he thought he was the game was a comedy of errors which had the spectators biting their lips to keep from blurting out better moves radnal eventually won in inartistic style benter vez maprab had been an onlooker when the game ended he delivered a twosentence verdict which was also obituary a wasted murder had the morgaffo seen that hedve died of embarrassment he stuck his nose in the air and stalked off to his sleeping cubicle well have to try again another time when were thinking straighter radnal told moblay who nodded ruefully radnal put away the war board and pieces by then moblay was the only tourist left in the common room radnal sat down next to liem vez steries not across the gaming table from the lissonese moblay refused to take the hint finally radnal grabbed the rhinoceros by the horn forgive me freeman but we have a lot to discuss among ourselves dont mind me moblay said cheerfully im not in your way i hope and id be interested to hear how you tarteshans investigate maybe i can bring something useful back to my prince radnal exhaled through his nose biting off words one by one he said freeman vez sopsirk you are a subject of this investigation to be blunt we have matters to discuss which you shouldnt hear we also have other weightier things to discuss peggol vez menk put in remember freeman this is not your principality it never occurred to me that you might fear i was guilty moblay said i know im not so i assumed you did too maybe ill try and screw the krepalgan girls since it doesnt sound like radnal will be using them tonight peggol raised an eyebrow them he packed a world of question into one word under their coat of down radnals ears went hot fortunately he managed to answer a question with a question what could be weightier than learning who killed dokhnor of kellef peggol glanced from one sleeping cubicle to the next as if wondering who was feigning slumber why dont you walk with me in the cool night air subleader vez steries can come with us he was here all day and can tell you what he saw himself things i heard when i took my own evening walk and which i might garble in reporting them to you lets walk then radnal said though he wondered where peggol vez menk would find cool night air in trench park deserts above sea level cooled rapidly when the sun set but that wasnt true in the bottomlands getting out in the quiet dark made it seem cooler radnal peggol and liem walked without saying much for a couple of hundred cubits only when they were out of earshot of the lodge did the park militiaman announce freeman vez menks colleagues discovered a microprint reader among the morgaffos effects did they by the gods radnal said where liem vez what was it disguised as a stick of artists charcoal the militiaman shook his head i thought i knew every trick in the codex but thats a new one now we can rub the plenipos nose in it if he fusses about losing a morgaffo citizen in tartesh but even thats a small thing next to what the reader held radnal stared heading off a war with morgaf is small it is freeman vez krobir peggol vez menk said you remember todays earthquake yes and there was another one yesterday a smaller one radnal interrupted they happen all the time down here no one except a tourist like moblay sopsirks son worries about them you reinforce your buildings so they wont fall down except in the worst shocks then go on about your business sensible peggol said sensible under most circumstances anyway not here not now why not radnal demanded because if what was on dokhnor of kellefs microprint reader is true always a question when were dealing with morgaffos someone is trying to engineer a special earthquake radnals frown drew his heavy eyebrows together above his nose i still dont know what youre talking about liem vez steries inclined his head to peggol vez menk by your leave freeman when peggol nodded liem went on radnal vez over the years somebody has smuggled the parts for a starbomb into trench park the tour guide gaped at his friend thats insane if somebody smuggled a starbomb into tartesh hed put it by the hereditary tyrants palace not here what does he want to blow up the last big herd of humpless camels in the world he has more in mind than that liem answered you see the bomb is underground on one of the fault lines nearest the barrier mountains the militiamans head swiveled to look west toward the sawbacked young mountain range the mountain range that held back the western ocean the night was warm and dry but cold sweat prickled on radnals back and under his arms they want to try to knock the mountains down im no geologist can they the gods may know liem answered im no geologist either so i dont this ill tell you the morgaffos seem to think it would work peggol vez menk cleared his throat the hereditary tyrant discourages research in this area lest any positive answers fall into the wrong hands thus our studies have been limited i gather however that such a result might be obtained the freemans colleagues radiophoned a geologist known to be reliable liem amplified they put to him some of what was on the microprint reader as a theoretical exercise when they were through he sounded ready to wet his robes i dont blame him radnal looked toward the barrier mountains too what had moblay said a wave as high as the lion gods mane if the mountains fell at once the wave might reach krepalga before it halted the deaths the devastation would be incalculable his voice shook as he asked what do we do about it good question peggol said astringent as usual we dont know whether its really there who planted it if it is where it is or if its ready other than that were fine liems voice turned savage i wish all the tourists were tarteshans then we could question them as thoroughly as we needed until we got truth from them thoroughly radnal knew was a euphemism for harshly tarteshan justice was more pragmatic than merciful so much so that applying it to foreigners would strain diplomatic relations and might provoke war the tour guide said we couldnt even be properly thorough with our own people not when one of them is toglo zev pamdal id forgotten liem made a face but you cant suspect her why would the hereditary tyrants relative want to destroy the country hes hereditary tyrant of it makes no sense i dont suspect her radnal said i meant well have to use our heads here we cant rely on brute force i suspect everyone peggol vez menk said matteroffactly as if hed said its hot tonight for that matter i also suspect the information we found among dokhnors effects it might have been planted there to provoke us to question several foreign tourists thoroughly and embroil us with their governments morgaffo duplicity knows no bounds as may be freeman but dare we take the chance that this is duplicity not real danger liem said if you mean dare we ignore the danger of course not peggol said but it might be duplicity would the morgaffos kill one of their own agents to mislead us radnal asked if dokhnor were alive wed have no idea this plot was afoot they might precisely because theyd expect us to doubt they were so coldhearted peggol answered radnal thought the eye and ear would suspect someone of stealing the sun if a morning dawned cloudy that was what eyes and ears were for but it made peggol an uncomfortable companion since we cant question the tourists thoroughly what shall we do tomorrow radnal said go on as we have been peggol replied unhappily if any of them makes the slightest slip that will justify our using appropriate persuasive measures not even a man who sometimes used torture in his work was easy saying the word out loud i can see one problem coming soon freeman vez menk radnal said call me peggol vez the eye and ear interrupted were in this mess together we might as well treat each other as friends im sorry go ahead sooner or later peggol vez the tour group will want to go west toward the barrier mountains and toward the fault line where this starbomb may be if it requires some finishing touches that will give whoever is supposed to handle them his best chance if it is someone in the tour group of course when were you thinking of doing this if hed sounded unhappy before he was lugubrious now radnal didnt cheer him up the western swing was on the itinerary for tomorrow i could change it but but that would warn the culprit if there is a culprit we know whats going on yes peggol fingered the tuft of hair under his lip i think youd better make the change anyhow radnal vez having heard radnal use his name with the polite particle he could do likewise better to alert the enemy than offer him a free opportunity liem vez steries began freeman vez menk the eye and ear broke in again what i told radnal also holds for you fair enough peggol vez liem said how could morgaf have got wind of this plot against tartesh without our having heard of it too i mean no disrespect i assure you but this matter concerns me he waved toward the barrier mountains which suddenly seemed a much less solid bulwark than they had before the question is legitimate and i take no offense i see two possible answers peggol said radnal had a feeling the eye and ear saw at least two answers to every question one is that morgaf may be doing this deceitfully to incite us against our other neighbors as i said before the other is that the plot is real and whoever dreamed it up approached the morgaffos so they could fall on us after the catastrophe each possibility was logical radnal wished he could choose between them since he couldnt he said theres nothing we can do about it now so we might as well sleep in the morning ill tell the tourists were going east not west thats an interesting excursion too it peggol raised a hand since ill see it tomorrow why not keep me in suspense he twisted this way and that you cant die of an impacted fundament can you ive never heard of it happening anyhow radnal hid a smile maybe ill be a medical first and get written up in all the physicians codices peggol rubbed the afflicted parts and ill have to go riding again tomorrow eh how unfortunate if we dont get some sleep soon well both be dozing in the saddle radnal said yawning it must be a couple of daytenths past sunset by now i thought moblay would never head for his cubicle maybe he was just fond of you radnal liem vez steries put a croon in the guides name that burlesqued the way the lissonese kept leaving off the polite particle radnal snapped night demons carry you off liem vez the ideas you come up with he waited for the militiaman to taunt him about evillia and lofosa but liem left that alone he wondered what ideas the two girls from the krepalgan unity had come up with and whether theyd use them with him tonight he hoped not as hed told peggol he did need sleep then he wondered if putting sleep ahead of fornication meant he was getting old if it did too bad he decided along with peggol and liem he walked back to the lodge the other militiamen and eyes and ears reported in whispers all quiet radnal turned a curious ear toward evillias sleep cubicle then lofosas and then moblay sopsirks sons he didnt hear moans or thumpings from any of them he wondered whether moblay hadnt propositioned the krepalgan girls or whether theyd turned him down or maybe theyd frolicked and gone back to sleep no that last wasnt likely the eyes and ears would have been smirking about the eye and earful theyd got yawning again radnal went into his own sleep cubicle took off his sandals undid his belt and lay down the airfilled sleepsack sighed beneath him like a lover he angrily shook his head two nights with lofosa and evillia had filled his mind with lewd notions he hoped they would leave him alone again he knew their dalliance with him was already an entry in peggol vez menks dossier having the eye and ear watch him at play or listen to him quarreling with them when he sent them away would not improve the entry those two nights hed just been falling asleep when evillia and lofosa joined him tonight nervous about whether theyd come and about everything hed heard from peggol and liem he lay awake a long time the girls stayed in their own cubicles he dozed off without knowing hed done so his eyes flew open when a koprit bird on the roof announced the dawn with a raucous highighig he needed a couple of heartbeats to wake fully realize hed been asleep and remember what hed have to do this morning he put on his sandals fastened his belt and walked into the common room most of the militiamen and eyes and ears were already awake peggol wasnt radnal wondered how much knowing he snored would be worth as blackmail liem vez steries said quietly no one murdered last night im glad to hear it radnal said sarcastic and truthful at the same time lofosa came out of her cubicle she still wore what radnal assumed to be krepalgan sleeping attire namely skin not a hair on her head was mussed and shed done something to her eyes to make them look bigger and brighter than they really were all the men stared at her some more openly some less she smiled at radnal and said in a voice like silver bells i hope you didnt miss us last night freeman vez krobir it would have been as much fun as the other two but we were too tired before he could answer he would have needed a while to find an answer she went outside to the privy the tour guide looked down at his sandals not daring to meet anyones eyes he listened to the small coughs that meant the others didnt know what to say to him either finally liem remarked sounds as though she knows you well enough to call you radnal vez i suppose so radnal muttered in physical terms shed been intimate enough with him to leave off the vez her tarteshan was good enough that she ought to know it too shed managed to embarrass him even more by combining the formal address with such a familiar message she couldnt have made him look more foolish if shed tried for six moons evillia emerged from her cubicle dressed or undressed like lofosa she didnt banter with radnal but headed straight for the privy she and lofosa met each other behind the helos they talked for a few heartbeats before each continued on her way toglo zev pamdal walked into the common room as lofosa returned from outside lofosa stared at the strongbrow woman as if daring toglo to remark on her nakedness a lot of tarteshans especially female tarteshans would have remarked on it in detail toglo said only i trust you slept well freelady from her casual tone she might have been talking to a neighbor she didnt know well but with whom she was on good terms yes thank you lofosa dropped her eyes when she concluded she couldnt use her abundantly displayed charms to bait toglo im glad to hear it toglo said still sweetly i wouldnt want you to catch cold on holiday lofosa took half a step then jerked as if poked by a pin toglo had already turned to greet the others in the common room for a heartbeat maybe two lofosas teeth showed in a snarl like a cave cats then she went back into her cubicle to finish getting ready for the day i hope i didnt offend her too much toglo said to radnal i think you handled yourself like a diplomat he answered hmm she said given the state of the world i wonder whether thats a compliment radnal didnt answer given what hed heard the night before the state of the world might be worse than toglo imagined his own diplomatic skills got a workout after breakfast when he explained to the group that theyd be going east rather than west golobol said i find the change from the itinerary most distressing yes his round brown face bore a doleful expression benter vez maprab found any change distressing this is an outrage he blustered the herbaceous cover approaching the barrier mountains is far richer than that to the east im sorry radnal said an interesting mixture of truth and lie he didnt mind annoying benter but would sooner not have had such a compelling reason i dont mind going east rather than west today toglo zev pamdal said as far as im concerned there are plenty of interesting things to see either way but i would like to know why the schedule has been changed so would i moblay sopsirks son said toglo is right what are you trying to hide anyhow all the tourists started talking the martoisi started shouting at once radnals own reaction to the lissonese man was a wish that a trench in trench park went down a lot deeper say to the redhot center of the earth he would have shoved moblay into it not only was he a boor to use a womans name without the polite particle using it uninvited even with the particle would have been an undue liberty he was a snoop and a rabblerouser peggol vez menk slammed his open hand down on the table beside which dokhnor of kellef had died the boom cut through the chatter into sudden silence peggol said freeman vez krobir changed your itinerary at my suggestion aspects of the murder case suggest that course would in the best interests of tartesh this tells us nothing not a thing now golobol sounded really angry not just upset at breaking routine you say these fine sounding words but where is the meaning behind them if i told you everything you wished to know freeman i would also be telling those who should not hear peggol said pfui golobol stuck out his tongue eltsac vez martois said i think you eyes and ears think youre little tin demigods but peggols pronouncement quieted most of the tourists ever since starbombs came along nations had grown more anxious about keeping secrets from one another that struck radnal as worrying about the cave cat after hed carried off the goat but who could tell there might be worse things than starbombs he said as soon as i can i promise i will tell all of you everything i can about whats going on peggol vez menk gave him a hard look peggol wouldnt have told anyone his own name if he could help it what is going on toglo echoed since radnal was none too certain himself he met that comment with dignified silence he did say the longer we quarrel here the less well have the chance to see no matter which direction we end up choosing that makes sense freeman vez krobir evillia said neither she nor lofosa had argued about going east as opposed to west radnal looked around the group saw more resignation than outrage he said come now freemen freeladies lets head for the stables there are many fascinating things to see east of the lodge and to hear also theres the night demons retreat for instance oh good toglo clapped her hands as ive said it rained the last time i was here the guide was too worried about flash floods to take us out there ive wanted to see that ever since i read hicag zev ginfers frightener codex you mean stones of doom radnals opinion of toglos taste fell trying to stay polite he said it wasnt as accurate as it might have been i thought it was trash toglo said but i went to school with hicag zev and weve been friends ever since so i had to read it and she certainly makes the night demons retreat sound exotic whether theres a breeze of truth in what she writes or not maybe a breeze a mild breeze radnal said i read it too i thought it was very exciting nocso zev martois said the tour guide thinks its garbage her husband told her i didnt say that radnal said neither martois listened to him they enjoyed yelling at each other more enough of your own breeze if we must do this lets do it at least benter vez maprab said as you say freeman radnal wished the night demons retreat really held night demons with any luck theyd drag benter into the stones and no one in the tour group would ever see or have to listen to him again but such convenient things happened only in codices the tourists were getting better with the donkeys even peggol seemed less obviously out of place on donkeyback than he had yesterday as the group rode away from the lodge radnal looked back and saw park militiamen and eyes and ears advancing on the stables to go over them again he made himself forget the murder investigation and remember he was a tour guide because were off earlier this morning were more likely to see small reptiles and mammals that shelter against the worst heat he said many of them a sudden little flip of sandy dirt a few cubits ahead made him stop by the gods theres one now he dismounted i think thats a shoveler skink a what by now radnal was used to the chorus that followed whenever he pointed out one of the more unusual denizens of the bottomlands a shoveler skink he repeated he crouched down yes sure enough there was the lure he knew he had an evenmoney chance if he grabbed the tail end the lizard would shed the appendage and flee but if he got it by the neck he did the skink twisted like a piece of demented rubber trying to wriggle free it also voided lofosa made a disgusted noise radnal took such things in stride after thirty or forty heartbeats the skink gave up and lay still radnal had been waiting for that he carried the palmsized lizard into the midst of the tourists skinks are common all over the world but the shoveler is the most curious variety its a terrestrial equivalent of the anglerfish look he tapped the orange fleshy lump that grew on the end of a spine about two digits long the skink buries itself under sand with just this lure and the tip of its nose sticking out see how its ribs extend to either side so it looks more like a gliding animal than one that lives underground it has specialized musculature to make those long rib ends bend what wed think of as the wrong way when an insect comes along the lizard tosses dirt on it then twists around and snaps it up its a beautiful creature its the ugliest thing i ever saw moblay sopsirks son declared the lizard didnt care one way or the other it peered at him through little beady black eyes if the variety survived another few million years if the bottomlands survived another couple of moons radnal thought nervously future specimens might lose their sight altogether as had already happened with other subterranean skinks radnal walked out of the path put the lizard back on the ground it scurried away surprisingly fast on its short legs after six or eight cubits it seemed to melt into the ground within moments only the bright orange lure betrayed its presence evillia asked do any bigger creatures go around looking for lures to catch the skinks as a matter of fact yes radnal said koprit birds can see color youll often see shoveler skinks impaled in their hoards bigeared nightfoxes eat them too but they track by scent not sight i hope no koprit birds come after me evillia said laughing she and lofosa wore matching redorange tunics almost the same shade as the shoveler skinks lure with two rows of big gold buttons and red plastic necklaces with gold clasps radnal smiled i think youre safe enough and now that the lizard is safe for the time being shall we go no wait wheres freeman vez maprab the old strongbrow emerged from behind a big widespreading thornbush a few heartbeats later still refastening the belt to his robe sorry for the delay but i thought id answer natures call while we paused here i just didnt want to lose you freeman radnal stared at benter as he got back onto his donkey this was the first apology hed heard from him he wondered if the tourist was well the group rode slowly eastward before long people began to complain every piece of trench park looks like every other piece lofosa said yes when will we see something different moblay sopsirks son agreed radnal suspected he would have agreed if lofosa said the sky were pink he slavered after her he went on its all hot and flat and dry even the thornbushes are boring freeman if you wanted to climb mountains and roll in snow you should have gone someplace else radnal said thats not what the bottomlands have to offer but there are mountains and snow all over the world theres nothing like trench park anywhere and if you tell me this terrain is like what we saw yesterday around the bitter lake freeman freeladyhe glanced over at lofosai think youre both mistaken they certainly are benter vez maprab chimed in this area has very different flora from the other one note the broaderleafed spurges the oleanders theyre just plants lofosa said benter clapped a hand to his head in shock and dismay radnal waited for him to have another badtempered fit but he just muttered to himself and subsided about a quarter of a daytenth later radnal pointed toward a gray smudge on the eastern horizon theres the night demons retreat i promise its like nothing youve yet seen in trench park i hope it shall be interesting oh yes golobol said i loved the scene where the demons came out at sunset claws dripping blood nocso zev martois said her voice rose in shivery excitement radnal sighed stones of doom is only a frightener freelady no demons live inside the retreat or come out at sunset or any other time ive passed the night in a sleepsack not fifty cubits from the stonepile and im still here with my blood inside me where it belongs nocso made a face no doubt she preferred melodrama to reality since she was married to eltsac reality couldnt seem too attractive to her the night demons retreat was a pile of gray granite about a hundred cubits high looming over the flat floor of the bottomlands holes of all sizes pitted the granite under the merciless sun the black openings reminded radnal of skulls eyes looking at him some holes look big enough for a person to crawl into peggol vez menk remarked has anybody ever explored them yes many people radnal answered we discourage it though because although no ones ever found a night demon theyre a prime denning place for vipers and scorpions they also often hold bats nests seeing the bats fly out at dusk to hunt bugs doubtless helped start the legend about the place bats live all over nocso said theres only one night demons retreat because the breeze which had been quiet suddenly picked up dust skirled over the ground radnal grabbed for his cap and from the many mineral throats of the night demons retreat came a hollow moaning and wailing that made the hair on his body want to stand on end nocso looked ecstatic there she exclaimed the cry of the deathless demons seeking to be free to work horror on the world radnal remembered the starbomb that might be buried by the barrier mountains and thought of horrors worse than any demons could produce he said freelady as im sure you know its just wind playing some badly tuned flutes the softer rock around the retreat weathered away and the retreat itself has taken a lot of sandblasting whatever bits that werent as hard as the rest are gone which explains how and why the openings formed and now when the wind blows across them they make the weird sounds we just heard hmp nocso said if there are gods how can there not be demons freelady speak to a priest about that not to me radnal swore by the gods of tartesh but like most educated folk of his generation had little other use for them peggol vez menk said freelady the question of whether night demons exist does not necessarily have anything to do with the question of whether they haunt the night demons retreat except that if there be no demons they are unlikely to be at the retreat nocsos plump face filled with rage but she thought twice about telling off an eye and ear she turned her head and shouted at eltsac instead he shouted back the breeze swirled around blowing bits of grit into the tour guides face more unmusical notes emanated from the night demons retreat cameras clicked i wish id brought along a recorder toglo zev pamdal said whats interesting here isnt how this place looks but how it sounds you can buy a wire of the night demons retreat during a windstorm at the gift shop near the entrance to trench park thank you radnal vez i may do that on my way out it would be even better though if i could have recorded what i heard with my own ears toglos glance slipped to eltsac and nocso who were still barking at each other well some of what i heard evillia said this night demons retreat was on the sea floor thats right as the dried muck and salt that surrounded it eroded it was left alone here think of it as a miniature version of the mountain plains that stick up from the bottomlands in ancient days they were islands the retreat of course was below the surface back then and may be again he thought he imagined fish peering into the holes in the ancient granite crabs scuttling in to scavenge the remains of snakes and sand rats the picture came to vivid life in his mind that bothered him it meant he took this menace seriously he was so deep in his own concerns that he needed a couple of heartbeats to realize the group had fallen silent when he did notice he looked up in a hurry wondering what was wrong from a third of the way up the night demons retreat a cave cat looked back the cave cat must have been asleep inside a crevice until the tourists racket woke it it yawned showing yellow fangs and pink tongue then with steady amber gaze it peered at the tourists once more as if wondering what sauce would go well with them lets move away from the retreat radnal said quietly we dont want it to think were threatening it that would have been a good trick he thought if the cave cat did decide to attack his handcannon would hurt it assuming he was lucky enough to hit but it wouldnt kill he opened the flap to his saddlebag just the same for once all the tourists did exactly as they were told seeing the great predator raised fears that went back to the days of manapes just learning to walk erect moblay sopsirks son asked will more of them be around in lissonland lions hunt in prides no cave cats are solitary except during mating season radnal answered they and lions have a common ancestor but their habits differ the bottomlands dont have big herds that make pride hunting a successful survival strategy just when radnal wondered if the cave cat was going back to sleep it exploded into motion long gray brown mane flying it bounded down the steep slope of the night demons retreat radnal yanked out his handcannon he saw peggol vez menk also had one but when the cave cat hit the floor of the bottomlands it streaked away from the tour group its grayish fur made it almost invisible against the desert cameras clicked incessantly then the beast was gone how beautiful toglo zev pamdal breathed after a moment she turned more practical where does he find water he doesnt need much toglo zev he answered like other bottomlands creatures he makes the most of what he gets from the bodies of his prey alsohe pointed norththere are a few tiny springs in the hills back when it was legal to hunt cave cats a favorite way was to find a spring and lay in wait until the animal came to drink it seems criminal toglo said to us certainly radnal halfagreed but to a man whos just had his flocks raided or a child carried off it was natural enough we go wrong when we judge the past by our standards the biggest difference between past and present is that we moderns are able to sin on a much larger scale peggol said maybe he was thinking of the buried starbomb but recent history held enough other atrocities to make radnal have trouble disagreeing eltsac vez martois said well freeman vez krobir i have to admit that was worth the price of admission radnal beamed of all the people from whom he expected praise eltsac was the last then nocso chimed in but it would have been even more exciting if the cave cat had come toward us and hed had to shoot at it ill say eltsac agreed id love to have that on film why radnal wondered did the martoisi see eye to eye only when they were both wrong he said with respect im delighted the animal went the other way id hate to fire at so rare a creature and id hate even more to miss and have anyone come to harm miss nocso said the word as if it hadnt occurred to her it probably hadnt people in adventure stories shot straight whenever they needed to eltsac said shooting well isnt easy when i was drafted into the voluntary guards i needed three tries before i qualified with a rifle oh but thats you not a tour guide nocso said scornfully he has to shoot well through eltsacs outraged bellow radnal said i will have you know i have never fired a handcannon in all my time at trench park he didnt add that given a choice between shooting at a cave cat and at nocso hed sooner have fired on her the wind picked up again the night demons retreat made more frightful noises radnal imagined how he would have felt if he were an illiterate hunter say hearing those ghostly wails for the first time he was sure hedve fouled his robes from fear but even so something else also remained true judging by the standards of the past was even more foolish when the present offered better information if nocso believed in night demons for no better reason than that shed read an exciting frightener about them that only argued she didnt have the sense the gods gave a shoveler skink radnal smiled as far as he could tell she didnt have the sense the gods gave a shoveler skink well go in the direction opposite the one the cave cat took radnal said at last well also stay in a tight group if you ask me anyone who goes wandering off deserves to be eaten the tourists rode almost in one anothers laps as far as radnal could tell the eastern side of the night demons retreat wasnt much different from the western but hed been here tens of times already tourists could hardly be blamed for wanting to see as much as they could no demons over here either nocso eltsac vez martois said his wife stuck her nose in the air radnal wondered why they stayed married for that matter he wondered why theyd got married when they sniped at each other so pressure from their kith groupings probably it didnt seem a good enough reason so why was he haggling over bride price with wello zev putuns father the putuni were a solid family in the lower aristocracy a good connection for an upandcoming man he couldnt think of anything wrong with wello but she didnt much stir him either would she have read stones of doom without recognizing it for the garbage it was maybe that worried him if he wanted a woman with whom he could talk would he need a concubine peggol had one radnal wondered if the arrangement made him happy likely not peggol took a perverse pleasure in not enjoying anything thinking of wello brought radnals mind back to the two nights of excess hed enjoyed with evillia and lofosa he was sure he wouldnt want to marry a woman whose body was her only attraction but he also doubted the wisdom of marrying one whose body didnt attract him what he needed he snorted what i need is for a goddess to take flesh and fall in love with me if she doesnt destroy my selfconfidence by letting on shes a goddess finding such a mate especially for a bride price less than the annual budget of tartesh seemed unlikely maybe wello would do after all are we going back by the same route we came toglo zev pamdal asked i hadnt planned to radnal said id aimed to swing further south on the way back to give you the chance to see country you havent been through before he couldnt resist adding no matter how much the same some people find it moblay sopsirks son looked innocent if you mean me radnal im happy to discover new things i just havent come across that many here hmp toglo said im having a fine time here i was glad to see the night demons retreat at last and also to hear it i can understand why our ancestors believed horrid creatures dwelt inside i was thinking the same thing only a couple of hundred heartbeats ago radnal said what a nice coincidence a smile brightened her face to radnals disappointment she didnt stay cheerful long she said this tour is so marvelous i cant help thinking it would be finer still if dokhnor of kellef were still alive or even if we knew who killed him yes radnal said hed spent much of the day glancing from one tourist to the next trying to figure out who had broken the morgaffos neck hed even tried suspecting the martoisi hed dismissed them before as too inept to murder anybody quietly but what if their squawk and bluster only disguised devious purposes his laugh came out dusty as peggol vez menks he couldnt believe it besides nocso and eltsac were tarteshans they wouldnt want to see their country ruined or could they be paid enough to want to destroy it nocso looked back toward the night demons retreat just as a koprit bird flew into one of the holes in the granite a demon i saw a night demon she squalled radnal laughed again if nocso was a spy and a saboteur he was a humpless camel come on he called time to head back as hed promised he took his charges to the lodge by a new route moblay sopsirks son remained unimpressed it may not be the same but it isnt much different oh rubbish benter vez maprab said the flora here are quite distinct from those we observed this morning not to me moblay said stubbornly freeman vez maprab by your interest in plants of all sorts were you by chance a scholar of botany radnal asked by the gods no benter whinnied laughter i ran a train of plant and flower shops until i retired oh i see radnal did too with that practical experience benter might have learned as much about plants as any scholar of botany about a quarter of a daytenth later the old man reined in his donkey and went behind another thornbush sorry to hold everyone up he said when he returned my kidneys arent what they used to be eltsac vez martois guffawed dont worry benter vez a fellow like you knows you have to water the plants haw haw youre a bigger jackass than your donkey benter snapped freemen please radnal got the two men calmed down and made sure they rode far from each other he didnt care if they went at each other three heartbeats after they left trench park but they were his responsibility till then you earn your silver here ill say that for you peggol observed i see fools in my line of work but im not obliged to stay polite to them he lowered his voice when freeman vez maprab went behind the bush now he didnt just relieve himself he also bent down and pulled something out of the ground i happened to be off to one side did he how interesting radnal doubted benter was involved in the killing of dokhnor of kellef but absconding with plants from trench park was also a crime one the tour guide was better equipped to deal with than murder we wont do anything about it now after we get back to the lodge why dont you have your men search benter vezs belongings again amusement glinted in peggols eyes youre looking forward to this who me the only thing that could be better would be if it were eltsac vez instead but he hasnt a brain in his head or anywhere else about his person are you sure peggol had been thinking along the same lines as radnal hed probably started well before radnal had too that was part of his job but radnal came back strong if he had brains would he have married nocso zev that won a laugh which didnt sound dusty he added besides all he knows about thornbushes is not to ride into them and hes not certain of that malice agrees with you radnal vez by the time the lodge neared golobol was complaining along with moblay take away the night demons retreat oh yes and take away the cave cat we saw there and what have you take away those two things and it is a nothing of a day freeman if you insist on ignoring everything interesting that happens you can turn any day dull toglo observed well said being a tour guide kept radnal from speaking his mind to the people he led this time toglo had done it for him she smiled why come see what the bottomlands are like if he isnt happy with what he finds toglo zev some are like that in every group it makes no sense to me but there you are if i had the money to see the nine iron towers of mashyak i wouldnt whine because they arent gold that is a practical attitude toglo said wed be better off if more people felt as you do wed be better off if radnal shut up if we didnt fear a starbomb was buried somewhere around here was how hed been about to end the sentence that wasnt smart not only would it frighten toglo or worry her she didnt seem to frighten easily but peggol vez menk would come down on him like he didnt know what for breaching security all at once he knew how peggol would come down on him like the western ocean pouring into the bottomlands over the broken mountains he tried to laugh at himself he didnt usually come up with such literary comparisons laughter failed the simile was literary but it might be literal as well wed be better off if what radnal vez toglo asked what did you start to say he couldnt tell her what hed started to say he wasnt glib enough to invent something smooth to his dismay what came out of his mouth was wed be better off if more people were like you toglo zev and didnt have fits at what they saw other people doing oh that radnal vez i didnt think anyone who was doing that was hurting anyone else you all seemed to be enjoying yourselves its not something id care to do where other people might see but i dont see i have any business getting upset about it oh radnal wasnt sure how to take toglos answer he had however already pushed his luck past the point where it had any business going so he kept quiet something small skittered between spurges something larger bounded along in hot pursuit the pursuit ended in a cloud of dust forestalling the inevitable chorus of whats that radnal said looks like a bladetooth just made a kill the carnivorous rodent crouched over its prey the tour guide pulled out a monocular for a closer look its caught a fat sand rat one of the animals you study moblay said are you going to blast it with your handcannon to take revenge i think you should nocso zev martois declared what a vicious brute to harm a defenseless furry beast radnal wondered if he should ask how shed enjoyed her mutton last night but doubted she would understand he said either carnivores eat meat or they starve a bladetooth isnt as cuddly as a fat sand rat but it has its place in the web of life too the bladetooth was smaller than a fox tan above and cream below at first glance it looked like any other jerboa with hind legs adapted for jumping big ears and a long tufted tail but its muzzle was also long and smeared with blood the fat sand rat squirmed feebly the bladetooth bit into its belly and started feeding nonetheless nocso moaned radnal tried to figure out how her mind worked she was eager to believe in night demons that worked all manner of evils yet a little real predation turned her stomach he gave up some inconsistencies were too big for him to understand how anyone managed to hold both halves of them at once he said as i remarked a couple of days ago the bladetooth does well in the bottomlands because jerboas had already adapted to conditions close to these while this part of the world was still under water its herbivorous relatives extract the water they must have from leaves and seeds while it uses the tissues of the animals it captures even during our rare rains no bladetooth has ever been seen to drink disgusting nocsos plump body shook as she shuddered radnal wondered how long her carcass would give a bladetooth the fluids it needed a long time he thought moblay sopsirks son whooped theres the lodge cold water cold ale cold wine as they had the evening before the eyes and ears and the militiamen came out to await the tour groups return the closer the donkeys came the better radnal could see the faces of the men who had stayed behind they all looked thoroughly grim this time he did not intend to spend a couple of daytenths wondering what was going on he called fer vez zosel vez take charge of the tourists i want to catch up on whats happened here all right radnal vez fer answered but his voice was no more cheerful than his expression radnal dismounted and walked over to liem vez steries he was not surprised when peggol vez menk fell into step with him their robes rustled as they came up to the militia subleader radnal asked whats the word liem vez liems features might have been carved from stone the word is interrogation he said quietly tomorrow by the gods radnal stared theyre taking this seriously in tarteshem youd best believe it liem wiped his sweaty face with his sleeve see those red cones past the cookpit thats the landing site we laid out for the helo thats due in the morning but interrogation radnal shook his head the eyes and ears methods were anything but gentle if we interrogate foreigners were liable to touch off a war tarteshem knows this radnal vez liem said my objections are on the wire up there i have been overruled the hereditary tyrant and his advisors must think the risks and damages of war are less than what tartesh would suffer if the starbomb performs as those who buried it hope peggol said but what if its not there or if it is but none of the tourists knows about it radnal said then well have antagonized the krepalgan unity lissonland and other countries as well and for what nothing get on the radiophone peggol vez see if theyll change their minds peggol shook his head no for two reasons one is that this policy will have come down from a level far higher than i can influence i am only a field agent i have no say in grand strategy the other is that your radiophone is too public i do not want to alert anyone that he is about to be interrogated radnal had to concede that made sense as far as security went but he did not like it any better then something else occurred to him he turned to liem vez steries am i going to be uh interrogated too what about zosel vez and fer vez and what about toglo zev pamdal are the interrogators going to work on one of the hereditary tyrants relatives i dont know any of those answers the militiaman said the people i spoke with in tartesh wouldnt tell me his eyes flicked to peggol i suppose they didnt care to be too public either no doubt peggol said now we have to act as normally as we can not letting on that well have visitors in the morning id have an easier time acting normal if i knew i wouldnt be wearing thumbscrews tomorrow radnal said after such ordeals the hereditary tyrant generously compensates innocents peggol said the hereditary tyrant is generous that was all radnal could say while talking to an eye and ear but silver while it worked wonders didnt fully make up for terror and pain and sometimes permanent injury the tour guide preferred remaining as he was to riches and a limp liem remarked keeping things from the tourists wont be hard look what theyre doing radnal turned looked and snorted his charges had turned the area marked off with red cones into a little game field all of them except prim golobol ran around throwing somebodys sponge rubber ball back and forth and trying to tackle one another if their sport had rules radnal couldnt figure them out moblay sopsirks son stubborn if unwise kept his yen for evillia and lofosa careless of the abrasions to his nearly naked hide he dragged lofosa into the dirt when she stood up her tunic was missing some of its big gold buttons she remained indifferent to the flesh she exposed moblay had got grit in his eyes and stayed on the ground a while evillia lost buttons too toglo zev pamdals belt broke as did nocso zev martois toglo capered with one hand holding her robes closed nocso didnt bother watching her jounce up and down the improvised pitch radnal wished she were modest and toglo otherwise fer vez canthal asked shall i get supper started get the coals going but wait for the rest radnal said theyre having such a good time they might as well enjoy themselves they wont have any fun tomorrow neither will we fer answered radnal grimaced and nodded benter vez maprab tackled eltsac vez martois and stretched the bigger younger man in the dust benter sprang to his feet swatted evillia on the backside she spun round in surprise the old fellow has life in him yet peggol said watching eltsac rise one hand pressed to a bloody nose so he does radnal watched benter he might be old but he was spry maybe he could have broken dokhnor of kellefs neck was losing a game of war reason enough or was he playing the same deeper game as dokhnor only when the sun slid behind the barrier mountains and dusk enfolded the lodge did the tourists give up their sport the cones shone with a soft pink phosphorescent glow of their own toglo tossed the ball to evillia saying im glad you got this out freelady i havent enjoyed myself so much and so foolishly in a long time i thought it would be a good way for us to unwind after riding and sitting around evillia answered she had a point if radnal ever led tourists down here again if the lodge wasnt buried under thousands of cubits of sea hed have to remember to bring along a ball himself he frowned in selfreproach he should have thought of that on his own instead of stealing the idea from someone in his group if i was thirsty before im drier than the desert now moblay boomed wheres that ale ill open the refrigerator zosel vez glesir said who else wants something he cringed from the hot sweaty tourists who dashed his way come my friends if you squash me who will get the drinks well manage somehow eltsac vez martois said the first sensible remark hed made fer vez canthal had the coals in the firepit glowing red zosel fetched a cutup pig carcass and a slab of beef ribs radnal started to warn him about going through the stored food so prodigally but caught himself if people fell into the interrogators hands tomorrow no need to worry about the rest of the tour radnal ate heartily and joined in songs after supper he managed to forget for hundreds of heartbeats what awaited when morning came but every so often realization came flooding back once his voice faltered so suddenly that toglo glanced over to see what had happened he smiled sheepishly and tried to do better then he looked at her he couldnt imagine her being connected with the plot to flood the bottomlands he had trouble imagining eyes and ears interrogating her as they would anyone else but he hadnt thought they would risk international incidents to question foreign tourists either maybe that meant he didnt grasp how big the emergency was if so toglo might be at as much risk as anyone horken vez sofana the circumstances man from the trench park militia came up to the tour guide i was told you wanted benter vez maprabs saddlebags searched freeman vez krobir i found these he held out his hand how interesting wait here senior trooper vez sofana radnal walked over to where benter was sitting tapped him on the shoulder would you please join me freeman what is it benter growled but he came back with radnal the tour guide said id like to hear how these redveined orchids he pointed to the plants in horken vez sofanas upturned palmappeared in your saddlebags removal of any plants or animals especially rare varieties like these is punishable by fine imprisonment stripes or all three benter vez maprabs mouth opened and closed silently he tried again ii would have raised them carefully freeman vez krobir he was so used to complaining himself he did not know how to react when someone complained of him and caught him in the wrong triumph turned hollow for radnal what were a couple of redveined orchids when the whole bottomlands might drown the tour guide said well confiscate these freeman vez maprab your gear will be searched again when you leave trench park if we find no more contraband well let this pass otherwise im sure i need not paint you a picture thank you very kind benter fled horken vez sofana sent radnal a disapproving look you let him off too lightly maybe but the interrogators will take charge of him tomorrow hmm compared to everything else stealing plants isnt such a big thing just what i was thinking maybe we ought to give them back to the old lemonface so theyll be somewhere safe if well you know the ifs yes the circumstances man looked thoughtful if we gave them back now hed wonder why we dont want that either too bad though yes discovering he worried about saving tiny pieces of trench park made radnal realize hed begun to believe in the starbomb the tourists began going off to their sleeping cubicles radnal envied their ignorance of what lay ahead he hoped evillia and lofosa would visit him in the quiet darkness and didnt care what the eyes and ears and militiamen thought the body had its own sweet forgetfulness but the body had its own problems too both women from krepalga started trotting back and forth to the privy every quarter of a daytenth sometimes even more than that it must have been something i ate evillia said leaning wearily against the doorpost after her third trip do you have a constipant the aid kit should have some radnal rummaged through it found the orange pills he wanted he brought them to her with a paper cup of water here thank you she popped the pills into her mouth drained the cup threw back her head to swallow i hope they help so do i radnal had trouble keeping his voice casual when shed straightened to take the constipant her left breast popped out of her tunic freelady i think you have fewer buttons than you did when the game ended evillia covered herself again an effort almost undermined when she shrugged i shouldnt be surprised most of those that didnt get pulled off took some yanks she shrugged again its only skin does it bother you you ought to know better than that he said almost angrily if you were feeling well if i were feeling well i would enjoy feeling good she agreed but as it is radnal vez at last she called him by his name and the polite particle a grimace crossed her face as it is i hope you will forgive me but she hurried back out into the night when lofosa made her next dash to the privy radnal had the pills waiting for her she gulped them almost on the dead run shed lost some new buttons herself radnal felt guilty about thinking of such things when she was in distress after a game of war with moblay that was almost as sloppy as their first radnal went into his cubicle he didnt have anything to discuss with liem or peggol tonight he knew what was coming somehow he fell asleep anyway radnal vez a quiet voice jerked him from slumber it was neither lofosa nor evillia bending over him promising sensual delights peggol vez menk stood in the entryway radnal came fully awake whats gone wrong he demanded those two highhead girls who dont believe in wearing clothes peggol answered what about them radnal asked confused they went off to the privy a while ago and neither of them came back my man on watch woke me before he went out to see if they were all right they werent there either where could they have gone radnal had had idiot tourists wander on their own but never in the middle of the night then other possible meanings for their disappearance crossed his mind he jumped up and why this also occurred to me peggol said grimly if they dont come back soon it will have answered itself they cant go far radnal said i doubt theyll have thought to get on donkeys they could hardly tell one end of the beasts from the the tour guide stopped if evillia and lofosa were other than they seemed who could tell what they knew peggol nodded we are thinking along the same lines he plucked at the tuft of hair under his mouth if this means what we fear much will depend on you to track them down you know the bottomlands and i do not our best tools are the helos radnal said when its light well sweep the desert floor a hundred times faster than we could on donkeyback he kept talking for another few words but peggol didnt hear him he didnt hear himself either not over the sudden roar from outside they dashed for the outer door they pushed through the eyes and ears and militiamen who got there first tourists pushed them from behind everyone stared at the blazing helos radnal stood in disbelief and dismay for a couple of heartbeats peggol vez menks shout brought him to himself we have to call tarteshem right now radnal spun round shoved and elbowed by the tourists in his way and dashed for the radiophone the amber ready light didnt come on when he hit the switch he ducked under the table to see if any connections were loose hurry up peggol yelled the demoncursed thing wont come on radnal yelled back he picked up the radiophone itself it rattled it wasnt supposed to its broken its been broken peggol declared how could it have been broken with eyes and ears and militiamen in the common room all the time the tour guide said not so much disagreeing with peggol as voicing his bewilderment to the world but peggol had an answer if one of those krepalgan tarts paraded through here without any clothes and they both ran back and forth all night we might not have paid attention to what the other one was doing bang it mmm more likely reach under it with the right little tool and you wouldnt need more than five heartbeats radnal would have needed more than five heartbeats but he wasnt a saboteur if evillia and lofosa were he couldnt doubt it but it left him sick inside theyd used him used their bodies to lull him into thinking they were the stupid doxies they pretended to be and it had worked he wanted to wash himself over and over he felt hed never be clean again liem vez steries said wed better make sure the donkeys are all right he trotted out the door ran around the crackling hulks of the flying machines the stable door was closed against cave cats the militiaman pulled it open through the crackle of the flames radnal heard a sharp report saw a flash of light liem crashed to the ground he lay there unmoving radnal and golobol the physician sprinted out to him the firelight told them all they needed to know liem would not get up again not with those dreadful wounds the tour guide went into the stables he knew something was wrong but needed a moment to realize what then the quiet hit him the donkeys were not shifting in their stalls nipping at the straw or making any of their other small noises he looked into the stall by the broken door the donkey there lay on its side its flanks neither rose nor fell radnal ran to the next and the next all the donkeys were dead except for three which were missing one for evillia the tour guide thought one for lofosa and one for their supplies no they werent fools i am he said and ran back to the lodge he gave the grim news to peggol vez menk were in trouble sure enough peggol said shaking his head wed be worse off though if the interrogation team werent coming in under a daytenth we can go after them in that helo it has its own cannon too if they dont yield goodbye by the gods i hope they dont so do i radnal cocked his head to one side a grin split his face isnt that the helo now why is it early i dont know peggol answered wait a heartbeat maybe i do if tarteshem called and got no answer they might have decided something was wrong and sent the helo straightaway the racket of engine and rotors swelled the pilot must have spotted the fires and put on full speed radnal hurried outside to greet the incoming eyes and ears the helos black silhouette spread huge across the sky as peggol had implied this was a military machine not just a utility flier it made for the glowing cones that marked the landing area radnal watched it settle toward the ground he remembered evillia and lofosa running around in the landing zone laughing giggling and losing buttons he waved his arms dashed toward the cones no he screamed wait too late dust rose in choking clouds as the helo touched the ground the tour guide saw the flash under one skid heard the report the skid crumpled the helo heeled over a rotor blade dug into the ground snapped thrummed past radnals head had it touched him his head would have gone with it the side panel of the helo came down on the bottomlands floor another sharp report and suddenly flames were everywhere the eyes and ears trapped inside the helo screamed radnal tried to help them but the heat would not let him approach the screams soon stopped he smelled the thick odor of charring flesh the fire burned on peggol vez menk hurried out to radnal i tried to stop them the tour guide said brokenly you came closer than i a reproach i shall carry to my grave peggol answered i did not see that danger much as i should have some of those men were my friends he slammed a fist against his thigh what now radnal vez die when the waters come was the first thought that crossed the tour guides mind mechanically he went through the obvious wait till dawn try to find their trail pack as much water on our backs as we can and go after them afoot afoot peggol said radnal realized he hadnt explained about the donkeys he did then went on leave one man here for when another helo comes give the tourists as much water as they can carry and send them up the trail maybe theyll escape the flood what you say sounds sensible well try it peggol said anything else pray radnal told him he grimaced nodded turned away moblay sopsirks son got through the eyes and ears and trotted up to radnal and peggol freeman vez krobir he began radnal rolled his eyes he was about to wish a night demon on moblays head but stopped instead he said wait a heartbeat you named me properly what should have been polite surprise came out as accusation so i did something about moblay had changed in the light of the blazing helos he looked not like peggol vez menk since he remained a shortnosed brownskinned highhead but of the same type as the eye and eartough and smart not just lascivious and overfamiliar he said freeman vez krobir i apologize for irritating you but i wanted to remain as ineffectualseeming as i could names are one way of doing that i am an aide to my prince i am one of his silent servants peggol grunted he evidently knew what that meant radnal didnt but he could guess something like an eye and ear he cried is there anyone in this cursed tour group not wearing a mask more to the point why drop the mask now peggol asked because my prince may the lion god give him many years does not want the bottomlands flooded moblay said we wouldnt suffer as badly as tartesh of course we own only a strip of the southernmost part but the prince fears the fighting that would follow who approached lissonland with word of this peggol said we learned from morgaf moblay answered the island king wanted us to join the attack on tartesh after the flood but the morgaffos denied the plot was theirs and would not tell us who had set the starbomb here we suspected the krepalgan unity but had no proof that was one reason i kept sniffing around the krepalgan women he grinned another should be obvious why krepalga peggol wondered aloud the unity didnt join morgaf against us in the last war what could they want enough to make them risk a war with starbombs radnal remembered the lecture hed given on how the bottomlands came to be remembered also his fretting about how far an unchecked flood might reach i know part of the answer to that i think he said peggol and moblay both turned to him he went on if the bottomlands flood the new central sea would stop about at krepalgas western border the unity would have a whole new coastline and be in a better position than either tartesh or lissonland to exploit the new sea the flood wouldnt get to krepalga for a long time moblay protested true radnal said but can you imagine stopping it before it did he visualized the map again i dont think you could not against that weight of water i think youre right peggol nodded decisively that may not be all krepalga has in mind but itll be part the unity must have been planning this for years theyll have looked at all the consequences they could let me help you now moblay said i heard freeman vez krobir say the donkeys are dead but what one walking man may do i shall radnal would have taken any ally who presented himself but peggol said no i am grateful for your candor and suspect you are truthful now but dare not take the chance one walking man could do much harm as well as good being of the profession i trust you understand moblay bowed i feared you would say that i do understand may the lion god go with you the three men walked back to the lodge the tourists rained questions on radnal no one has told us anything not a single thing golobol complained what is going on why are helos exploding to left and then to right tell me radnal told him and everyone else the stunned silence his words produced lasted perhaps five heartbeats then everybody started yelling nocso zev martois voice drowned all others does this mean we dont get to finish the tour more sensibly toglo zev pamdal said is there any way we can help you in your pursuit radnal vez thank you no youd need weapons we havent any to give you your best hope is to make for high ground you ought to leave as soon as you load all the water you can carry lie up in the middle of the day when the sun is worst with luck youll be up at the old continental shelf in oh a day and a half if the floods held off that long you ought to be safe for a while there and a helo may spot you as you travel what if the flood comes when were still down here eltsac vez martois demanded what then freeman knowitall then you have the consolation of knowing i drowned a few heartbeats before you i hope you enjoy it radnal said eltsac stared at him he went on thats all the stupidity i have time for now lets get you people moving peggol vez well send a couple of eyes and ears back too your men wont be much help traveling crosscountry come to that you no peggol said firmly my place is at the focus i shant lag and i shoot straight im not the worst tracker either radnal knew better than to argue all right the water bladders would have gone on the donkeys radnal filled them from the cistern while the militiamen and eyes and ears cut straps to fit them to human shoulders the eastern sky was bright pink by the time they finished radnal tried to give no tourists loads of more than a third of their body weight that was as much as anyone could carry without breaking down nocso vez martois said with all this water how can we carry food you cant radnal snapped he stared at her you can live off yourself a while but you cant live without water telling off his tourists was a new heady pleasure since it might be his last he enjoyed it while he could ill report your insolence nocso shrilled that is the least of my worries radnal turned to the eyes and ears who were heading up the trail with the tourists try to keep them together try not to do too much at midday make sure they all drink and make sure you do too gods be with you an eye and ear shook his head no freeman vez krobir with you if they watch you well be all right but if they neglect you we all fail radnal nodded to the tourists he said good luck if the gods are kind ill see you again at the top of trench park he didnt mention what would happen if the gods bumbled along as usual toglo said radnal vez if we see each other again i will use whatever influence i have for you thanks was all radnal could say under other circumstances getting patronage from the hereditary tyrants relative would have moved him to do great things even now it was kindly meant but of small weight when he first had to survive to gain it a sliver of redgold crawled over the eastern horizon the tourists and the eyes and ears trudged north a koprit bird on the rooftop announced the day with a cry of hig hig hig peggol ordered one of the remaining eyes and ears to stay at the lodge and send westward any helos that came then he said formally freeman vez krobir i place myself and freeman vez potos my colleague here under your authority command us if thats how you want it radnal answered shrugging you know what well do march west until we catch the krepalgans or drown whichever comes first nothing fancy lets go radnal the two eyes and ears the lodge attendants and the surviving militiamen started from the stables the morning light showed the tracks of three donkeys heading west the tour guide took out his monocular scanned the western horizon no luck dips and rises hid evillia and lofosa fer vez canthal said theres a high spot maybe three thousand cubits west of here you ought to look from there maybe radnal said if we have a good trail though im likelier to rely on that i begrudge wasting even a heartbeats time and spotting someone isnt easy even if he wants to be found remember that poor fellow who wandered off from his group four years ago they used helos dogs everything but they didnt find his corpse until a year later and then by accident thank you for pumping up my hopes peggol said nothing wrong with hope radnal answered but you knew the odds were bad when you decided to stay the seven walkers formed a loose skirmish line about five cubits apart from one another radnal the best tracker took the center at his right was horken vez sofana at his left peggol he figured they had the best chance of picking up the trail if he lost it that likelihood grew with every step evillia and lofosa hadnt gone straight west he quickly found that out instead theyd jink northwest for a few hundred cubits then southwest a few hundred more in a deliberate effort to throw off pursuit they also chose the hardest ground they could find which made the donkeys tracks tougher to follow radnals heart sank every time he had to cast about before they found the hoofprints again his group lost ground with every step the krepalgans rode faster than they could walk i have a question horken vez sofana suppose the starbomb goes off and the mountains fall how are these two women supposed to get away radnal shrugged he had no idea did you hear that peggol vez he asked yes peggol said two possibilities spring to mind i might have guessed radnal said hush as i was saying before you crassly interrupted one is that the starbomb was supposed to have a delayed detonation letting the perpetrators escape the other is that these agents knew the mission was suicidal morgaf has used such personnel so have we once or twice krepalga might find such servants however regrettable that prospect seems to us horken gave a slow deliberate nod what you say sounds convincing they might have first planned a delay to let them escape then shifted to sacrificing themselves when they found we were partway on to them true peggol said and they may yet be planning to escape if they somehow secreted away helium cylinders for instance they might inflate several prophylactics and float out of the bottomlands radnal wondered for a heartbeat if he was serious then the tour guide snorted i wish i could stay so cheerful at deaths door death will find me whether i am cheerful or not peggol answered i will go forward as boldly and as long as i can conversation flagged the higher the sun rose the hotter the desert became the more anything but putting one foot in front of the other seemed more trouble than it was worth radnal wiped sweat from his eyes as he slogged along the water bladder on his back started out as heavy as any pack hed ever toted he wondered how long he could go on with such a big burden but the bladder got lighter every time he refilled his canteen he made himself keep drinking not getting water in as fast as he sweated would be suicidal unlike the fanatic morgaffos peggol had mentioned he wanted to live if he could hed given everyone about two days worth of water if he didnt catch up to lofosa and evillia by the end of the second day he shook his head one way or another it wouldnt matter after that as noon neared he ordered the walkers into the shade of a limestone outcrop well rest a while he said when we start again it ought to be cooler not enough to help peggol said but he sat down in the shade with a grateful sigh he took off his stylish cap sadly felt of it itll make a dishrag after this nothing better radnal squatted beside him too hot to talk his heart pounded it seemed so loud he wondered if it would give out on him then he realized most of that beating rhythm came from outside fatigue fell away he jumped up doffed his own cap and waved it in the air a helo the rest of the group also got up and waved and yelled its seen us zosel vez glesir said nimbly as a dragonfly the helo shifted direction in midair and dashed straight toward them it set down about fifty cubits from the ledge its rotors kept spinning it was ready to take off again at any moment the pilot leaned out the window bawled something in radnals direction through the racket he had no idea what the fellow said the pilot beckoned him over the din and dust were worse under the whirling rotor blades radnal had to lean on tiptoe against the helos hot metal skin before he made out the pilots words how far ahead are the cursed krepalgans they had better than a daytenths start and theyre on donkeyback say up to thirty thousand cubits west of here radnal repeated himself several times before the pilot nodded and ducked back into his machine wait radnal screamed the pilot stuck his head out again radnal asked did you come across my group heading toward the trail up the old continental shelf yes somebody ought to be picking them up right about now good radnal bellowed the pilot tossed him a portable radiophone he seized it now he was no longer cut off from the rest of the search they sped the helo shot into the air sped away westward the tour guide knew relief even if he drowned the people hed led would be safe now that this helos here do we need to go on asked impac vez potos the eye and ear with peggol youd best believe it freeman radnal recounted the story of the lost tourist whod stayed lost no matter how many helos search theyll be covering a big area and trying to find people who dont want to be found we stay in the hunt till its over by the way the krepalgans fooled us all they wont make things easy shall we keep resting or head out now peggol asked radnal chewed on that for a few heartbeats if the helo was here that meant the people at tarteshem knew from its radiophone how bad things were and that meant helos would swarm here as fast as they could take off which meant his group would probably be able to get supplies but he didnt want to lose people to heatstroke either a risk that came with exertion in the desert well give it another tenth of a daytenth he said at last he was first up when the rest ended the other six rose with enough groans and creaking joints for an army of invalids well loosen up as we get going fer vez canthal said hopefully a little later panic ran through radnal when he lost the trail he waved for peggol and horken vez sofana they scoured the ground on hands and knees but found nothing rockhard dirt stretched in all directions for a couple of hundred cubits if they pulled up a bush and swept away their tracks well have a night demons time picking them up again horken said we wont try radnal declared the rest of the searchers looked at him in surprise he went on were wasting time here right no one disagreed so here is the last place we want to stay well do a search spiral zosel vez you stand here to mark this spot sooner or later well find the trail again you hope peggol said quietly yes i do if you have a better plan ill be grateful to hear it the eye and ear shook his head and a moment later dropped his eyes while zosel stood in place the other searchers tramped in a widening spiral after a hundred heartbeats impac vez potos shouted ive found it radnal and horken hurried to see what hed come across where radnal asked impac pointed to a patch of ground softer than most in the area sure enough it held marks the more experienced men squatted to take a better look they glanced up together their eyes met radnal said freeman vez potos those are the tracks of a bladetooth if you look carefully you can see where it dragged its tail in the dirt donkeys never do that oh impac said in a small sad voice radnal sighed he hadnt bothered mentioning that the tracks were too small for donkeys and didnt look like them either lets try once more he said the spiral resumed when impac yelled again radnal wished he hadnt tried to salve his feelings if he stopped them every hundred heartbeats theyd never find anything this time horken stayed where he was radnal stalked over to impac show me he growled impac pointed once more radnal filled his lungs to curse him for wasting their time the curse remained unspoken there at his feet lay the unmistakable tracks of three donkeys by the gods he said they are right this time impac asked anxiously yes thank you freeman radnal shouted to the other searchers the seven headed southwest following the recovered trail fer vez canthal went up to impac and slapped him on the back impac beamed as if hed performed bravely in front of the hereditary tyrant considering the service hed just done tartesh hed earned the right he was also lucky radnal thought but hed needed courage to call out a second time after being ignominiously wrong the first and sharp eyes to spot both sets of tracks even if he couldnt tell what they were once hed found them so more than luck was involved radnal slapped impacs back too sweat poured off radnal as it evaporated from his robes it cooled him a little but not enough like a machine taking on fuel he drank again and again from the bladder on his back now the sun was in his face he tugged his cap over his eyes kept his head down and tramped on when the krepalgans tried doubling back he spotted the ruse instead of following the wrong trail and wasting hundreds of precious heartbeats by then the western sky was full of helos they roared about in all directions sometimes low enough to kick up dust radnal wanted to strangle the pilots who flew that way they might blow away the trail too he yelled into the radiophone the lowflying helos moved higher a big transport helo set down a few hundred cubits in front of the walkers a door in its side slid open a squadron of soldiers jumped down and hurried west are they close or desperate radnal wondered desperate certainly peggol said as for close we can hope we havent drowned yet on the other handhe always thought of the other handwe havent caught your two sluts either they werent mine radnal said feebly but he remembered their flesh sliding against his the way their breath had caught the sweatsalty taste of their skin peggol read his face aye they used you radnal vez and they fooled you if it makes you feel better they fooled me too i thought they kept their brains in their twats they outsmarted me with the fornication books in their gear and the skin they showed they used our prudishness against us how could anyone who acts that way be dangerous its a ploy that wont work again once may have been plenty radnal wasnt ready to stop feeling guilty if it was youll pay full atonement peggol said radnal shook his head dying when the bottomlands flooded wasnt atonement enough not when that flood would ruin his nation and might start an exchange of starbombs that would wreck the world the ground shivered under his feet despite the furnace heat of the desert floor his sweat went cold please gods make it stop he said his first prayer in years it stopped he breathed again it was just a little quake he would have laughed at tourists for fretting over it at any other time he would have ignored it now it nearly scared him to death a koprit bird cocked its head peered down at him from a thornbush that held its larder highighig it said and fluttered to the ground radnal wondered if it could fly fast enough or far enough to escape a flood the radiophone let out a burst of static radnal thumbed it to let himself transmit vez krobir here this is combat group leader turand vez nital i wish to report that we have encountered the krepalgan spies both are deceased thats wonderful radnal relayed the news his companions raised a weary cheer then he remembered again his nights with evillia and lofosa and then he realized combat group leader vez nital hadnt sounded as overjoyed and relieved as he should have slowly he said whats wrong when encountered the krepalgans were moving eastward eastw oh you see the predicament turand said they appear to have completed their work and to have been attempting to escape now they are beyond questioning please keep your transmission active so a helo can home on you and bring you here you look to be tarteshs best hope of locating the bomb before its ignition i repeat please maintain transmission radnal obeyed he looked at the barrier mountains they seemed taller now than they had when he set out how long would they keep standing tall the sun was sliding down toward them too how was he supposed to search after dark he feared tomorrow morning would be too late he passed on to his comrades what the officer had said horken vez sofana made swimming motions radnal stooped for a pebble threw it at him a helo soon landed beside the seven walkers someone inside opened the sliding door come on he bawled move it move it moving it as fast as they could radnal and the rest scrambled into the helo it went airborne before the fellow at the door had it fully closed a couple of hundred heartbeats later the helo touched down hard enough to rattle the tour guides teeth the crewman at the door undogged it and slid it open out he yelled out radnal jumped the others followed a few cubits away stood a man in a uniform robe similar but not identical to the one the militia wore whos freeman vez krobir he said im turand vez nital im vez krobir i radnal broke off two bodies lay behind the tarteshan soldier radnal gulped hed seen corpses on their funeral pyres but never before sprawled out like animals waiting to be butchered he said the first thing that popped into his head they dont look like you shot them we didnt the officer said when they saw they couldnt escape they took poison they were professionals peggol murmured as may be turand growled this onehe pointed at evilliawasnt gone when we got to her she said youre too late and then died may night demons gnaw her ghost forever wed better find that cursed bomb fast then radnal said can you take us to where the krepalgans were cornered this very heartbeat turand said come with me its only three or four hundred cubits from here he moved at a trot that left the worn walkers gasping in his wake at last he stopped and waited impatiently for them to catch up this is where we found them and they were coming east you said radnal asked thats right though i dont know for how long the officer answered somewhere out there is the accursed starbomb were scouring the desert but this is your park maybe your eye will fall on something theyd miss if not you neednt go on radnal said i almost fouled my robe when we had that little tremor a while ago i thought id wash ashore on the krepalgan border ten million cubits from here if youre standing on a starbomb when it goes off you neednt fear the flood afterwards turand said gak radnal hadnt thought of that it would be quick anyhow enough chatter horken vez sofana said if were to search let us search search and may the gods lend your sight wings turand said the seven walkers trudged west again radnal did his best to follow the donkeys trail but the soldiers footprints often obscured them how are we supposed to track in this confusion he cried they might as well have turned a herd of humpless camels loose here its not quite so bad as that horken said stooping low he pointed to the ground look heres a track heres another a few paces on we can do it we have to do it radnal knew the senior trooper was right he felt ashamed of his own outburst he found the next hoofprint himself and the one after that those two lay on opposite sides of a faultline crack when he saw that he knew the starbomb couldnt rest too far away but he felt time pressing hard on his shoulders maybe the soldiers will have found the starbomb by now fer vez canthal said we cant count on it look how long it took them to find the krepalgans we have to figure its up to us radnal realized the weight on him wasnt just time it was also responsibility if he died now hed die knowing hed failed and yet while the searchers stirred through trench park the animals of the bottomlands kept living their usual lives they could not know they might perish in the next heartbeat a koprit bird skittered across the sand a few paces in front of radnal a clawed foot stabbed down its caught a shoveler skink he said as if the hot worn men with him were members of his group the lizard thrashed trying to get away sand flew every which way but the koprit bird held on with its claws tore at the skink with its beak and smashed it against the ground until its writhing ceased then it flew to a nearby thornbush with its victim it impaled the skink on a long stout thorn the lizard was the latest addition to its larder which also included two grasshoppers a baby snake and a jerboa and as koprit birds often did this one used the thornbushs spikes to display bright objects it had found a yellow flower now very dry must have hung there since the last rains and not far from the lizard the koprit bird had draped a couple of redorange strings over a thorn radnals eyes came to them passed by snapped back they werent strings he pointed arent those the necklaces evillia and lofosa wore yesterday he asked hoarsely they are peggol and horken said it together they both had to notice and remember small details they sounded positive when peggol tried to take the necklaces off their thorn the koprit bird furiously screeched highig claws outstretched it flew at his face he staggered backwards flailing his arms radnal waved his cap as he walked up to the thornbush that intimidated the bird enough to keep it from diving on him though it kept shrieking he grabbed the necklaces and got away from the larder as fast as he could the necklaces were heavier than hed expected too heavy for the cheap plastic hed thought them to be he turned one so he could look at it endon its got a copper core he said startled let me see that again peggol and horken spoke together they snatched a necklace apiece then peggol broke the silence alone detonator wire absolutely horken agreed never seen it with red insulator though usually it would be brown or green for camouflage this time it was camouflaged as jewelry radnal stared from horken to peggol you mean these wires would be hooked to the cell that would send the charge to the starbomb when the timer went off thats just what we mean peggol said horken vez sofana solemnly nodded but they cant now because theyre here not there fumbling for words radnal went on and theyre here because the koprit bird thought they were pretty or maybe it thought they were food theyre about the color of a shoveler skinks lure and pulled them loose and flew away with them realization hit then that koprit bird just saved tartesh the ugly thing almost put my eye out peggol grumbled the rest of the group ignored him one or two of them cheered more like radnal stood quietly too tired and dry and stunned to show their joy the tour guide needed several heartbeats to remember he carried a radiophone he clicked it on waited for turand vez nital what do you have the officer barked radnal could hear his tension hed felt it too till moments before the detonation wires are off the starbomb he said giving the good news first i dont know where that is but it wont go off without them after staticpunctuated silence turand said slowly are you daft how can you have the wires without the starbomb there was this koprit bird what turands roar made the radiophone vibrate in radnals hand as best he could he explained more silence followed at last the soldier said youre certain this is detonator wire an eye and ear and the trench park circumstances man both say it is if they dont recognize the stuff who would youre right another pause from turand then a koprit bird you say do you know that i never heard of koprit birds until just now his voice held wonder but suddenly he sounded worried again saying can you be sure the wire wasnt left there to fool us one last time no fear knotted radnals gut again had he and his comrades come so far done so much only to fall for a final deception horken let out a roar louder than turands had been ive found it he screamed from beside a spurge about twenty cubits away radnal hurried over horken said it couldnt have been far because koprit birds have territories so i kept searching and he pointed down at the base of the spurge lay a small timer hooked to an electrical cell the timer was upside down the koprit bird must have had quite a fight tearing loose the wires it prized radnal stooped turned the timer over he almost dropped it the needle that counted off the daytenths and heartbeats lay against the zero knob will you look at that he said softly impac vez potos peered over his shoulder the junior eye and ear clicked his tongue between his teeth a koprit bird horken said he got down on hands and knees poked around under every plant and stone within a couple of cubits of the spurge before a hundred heartbeats went by he let out a sharp wordless exclamation radnal got down beside him horken had tipped over a chunk of sandstone about as big as his head under it was a crack in the earth that ran out to either side from the crack protruded two drab brown wires a koprit bird horken repeated the helos and men would have been too late but the koprit bird hungry or out to draw females into its territory had spotted something colorful so radnal took out the radiophone weve found the timer it is separated from the wires which we presume lead to the starbomb the koprit bird took away the wires the krepalgans used to attach the timer a koprit bird now turand vez nital said it he sounded as dazed as any of the rest of them but quickly pulled himself together again thats excellent news as i neednt tell you ill send a crew to your location directly to begin excavating the starbomb out peggol vez menk had been examining the timer too his gaze kept returning to the green needle bisecting the zero symbol he said how deep do you suppose the bomb is buried it would have to be pretty deep to trigger the fault radnal answered i couldnt say how deep im no savant of geology but if turand vez nital thinks his crew will dig it up before nightfall hell have to think again how could krepalga have planted it here impac vez potos said wouldnt you trench park people have noticed trench park is a big place radnal said i know that i ought to ive walked enough of it impac said wearily still people dont frequent this area either radnal persisted ive never led a group anywhere near here no doubt the krepalgans took risks doing whatever they did but not enormous risks peggol said we shall have to ensure such deadly danger cannot return again whether we should expand the militia base regular soldiers here or set up a station for eyes and ears that i dont know we must determine which step offers the best security but we will do something you also have to consider which choice hurts trench park least radnal said that will be a factor peggol said but probably a small one think radnal vez if the barrier mountains fall and the western ocean pours down on the bottomlands how much will that hurt trench park radnal opened his mouth to argue more keeping the park in its natural state had always been vital to him man had despoiled so much of the bottomlands this was the best almost the only reminder of what theyd been like but hed just spent days wondering whether hed drown in the next heartbeat and all of today certain he would and if hed drowned his country would have drowned with him set against that a base for soldiers or eyes and ears suddenly seemed a small thing he said not another word radnal hadnt been in tarteshem for a long time though tarteshs capital wasnt far from trench park hed never been paraded through the city in an opentopped motor while people lined the sidewalks and cheered he should have enjoyed it peggol vez menk who sat beside him in the motor certainly did peggol smiled and waved as if hed just been chosen high priest after so long in the wide open spaces of the bottomlands though and after so long in his own company or that of small tour groups riding through the midst of so much tightpacked humanity more nearly overwhelmed than overjoyed radnal he looked nervously at the buildings towering over the avenue it felt more as if he were passing through a canyon than anything manmade radnal radnal the crowds chanted as if everybody knew him well enough to use his name in its most naked intimate form they had another cry too koprit bird koprit bird the gods praise the koprit bird that took away some of his nervousness seeing his grin peggol said anyone would think theyd seen the artists new work youre right radnal answered maybe its too bad the koprit bird isnt here for the ceremony after all peggol raised that eyebrow of his you talked them out of capturing it i know i did the right thing radnal said putting the koprit bird that stole the detonator wires in a cage didnt seem fitting trench park existed to let its creatures live wild and free with as little interference from mankind as possible the koprit bird had made it possible for that to go on caging it afterwards struck radnal as ungrateful the motor drove onto the grounds of the hereditary tyrants palace it pulled up in front of the gleaming building that housed bortav vez pamdal a temporary stage and a podium stood on the lawn near the road the folding chairs that faced it were full of dignitaries from tartesh and other nations no krepalgans sat in those chairs the hereditary tyrant had sent the plenipo from the krepalgan unity home ordered all krepalgan citizens out of tartesh and sealed the border so far hed done nothing more than that radnal both resented and approved of his caution in an age of starbombs even the attempted murder of a nation had to be dealt with cautiously lest a successful double murder follow a man in a fancy robe came up to the motor bowed low i am the protocol officer if you will come with me freemen radnal and peggol came the protocol officer led them onto the platform got them settled and hurried away to see to the rest of the seven walkers whose motors had parked behind the one from which the tour guide and the eye and ear had dismounted peering at the important people who were examining him radnal got nervous again he didnt belong in this kind of company but there in the middle of the second row sat toglo zev pamdal who smiled broadly and waved at him seeing someone he knew and liked made it easier for him to wait for the next part of the ceremony the tarteshan national hymn blared out radnal couldnt just sit he got up and put his hand over his heart until the hymn was done the protocol officer stepped up to the podium and announced freemen freeladies the hereditary tyrant bortav vez pamdals features adorned silver smiled down from public buildings and were frequently on the screen radnal had never expected to see the hereditary tyrant in person though in the flesh bortav looked older than he did on his images and not quite so firm and wise like a man in other words not a demigod but his ringing baritone proved all his own he spoke without notes for a quarter of a daytenth praising tartesh condemning those who had tried to lay her low and promising that danger would never come again in short it was a political speech since radnal cared more about the kidneys of the fat sand rat than politics he soon stopped paying attention he almost missed the hereditary tyrant calling out his name he started and sprang up bortav vez pamdal beckoned him to the podium as if in a dream he went bortav put an arm around his shoulder the hereditary tyrant was faintly perfumed freemen freeladies i present radnal vez krobir whose sharp eye spotted the evil wires which proved the gods had not deserted tartesh for his valiant efforts in preserving not only trench park not only the bottomlands but all tartesh i award him five thousand units of silver and to declare that he and all his heirs are henceforward recognized as members of our nations aristocracy freeman vez krobir the dignitaries applauded bortav vez pamdal nodded first to the microphone then to radnal making a speech frightened him worse than almost anything hed gone through in the bottomlands he tried to pretend it was a scientific paper thank you your excellency you honor me beyond my worth i will always cherish your kindness he stepped back the dignitaries applauded again perhaps because hed been so brief away from the mike the hereditary tyrant said stay up here by me while i reward your colleagues the other presentation for you is at the end bortav called up the rest of the seven walkers one by one he raised peggol to the aristocracy along with radnal the other five drew his praise and large sums of silver that seemed unfair to radnal without horken for instance they wouldnt have found the electrical cell and timer and impac had picked up the trail when even radnal lost it he couldnt very well protest even as the hero of the moment he lacked the clout to make bortav listen to him moreover he guessed no one had informed the hereditary tyrant hed been fornicating with evillia and lofosa a few days before they went out to detonate the buried starbomb bortav vez pamdal was a staunch conservative about morals he wouldnt have elevated radnal if hed known everything he did in trench park to salve his conscience radnal reminded himself that all seven walkers would have easier lives because of todays ceremony it was true he remained not quite convinced it was enough zosel vez glesir last to be called to the podium finished his thankyou and went back to his place bortav vez pamdal reclaimed the microphone as the applause for zosel died away the tyrant said our nation should never forget this near brush with disaster nor the efforts of all those within trench park who turned it aside to commemorate it i here display for the first time the insigne trench park will bear henceforward the protocol officer carried a clothcovered square of fiberboard not quite two cubits on a side over to radnal he murmured the veil unfastens from the top hold the emblem up so the crowd can see it as you lower the veil radnal obeyed the dignitaries clapped most of them smiled a few even laughed radnal smiled too what better way to symbolize trench park than a koprit bird perching on a thornbush bortav vez pamdal waved him to the microphone once more he said i thank you again your excellency now on behalf of all trench park staff we shall bear this insigne proudly he stepped away from the microphone then turned his head and hissed to the protocol officer what do i do with this thing lean it against the side of the podium the unflappable official answered well take care of it as radnal returned to his seat the protocol officer announced now well adjourn to the grand reception hall for drinks and a luncheon along with everyone else radnal found his way to the grand reception hall he took a glass of sparkling wine from a waiter with a silver tray then stood around accepting congratulations from important officials it was like being a tour guide he knew most of what he should say and improvised new answers along old themes in a flash of insight he realized the politicians and bureaucrats were doing the same thing with him the whole affair was formal as a figure dance when he saw that his nervousness vanished for good or so he thought until toglo came smiling up to him he dipped his head hello freelady its good to see you again if i was toglo zev through danger in trench park i remain toglo zev here safe in tarteshem she sounded as if his formality disappointed her good he said despite her pledge of patronage before she hiked away from the lodge plenty of people friendly to trench park staff in the bottomlands snubbed them if they met in the city he hadnt thought she was that type but better safe as if by magic bortav vez pamdal appeared at radnals elbow the hereditary tyrants cheeks were a little red he might have had more than one glass of sparkling wine he spoke as if reminding himself you already know my niece dont you freeman vez krobir your niece radnal stared from bortav to toglo shed called herself a distant collateral relation niece didnt fit that definition hope you enjoy your stay here bortav slapped radnal on the shoulder breathed wine into his face and ambled off to hobnob with other guests you never said you were his niece radnal said now that he was suddenly an aristocrat he might have imagined talking to the clanfather of the hereditary tyrants distant collateral relative but to talk to bortav vez pamdals brother or sisterhusband impossible maybe that made him sound peevish im sorry toglo answered radnal studied her expecting the apology to be merely for forms sake but she seemed to mean it she said bearing my clan name is hard enough anyway it would be harder yet if i told everyone how close a relative of the hereditary tyrants i am people wouldnt treat me like a human being believe me i know by the bitterness in her voice she did oh radnal said slowly i never thought of that toglo zev her smile when he used her name with the polite particle made him feel better you should have she told him when folk hear im from the pamdal clan they either act as if im made of glass and will shatter if they breathe on me too hard or else they try to see how much they can get out of me i dont care for either one thats why i minimize the kinship oh radnals snort of laughter was aimed mostly at himself i always imagined being attached to a rich and famous clan made life simpler and easier not the other way round i never thought anything bad might be mixed with that im sorry for not realizing it you neednt be she said i think youd have treated me the same even if youd known from the first heartbeat who my uncle happened to be i dont find that often so i treasure it radnal said id be lying if i told you i didnt think about which family you belonged to well of course radnal vez youd be stupid if you didnt think about it i dont expect that until the koprit bird i thought the gods were done with miracles but whatever you were thinking you didnt let it get in the way i tried to treat you as much like everyone else as i could he said i thought you did wonderfully she answered thats why we became friends so fast down in trench park its also why id like us to stay friends now id like that very much radnal said provided you dont think im saying so to try and take advantage of you i dont think youd do that though toglo kept smiling her eyes measured him shed said shed had people try to take advantage of her before radnal doubted those people had come off well being who you are makes it harder for me to tell you i also liked you very much down in the bottomlands he said yes i can see that it might toglo said you dont want me to think you seek advantage she studied radnal again this time he studied her too maybe the first person whod tried to turn friendship to gain had succeeded she was he thought a genuinely nice person but he would have bet his five thousand units of silver that shed sent the second such person packing being nice didnt make her a fool he didnt like her less for that maybe eltsac vez martois was attracted to fools but eltsac was a fool himself radnal had called himself many names but fool seldom the last time hed thought that about himself was when he found out what lofosa and evillia really were of course when he made a mistake he didnt do it halfway but hed managed to redeem himself with help from that koprit bird toglo said if we do become true friends radnal vez or perhaps even more than thata possibility he wouldnt have dared mention himself but one far from displeasingpromise me one thing what he asked suddenly wary i dont like friendship with conditions it reminds me too much of our last treaty with morgaf we havent fought the islanders in a while but we dont trust them or they us we saw that in the bottomlands too she nodded true still i hope my condition isnt too onerous go on he sipped his sparkling wine well then radnal vez krobir the next time i see you in a sleepsack with a couple of naked highhead girls or even strongbrows you will have to consider our friendship over some of the wine went up his nose that only made him choke worse dabbing at himself with a linen square gave him a few heartbeats to regain composure toglo zev you have a bargain he said solemnly they clasped hands the wheels of if l sprague de camp king oswiu of northumbria squirmed in his chair in the first place these synods bored him in the second his mathematics comprised the ability to add and subtract numbers under twenty on his fingers hence all this argument among the learned clerics assembled in whitby in the year of our lord about the date of easter and the phases of the moon and cycles of and years went over the kings head completely what did the exact date of easter matter anyhow if they wanted to why couldnt the latins celebrate their easter when they wanted and the ionans celebrate theirs the ionans had been doing all right as far as oswiu could see and then this wilfrid of york had to bring in his swarms of latin priests objecting to this and that as schismatic heretical etc they were abetted by oswius queen eanfled which put poor oswiu in an awkward position he not only wanted peace in the family but also hoped to attain to heaven some day moreover he liked the abbot colman leader of the ionans and he certainly didnt want any faroff bishop of rome sticking his nose into his affairs on the other hand king oswiu came to with a jerk father wilfrid was speaking to him directly the arguments of my learned friend he indicated the abbot colman of lindisfarne are very ingenious i admit but that is not the fundamental question the real decision is shall we accept the authority of his holiness of rome like good christians or wait a minute wait a minute interrupted oswiu why must we accept gregorys authority to be good christians im a good christian and i dont let any foreign the question my lord is whether one can be a good christian and a rebel against i am too a good christian bristled oswiu wilfrid of york smiled perhaps you remember the statement of our savior to peter the first bishop of rome thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven you see oswiu thought that put a different light on the matter if this fellow peter actually had the keys of heaven he turned to the abbot colman and asked is that a correct quotation it is my lord but just a minute just a minute youll get me all confused again if you start arguing now can you quote a text showing that equivalent powers were granted to saint columba the grave irishmans face registered sudden dismay he frowned in concentration so intense that one could almost hear the wheels well said oswiu speak up colman sighed no my lord i cannot but i can show that it is the latins not we who are departing from thats enough colman oswius singletrack mind once made up had no intention of being disturbed again i have decided that from this day forth the kingdom of northumbria shall follow the latin practice concerning easter and that we shall declare our allegiance to the roman bishop gregory lest when i come to the gates of heaven there would be none to open them for me he being my adversary who has the keys the synod is adjourned king oswiu went out avoiding the reproachful look that the abbot sent after him it was a dirty trick on colman who was a very decent chap but after all it wouldnt do to antagonize the heavenly doorman and maybe now eanfled would stop nagging him allister park rubbed his eyes and sat up in bed as he usually did he noticed nothing wrong until he looked at the sleeve of his pajamas he could not recall ever having had a pair of pajamas of that singularly repulsive green he couldnt recall having changed to clean pajamas the night before in short he couldnt account for these pajamas at all oh well probably eunice or mary had given them to him and hed put them on without thinking he yawned brushing his mouth with the back of his hand he jerked his hand away then he cautiously felt his upper lip he got out of bed and made for the nearest mirror there was no doubt about it he had a mustache he had not had a mustache when he went to bed the night before abdarrahman governor of cordoba for the khalifah hisham ibn abdalmalik lord of damascus protector of the faithful etc etc paced his tent like a caged leopard with claustrophobia he hated inactivity and to him the last six days of tentative skirmishing had been just that he glowered over his pepperandsalt beard at his chiefs sitting crosslegged in an ellipse on the rugs well he barked yezid spoke up but a little longer commanderinchief and the franks will melt away the infidels have little cavalry save gothic and aquitanian refugees without cavalry they cannot keep themselves fed our horse can range the country supplying us and cutting off help from our enemies there is no god but god yaqub snorted how long do you think our men will abide this fearful frankish climate the winter is almost upon us i say strike now while their spirits are still up this rabble of frankish farmers on foot will show some rare running have the armies of the faithful come this far by sitting in front of their enemies and making grimaces at them yezid delivered an impressive snort of his own just the advice one would expect from a dog of a maadite this karel who commands the infidels is no fool whos a dog yelped yaqub jumping up pig of a yemenite abdarrahman yelled at them until they subsided one major idea of this foray into francia was to bury the animosity between members of the two parties yezids starting a quarrel on political grounds put the governor in an embarrassing position as he was a yemenite himself he was still undecided an intelligent man he could see the sense to yezids fabian advice emotionally however he burned to get to grips with the army of charles mayor of austrasia and yezid should be punished for his insulting remark i have decided said abdarrahman that while there is much to be said on both sides yaqubs advice is the sounder nothing hurts an armys spirit like waiting besides god has planned the outcome of the battle anyway so why should we fear if he decides that we shall win we shall win therefore tomorrow saturday we shall strike the franks with all our force god is god and mohammed is his prophet but the next night abdarrahman lay dead by the banks of the river vienne near tours with his handsome face waxy in the starlight and blood in his pepperandsalt beard the austrasian line had held yezid who had been right was dead likewise and so was yaqub who had been wrong and the surviving arabs were fleeing back to narbonne and barcelona allister park opened the door of his apartment and grabbed up his times sure enough the date was monday april th just as it ought to have been the year was right too that ruled out the possibility of amnesia he went back to the mirror he was still a slightly stout man in his middle thirties with paleblue eyes and thinning sandy hair but he wasnt the same man the nose was different so were the eyebrows the scar under the chin was gone he gave up his selfinspection and got out his clothes at that juncture he got another shock the clothes werent his or rather they were clothes for a man of his size and of the quality that a selfindulgent bachelor with an income of a year would buy park didnt object to the clothes it was just that they werent his clothes park gave up speculation about his sanity for the nonce he had to get dressed breakfast he was sick of the more cardboardlike cereals to hell with it hed make himself some french toast if it put another inch on his middle hed sweat it off sunday at the new york athletic club the mail was thrust under his door he finished knotting his necktie and picked it up the letters were all addressed to a mr arthur vogel then allister park really awake did look around the apartment was built on the same plan as his own but it wasnt the same the furniture was different lots of little things were different such as a nick in the wall that shouldnt be there park sat down and smoked a cigarette while he thought there was no evidence of kidnapping which considering his business was not too unlikely a possibility hed gone to bed sunday night sober alone and reasonably early why should he wake up in another mans apartment he forgot for the moment that he had also awakened with another mans face before he had time to remember it the sight of the clock jostled him into action no time for french toast it would have to be semi edible cardboard after all but the real shock awaited him when he looked for his briefcase there was none neither was there any sign of the sheaf of notes he had so carefully drawn up on the conduct of the forthcoming antonini case that was more than important on his convicting the antonini gang depended his nomination for district attorney for the county of new york next fall the present da was due to get the bipartisan nomination to the court of general sessions at the same time he was planning with thoroughly dishonorable motives to invite martha up for dinner but he didnt want to have dinner with her until hed cleared this matter up the only trouble with calling her up was that the address book didnt have her name in it or indeed the name of anybody park had ever heard of neither was she listed in the phone book he dialed canal somebody said department of hospitals huh isnt this canal yes this is the department of hospitals well whats the district attorneys office then hell i ought to know my own office phone the district attorneys office is worth park groggily called worth mr parks office please what office did you ask for please the office of assistant district attorney park parks voice took on the metallic rasp racket bureau to you sister im sorry we have no such person listen young lady have you got a deputy assistant da named frenczko john frenczko you spell it with a z silence no im sorry we have no such person allister park hung up the old building at center was still there the racket bureau was still there but they had never heard of allister park they already had an assistant da of their own a man named hutchison with whom they seemed quite well satisfied there was no sign of parks two deputies frenczko and burt as a last hope park went over to the criminal courts building if he wasnt utterly mad the case of people v cassidy extortion ought to come up as soon after ten as it would take judge segal to read his calendar frenczko and burt would be in there after cassidys hide but there was no judge segal no frenczko no burt no cassidy very interesting mr park soothed the psychiatrist very interesting indeed the most hopeful feature is that you quite realize your difficulty and come to me now what i want to know interrupted park is was i sane up to yesterday and crazy since then or was i crazy up to then and sane now it seems hard to believe that one could suffer from a coherent set of illusions for thirtysix years replied the psychiatrist yet your present account of your perceptions seems rational enough perhaps your memory of what you saw and experienced today is at fault but i want to get straightened out my whole political future depends on it at least he stopped was there such an antonini gang was there a nomination awaiting an allister park if they were convicted i know said the psychiatrist gently but this case isnt like any i ever heard of you go ahead and wire denver for allister parks birth certificate well see if there is such a person then come back tomorrow park awoke looked around and groaned the room had changed again but he choked off his groan he was occupying a twin bed in its mate lay a fairtomiddling handsome woman of about his own age his groan had roused her she asked how are you feeling wally im feeling fine he mumbled the significance of his position was soaking in he had some trouble suppressing another groan about marriage he was an adherent of the whybuyacow philosophy as he had had occasion to make clear to many women by way of fair warning i hope you are said the woman anxiously you acted so queer yesterday do you remember your appointment with dr kerr i certainly do said park kerr was not the name of the psychiatrist with whom he had made the appointment the woman prepared to dress park gulped a little for years hed managed to get along without being mixed up with other mens wives ever since and he wished he knew her name a wellmannered man under those circumstances wouldnt refer to the woman as hey you what are we having for breakfast sweetiepie he asked with a sickly grin she told him adding you never called me that before dear when she started toward him with an expectant smile he jumped out of bed and dressed with frantic haste he ate silently when the woman inquired why he pointed to his mouth and mumbled canker sore it hurts to talk he fled as soon as he decently could without learning his wifes name his wallet told him his name was wallace heineman but little else about himself if he wanted to badly enough he could no doubt find out whom he worked for who his friends were which if any bank he had money in etc but if these daily changes were going to continue it hardly seemed worthwhile the first thing was to get back to that psychiatrist although the numbers of the streets were different the general layout was the same half an hours walking brought him to the block where the psychiatrists office had been the building had been on the southeast corner of fiftyseventh and eighth park could have sworn the building that now occupied that site was different however he went up anyway he had made a careful note of the office number his notebook had been missing that morning like all the rest of his or rather arthur vogels things still he remembered the number the number turned out to be that of a suite of offices occupied by williamson ostendorff cohen burke and williamson attorneys no they had never heard of parks brainman yes williamson ostendorff cohen burke and williamson had occupied those offices for years park came out into the street and stood a long time thinking a phenomenon that he had hitherto noticed only vaguely now puzzled him the extraordinary number of union jacks in sight he asked the traffic cop about it the cop looked at him kings buithday he said what king why our king of course david the fuist the cop touched his finger to the peak of his cap park settled himself on a park bench with a newspaper the paper was full of things like references to the recent anglorussian war the launching of the queen victoria his majestys visit to a soap factory where he displayed a keen interest in the technical problems involved in the victory of massachusetts over quebec in the intercolonial football matches massachusetts a colony and football in april the trial of one diedrichs for murdering a man with a crosscut saw all this was very interesting especially the diedrichs case but allister park was more concerned with the whereabouts and probable fate of the antonini gang he also thought with gentle melancholy of mary and eunice and dorothy and martha and joan and but that was less important than the beautiful case he had dug up against such a slimy set of public enemies even park despite the cynical view of humanity that public prosecutors get had felt a righteous glow when he tallied up the evidence and knew he had them and the nomination was not to be sneezed at either it just happened that he was available when it was a protestants turn at that nomination if he missed out hed have to wait while a catholic and a jew took theirs since you had to be one or the other to get nominated at all park had become perforce a church member and regular if slightly hypocritical goer his plan was after a few terms as da to follow the incumbent da onto the bench you would never have guessed it but inside allister park lingered enough of the idealism that as a young lawyer he had brought from colorado to give the bench an attractiveness not entirely comprised of salary and social position he looked in his pockets there was enough there for one good bender of the rest of the day he never could remember much afterwards he did remember giving a pound note to an old woman selling shoelaces leading a group of drunks in a song about one columbo who knew the world was roundo unexpurgated and trying to take a firemans hose away from him on the ground that the city was having a water shortage he awoke in another strange room without a trace of a hangover a quick look around assured him that he was alone it was time he thought that he worked out a system for the investigation of his identity on each successive morning he learned that his name was wadsworth noe the pants of all the suits in his closet were baggy knee pants plus fours something was going ping ping ping like one of those tactful alarm clocks park located the source of the noise in a goosenecked gadget on the table which he finally identified as a telephone as the transmitter and receiver were built into a single unit on the end of the gooseneck there was nothing to lift off the hook he pressed a button in the base a voice spoke waddy ohyeah whos this this is your little bunnykins park swore under his breath the voice sounded female and young and had a slight indefinable accent he stalled how are you this morning oh im fine hows my little butterball park winced wadsworth noe had a figure even more portly than allister parks park with effort infused syrup into his voice oh im fine too sweetiepie only im lonesome as all hell oh isnt that too bad oo poor little thing shall i come up and cook dinner for my precious id love it a plan was forming in parks mind hitherto all these changes had taken place while he was asleep if he could get somebody to sit around and watch him while he stayed up the date was made park found hed have to market on the street aside from the fact that all the men wore plus fours and widebrimmed hats the first thing that struck him was the sight of two dark men in uniform they walked in step down the middle of the sidewalk their walk implied that they expected people to get out of their way people got as the soldiers passed him park caught a sentence in a foreign language sounding like spanish at the market everyone spoke with that accent park had heard over the phone they fell silent when another pair of soldiers entered these loudly demanded certain articles of food a clerk scurried around and got the order the soldiers took the things and departed without paying park thought of going to a library to learn about the world he was in but if he were going to shift again it would hardly be worthwhile he bought a new york record noticing that the stand also carried a lot of papers in french and spanish back in his apartment he read of his majesty napoleon v apparently emperor of new york city and god knew what else his little bunnykins turned out to be a smallish dark girl not badlooking who kissed him soundly she said where have you been the last few days waddy i havent heard from you for simply ages i was beginning to think youd forgotten me oo hasnt forgotten has oo me forget why sweetiepie i couldnt any more forget you than i could forget my own name and what the hells that he asked himself wordsworth no wadsworth noe thank god give us another kiss she looked at him what makes you talk so funny waddy canker sore said allister park ooo you poor angel let me see it its all right how about that famous dinner at least wadsworth noe kept a good cellar after dinner park applied himself cautiously to this it gave an excuse for just sitting park asked the girl about herself she chattered on happily for some hours then her conversation began to run dry there were long silences she looked at him quizzically are you worrying about something waddy somehow you seem like a different man no he lied im not worrying she looked at the clock i suppose i ought to go she said hesitantly park sat up oh please dont she relaxed and smiled i didnt think youd let me just wait she disappeared into the bedroom and presently emerged in a filmy nightgown allister park was not surprised but he was concerned attractive as the girl was the thought of solving his predicament was more so besides he was already sleepy from the liquors he had drunk how about making some coffee sweetiepie he asked she acquiesced the making and drinking of the coffee took another hour it was close to midnight to keep the ball rolling park told some stories then the conversation died down again the girl yawned she seemed puzzled and a bit resentful she asked are you going to sit up all night that was just what park intended to do but while he cast about for a plausible reason to give he stalled ever tell you about that man wugson i met last week funniest chap you ever saw he has a big bunch of hairs growing out the end of his nose he went on in detail about the oddities of the imaginary mr wugson the girl had an expression of whatdididotodeservethis she yawned again click allister park rubbed his eyes and sat up he was on a hard knobby thing that might by gross misuse of the language be called a mattress his eyes focussed on a row of iron bars he was in jail allister parks day in jail proved neither interesting nor informative he was marched out for meals and for an hour of exercise nobody spoke to him except a guard who asked hey there chief who ja think you are today huh julius caesar park grinned nope im god this time this was getting to be a bore if one could do this flitting about from existence to existence voluntarily it might be fun as it was one didnt stay put long enough to adjust oneself to any of these worlds ofillusion the next day he was a shabby fellow sleeping on a park bench the city was still new york no it wasnt it was a different city built on the site of new york he had money for nothing more than a bottle of milk and a loaf of bread these he bought and consumed slowly while reading somebodys discarded newspaper reading was difficult because of the queer spelling and the people had an accent that required the closest attention to understand he spent a couple of hours in an art museum the guards looked at him as if he were something missed by the cleaners when it closed he went back to his park bench and waited night came a car at least a four wheeled power vehicle drew up and a couple of cops got out park guessed they were cops because of their rhinestone epaulets one asked are you john gilby he pronounced it air yew thawn gilbь but allister park caught his drift damned if i know brother am i the cops looked at each other hes him all right said one to park come along park learned little by little that he was not wanted for anything more serious than disappearance he kept his own counsel until they arrived at the stationhouse inside was a fat woman she jumped up and pointed at him crying raucously thats him thats the dirty deserter running off and leaving his poor wife to starve the back of me hand to you you dirty please mrs gilby said the desk sergeant the woman was not to be silenced heaven curse the day i met you sergeant darlin what can i do to put the dirty loafer in jail where he belongs well said the sergeant uncomfortably you can charge him with desertion of course but dont you think youd better go home and talk it over we dont want to hey cried park they looked at him ill take jail if you dont mind click once again he was in bed it was a real bed this time he looked around the place had the unmistakable air of a sanitarium or hospital oh well park rolled over and went to sleep the next day he was still in the same place he began to have hopes then he remembered that as the transitions happened at midnight he had no reason for assuming that the next one would not happen the following midnight he spent a very boring day a physician came in asked him how he was and was gone almost before park could say fine people brought him his meals if hed been sure he was going to linger hed have made vigorous efforts to orient himself and to get out but as it was there didnt seem any point the next morning he was still in bed but when he tried to rub his eyes and sit up he found that his wrists and ankles were firmly tied to the four posts this wasnt the same bed nor the same room it looked like a room in somebodys private house and at the foot of the bed sat the somebody a small grayhaired man with piercing black eyes that gleamed over a sharp nose for a few seconds allister park and the man looked at each other then the mans expression underwent a sudden and alarming change as if internal pain had gripped him he stared at his own clothes as if he had never seen them before he screamed jumped up and dashed out of the room park heard his feet clattering down stairs and the slam of a front door then nothing allister park tried pulling at his bonds but the harder he pulled the tighter they gripped so he tried not pulling which brought no results either he listened there was a faint hiss and purr of traffic outside he must be still in a city though it seemed a fairly quiet one a stair creaked park held his breath somebody was coming up and without unnecessary noise more than one man park thought listening to the creaks somebody stumbled from far below a voice called up a question that park couldnt catch there were several quick steps and the smack of a fist the door of parks room was ajar through the crack appeared a vertical strip of face including an eye the eye looked at park and park looked at the eye the door jerked open and three men pounced into the room they wore floppy trousers and loose blouses that might have come out of a russian ballet they had large flat pentagonal faces redbrown skins and straight black hair they peered behind the door and under the bed what the hell asked allister park the largest of the three men looked at him youre not hurt hallow no but im damn sick of being tied up the large mans face showed a flicker of surprise the large man cut parks lashings park sat up rubbing his wrists and learned that he was wearing a suit of coarse woolen underwear wheres the rascally noggle asked the large brown man although he rolled his rs like a scot he did not look like a scot park thought he might be an asiatic or an american indian you mean the little grayhaired bird sure you know the scoundrel he pronounced the k in know suppose i do when i woke up he was in that chair he looked at me and beat it out of here as if all the bats of hell were after him maybe hes gone daft but the weighty thing is to get you out one of the men got a suit out of the closet resembling the three mens clothes but somber gray allister park dressed the tenseness of the men made him hurry though he didnt take all this very seriously yet working his feet into the elasticsided shoes with the big metal buckles park asked how long have i been here you dropped from the ken of a man a week ago today replied the large man with a keen look a week ago today he had been allister park assistant district attorney the next day he hadnt been it was probably not a mere coincidence he started to take a look at his new self in the mirror before he could do more than glimpse a weeks growth of beard two of the men were gently pulling his arms toward the door there was something deferential about their urgency park went along he asked what do i do now that takes a bit of thinking on said the large man it might not be safe for you to go home shh he stole dramatically down the stairs ahead of them of course he continued you could put in a warrant against joseph noggle what good would that do not much i fear if noggle was put up to this by macsvensson you can be sure the lazy knicks wouldnt find him park had more questions but he didnt want to give himself away any sooner than he had to the house was old decorated in a curious geometrical style full of hexagons and spirals on the ground floor sat another brown man in a rocking chair in one hand he held a thing like an automobile grease gun with a pistol grip across the room sat another man with a black eye looking apprehensively at the gunthing the one in the chair got up took off his bonnet and made a bow toward park he said haw hallow were you hurt hell live over it glory be to patrick said the big one whom the others addressed as sachem this person now glowered at the man with the black eye nay alarums understand or he drew the tip of his forefinger in a quick circle on the crown of his head it dawned on park that he was outlining the part of the scalp that an indian might remove as a trophy they quickly went out glancing up and down the street it was early morning few people were visible parks four companions surrounded him in a way that suggested that much as they respected him he had better not make a break the sidewalk had a woodblock paving at the curb stood a wellstreamlined automobile the engine seemed to be in the rear from the size of the closedin section park guessed it to be huge they got in the instrument board had more knobs and dials than a transport plane the sachem started the car noiselessly another car blew a resonant whistle and passed them wagging a huge tail of water vapor park grasped the fact that the cars were steampowered hence the smooth silent operation hence also the bulky engine and the complex controls the buildings were large but low park saw none over eight or ten stories the traffic signals had semaphore arms with stai and com on them where are you taking me asked park outside the burg bounds first said the sachem then well think on the next park wondered what was up they were still respectful as all hell but there was something ominous about their haste to get outside the burg bounds which park took to be the city limits he said experimentally im half starved a couple of the brown men echoed these sentiments so the sachem presently stopped the car at a restaurant park looked around it except for that odd geometric style of decoration it was much like other restaurants the world over whats the program he asked the sachem park had known some heavy drinkers in his time but never one who washed his breakfast pancakes down with whiskey as the large brown man was now doing thatll be seen said the sachem what did noggle try to do to you never did find out theres been an under talk about the swapping of minds i wonder if where are you going be right back said park heading for the mens room in another minute the sachem would have cornered him on the question of identity they watched him go once in the mens room he climbed onto a sink opened a window and squirmed out into the adjacent alley he put several blocks between himself and his convoyers before he slowed down his pockets failed to tell him whose body he had his only mark of identification was a large gold ring with a celtic cross he had a few coins in one pocket wherewith he bought a newspaper careful searching disclosed the following item bisjap stil mising at a lжt aur jestrdai nee toocan had ben faund of yi mising bisjap ib scoglund of yi niu belfast bisjapric of yi

bihaaf of yi screlingz haz bimikst him in a fiirs yingli scцfal it looked to park as though some german or norwegian had tried to spell english or what passed for english in this city phonetically according to the rules of his own language with a little middle english or anglosaxon thrown in he made a tentative translation bishop still missing at a late hour yesterday no token sign had been found of the missing bishop ib scoglund of the new belfast bishopric of the celtic christian church whose vanishing a week ago has stirred the burg city cnicts police say they are leaving no stone unturned in their strife effort to find the whereabouts of the missing preacher it sounded like him all right what a hell of a name ib scoglund the next step was to find where he lived if they had telephones they ought to have telephone directories half an hour later park approached the bishops house if he were going to change again at midnight the thing to do would be to find some quiet place relax and await the change however he felt that the events of the week made a pattern of which he thought he could see the beginnings of an outline if his guesses were right he had arrived at his destination the air was moderately warm and a bit sticky as new york city air might well be in april a woman passed him leading a floppyeared dog she was stout and fiftyish although park did not think that a skirt that cleared her knees by six inches became her that was what was being worn as he turned the corner onto what ought to be his block he sighted a knot of people in front of a house two men in funny steeplecrowned hats sat in an open car they were dressed alike and park guessed they were policemen park pulled his bonnet a thing like a breton peasants hat over one side of his face he walked past on the opposite side of the street looking unconcerned the people were watching no his number there was an alley on one side of the house park walked to the next corner crossed and started back toward no he had almost reached the entrance to the alley when one of the men spotted him with a cry of theres the bishop himself the men on the sidewalk there were four ran toward him the men in the funny hats got out of their vehicle and followed park squared his shoulders he had faced down wardheelers who invaded his apartment to tell him to lay off certain people or else however far from being hostile these shouted wherrre ya been hallow were you kidnapped ja lose your recall how about a wording all produced pads and pencils park felt at home he asked whos it for one of the men said im from the sooth the what the new belfast sooth weve been upholding you on the skrelling question park looked serious ive been investigating conditions the men looked puzzled park added you know looking into things oh said the man from the sooth peering the kilters eh the men in the funny hats arrived one of the pair asked any wrongdoings bishop want to mark in a slur park fumbling through the mazes of this dialect figured that he meant file a complaint he said no im all right thanks anyway but cried the hat are you sure you dont want to mark in a slur well take you to the lair if you do no thank you said park the hats sidled up to him one on either side in the friendliest manner they took his arms and gently urged him toward the car saying sure you want to mark in a slur we was sent special to get you so you could if somebody kidnapped you you must or its helping wrongdoing you know its just a little way to the lair park had been doing some quick thinking they had an ulterior reason for wanting to get him to the lair presumably a police station but manhandling a bishop especially in the presence of reporters just wasnt done he wrenched loose and jumped into the doorway of no he snapped i havent got any slurs and im not going to your lair get me aw but hallow we wasnt going to hurt you only if you have a slur you have to mark it in thats the law see the man his voice a pleading whine came closer and reached for parks sleeve park cocked a fist saying if you want me for anything you can get a warrant otherwise the soothll have a story about how you tried to kidnap the bishop and how he knocked the living bejesus out of you the reporters made encouraging noises the hats gave up and got back in their car with some remark about hell sure give us hell they departed park pulled the little handle on the door something went bong bong inside the reporters crowded around asking questions park trying to look the way a bishop should held up a hand im very tired gentlemen but ill have a statement for you in a few days they were still pestering him when the door opened inside a small monkeylike fellow opened his mouth hallow colman keep us from harm he cried im sure he will said park gravely stepping in how about some food surely surely said monkeyface but but what on earth has your hallowship been doing ive been fair sick with worry peering the kilters old boy peering the kilters park followed monkeyface upstairs as if he had intended going that way of his own accord monkeyface doddered into a bedroom and busied himself with getting out clean clothes park looked at a mirror he was as he had been throughout his metamorphoses a stocky man with thinning light hair in the middle thirties while he was not allister park neither was he very different from him the reddish stubble on his face would have to come off in the bathroom park found no razor he stumbled on a contraption that might be an electric razor he pushed the switch experimentally and dropped the thing with a yell it had bitten a piece out of his thumb holding the injured member park cut loose with the condemnatory vocabulary that ten years of work among new york citys criminal class had given him monkeyface stood in the doorway eyes big park stopped his swearing long enough to rasp damn your lousy little soul dont stand there get me a bandage the little man obeyed he applied the bandage as though he expected park to begin the practice of cannibalism on him at any moment whats the matter said park i wont bite you monkeyface looked up begging pardon your hallowship but i thock you wouldnt allow the swearing of aiths in your presence and now such frickful aiths i never did hear oh said park he remembered the penetrating look the sachem had given his mild damns and hells naturally a bishop would not use such language at least not where he could be overheard youd better finish my shave he said monkeyface still looked uneasy begging your forgiveness again hallow but what makes you talk such a queer speech canker sore growled park shaved he felt better he bent a kindly look on monkeyface listen he said your bishop has been consorting with low uncouth persons for the past week so dont mind it if i fall into their way of speaking only dont tell anybody see sorry i jumped on you just now dyou accept my apology yes yes of course hallow all right then how about that famous breakfast after breakfast he took his newspaper and the pile of mail into the bishops wellequipped library he looked up screling in the wцrdbuk or dictionary a screling was defined as one of the aboriginal inhabitants of vinland vinland stirred a faint chord something hed learned in school the atlas contained a map of north america a large area in the north and east thereof bounded on the west and south by an irregular line running roughly from charleston to winnipeg was labeled the bretwaldate of vinland the remaining twothirds of the continent comprised half a dozen political areas with such names as dacoosja tjeroogia aztecia park referring back to the dictionary derived these from dakota cherokee aztec etcetera in a couple of hours telephone calls began coming in monkeyface according to his instructions told one and all that the bishop was resting up and couldnt be disturbed park meanwhile located a pack of pipes in the library and a can of tobacco he got out several pads of paper and sharpened a dozen pencils monkeyface announced lunch park told him to bring it in he announced dinner park told him to bring it in he announced bedtime park told him to go soak his head he went clucking he had never seen a man work with such a fury of concentration for so long at a stretch let alone his master but then he had never seen allister park reviewing the evidence for a big criminal case history according to the encyclopedia was much the same as park remembered it down to the dark ages tracing down the point at which the divergence took place he located the fact that king oswiu of northumbria had decided in favor of the celtic christian church at the synod of whitby ad park had never heard of the synod or of king oswiu but the encyclopedia ascribed to this decision the rapid spread of the celtic form of christianity over great britain and scandinavia hence it seemed to park that probably in the history of the world he had come from the king had decided the other way the roman christian church had held most of its ground in northern europe for a century more but the fate of its influence there had been sealed by the defeat of the franks by the arabs at tours the arabs had occupied all southern gaul before they were finally stopped and according to the atlas they were still there the pope and the lombard duchies of italy had at once placed themselves under the protection of the byzantine emperor leo the iconoclast a greekspeaking roman empire still occupied anatolia and the balkans under a serbian dynasty a danish king of england named gorm had brought both the british isles and scandinavia under his rule as knut had done in parks world but gorms kingdom proved more durable than knuts the connection between england and scandinavia had survived despite intervals of disunion and civil war down to the present north america was discovered by one ketil ingolfsson in ad enough norse english and irish colonists had migrated thither during the eleventh century to found a permanent colony from which the bretwaldate of vinland had grown their language while descended from anglosaxon naturally contained fewer words of latin and french origin than parks english the indians screlingz or skrellings had not proved a pushover as the colonists had neither the gunpowder nor the numbers that the whites of parks history had had by the time the whites had reached the present boundaries of vinland expelling or enslaving the skrellings as they went the remaining natives had acquired enough knowledge of ferrous metallurgy and organized warfare to hold their own those that remained in vinland were no longer slaves but were still a suppressed class suffering legal and economic disabilities he bishop ib scoglund was a crusader for the removal of these disabilities hallow was simply a respectful epithet meaning about the same as reverend an italian named caravello had invented the steam engine about and the industrial revolution had followed as a matter of course it was the following morning when park having caught the three hours of sleep that sufficed for him when necessary was back at the books that monkeyface right name eric dunedin came timidly in he coughed deferentially the pigeon came with a writing from thane callahan park frowned up from his mountain of printed matter who never mind lets see it he took the note it read spelling conventionalized dear hallow why in the name of the blood witnesses of belfast did you run away from us yesterday the papers say you have gone back home isnt that risky must have a meeting with you forthwith shall be at bridgets beach this noon waiting respectfully r c park asked dunedin tell me is callahan a tall heavy guy who looks like an in a skrelling dunedin looked at him oddly by this time park was getting pretty well used to being looked at oddly dunedin said but he is a skrelling hallow the sachem of all the skrellings of vinland hm so hell meet me at this beach why the devil cant he come here ooooh but hallow bethink what happened to him the last time the new belfast knicks caught him whatever that was park reckoned he owed the sachem something for the rescue from the clutches of the mysterious mr noggle the note didnt sound like one from a wouldbe abductor to his escaped prey but just in case park went out to the modest episcopal automobile dunedin called it a wain and put a wrench in his pocket he told dunedin youll have to drive this thing my thumbs still sore it took a few minutes to get steam up as they rolled out of the driveway a car parked across the street started up too park got a glimpse of the men therein while they were in civilian clothes as he was they had a grim plainclothesman look about them after three blocks the other car was still behind them park ordered dunedin to go around the block the other car followed park asked can you shake those guys ii dont know your hallowship im not very good at fast driving slide over then how in hell do you run this thing you mean you dont know never mind roared park wheres the accelerator or throttle or whatever you call it oh the strangle there dunedin pointed a frankly terrified finger and the brake the wain jumped ahead with a rush park spun it around a couple of corners getting the feel of the wheel the mirror showed the other car still following park opened the strangle and whisked around the next corner no sooner had he straightened out than he threw the car into another dizzy turn the tires screeched and dunedin yelped as they shot into an alleyway the pursuers whizzed by without seeing them an eggbald man in shirtsleeves popped out of a door in the alley hi he said this aint no hitching place he looked at parks left front fender clucking looks like you took off some paint park smiled i was just looking for a room and i saw your sign how much are you asking fortyfive a month park made a show of writing this down he asked whats the address please one twentyfive isleif thanks ill be back maybe park backed out with a scrape of fender against stone and asked dunedin directions dunedin gray of face gave them park looked at him and chuckled nothing to be scared of old boy i knew i had a good two inches clearance on both sides the sachem awaited park in the shade of the bathhouse he swept off his bonnet with a theatrical flourish haw hallow a fair day for our tryst park reflected that on a dull day you could smell rufus callahans breath almost as far as you could see rufus callahan he continued the west ends best for talk i have a local knick watching in case greenfield sends a prowler did they follow you out park told him meanwhile wondering how to handle the interview so as to make it yield the most information they passed the end of the bathhouse and allister park checked his stride the beach was covered with naked men and women not quite naked each had a gaily colored belt of elastic webbing around his or her middle just that park resumed his walk at callahans amused look callahan said if the head knick lewis werent a friend of mine i shouldnt be here if i ever did get pulled upwell the judges are all macsvenssons men just as greenfield is park remembered that offa greenfield was mayor of new belfast callahan continued while macsvenssons away the pushing eases a little whens he due back asked park in a week maybe callahan waved an arm toward distant new belfast what a fair burg and what a wretched wick to rule it how do you like it why i live there dont i callahan chuckled wonderful my dear hallow wonderful in another week nobodyll know you arent his hallowship at all meaning what oh you neednt look at me with that wooden face youre nay mair bishop scoglund than i am yeah said park noncommittally he lit one of the bishops pipes how about a jinn asked callahan park looked at him until the sachem got out a cigarette park lit it for him silently conceding one to the opposition how was he to know that a jinn was a match he asked suppose i was hit on the head the big skrelling grinned broadly that mick spoil your recall in spots but it wouldnt give you that frickful wordtone you were using when we befreed you i see youve gotten rid of most of it by the way how did you do that in thirty some hours park gave up the man might be just a slightly drunken indian with a conspiratorial manner but he had the goods on allister he explained i found a bunch of records of some of my sermons and played them over and over on the machine my my you are a cool one joe noggle mick have done worse when he picked your mind to swap with the bishops who are you in sooth or perhaps i should say who were you park puffed placidly ill exchange information but i wont give it away when callahan agreed to tell park all he wanted to know park told his story callahan looked thoughtful he said im nay brainwizard but they do say theres a theory that every time the history of the world hinges on some decision there are two worlds one that which would happen if the card fell one way the other that which would follow from the other which is the real one that i cant tell you but they do say noggle can swap minds with his thocks and i dont doubt its swapping between one of these possible worlds and another they mean he went on to tell park of the bishops efforts to emancipate the skrellings in the teeth of the opposition of the ruling diamond party this partys strength was mainly among the rural squirearchy of the west and south but it also controlled new belfast through the local boss ivor macsvensson if scoglunds amendment to the bretwaldates constitution went through at the next session of the national thing as seemed likely if the ruby party ousted the diamonds at the forthcoming election the squirearchy might revolt the independent skrelling nations of the west and south had been threatening intervention on behalf of their abused minority that sounded familiar to park except that if he took what he had read and heard at its face value the minority really had something to kick about this time the diamonds wouldnt mind a war because in that case the elections which they expected to lose would be called off youre not listening thane park or should i say hallow scoglund nice little number said park nodding toward a pretty blonde girl on the beach callahan clucked such a wording from a strict wedless what youre a pillar of the church arent you oh my lord park hadnt thought of that angle the celtic christian church despite its libertarian tradition was strict on the one subject of sex anyhow said callahan what shall we do with you for youre bound to arouse mistrust park felt the wrench in his pocket i want to get back got a whole career going to smash in my own world unless the fellow whos running your body knows what to do with it not much chance park could visualize frenczko or burt frantically calling his apartment to learn why he didnt appear the unintelligible answers they would get from the bewildered inhabitant of his body the cops screaming up in the strugglebuggy to cart the said body off to belleview the headline prosecutor breaks down so they yanked me here as a bit of dirty politics eh ill get back but meantime ill show em some real politics callahan continued the only man who could unswap you is joseph noggle and hes in his own daffybin huh they found him wandering about clean daft its a good deed you didnt put in a slur against him theyd have stripped you in court in nay time maybe thats what they wanted to do thats an idea thats why they were so anxious for you to go to the lair i dont doubt theyll be watching for to pull you up on some little charge it wont matter whether youre guilty or not once they get hold of you youre headed for noggles inn what a way to get rid of the awkward bishop without pipe or knife when callahan had departed with another flourish park looked for the girl she had gone too the day was blistering and the water inviting since you didnt need a bathing suit to swim in vinland why not try it park returned to the bathhouse and rented a locker he stowed his clothes and looked at himself in the nearest mirror the bishop didnt take half enough exercise he thought looking at the waistline hed soon fix that no excuse for a mans getting out of shape that way he strolled out feeling a bit exposed with his white skin among all these bronzed people but not showing it in his welldisciplined face a few stared maybe it was his whiteness maybe they thought they recognized the bishop he plunged in and headed out he swam like a porpoise but shortness of breath soon reminded him that the bishops body wasnt up to allister parks standards he cut loose with a few casual curses since there was nobody to overhear and swam back as he dripped out onto the sand a policeman approached thundering you youre under stoppage what for shameful outputting but look at those protested park waving at the other bathers thats just it come along now park went forgetting his anger in concern as to the best method of avoiding trouble if the judges were macsvensson men and macsvensson was out to expose him he dressed under the cops eagle eye thanking his stars hed had the foresight to wear nonclerical clothes the cop ordered give your name and address to the bookholder allister park isleif street new belfast the clerk filled out a blank the cop added a few lines to it park and the cop went and sat down for a while waiting park watched the legal procedure of this little court keenly the clerk called thane park and handed the form up to the judge the cop went over and whispered to the judge the judge said all women will kindly leave the courtroom there were only three they went out allister park said the judge you are marked with shameful outputting how do you plead i dont understand this your honor i mean your жrness said park i wasnt doing anything the other people on the beach werent the judge frowned knick woodson says you afterthockly exposeduh the judge looked embarrassed you afterthockly output your uh he lowered his voice your navel he hissed the judge blushed is that considered indecent dont try to be funny its not in good taste i ask you again how do you plead park hesitated a second do you recognize the plea of non vult whats that latin we dont use latin here well then a plea that i didnt mean any harm and am throwing myself on the mercy of the court oh you mean a plea of good will thats not usually used in a freerighters court but i dont see why you cant whats your excuse you see your honor ive been living out in dakotia for many years and ive rather gotten out of civilized habits but ill catch on quickly enough if you want a character reference my friend ivor macsvensson will give me one the judges eyebrows went up like a buzzard hoisting its wings for the takeoff you ken thane macsvensson oh sure hrrrmph well hes out of town but uh if thats so im sure youre a good burger i hereby sentence you to ten days in jail sentence withheld until i can check your mooding and thereafter on your good acting you are free like a good thanes thane eric dunedin kept his curiosity to himself this became a really heroic task when he was sent out to buy a bottle of soluble hair dye a false mustache and a pair of phoney spectacles with flat glass panes in them there was no doubt about it the boss was a changed man since his reappearance he had raised dunedins salary and except for occasional outbursts of choler treated him very considerately the weird accent had largely disappeared but this hard inscrutable man wasnt the bishop dunedin had known park presented himself in his disguise to the renting agent at isleif he said remember me i was here this morning asking about a room the man said sure he remembered him he never forgot a face park rented a small tworoom apartment calling himself allister park later in the evening he took some books a folder of etchings and a couple of suitcases full of clothes over when he returned to the bishops house he found another car with a couple of large watchful men waiting at the curb rather than risk contact with a hostile authority he went back to his new apartment and read around midnight he dropped in at a small hash house for a cup of coffee in fifteen minutes he was calling the waitress sweetiepie the etchings worked like a charm dunedin looked out the window and announced two wains and five knicks hallow the twoth wain drew up just now the men in it look as if theyd eat their own mothers without salt park thought he had to get out somehow he had looked into the subject of search warrants illegal entry and so forth as practiced in the bretwaldate of vinland and was reasonably sure the detectives wouldnt invade his house the laws of vinland gave what park thought was an impractically exaggerated sanctity to a mans home but he was glad of that as things were however if he stepped out the pack would be all over him with charges of drunken driving conspiracy to violate the tobacco tax and anything else they could think of he telephoned the knicks branch or police department and spoke falsetto are you the knicks glory be to patrick and bridget im wife caroline chisholm at mercia and we have a crazy man running up and down the halls naked with an ax sure hes killed my poor husband already spattered his brains all over the hall he did and im locked in my room and looking for him to break in any time park stamped on the floor and continued eeek thats the monster now trying to break the door down oh hurry i pray hes shouting that hes going to chop me in little bits and feed me to his cat yes mercia eeeee save me he hung up and went back to the window in five minutes as he expected the gongs of the police wains sounded and three of the vehicles skidded around the corner and stopped in front of no down the block funny hats tumbled out like oranges from a burst paper bag and raced up the front steps with guns and ropes enough to handle gargantua the five who had been watching the house got out of their cars too and ran down the block allister park lit his pipe and strode briskly out the front door down the street away from the disturbance and around the corner park was announced as bishop scoglund to dr edwy borup the head of the psychophysical institute was a smallish bald snaggletoothed man who smiled with an uneasy cordiality park smiled back wonderful work youve been doing dr borup after handing out a few more vague compliments he got down to business i understand that poor dr noggle is now one of your patients umm uh yes reverend hallow he is uh his lusty working seems to have brock on a brainly breakdown park sighed the good lord will see him through let us hope i wonder if i could see him i had some small kenning of him before his trouble he once told me hed like my spiritual guidance when he got around to it well umm im not sure it would be wise in his kilter oh come now dr borup surely thocks of hicker things would be good for him the sharpnosed grayhaired man who had been joseph noggle sat morosely in his room hardly bothering to look up when park entered well my friend said park what have they been doing to you nothing said the man his voice had a nervous edge thats the trouble every day im a different man in a different sanitarium each day they tell me that two days previously i got violent and tried to poke somebody in the nose i havent poked nobody in the nose why in gods name dont they do something sure i know im crazy ill cooperate if theyll do something there there said park the good lord watches over all of us by the way what were you before your trouble started i taught singing park thought several frickful aiths if a singing teacher or somebody equally incompetent for his kind of work were in his body now he lit a pipe and talked soothingly and inconsequentially to the man who though not in a pleasant mood was too grateful for a bit of company to discourage him finally he got what he was waiting for a husky male nurse came in to take the patients temperature and tell park that his time was up park hung around on one excuse or another until the nurse had finished then he followed the nurse out and grasped his arm what is it hallow asked the nurse are you poor noggles regular attendant yes got any kinfolk or people you like specially in the priesthood yes theres my aunt thyra shes a nun at the new lindisfarne abbey like to see her advanced why i guess so yes shes always been pretty good to me all right heres what you do can you get out or send somebody out to telephone noggles condition to me every morning before noon the nurse guessed he could all right snapped park and it wont do anybody any good if anybody knows youre doing it understand he realized that his publicprosecutor manner was creeping back on him he smiled benignly the lord will bless you my son park telephoned dunedin asked him to learn the name of somebody who dwelt on the top floor of the apartment house next door and to collect one ladder thirty feet of rope and one brick he made him call back the name of the topfloor tenant but hallow what in the name of patrick do you want a brick for park chuckling told him hed learn when he got off the folkwain at mercia street he didnt walk boldly up to his own house he entered the apartment house next door and said he was calling on mrs figgis his clericals constituting adequate credentials when the elevatorman let him out on the top floor he simply climbed to the roof and whistled for monkeyface he directed dunedin in the tieing of the end of the rope to the brick the heaving thereof to the roof of the apartment house and the planting of the ladder to bridge the tenfoot gap after that it was a simple matter for park to lower himself to his own roof without being intercepted by the watchdogs in front of his house as soon as he got in the phone rang a sweetnessandlight voice at the other end said this is cooley hallow every time ive called your man has said you were out or else that you couldnt be bothered thats right said park i was yes anyway were all giving praises to the lord that you were spared thats fine said park it surely is a wonderful case of how his love watches over us whats on your mind cooley said park sternly repressing a snarl of impatience oh uh what i meant was will you give your usual sermon next sunday park thought quickly if he could give a sermon and get away with it it ought to discourage the people who were trying to prove the bishop loony sure i will where are you calling from why uh the vestry some damned assistant thought park but hallow wont you come up tonight im getting some of the parishioners together in the chapel for a homish thanksgiving stint with hymns of im afraid not said park give em my love anyway there goes my doorbell bye he marched into the library muttering dunedin asked what is it hallow gotta prepare a goddam sermon said park taking some small pleasure at his thanes thanes expression of horror fortunately the bishop was an orderly man there were manuscripts of all his sermons for the past five years and phonograph records in the form of magnetized wire of several there was also plenty of information about the order of procedure in a celtic christian service park set about concocting a sermon out of fragments and paragraphs of those the bishop had delivered during the past year playing the spools of wire over and over to learn the bishops inflections he wished he had some way of getting the bishops gestures too he was still at it next day when he dimly heard his doorbell he thought nothing of it trusting to dunedin to turn the visitor away until monkeyface came in and announced that a pair of knicks awaited without park jumped up did you let em in no hallow i thought good boy ill take care of em the larger of the two cops smiled disarmingly can we come in hallow to use your wiretalker nope said park sorry the knick frowned in that case we gotta come in anyway mistrust of unlawful owning of pipe he put his foot in the door crack a pipe park knew was a gun he turned and stamped on the toe of the shoe hard then slammed the door shut as the foot was jerked back there were some seconds of frickful aiths wafting through the door then the pounding of a fist against it get a warrant park yelled through the door the noise subsided park called dunedin and told him to lock the other entrances presently the knicks departed parks inference based upon what he had been able to learn of vinland law that they would not force an entrance without a warrant had proved correct however they would be back and there is nothing especially difficult about finding an illegal weapon in a mans house whether he had one before or not so park packed a suitcase climbed to the roof of the adjoining apartment and went down the elevator the elevator man looked at him in a marked manner once in the street he made sure nobody was looking and slapped on his mustache and glasses he pulled his bonnet well down to hide his undyed hair and walked over to allister parks place there he telephoned dunedin and directed him to call the city editors of all the probishop newspapers and tip them off that an attempt to frame the bishop impended he told dunedin to let the reporters in when they came the more the better preferably there should be at least one in every room now he thought let those flatfeet try to sneak a gun into one of my bureau drawers so they can find it and raise a stink he spent the night at the apartment and the next day having gotten his sermon in shape he paid a visit to his church he found a functionary of some sort in an office and told him that he allister park was considering getting married in st columbanus and would the functionary a th morgan please show him around th morgan was pleased to dr cooley usually did that job but he was out this afternoon park looked sharply through his phoney spectacles memorizing the geography of the place he wished now hed passed up the sermon for one more week and had instead attended next sundays service as allister park so that he could see how the thing was done but it was too late now morgan broke in on his thoughts theres dr cooley now thane park wouldnt you like to meet him ulp said park sorry got to see a man thanks a lot before the startled cleric could protest park was making for the door as fast as he could go without breaking into a run the plump rosy young man in pincenez whom park saw out of the corner of his eye must be cooley park had no intention of submitting his rather thin disguise to his assistants inspection he telephoned the bishops home the other people in the lunchroom were startled by the roar of laughter that came through the glass of his telephone booth as dunedin described the two unhappy cops trying to plant a gun in his house under the noses of a dozen hostile wisecracking reporters monkeyface added ii took the freedom your hallowship of finding out that two of the newsers live right near here if the knicks try that again and these newsers are at home we could wirecall them over youre learning fast old boy said park guess i can come home now it was saturday when dunedin answered a call from the psychophysical institute he cocked an eye upward whence came a series of irregular whams as if trunks were being tossed downstairs yes he said ill get him as he wheezed upstairs the whams gave way to a quick muffled drumming if anything were needed to convince him that something drastic had happened to his masters mind the installation and regular use of a horizontal bar and a punching bag in a disused room was it park in a pair of sweatsoaked shorts turned his pale eyes good old monkeyface park who treated subordinates with great consideration never told dunedin what he thought he looked like its the man at the psychophysical institute announced dunedin the male nurse announced that for a change joseph noggle was claiming to be joseph noggle park grabbed his bonnet and drove the steamer over borup asked but my dear dear hallow why must you uh see this one patient there are plenty mair who could use your ghostly guidance fool amateur thought park if he doesnt want me to know why he wants to keep noggle locked up why doesnt he say hes violent or something this way hes giving away his whole game but aloud he gave a few smooth pious excuses and got in to see his man the original authentic noggle had a quick nervous manner it didnt take him more than a minute to catch on to who parkscoglund was look here he said look here ive got to get out ive got to get at my books and onmarkings if i dont get out now while im in my own body i shant be able to stop this damned merrygoround for another six days you mean my son that you occupy your own body every six days what happens the rest of the time the rest of the time im going around the wheel indwelling ane after another of the bodies of the other men on my wheel and the minds of these other men are following me around likewise so every ane of the six bodies has each of our six minds in it in turn every six days i see park smiled benignly and whats this wheel you talk about i call it my wheel of if each of the other five men on it are the men i should most likely have been if certain things had been otherwise for instance the man in whose body my mind dwelt yesterday was the man i should most likely have been if king egbert had fallen off his horse in park didnt stop to inquire about king egbert or the sad results of his poor equestrianism he asked softly how did your wheel get started in the first place it was when i tried to stop yours law of keeping of psychic momentum you know i got careless and the momentum of your wheel was overchanged to mine so ive been going around ever since now look here whatever your name is ive got to get out of here or ill never get stopped i ordered them to let me out this morning but all theyd say was that theyd see about it tomorrow tomorrow my bodyll be occupied by some other wheelmate and theyll say im crazy again borup wont let me go anyway if he can help it he likes my job but youve got to use your inflowing as bishop oh said park silkily ive got to use my influence eh just one more question are we all on wheels and how many of these possible worlds are there yes were all on wheels the usual number of rooms on a wheel is fourteen thats the number on yours though it sometimes varies the number of worlds is infinite or almost so that the chances that anybody on my wheel would be living in the same world as anybody on yours is pretty small but thats not weightful the weightful thing is to get me out so ah yes thats the weightful thing isnt it but suppose you tell me why you started my wheel in the first place it was just a forseeking in the mental control of wheels youre lying said park softly oh im lying am i well then reckon out your own reason im sorry that you take this attitude my son how can i help you if you wont put your trust in me and in god oh come on dont playact youre not the bishop and you know it ah but i was a churchman in my former being park fairly oozed holiness thats not odd is it since i was the man the bishop would most likely have been if king oswiu had chosen for the romans and the arabs had lost the battle of tours youd hold yourself bound by professional confidence park looked shocked what a thock of course i would all right im something of a sportsman you know about a month ago i got badly pinched by the ponies and i ah borrowed a little heading on my pay from the institutes funds of course id have paid it back it was really quite an honest deed but i had to make a few little ah rightings in the books because otherwise one who didnt understand the conditions might have drawn the wrong thocks from them ivor macsvensson somehow found out and threatened to put me in jail if i didnt use my mental powers to start your wheel of if going until it had made a halfturn and then stop it with another mans mind in the bishops body it ought to be easy to prove the bishop daft in any event his inflowing would be destroyed but as you know it didnt work out quite that way you seemingly arent in anybodys custody so youll have to do something to get me out park leaned forward and fixed noggle with the bishops fishpale eyes he said harshly you know noggle i admire you for a guy who robs his hospital and then to get out of it goes and starts fourteen mens minds spinning around ruining their lives and maybe driving some of them crazy or to selfkilling you have more gall than a barn rat you sit there and tell me one of your victims that ill have to do something to get you out why damn your lousy little soul if you ever do get out ill give you a case of lumps thatll make you think somebody dropped a mountain on you noggle paled a bit then then you werent a churchman in your own world hell no my business was putting lice like you in jail and i still ock to be able to do that here with what you so kindly told me just now noggle swallowed as this sank in but you promised park laughed unpleasantly sure i did i never let a little thing like a promise to a crook keep me awake nights but you want to get back dont you and im the only one who can send you back and youll have to get me out of here before i can do anything there is that said park thoughtfully but i dont know maybe ill like it here when i get used to it i can always have the fun of coming around here every sixth day and giving you the horselaugh youre a devil park laughed again thanks you thought youd get some poor bewildered dimwit in scoglunds body didnt you well youll learn just how wrong you were he stood up ill let you stay here a while more as dr borups prize looney maybe when youve been taken down a peg we can talk business meanwhile you might form a club with those other five guys on your wheel you could leave notes around for each other to find so long dr svengali ten minutes later park was in borups office with a bland episcopal smile on his face he asked borup apropos of nothing in particular a lot of questions about the rules involving commitment and release of inmates nay said edwy borup firmly we could uh parole a patient in your care only if he were rick most of the time those that are wrong most of the time like poor dr noggle have to stay here it was all very definite but park had known lots of people who were just as definite until pressure was brought to bear on them from the right quarter the nearer the sunday service came the colder became allister parks feet which for such an aggressive selfconfident man was peculiar but when he thought of all the little details the kneeling and getting up again the facing this way and that he telephoned cooley at the cathedral he had he said a cold and would cooley handle everything but the sermon surely hallow surely the lord will see to it that youre fully restored soon i hope ill say a special prayer for you it was also time park thought to take monkeyface into his confidence he told him all whereat dunedins eyes grew very large now old boy said park briskly if you ever want to get your master back into his own body youll have to help me out for instance heres that damned sermon im going to read it and youll correct my pronunciation and gestures sunday afternoon park returned wearily to the bishops house the sermon had gone off easily enough but then hed had to greet hundreds of people he didnt know as if they were old friends and hed had to parry scores of questions about his absence he had he thought earned a drink a highball asked dunedin whats that park explained dunedin looked positively shocked but thane p i mean hallow isnt it bad for your insides to drink such cold stuff never mind my insides ill hullo whos that dunedin answered the doorbell and reported that a th figgis wanted to see the bishop park said to show him in there was something familiar about that name the man himself was tall angular and grimlooking as soon as dunedin had gone he leaned forward and hissed dramatically ive got you now bishop scoglund what are you going to do about it what am i going to do about what my wife what about your wife you know well enough you went up to my rooms last tuesday while i was away and came down again wednesday dont be an ass said park ive never been in your rooms in my life and ive never met your wife oh yes dont try to fool me you wolf in priests clothing ive got witnesses by god ill fix you you seducer oh that park grinned and explained his ladderandrope procedure think i believe that sneered figgis if you werent a priest id challenge you and cut your liver out and eat it as it is i can make things so hot for you now now interrupted park be reasonable im sure we can come to an understanding trying to bribe me huh i wouldnt put it just that way so you think you can buy my honor do you well whats your offer park sighed i thought so just another goddam blackmailer get out louse but arent you going to park jumped up spun figgis around and marched him toward the door out i said if you think you can get away with spreading your little scandal around go to it youll learn that you arent the only one who knows things about other people figgis tried to wriggle loose park kicked him into submission and sent him staggering down the front steps with a final shove dunedin looked awedly at this formidable creature into which his master had been metamorphosed do you really know something to keep him quiet hallow nope but my experience is that most men of his age have something theyd rather not have known anyway youve got to take a strong line with these blackmailers or theyll raise no end of hell of course my son we hope the good lord will show our erring brother the folly of his sinful ways dont we park winked being a bishop entailed much more than putting on a onehour performance at the cathedral every sunday as park soon learned but he transacted as much of his episcopal business as he could at home and put the rest onto cooley he didnt yet feel that his impersonation was good enough to submit to closerange examination by his swarm of subordinates while he was planning his next step an accident unexpectedly opened the way for him he had just settled himself in the isleif street apartment the evening of tuesday april th when a young man rang his doorbell it took about six seconds to diagnose the young man as a fledgling lawyer getting a start on a political career as a precinct worker no said park i wont sign your petition to nominate thane hammar because i dont know him ive just moved here from dakotia but id like to come around to the clubhouse and meet the boys the young man glowed why dont you theres a meeting of the precinct workers tomorrow night and voters are always welcome the clubhouse walls were covered with phoney viking shields and weapons whos he park asked his young lawyer through the haze of smoke he was a florid man to whom several were paying obsequious attention thats trigvy darling brahtzs parasite park caught a note of dislike and added it to the new card in his mental index file brahtz was a diamond thingman from a western province the leader of the squirearchy in this somewhat naive culture a gentleman had to demonstrate his financial standing by supporting a flock of idle friends or deputy gentlemen the name of the parasite was not merely accurate but was accepted by these hangerson without any feeling of derogation through the haze wove an unpleasantly familiar angular figure parks grip on the edge of the table automatically tightened haw morrow said figgis and looked at park havent i met you somewhere maybe said park ever live in dakotia morrow the young lawyer introduced park as park park fervently hoped his disguise was thick enough figgis acknowledged the introduction but continued to shoot uneasy little glances at park i could swear he said just then the meeting was called although it would have driven a lot of people to suicide from boredom park enjoyed the interplay of personalities the quick fencing with parliamentary rules by various factions these rules differed from those he was used to being derived from those of the ancient icelandic thing instead of the english parliament but the idea was the same the local members wanted to throw a party for the voters of the hide district a wellknit minority led by the parasite darling wanted to save the money for contribution to the national war chest park waited until the question was just about to be put to a vote then snapped his fingers for the chairmans attention the chairman an elderly dodderer recognized him my friends said park lurching to his feet of course i dont know that i really ock to say anything being just a new incomer from the wilds of dakotia but ive always voted diamond and so did my father and his father before him and so on back as far as there was any diamond party so i think i can claim as solid a party membership as some folks who live in new belfast three months out of the year and spend the rest of their time upholding the monetary repute of certain honorable country thanes park with satisfaction saw darling jerk his tomatocolored face around and heard a few snickers though he continued taking the healthy skin you get from country life i dont know but what i envy such people more snickers now it seems to me that twenty minutes later the party had been voted park was the chairman since he alone seemed really anxious to assume responsibility and trigvy darling at whose expense park had acquired a frothy popularity by his jibes had turned from vermillion to magenta after the meeting park found himself in a group of people including the chairman and figgis figgis was saying something about that scoundrel scoglund when his eye caught parks he grinned his slightly sepulchral grin i know now why i thock id met you you remind me of the bishop know him i met him once say dutt this was to the aged chairman what dates set for your withdrawal next meeting quavered the ancient one ah here is our crown prince heh heh darling his face back to normal tomatocolor advanced do you ken thane park i ken him well enough growled darling with the look of one who has found a cockroach in his ice cream it seems to me thane dutt that part of a chairmans duty is to stop use of personalities on the part of speakers you can always plead point of personal privilege heh heh darling did something in his throat that was not quite articulate speech figgis murmured he knows the boys would laugh him down if he tried it yeah said darling well see about that when im chairman he stalked off park wasted no time in exploiting his new job knowing that ivor macsvensson was due back in new belfast the next day he went around as allister park to the law office used by the boss as a front for his activities the boss was already in but the outer office was jammed with favor seekers park instead of preparing to spend the morning awaiting his turn bribed the office boy to tell him when and where macsvensson ate his lunch then he went to the nearby public library movies not having been invented in this world and took his ease until one oclock unfortunately ivor macsvensson failed to show up at the restaurant indicated though park stretched one tunafish lunch out for half an hour park cursed the lying office boy plain bribery he was hardened to but he really became indignant when the bribee failed to deliver so he set about it the hard way a nearby knick gave him the locations of the five highestpriced restaurants in the neighborhood and in the third he found his man he recognized him from the pictures he had studied before starting his search a big good looking fellow with cold blue eyes and prematurely white hair park marched right up haw thane macsvensson bethink you me macsvensson looked puzzled for a fraction of a second but he said smoothly sure of course i bethink me of you your name is uh allister park chairman of the amusement committee of the tenth hide park rattled off i only met you recently just before you left sure of course id know you anywhere lets see judge vidolf of bridgets beach wirecalled me this morning wanted to know if i kenned you told him id call him back he gripped parks hand come on sit down sure of course any good party worker is a friend of mine whats the tenth hide doing park told of the party macsvensson whistled saturday the thirtieth thats day after tomorrow i can manage it said park maybe you could tell me where i could pick up some sober bartenders sure of course under parks deferential prodding the boss gave him all the information he needed macsvensson finished with the quick vigorous handshake cultivated by people who have to shake thousands of hands and who dont want to develop a case of greeters cramp he urged park to come around and see him again especially after that fellow darling gets the chairmanship of your committee park went grinning a little to himself he knew just what sort of impression he had made and could guess how the boss was reacting to it hed be glad to get a vigorous aggressive worker in the organization at the same time hed want to keep a close watch on him to see that his power wasnt undermined park congratulated himself on having arrived in a world where the political setup had a recognizable likeness to that of his own in an absolute monarchy for instance hed have a hell of a time learning the particular brand of intrigue necessary to become a kings favorite as it was the bridgets beach knicks stood glowering at a safe distance from the throng of picnickers although they were antimacsvensson the judges were pro so what could they do about it if the party violated the ordinances regarding use of the beach since parks fellow committeemen were by now too sodden with beer to do anything at all park was dashing around clad in a pair of tennis shoes and the absurd particolored belt that constituted the vinland bathing suit running everything himself everybody seemed to be having a good timeparty workers the more influential of the voters and their families everybody but a morose knot of darling amp followers at one end near this knot a group of antidarlings was setting up a song trig darling he has a foul temper trig darlings as red as can be oh nobody here loves trig darling throw trigvy out into the sea throwtrig throwtrig throw trigvy out into the sea park hurried up to shush them things were going fine and he didnt want a fight yet at any rate but his efforts were lost in the next stanza trig darling he has a potbellee trig darlings as mean as can be at that moment apparently a giant hit allister park over the head with a sequoia sempervirens he reeled a few steps shook the tears out of his eyes and faced trigvy darling advancing with large fists cocked hey said park this isnt he brought up his own fists but darling instead of trying to hit him again faced him for three seconds and then spat at him park glanced at the drop of saliva trickling down his chest so did everyone else one of darlings friends asked do you make that a challenge trig yes boomed the parasite park didnt really catch on to what was coming until he was surrounded by his own party he and darling were pushed together until their bare chests were a foot apart somebody called the knicks over these stationed themselves around the couple somebody else produced a long leather belt which he fastened around the middies of both men at once so they could not move farther apart darling his red face expressionless grabbed parks right wrist with his left hand and held out his own right forearm evidently expecting park to do the same it was not until a big sheathknife was pressed into each mans right hand that park knew he was in a duel somehow he had missed this phase of vinland custom in his reading park wondered frantically whether his mustache would come off in the struggle one knick stepped up and said you know the rules no kicking biting butting or scratching penalty for a foul is one free stab ready yes said darling yes said park with more confidence than he felt go said the policeman park felt an instant surge of his opponents muscles darling had plenty of these under the fat if hed only had longer to train the bishops body darling wrenched his wrist loose from parks grip threw a leg around one of parks to trip him and brought his fist down in a lightning overhand stab it was too successful parks leg went out from under him and he landed with a thump on his back dragging darling down on top of him darling drove his knife up to the hilt in the sand when he jerked it up for another stab park miraculously caught his wrist again a heave and darling toppled onto the sand beside him for seconds they strained and panted a tangle of limbs park his heart laboring and sand in his eyes wrenched his own knifearm free but when he stabbed at darling the parasite parried with a curious twisting motion of his left arm and gathered parks arm into a bonecrushing grip park in agony heaved himself to his knees pulling darling up too they faced each other on their knees the belt still around them darling wrenched his knifearm loose again whipped it around as for a backhand stab then back for an overhand park trying to follow the darting blade felt as if something had exploded in his own left arm darlings point was driven into it and into the bone before it had a chance to bleed darling tried to pull it out it didnt yield on the first pull park leaned forward suddenly darling unwound his left arm from parks right to catch himself as he swayed backwards park stabbed at him darling blocked the stab with his forearm making park feel as if his wrist was broken he played his last improvised trick tossed up the knife caught it the other way to and brought it around in a quick upandout thrust to his surprise darling failed to block it at all the blade slid up under the parasites ribs to the hilt park warm blood running over his hand twisted and sliced his way across darlings abdomen trigvy darling lay on his back mouth open and sand in his sightless eyeballs the spectators looked in awe at the teninch wound park feeling a bit shaken stood while they bandaged his arm the knicks gravely took down the vital information about the dead man filling the last line of the blank with killed in fair fight with allister park isleif st nb then people were shaking his hand slapping his bare back and babbling congratulations at him had it coming to him never liked him anyway only we had to take him on account of brahtz youll make a better chairman park stole a hand to his upper lip his mustache was a little loose on one side but a quick press fixed that he gradually became aware that the duel so far from spoiling the party had made a howling success of it leading a double life is a strenuous business at best it is particularly difficult when both ones identities are fairly prominent people nevertheless allister park managed it with singleminded determination to let nothing stop his getting the person of joseph noggle in such a position that he could make him give his parks wheel of if another halfspin it might not be too late even if the antonini case was washed up to rehabilitate himself his next step was to cultivate ivor macsvensson burg committee chairman for the diamond party of the burg of new belfast this was easy enough as the chairman of the hide committee was exofficio a member of the burg committee they were dining in one of the small but expensive restaurants for which macsvensson had a weakness the burg chairman said well have to get anlaaf off thats all there is to it those dim knicks should have known better than to pull him in it in the first place park looked at the ceiling even if it was pendas daughter even if it was pendas daughter after all spoiling the morals of a tenyearold i know i know said macsvensson impatiently i know hes a dirty bustard but what can i do hes got the twentysixth hide in his fist so ive got to play cards with him especially with the thingly choosing coming up in three months itll be close even with bishop scoglund lying low the way he has been i had a little plan for shushing the dear bishop it didnt work but it seems to have scared him into keeping quiet about the ricks of the skrellings and the thing meeting next month if that damned equalricks changelet goes through itll split the party wide open if it doesnt asked park thatll be all right how about the dakotians and the rest macsvensson shrugged no trouble for fifty years they talk a lot but i never saw a skrelling that would stand up and fick yet and what if they did try a war new belfast is a long way from the border and the choosing would be called off maybe by the time it was over people would get some sense park had his own ideas his researches had told him something about the unprepared state of the country new belfast had hundreds of miles between it and the independent skrellings in case of a sea attack they could count on the friendly northumbrian fleet one of the worlds largest to come over and help out hence the new belfast machine had consistently plugged for more money for harbor improvements and merchantmarine subsidies and less for military purposes however if the northumbrian fleet were immobilized by the threat of the navy of the amirate of cordova and the skrellings overran the hinterland of vinland macsvensson was speaking you know that youngest daughter of mine she wants to marry a school teacher craziest idea and that boy of mine has the house full of his musical friends at least thats what he callsem theyll play their flugelhorns and yell and stamp all night why not come up to my place asked park with the studied nonchalance of an experienced dryfly fisherman making a cast sure of course glad to ive got three appointments thinging but hell with em there was no doubt about it ivor macsvensson was good company even if he did have a deplorable scale of moral values park having made the necessary soundings finally suggested getting some company the chairmans blue eyes lit up a bit there was some lechery in the old war horse yet park telephoned his little waitress friend yes she had a friend who was just dying to meet some big political pipes many residents of new belfast were wont to say of ivor macsvensson he may be a serpent crook but at least he leads a spotless home life macsvensson was at pains to encourage this legend however insubstantial its basis these people would have been pained to see the boss an hour later smeared with lipstick bouncing parks friends friend on his knee the friends friend was undressed to a degree that would have shocked vinlanders anywhere but on a beach stuffy isnt it said park and got up to open a window the unsuspecting macsvensson was having too good a time to notice park thrust his arm out the window and wag it briefly five minutes later the doorbell rang by the time macsvensson had snapped out of his happy daze park had admitted a small wrinkled man who pointed at the friends friend and cried fleda oswald shrieked the girl sir shouted dunedin at the boss what have you been doing with my wife what have you been doing with my wife oh sobbed fleda i didnt mean to be unfaithful truly i didnt if id only thock of you before it was too late huh mumbled macsvensson too late unfaithful your wife yes you snake you scoundrel you bustard my wife youll suffer for this boss macsvensson just wait till i here here my man said park taking dunedin by the arm and pulling him into the vestibule for ten minutes the boss listened in sweaty apprehension to parks and dunedins voices rising and falling the former soothing the latter strained with rage finally the door slammed park came back and said i got him to promise not to put in any slurs or tell any newspapers for a while until we talk things over again i know who he is and i think i can squelch him through the company he works for im not sure thatll work though hes mad as a wet hen wont believe that this was just an innocent gettogether the imperturbable boss looked badly shaken youve got to stop him al the story would raise merry hell if you can do it you can have just about anything i can give you how about the secretaryship of the burg committee asked park promptly surely of course i can find something else for ethelbald to do only keep that man shut up all right old boy right now youd better get home as soon as you can when macsvensson had been gone a few minutes eric dunedins ugly face appeared in the doorway all clear hal i mean thane park come on in old boy that was a neat piece of work you did well too fleda both you girls did and now park started to drive a corkscrew into another cork we can have a real party damn it dunedin said park when i say put your breakfast down on the table and eat it i mean it but hallow it simply isnt done for a thanes thane to eat with his master to hell with whats done and what isnt ive got more for you to do than stand around and treat me as if i were god almighty weve got work brother now get busy on that mail dunedin sighed and gave up when park chose to he could by now put on what dunedin admitted was a nearly perfect imitation of bishop scoglund but unless there were somebody present to be impressed thereby he chose instead to be his profane and domineering self dunedin frowned over one letter and said thane callahan wants to know why you havent been doing anything to push the glickricks changelet park mentally translated the last to equalrights amendment why should i it isnt my baby oh well tell him ive been too busy but ill get around to it soon thats always the stock excuse dunedin whistled suddenly the kin of the late trigvy darling have filed a wergild claim of a hundred and fifty thousand crowns against you what what lets see that whats that all about have they got the right to sue me when i killed him in selfdefense oh but of course hallow theres nay criminal penalty for killing a man in fair fight but his heirs can claim two years earnings from you didnt you know that when you took up his challenge good lord no what can i do about it oh deary me glory be to patrick you can try to prove the claim too big as this one may be i dont know though darling got a big stipend from brahtz as a parasite i can always withdraw allister park from circulation and be just the bishop then let em try to collect it would be wearisome to follow allister parks political activities in detail for the three weeks after his use of the badger game on macsvensson but lest his extraordinary rise to power seem improbable consider that it was not until the s in parks original world that a certain josef vissarianovitch dzugashvili better known as joseph stalin discovered what could really be done with the executive secretaryship of a political committee so it is not too surprising that whereas park knew what could be done with this office the politicians of vinland did not they learned among other things the secretary makes up the agenda of meetings he puts motions in proper form since a motion is seldom intelligible in the form in which it is presented from the floor he prompts the chairman the nominal head of the organization on parliamentary procedure he is the interim executive officer wherefore all appointments go through his hands and he has custody of all records he is exofficio member of all committees since a committee seldom has any clear idea of what it wants to do or how it wants to do it an aggressive secretary can usually run as many committees as he has time for whereas the chairman cant speak at meetings the secretary can not only speak but speak last he gets the gavel when an appeal is made from the chair at least that is how it is done in this world in vinland the rules were not quite the same but the similarity was close enough for parks purpose which was still to get back to good old new york and that judgeship if there was still any chance of getting it it was after the burg committee meeting on the first of june that park faced ivor macsvensson in the latters office park intended to start needling the boss about the body of joseph noggle but macsvensson got there first demanding whats all this about your making up to the committeemen whats that asked park blandly ive been seeing them on routine duties only yeah not according to what ive been told and ive found out that that girl you had up for me wasnt wedded at all trying to put one down on the boss eh well you can go back to hidewalking youll call a special committee meeting for friday night get those seeings out today without fail thats all suits me grinned park the chairman can demand special meetings but the secretarys the man who sends out the notices when friday evening arrived two thirds of the seats in the committee room in karlsefni hall remained empty macsvensson blue eyes glacial fretted park sending out thunderheads of smoke from the bishops largest pipe lolled in a chair glancing surreptitiously at his watch if macsvensson were down at the far end of the hall when the hand touched sixty park would simply arise and say in the absence of the chairman and of any other officers authorized to act as such i allister park acting as chairman hereby call this meeting to order but macsvensson looking at him divined his intention he snatched out his own watch and dashed to the chair he made it by one and a half seconds park was not disturbed he took his place hearing the bosss growl did you send out all those seeings when i told you to park theres just barely a quorum here absolutely i cant help it if they go astray in the mail park neglected to add that with the proper cooperation from a postal clerk it is sometimes possible to make sure that certain of the notices though duly postmarked as of the time they are received are accidentally misplaced in the post office and completely overlooked until the day after the meeting the meeting will kindly come to order snapped macsvensson he did not like the look of the quorum at all not one of his tried and true friends was in sight except sleepy ethelbald he continued this is a special meeting called to hold in mind the good and welfare of the committee as such there will be no reading of the minutes the meeting will now consider items for the agenda macsvensson caught the eye of sleepy ethelbald who had been primed for just this occasion before ethelbald could rouse himself another committeeman popped up with i move that we take up the fitness of chairman macsvensson to last in his present office twothed i move the agenda be closed twothed macsvensson sat up for a few seconds with his mouth open he had had revolts before plenty of them but never one with the devastating speed and coordination of this he finally mumbled all in favor aye roared most of the quorum macsvensson ran fingers through his hair then squared his shoulders he wasnt licked yet by any means there were more tricks the meeting will now consider the first item on the agenda i move the impeachment of chairman macsvensson twothed for the second time the chairman sat with his mouth open park said gently you take up the motion and give me the gavel but wailed macsvensson no buts a motion to impeach the chairman selfmovingly shifts the gavel to the secretary come on old boy an hour later ivor macsvensson stalked out beaten park could have had the chairmanship himself but he astutely preferred to keep the secretaryship and put the ancient of days magnus dutt in that exposed position mayor offa greenfield knew his own mind such as it was he banged his fist on his desk making all his chins quiver nay he shouted i dont know what youre up to allister park but by the right ear of hallow gall its something the freedom of a free people now now were not talking about the freedom of a free people im sure we agree on that matter its just a question of the person of joseph noggle i wont be dictated to i wont take orders from anybody except ivor macsvensson except iv nay i said anybody go practice your snaky trick on somebody else allister park youll get nothing from me i wont interfere with borups running of his institute unless of course greenfield lowered his voice to normal you can get macsvensson to back you up greenfield it seemed had the one virtue of loyalty he intended to stick by the fallen boss to the bitter end even though nearly all the rest of macsvenssons staunch supporters had deserted him when the effectiveness of parks coup had become patent but greenfield was not elected as were the members of the burg thing he was appointed by a committee of the althing the national legislative body so park for all his local power could not displace greenfield at the coming elections by putting up a rival candidate he could only do it by acquiring sufficient power in the althing he set himself to study how to do this new belfast elected six members to the althing as the city was firmly diamond nomination implied election therefore the six thingmen however much they bragged about their independence in public were careful to obey the whims of the boss of new belfast the repeated efforts of yon brahtz to impose his control on the new belfast diamonds by planting stooges like the late trigvy darling in their hide committees had aroused some resentment park decided that he could trust his most active supporters and the six thingmen to back him in a gigantic doublecross to desert the diamond party altogether and join the rubies the goats would be not merely brahtz and his squirearchy but the local ruby politicians of new belfast however as these had never accomplished anything but draw some patronage from the althing in the periods when the rubies were in power there park thought he would not find much resistance to their sacrifice on the part of the ruby leaders and so it proved twenty men though seldom keep a secret for long the morning of june th park opened his paper to find the report of a defiant speech by yon brahtz in which he announced bluntly that the thanes of the cherogian march of vinland will defend the ricks they inherited from their heroic forebears by any means needful and moreover the means for such defense are ready and waiting park translated this to mean that if the scoglund amendment were passed by a coalition of rubies and insurgent new belfast diamonds the squirearchy would secede but that would mean civil war which in turn would mean postponement of the elections what was even more serious the diamond thingmen from the seceding provinces would automatically lose their seats giving the rubies a clear majority since the rubies would no longer need the support of parks insurgents they would be disinclined to make a deal with him to appoint a mayor of his choice park privately thought that while in theory he supposed he believed in the scoglund amendment in practice both his and the ruby leaders interests would be better served by dropping it for the present despite the growls of the dakotians and cherogians however the ruby leaders were firm that huge block of skrelling votes they would get by emancipating the aborigines was worth almost any risk as for such questions as the rights of the skrellings as human beings or the unfortunate vinlanders who would be killed or haggled up in a civil war they were not considered at all park holed up in the isleif street apartment with a couple of bodyguards answered a call from dunedin haw hallow thane callahan is here to see you send him over here warn him ahead of time who i park remembered the guards and amended warn him about everything you know lord he thought all this just to get hold of noggle still shut up in the psychophysical institute maybe it would have been simpler to organize a private army like brahtzs and storm that fortresslike structure a longdistance call for the mobilization of his sons of the vikings as he called his storm troopers kedrick the bretwald of vinland had refused to mobilize the army because he explained such an action would be provocative maybe he secretly favored the squirearchy whose man he was maybe he was just a pacific civilian who found the whole subject of soldiers guns and such horrid things too repulsive to discuss maybe he really believed what he said callahan arrived with a flourish since macsvensson was no longer boss of new belfast the sachem went openly about the city without fear of arrest and beatingup by the police he told park it would be worth my life if some of my fellow skrellings knew id told you but the dakotians have an army secretly assembled on the bounds if the vinlanders start fickting among themselves the dakotiansll jump in to grab the northwestern provinces park whistled how about the cherogians theyre holding back waiting to see how things are turning out if the war seems to be fruitbearing theyll try a little rickting of the bounds themselves and what will your skrellings do then that depends if the scoglund changelet is lost theyll join the foe to a man if it goes through i think i can hold most of them in line why do you tell me this callahan the sachem grinned his large disarming grin two reasons first the bishop and i have been friends for years and ill stick to his body no matter where his soul may be twoth im not fooled as some of my skrellings are by talk of what fine things the dakotiansll do for us if we help them overthrow the palefaces the dakotian realm is even less a folkish one than the bretwaldates i know a thing or two about how they treat their ain folk so if youll stick to me ill stick to you park would have liked to appear at the opening of the althing as bishop scoglund but as too many people there knew him as allister park he attended in his mustache hair dye and spectacles the atmosphere was electric even park with all his acumen had been unable to keep up with events the risks were huge whichever way he threw his insurgents votes he kept them shut up in a committee room with him until the last possible minute he did not yet know himself whether he would order them to vote for or against the amendment the clock on the wall ticked around a boy came in with a message for park it said in effect that the sons of the vikings had received a report that the amendment had already been passed had mobilized and seized the town of olafsburg who had sent that mistaken message and why there was no way of finding out but it was too late for anybody to back down park looked up and said very seriously were voting for the scoglund amendment that was all with his welltrained cogs no more was necessary the bell rang they filed out park took his seat in the visitors gallery he said nothing but thought furiously as the session of the althing was opened with the usual formalities the chairman and the speaker and the chaplain took an interminable time about their business as if afraid to come to grips with the fearful reality awaiting their attention when the first motions came up a dead silence fell as parks men got up and walked over to the rubies side of the house then the rubies let out a yell of triumph there was no more need of stalling or delicate angling for marginal votes motion after motion went through with a roar out went the diamond chairman and speaker and in went rubies in their place in an hour the debate had been shut off despite howls from diamonds and their sympathizers about gag law and highhanded procedure the amendment came up for its first vote it fell short of the twothirds required by eleven votes park scribbled a note and had it delivered to the speaker the speaker handed it to the chairman park watched the little white note drift around the ruby side of the house then the ruby leader got up and solemnly moved the suspension of thingmen adamson arduser beurwulf dahl fessenden gilpatrick holmquist all the thingmen from the seceding area most of those named didnt wait they rose and filed out presumably to catch airwains for their home provinces the amendment passed on the second vote park looked up the ruby leader after the althing adjourned he said i hear kedrick still wont order mobilization talks about letting the erring brethren go in peace whats your party line on the matter the ruby leader a thin cool man blew smoke through his nose were going to fick if kedrick wont go along there are ways the same applies to you thane park park suddenly realized that events had put him in a suspect position if he didnt want himself and his cogs to be damned as copperheads or the vinland equivalent hed have to outshout the rubies for unity down with the rebels etcetera well he might as well do a good job of it that afternoon the guards at the psychophysical institute were astonished to have their sanctuary invaded by a squad of uniformed knicks with the notorious allister park at their head flourishing a search warrant the charge was violation of the fire ordinances in a building made almost entirely of tile glass and reinforced concrete but but but stuttered dr edwy borup park merely whisked out another warrant this time for the arrest of joseph noggle but but you cant stop one of my patients its uh illegal ill call mayor greenfield go ahead grinned park but dont be surprised if you get a busy signal he had taken the precaution of seeing that all the lines to the mayors office would be occupied at this time hello noggle said park haw who are you i think ive met you let me see park produced an air pistol im allister park youll figure out where you met me soon enough but you wont talk about it im glad to see my figuring came out right can you start a mans wheel today now i suppose i could oh i know who you are now nay comments i said youre coming along brother and doing just as youre told the next step was when park walked arm in arm with noggle into the imposing executive building parks standing as a powerful boss saw him through the guards and flunkeys that guarded the bretwalds office on the top floor the bretwald looked up from his desk oh haw thane park if youre going to nag me about that mobilization order youre wasting your time whos eeee where am i whats happened to me help help in bounded the guards guns ready park faced them sadly our respected bretwald seems to have had a mental seizure he said the guards covered the two visitors and asked kedrick what was the matter all they could get out of kedrick was help get away from me let me out i dont know who youre talking about my names not kedrick its oshaughnessy they took him away the guards kept park and noggle until a message from the acting bretwald said to let them go by the brazen gates of hell cried park is that all yep said the new secretary of war douglas was a brahtz man hence he saw to it that the army was made as harmless as possible before he skipped out park laughed grimly the secretary of war sabotages he does what never mind he raises hell with if you want a more familiar expression raises hell with the army for the benefit of his party with the dakotians about to come whooping in i suppose it oughtnt to surprise me though how many can we raise about twenty thousand in the burgish area but we can arm only half of them rickly most of our quickfire pipes and warwains have been hurt so itll take a month to fix them how about a force of skrellings the secretary shrugged we can raise em but we cant arm them go ahead and raise em anyway all right if you say so but hadnt you better have a rank it would look better all right you make me your assistant dont you want a commission not on your life your generals would go on strike and even if they didnt id be subject to military law the army was not an impressive one even when its various contingents had all collected at what would have been pittsburgh if its name hadnt been the lovely one of guggenvik the regulars were few and unimpressive the militia were more numerous but even less prepossessing the skrelling levy was the most unmilitary of all they stood around with silly grins on their flat brown faces and chattered and scratched park thought disgustedly so these are the descendants of the noble red man and the heroic viking fifty years of peace had been a blessing to vinland but not an altogether unmitigated one the transport consisted of a vast fleet of private folkwains and goodwains busses and trucks to you it had been possible to put only six warwains in the field these were a kind of steamdriven armored car carrying a compressor and a couple of pneumatic machine guns there was one portable liquidair plant for charging shells and air bombs the backwardness of vinland chemistry compared to its physics caused a curious situation the only practical military explosives were a rather lowgrade black powder and a carbonliquidoxygen mixture since the former was less satisfactory as a propellant considering smoke flash and barrelfouling than compressed air and was less effective as a detonant than the liquid air explosive its military use was largely confined to land mines liquid oxygen however while as powerful as trinitrotoluol had to be manufactured on the spot as there was no way of preventing its evaporation hence it was a very awkward thing to use in mobile warfare park walked into the intelligence tent and asked the secretary of war what do you think our chances are the secretary looked at him against the squires about even against the dakotians one to five against both none he held out a handful of dispatches these told of the success of the sons of the vikings in extending their hold in the southwest not surprising considering that the only division of regulars in that area were natives of the region and had gone over to the rebels more dispatches described in brief fragments the attack of a powerful and fastmoving dakotian army west of lake yanktonai michigan the last of these was dated pm june th the preceding day whats happened since then asked park dont know said the secretary just then a message came in from the first division it told little but the dateline told much it had been sent from the city of edgar at the south end of lake yanktonai park looked at his map and whistled but an army cant retreat fifty miles in one day the staff can said the secretary they ride further speculation about the fate of the first division seemed unnecessary the oneeyed colonel montrose was dictating an announcement for the press to the effect that our army has driven off severe dakotian attacks in the edgar area with heavy losses to the foe nine dakotian warwains were destroyed and five were captured other military booty included twentysix machinepipes two foeish airwains were shot down park thought this montrose has a good imagination which quality seems sadly lacking in most of the officers maybe we can do something with him if were still here long enough the secretary pulled park outside looks as though they had us we havent anything to fick with not even brains general higgins is just an easygoing paradeground soldier who never expected to have to shoot at anybody in his life for that matter neither did i got any ideas still thinking brother said park studying his map im nay soldier either you know just a thingman if i could give you any help it would be political well if we cant win by fickting politics would seem to be the only way left maybe park was still looking at the map i begin to have a thock lets see higgins fortunately for parks idea general higgins was not merely easygoing he was positively comatose he sat in his tent with his blouse unbuttoned and a bottle of beer in front of him serene in the midst of worry and confusion come in thanes come in he said have some beer piff got any ideas blessed if i know where to turn next nay artillery nay airwains to speak of nay real soldiers piff do you guess if we started fortifying new belfast now itd be strong enough to hold when we were pushed back there nobody knows anything piff im supposed to have a staff but half of em have got lost or sneaked off to join the rebels blessed if i know what to do next park thought general higgins would make a splendid salvation army general but there was no time for personalities he sprang his plan goodness gracious said higgins it sounds very risky get colonel callahan the sachem filled the tent opening when he arrived weaving slightly somebody want me belatedly he remembered to salute higgins barked at him colonel callahan do you ken you have your blouse on backwards callahan looked down so i have haha sir thats a very weighty matter very weighty no dont change it here youre drunk too so are callahan suppressed an appalling violation of discipline just in time maybe i had a little sir thats very weighty very weighty just think of it i ought to have you shot callahan grinned what would my regiment do then i dont know what would they do give you three guesses sir hic run away i suppose right the first time sir congratulations dont congratulate me you fool the secretary has a plan a plan really haw thane park i didnt see you how do you like our army park said i think its the goddamndest thing i ever saw in my life its a galloping nightmare oh come now said higgins some of the brave boys are a little green but its not as bad as all that a very young captain entered gave a heelclick that would have echoed if there had been anything for it to echo against and said sir the service company twentieth regiment third division has gone on strike what said the general why no food sir the goodwains arrived empty have them all shot no shoot one out of ten no wait a minute arrived empty you say somebody stole the food to sell at the local grocers take a platoon and clean out all the goods shops in guggenvik pay them in thingly ious the secretary interjected the althing will never pay those off you know i know they wont haha now lets get down to that plan of yours the names were all different allister park gave up trying to remember those of the dozens of small towns through which they rolled but the gently rolling stretches of southern indiana were much the same cut up into a checkerboard of fields with woodlots here and there and an occasional snaky line of cottonwoods marking the course of a stream the vinlanders had not discovered the beauties of billboard advertising which to parks mind was something not having a businessmans point of view he had no intention of introducing this charming feature of his own civilization into vinland the vinlanders did have their diabolical habit of covering the landscape with smoke from faulty burners in their wains and that was bad enough a rising whistle and a shattering bang from the rear made park jump around in the seat of his wain a mushroom of smoke and dust was rising from a hillside the airwain that had dropped the bomb was banking slowly to turn away the pneumatics clattered all along the column but without visible effect a couple of their own machines purred over and chased the bomber off those steamturbine planes were disconcertingly quiet things on the other hand the weight of their power plants precluded them from carrying either a heavy bomb load or a lot of fuel so they were far from a decisive arm they rustled across the sky with the dignity of dowagers seldom getting much over miles an hour and their battles had the deliberation of a duel between sailing shipsoftheline they wound down to the sunny ohio they called it the okeeyo both derived from the same iroquois word in the region where the airwains had reported the rebel army a rebel airwain a converted transport ship came to look them over and was shot down from across the river came faintly the rebel yells and the clatter of pneumatics firing at targets far out of range park guessed that discipline in brahtzs outfit was little if any better than in his own now if they wanted to the stage was set for an interminable campaign of inaction either side could try to sneak its men across the river without being caught in the act by the other or it could adopt a defensive program contenting itself with guarding all the likely crossings that sort of warfare would have suited general higgins fine minimizing as it did the chance that most of his musicalcomedy army would do a lightning advance to the rear as soon as they came under fire it would in fact have been sound tactics if they could have counted on the rebels remaining on the south bank of the okeeyo in that region instead of marching east toward guggenvik and if the dakotians were not likely to descend on their rear at any moment the secretary of war had gone back to new belfast leaving park the highestranking civilian with higgins army he had the good sense to keep out of sight as much as possible taking into account the soldiers traditional dislike of the interfering politician general etheling commanding the rebel army got a message asking if he would hold a parley with a civilian envoy of general higgins army general etheling wearing a military blouse over a farmers overalls and boots pulled his long mustache and said no if higgins wants to parley with me he can come himself back came the answer this is a very highranking civilian in fact he outranks higgins himself would that island in the middle of the okeeyo do etheling pulled his mustache some more and decided it would do so next morning general etheling wearing the purely ornamental battleax that formed part of the vinland officers dress uniform presented himself off the island as he climbed out of his rowboat he saw his opposite numbers boat pull away from the far side of the little island he advanced a way among the cottonwoods and yelled haw haw a stocky blond man appeared you all alone thane yes well ill be jiggered you boys kin go along back ill holler when i need you now thane who be you im bishop ib scoglund general what but aint you the wick who started the whole rumpus with all that silly talk about ricks for the skrellings the bishop sighed i did what i believed right in the sight of the lord but now a greater danger threatens us the dakotians are sweeping across our fair land like the hosts of midian of old surely it were wise to sink our little bickerings in the face of this peril you say the lousy redskins is doing an invasion well now thats the first i heered of that what proof you got park produced an assortment of papers dispatches a copy of the edgar daily tidings et cetera the general was at last convinced he said well ill be tarnally damned begging your pardon hallow i forgot as how you were a preacher thats all rick my son there are times when even in a cleric like me the baser passions rise and it is all i can do to refrain from saying damn myself well now thats rick handsome of you but what does old cottonhead higgins want me to do i got my orders you know i know my son but dont you see the divine will in these events when we his children fall out and desecrate the soil of vinland with our brothers blood he chastises us with the scourge of invasion let us unite to hurl back the heathen before it is too late general higgins has a plan for joint doing all worked out if you take it up he will prove his good faith by letting you cross the okeeyo unopposed what kind of plan is it i never knew cottonhead had enough brains to plan a barn dance not to mention a campaign i couldnt give you all the details theyre in this paper but i know they call for your army to put itself in the path of the invaders and when you are engaged with them for our army to attack their left flank if we lose our brotherly quarrel will be one with sodom and gomorrah if we win it will be surely possible to settle our strife without further bloodshed you will be a great man in the sight of the people and a good one in the sight of heaven general well i guess maybe as how youre right give me the rest of the day to study these here plans they shook hands the general made a fumbling salute and went over to his side of the island to call his boat thus he did not see the bishop hastily don his mustache and spectacles when general ethelings rebels crossed the river next morning they found no trace of higgins force except for the usual camp litter following directions they set out for edgar general higgins goaded to hurry by allister park sent his army rolling northward people in dustcolored work clothes came out to hang over fences and stare at them park asked one of these a strapping youth with some skrelling blood if he had heard of the invasion sure said the man reckon they wont git this fur though so we aint worrying the young man laughed loudly at the suggestion of volunteering me go off and git shot up so some other wick can sit on his rump and get rich not me thane if the folks in edgar gets scalped it serves em right for not paying us mair for our stuff as the army moved farther and farther toward edgar the expressions of the civilians grew more anxious as they approached the piankishaw wabash river they passed wains parked by the roads piled with household goods however when the army had passed many of these reversed their direction and followed the army back north toward their homes park was tempted to tell some of these people what idiots they were but that would hardly have been politic the army had little enough selfconfidence as it was higgins army spread out along the south bank of the piankishaw all those in the front line had by order stained their hands and faces brown the genuine skrellings were kept well back park took an observation post overlooking the main crossing of the river he had just settled himself when there was a tremendous purring hum from the other side of the bridge an enemy warwain appeared its ten tires screeched in unison as it stopped at the barrier on the road pneumatics began to pop on all sides the forward turret swung back and forth its gun clattering then a tremendous bang sent earth bridge and wain into the air the wain settled into the water on its side half out some men crawled out and swam for the far shore bullets kicking up little splashes around their bobbing heads up the river park could see a pontoon boat putting out from the north shore it moved slowly by poling passed out of sight in a few minutes it reappeared drifting downstream it came slowly past park and stopped against a ruined bridge abutment water gradually leaked through the bullet holes in the canvas until only one corner was above water a few arms and faces bobbed lazily just below the surface the firing gradually died down park could imagine the dakotians scanning the position with their field glasses and planning their next move if their reputation was not exaggerated it would be something devastating he climbed down from his perch and trotted back to headquarters where he found rufus callahan sober for once ten minutes later the two preceded by an army piper exposed themselves at the east end of the bridge park carried a white flag and the piper squealed parley on his instrument nobody shot at them so they picked their way across the bridge climbing along the twisted girders callahan got stuck im scared of high places he said through his teeth clinging to the ironwork park took out his air pistol youll be worse scared of me he growled the huge man was finally gotten under way again at the far end a skrelling soldier jumped out of the bushes rifle ready he crackled something at them in dakotian callahan answered in the same language and the man took them in tow as the road curved out of sight of the river park began to see dozens of warwains pulled up to the side of the road some had their turrets open and red men sat in them smoking or eating sandwiches there were other vehicles service cars of various kinds and horse cavalry with lances and short rifles they stopped by one warwain their escort snapped to a salute that must have jarred his bones an officer climbed out he wore the usual mustardcolored dakotian uniform topped off with the feathered war bonnet of the sioux indian after more chattering park and callahan were motioned in it was crowded inside park burned the back of his hand against a steam pipe and cut loose with a string of curses that brought admiring grins to the redbrown faces of the crew everything was covered with coal soot the engineer opened the throttle and the reciprocating engine started to chug park could not see out they stopped presently and got out and got into another warwain a very large one inside the big machine were a number of dakotian officers in the redwhiteandblack war bonnets a fat one with a little silver war club hanging from his belt was introduced to park and callahan as general tashunkanitko governor of the oglala and commanderinchief of the present expedition well snapped this person in a highpitched metallic voice callahan gave his sloppy salute which at first glance looked alarmingly as though he were thumbing his nose and said im representing the commander of the skrelling division the what the skrelling division weve been ordered by the althing to put down the uprising of the diamonds in the southwest of vinland they have a big army and are likely to win all vinland if not stopped we cant stop them and on the other hand we cant let them take all the south while you take all the north of vinland my commander humbly suggests that it is hardly proper for two armies of men of the same race to fick each other while their joint foe takes over all vinland as brahtzs army will do unless we join against it general tashunkanitko crackled something to one of his men who rattled back the general said it was taled that your men looked like skrellings but we could not get close enough to be sure and did not believe the tale what do you offer callahan continued my commander will not try to push the dakotians from the area west of the piankishaw if you will help him against the rebels does that offer bind your thing nay but as our army is the only real one at present under their command they will have nay way of enforcing their objections to prove our good faith we will if you agree let you cross the piankishaw without fickting the general thought for some seconds he said that offer ock to be put up to my government nay time sir the rebels are moving north from the okeeyo already anyway if we make a truce aside from our thing you should be willing to do the same after weve overthrown the brahtz army im sure we can find some workable arrangement between our armies tashunkanitko thought again i will do it have you a plan worked out yes sir right here when the dakotians crossed the piankishaw the next day there was no sign of the large and supposedly redskin army that had held the passage against them across the rolling indiana plain came the rattle of pneumatic rifles and the crack of air and mortarbombs general higgins told park we just got a message from general etheling says hes hard pressed and its about time we did our flank attack on the dakotians and this general tushtashgeneral madhorse wants to know why we havent attacked the flank of the rebels says hes still pushing em back but they outnumber him twa to ane and hes had a lot of mechanical breakdowns says if well hit them now theyll run we dont want to let either side win said park guess its time to start with considerable confusion though perhaps less than was to be expected the army of the new belfast got under way it was strung out on a fivemile front at right angles to the line of contact of the dakotian and rebel armies the right wing was the stronger since it would meet stronger resistance from tashunkanitkos hardened professionals than from ethelings armed hayseeds park squeezed into the observation turret of the headquarters wain beside higgins they went slowly so as not to outrun the infantry lurching and canting as the huge rubber doughnutshaped wheels pulled them over walls and fences they crunched through one corner of a farmyard and the countryside was at once inundated by fleeing pigs and chickens park had a glimpse of an overalled figure shaking a fist at the wain he couldnt help laughing it was too bad about the farmers livestock but there was something ultrarural about the mans indignation over a minor private woe when a battle was going on next door men began to appear ahead horsemen leaping fences and ditches scattered scouts dodging from tree to fence firing at unseen targets then frantically working the pumplevers of their rifles to compress the air for the next shot one of them was not a hundred yards away when he saw the advancing wains he stared stupidly at them until the forward machinegunner in the headquarters wain fired a burst that sent the gravel flying around the scouts feet the scout jumped straight up and came down running others ran when they saw the wains looming out of the dust a few who didnt see soon enough ran toward the advancing line with their hands up they met larger groups of redskins crawling or running from right to left with faces set each time there would be one face the first to turn then they would all turn the group would lose its form and purpose sublimating into its component human atoms some stood some ran in almost any direction then they were in a halfplowed field the plow and the steam tractor stood deserted among the brown furrows on the other side of the field crouched a hostile wain park felt the engine speed up as the two machines lumbered toward each other bullets pattered about his cupola it gratified him to see the general wince when they struck on and around the glass the wains came straight at each other park gripped the handholds tight the other wain stopped suddenly backed swiftly and tried to run in at them from the side their own jumped ahead with a roar its ram dug into the side of the other machine with a terrible crash they backed away park could see lubricating oil running out of the wound in the other machine it still crawled slowly his own mechanical rhinoceros charged again this time the other machine heaved up on its far wheels and fell over the fight went out of the dakotians all of a sudden they had made a terrific assault on twice their number then had fought steadily for two days their wains were battered their horses hungry and their infantry exhausted from pumping up their rifles and to have a horde of strangers roll up their flank just when victory was in sight no wonder general tashunkanitko and his officers let a tear or two trickle when they were rounded up general ethelings rebels fared no better rather worse in fact the skrelling regiment ran wild among the rural vinlanders doing what they had wanted to do for generations scalp the palefaces having somewhat hazy ideas about that ancestral ritual they usually made the mistake of trying to take off the whole top of a mans head instead of the neat little twoinch circle of scalp when they started in on the prisoners they had to be restrained by a few bursts of machinegun fire from one of higgins wains the train back to new belfast stopped at every crossroads so the people could come out and whoop they cheered allister park well enough they cheered rufus callahan they yelled for bishop scoglund the story had gone ahead how park and general higgins had devised a scheme for the entrapment of both the rebel and dakotian armies how the brave bishop had talked etheling into it how etheling had treacherously shot the brave bishop how callahan had swum the okeeyo with bishop scoglund on his back it was rumored that the city politician allister park had had something to do with these developments but you never want to believe anything good of these politicians since he was assistant secretary of war though it was only polite to give him a cheer too park did not think it would be prudent to show himself to the same audience both as park and as the bishop so they were all informed that his hallowship was recuperating as they rolled into new belfast park experienced the letdown feeling that comes at such moments what next by now noggle would have been rescued from parks knicks and returned to edwy borups hatch that was bound to happen anyway which was why park hadnt tried to use that method of getting noggle into his power before the whirling of the wheel of if was a delicate business not to be interrupted by people with warrants and he would have to see to it that somebody was left behind to force noggle to stop the wheel when the right point had been reached it ought not to be difficult now though if he couldnt use his present power and position to get hold of noggle hed have enough after election which would come off as scheduled after all first hed make noggle stop poor old kendricks wheel then hed have callahan or somebody stand over noggle with a gun while he spun his parks wheel through another half turn then maybe noggle would be allowed to halt his own carousel for the first three days after his return he was too busy to give attention to this plan everybody in new belfast seemingly had written him or telephoned him or called at one of his two homes to see him although monkeyface was a lousy secretary park didnt dare hire another so long as he had his double identity to maintain but the antonini trials were due in a week back in that other world and the heirs and assigns of trigvy darling had had a date set for a hearing on their damage claim and if park knew his history there would probably be a reconstruction period in the revolted territories of which he wanted no part for the second time edwy borup had his sanctuary invaded by allister park and a lot of toughlooking official persons including rufus callahan borup was getting resigned if not reconciled to this if they didnt let his prize patient noggle escape before they werent likely to this time haw noggle said park feel a little more withdoing nay snapped noggle but since you have me by the little finger i suppose ill have to do what you say all right youre honest anyway first youre going to stop bretwald kedricks wheel bring him in boys but i darent stop a wheel without my downwritings you bethink last time thats all right we brought your whole damn library over there was nothing to it noggle stared at the fidgety bretwald the period of whose cycle was fortunately just twice his so that both were in their own bodies at the same time then he said whew had a lot of psychic momentum that ane i just did stop him hell be all rick now what next park told everybody but callahan to go out then he explained that noggle was to give his wheel another half turn but objected noggle thatll take seven days whats going to be done with your body in the meantime itll be kept here and so will you when the halfcycles done youll stop my wheel and then well let you stop your own whenever you like ive made sure that youll stay here until you do the right thing by my wheel whether you cure your own case or not noggle sighed and macsvensson thock hed get some simpleminded idealist like the bishop how is it that your pattern of acting is otherly from his when by the laws of luck you started out with much the same forebearish makeup park shrugged probably because ive had to fick every step of the way while he was more or less born into his job were not so otherly at that his excess energy went into social crusading while mines gone into politics i have an ideal or two kicking around somewhere id like to meet bishop scoglund some time think id like him im afraid thats undoable said noggle even sending you back is risky i dont know what would happen if your body died while his mind indwelt it you might land in still another doable world instead of in your ain or you mick not land anywhere ill take a chance said park ready yes dr joseph noggle stared at park hey thane park said a voice from the doorway a wick named dunedin wants to see you says its weighty tell him im busy no ill see him monkeyface appeared panting have you gone yet have you changed glory to bridget you i mean his hallowship what i mean is the althing signed a treaty with the dakotians and cherogians and such setting up an international court for the continent of skrelleland and the bishop has been chosen one of the judges i thock you ock to know before you did anything well well said park thats interesting but i dont know that it changes anything callahan spoke up i think youd make a better judge allister than he would hes a fine fellow but he will believe that everybody else is as uprick as he theyd pull the wool over his eyes all the time park pondered after all what had he gone to all this trouble for why had he helped turn the affairs of half the continent upside down except to resume a career as public prosecutor which he hoped would some day land him on the bench and here was a judgeship handed him on a platter ill stay he said but objected noggle how about those thirteen other men on your wheel are you going to leave them out of their rick rooms park grinned if theyre like me theyre adaptable guys whove probably got started on new careers by now if we shift em all again itll just make more trouble for them come along rufus the funeral of allister park assistant secretary of war brought out thousands of people some were politicians who had been associated with park some came for the ride a few came because they liked the man in an anteroom of the cathedral bishop scoglund waited for that infernal music to end whereupon he would go out and preach the swellest damn funeral oration new belfast had ever heard it isnt given to every man to conduct that touching ceremony for his own corpse and the bishop intended to give his alterego a good sendoff in a way he was sorry to bid allister park goodbye allister had a good deal more in common with his natural authentic self than did the bishop but he couldnt keep up the two identities forever and with the judgeship on one hand and the damage suit on the other there wasnt much question of which of the two would have to be sacrificed the pose of piety would probably become natural in time the judgeship would give him an excuse for resigning his bishopric luckily the celtic christian church had a liberal attitude toward folk who wished to leave the church of course hed still have to be careful girlfriends and such maybe it would even be worthwhile getting married what the devil what do you wish my son said the bishop looking up into figgiss unpleasant face you know what i wish you old goat what are you going to do about my wife why friend it seems that you have been subject to a monstrous fooling you bet i please do not shout in the house of god what i was saying was that the guilty man was none other than the late allister park may the good lord forgive his sins he has been impersonating me as you know we looked much alike allister park upowned to me on his deathbed two days ago no doubt his excesses brought him to his untimely end still for all his human frailties he was a man of many good qualities you will forgive him will you not but but i please for my sake you would not speak ill of the dead would you oh hell your forgiveness bishop i thock i had a good thing thats all gbye sorry the music was coming to an end the bishop stood up straightened his vestments and strode majestically out if he could only count on that drunken nitwit callahan not to forget himself and bust out laughing the coffin smothered in flowers was like all coffins in vinland shaped like a viking longboat it was also filled with pine planks some people were weeping a bit even callahan in the front row was appropriately solemn friends we have gathered here to pay a last gild to one who has passed from among us the pugnacious peacemaker harry turtledove aka the wire recorder said aka aka aka aka eric dunedin repeated aka aka aka dunedins boss judge ib scoglund burst out laughing the thanes pinched rather simian face twisted into a reproachful frown scoglund could guess what he was thinking you didnt act like this back in the days when you were a bishop the judge knew dunedin was right he hadnt acted this way when he was a bishop not up until the very end of course the mind of an upandcoming new york assistant da named allister park hadnt come to inhabit this body till then either i beg forgiveness eric he said more or less sincerely but you have to say forth that twoth wordpart down in the back of the throat like this aka do you hear the otherness nay hallow er judge dunedin said allister park breathed through ib scoglunds nose in exasperation well youre going to have to learn to hear it if you ever aim at speak ketjwa the way you spoke it the way the letters look on paper to someone whos used to english aka doesnt mean corn beer it meansat the last moment he decided to have mercy on his servants sensibilities dung dunedin looked ready to burst into tears i never wanted to learn to speak ketjwa or aught save english all these skrelling tongues tie my wits up in knots privately scoglund or rather park agreed with him but he said im learning it so that shows you can and youll have to for no one in kuuskoo but a few men of letters and spokesfolk to the bretwaldate knows even one word of our speech how will you keep us in meat and potatoes to say naught of aka if you cant talk with the folk who sell them ill try judge dunedin said aka he pronounced it wrong again park sighed nobody could make his thane a linguist not in the couple of days before their steamship docked at uuraba on the northern coast of the landstrait of panama not in the new sea journey down from the landstraits southern coast to ookonja the port nearest kuuskoo and not with twenty years to work either a talent for languages simply wasnt in monkeyface the most to hope for was that he would learn more with park bullying him than without im going up on deck for some fresh air park announced you stay here till youve played that record two more times dunedin gave him a martyred look which he ignored the cabin was hot and stuffy no one in this world had thought of air conditioning park grabbed a hat and a couple of books and climbed the narrow iron staircase to the deck the air there was no less humid than it had been inside and hardly cooler summer on the westmiddle sea park still thought of it as the caribbean no matter what the map said was bound to be tropical but here at least the air was moving the deck chairs were deck chairs right down to their gaudy canvas webbing park threw himself into one it complained about his weight he sighed again all the alter egos on his wheel of if seemed to run to portliness they were all losing their hair too he put on the hat in a hurry before the sun seared his scalp soon he forgot sun humidity everything when he studied he studied hard and he had a lot of studying to do he felt like a student dropped into a class the week before exams ever since his actually ib scoglunds appointment to the international court for the continent of skrelleland the year before hed done little but study this worlds languages history and legal systems they were still strange to him but as soon as he got to kuuskoo he would have to start using them he wished hed been assigned a case involving the bretwaldate of vinland its customs were recognizably similar to the ones hed grown up with but assigning legal actions to disinterested outsiders made a certain amount of sense disinterested allister park certainly was nothing like either country involved in this dispute existed in the world he knew tawantiinsuuju was he gathered from the text in his lap what the inca empire might have become had spaniards not strangled it in infancy in this world though arabs and berbers still ruled spain among other places park thought that was part of the problem hed have to deal with a shadow fell on the book after a moment park looked up a man was standing by his chair you are judge scoglund he asked in ketjwa yes i am park answered slowly using the same language he was just glad he was talking with a man men and women used different words for kin and for other things in ketjwa and he wasnt any too familiar with the distaff side of the vocabulary who are you sir i am called ankowaljuu the fellow answered he was in his late thirties close to parks own age with redbrown skin straight black hair cut a little below his ears and a highcheekboned face dominated by a nose of nearly roman impressiveness he wore sandals a wool tunic and a black derby hat i am tukuuii riikook to the son of the sun maita kapak at the mention of his rulers name he shaded his eyes with one hand for a moment as if to shield them from the monarchs glory tukuuii riikook eh park looked at him with more interest than hed felt before ankowaljuu was no ordinary passenger you understand what it means then aye park said a tukuuii riikook was an imperial inspector of the secret sort outside the usual chain of command most empires had them under one name or another so the rulers could make sure their regular functionaries were performing as they should frowning the judge went on i do not understand why you tell me though ankowaljuu smiled displaying large white teeth shall i speak english to make sure i am clear please do park said with relief i am working to learn your tongue but i am not yet flowing in it you have the backofthethroat sounds which are most often hardest for vinlanders to gain ankowaljuu said but to go on i tell you because i want you to know you may count on me i speak for myself now mind you not for the son of the sun for as long as you have a hand in judging this dealing between my folk and the emirate of the dar alharb oh why is that park hoped his voice did not show his sudden hard suspicion his years in the das office told him no one ever offered anything for nothing you must understand i cannot talk with you about this dealing all the more so because you are a tukuuii riikook a thane of your emperor yes of course i understand that you naysay shows your honesty i must tell you the son of the sun was sorry he gave our quarrel with the emir to the international court when he learned the judge would be from vinland why is that park asked again this time out of genuine curiosity my country has little to do with either yours or the emirate because so many vinlanders are forejudged against skrellings ankowaljuu said grimly but when i came up to new belfast to find out what sort of man you are i found his mistrusts were misplaced no one who has swinked so hard for the ricks of the skrellings in vinland could be anything but fair in his judgments well thank you very much park murmured a little embarrassed at taking credit for work that had actually been ib scoglunds i wont needfully choose for you either just because youre skrellings you know ankowaljuu made a shoving motion as if to push that idea aside i would not reckon anything of the sort but it is good to know you will not turn against us just because the folk of the dar alharb are incomers to skrelleland like you vinlanders i never thock of that park clapped a hand to his forehead this bounds strife is quite embrangled enough without worries of that sort so it is ankowaljuu chuckled a bit unpleasantly at least i need not trouble myself about any faithly forejudgment on your part as a onetime christian bishop no doubt you will have glick scorn for the emir and his allah on the one hand and our hallowing of the sun and patjakamak who put it in the sky on the other i think all faiths can be good park said ankowaljuus eloquent grunt showed just how much he believed that the funny thing was park really meant it anyone who wanted to play politics in new york had to feel or at least act that way and nothing in parks experience with criminals had shown him that people who followed any one religion behaved conspicuously better than those who believed in another trouble was both the tawantiinsuujans and the emirs subjects took their religions so damned seriously dar alharb itself meant land of warwar against the pagans the moors of cordova had found when they crossed to what park still sometimes thought of as brazil since all the skrellings in the southern half of skrelleland were pagan the past few hundred years had seen a lot of war well maybe this is one war well stop he muttered he didnt know he had spoken aloud until ankowaljuu said i hope we do the tukuuii riikook raised a hand to the brim of his derby and walked off park opened his book to the place his thumb had been keeping religion politics greed embrangled wasnt nearly a strong enough word for this case a word that was came to mind but not one suited for polite company he said it anyhow softly and plunged back in reed flutes whistled mournfully allister park didnt think it was fit music for a fanfare but nobodyd asked him judge ib scoglund of the international court of skrelleland a flunky bawled in ketjwa park bowed at the doorway to the big reception hall slowly walked in slowly was the operative word he thought kuuskoo was more than two miles above sea level the air was chilly and above all thin hed come by train from the broiling tropical port of ookonja in less than a day any sudden motion made his heart pound wildly he looked around for a chair he spotted one but before he could sit down a big redfaced man came over to pump his hand haw good to meet you hallow er thane er judge scoglund he boomed im osfric lundqvist the bretwaldates spokesman to the son of the sun thank you thane lundqvist park said my joyment lundqvist did not let go of parks hand thank you park repeated trying to find some polite way to disengage himself from the ambassador lundqvist was he knew an amiable nonentity who drank too much because several nations lay between vinland and tawantiinsuuju this was a safe enough post for a rich squire with more influence than ability no matter how badly he blundered he could not start a war by himself as if by magic eric dunedin appeared at parks elbow judge the son of the suns warden for outlandish dealings wants to meet you outlandish dealings then park made the mental leap between the english he was used to and the bretwaldates dialect the foreign affairs minister monkeyface meant oh of course thanks eric here let me inlead you to him lundqvist said eagerly thats all rick your bestness but i ock to go alone im here as judge for the international court after all not as a burgman of vinland and park thought ill get you out of my hair lundqvist looked disappointed but managed a nod the warden for outlandish dealings was a middleaged skrelling with irongray hair cut in a pageboy bob like ankowaljuus unlike ankowaljuu though he wore in each ear a silver plug big enough to stopper a bathtub only the high nobility of tawantiinsuuju still clung to that style park bowed to him spoke in ketjwa i am glad to meet you minister tjiimpuu tjiimpuu bowed in return not as deeply and set his right hand on parks left shoulder and i you judge scoglund how fare you in our mountain city the climate is not much like that to which you had grown accustomed traveling here is it no indeed park tried a ketjwa proverb patjam kuutin the world changes as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wished he had them back the sayings implication was for the worse but tjiimpuu laughed lowlanders always have trouble catching their breath here sit down if you need to park gratefully sank into a chair tjiimpuu gestured to a servant spoke rapidly the man nodded and hurried away he returned a moment later with a painted earthenware cup full of some gently steaming liquid tjiimpuu took it from him handed it to park here drink this many lowlanders find it helps give them strength thank you sir park sniffed the contents of the cup the liquid was aromatic but unfamiliar he tasted it it was more bitter than hed expected but no worse than strong tea drunk without sugar and by the time hed finished the cup he did indeed feel stronger for the first time since hed reached kuuskoo his lungs seemed to be getting enough air thats marvelous stuff he exclaimed what is it cocaleaf tea tjiimpuu said park stared at him back in new york hed spent part of his time throwing cocaine peddlers and cocaine users in jail he wondered if the foreign minister was trying to trap him in an indiscretion then he noticed tjiimpuu had a cup of the stuff too oh he said weakly most uh invigorating i thought it would do you good tjlimpuu said i still should warn you not to exert yourself too strenuously for the next moon or two or you may fall seriously ill i will remember park said after a moment he added could you please send some over to my servant of the two of them dunedin would likely be doing more physical work a waiter soon gave monkeyface a cup park caught dunedins eye nodded his man had been looking doubtfully at the stuff now he drank though he made a face at the taste park nodded again sternly this time and watched him finish the tea when dunedin felt what it did for his insides he grinned at his boss which only made him look more like a monkey than ever now to business tjiimpuu said in a tone of voice different from the one hed used before i must tell you that the son of the sun will not permit the boundary between ourselves and the emirate of the dar alharb to be moved from where his father the great waskar fixed it twentyeight years ago under waskar tawantiinsuuju had won the most recent clash with its eastern neighbor setting conditions at the start of talks is no way to have them succeed park said for the son of the sun to abandon land his father won would disgrace him before patjakamak the creator of the world and before the holy sun that looks down on all he does tjiimpuu said icily it cannot be judge scoglund that was the wrong tack to take with allister park do not tell me what can and cannot be he said when tawantiinsuuju agreed to let the international court decide your latest quarrel you put that power into its hands and through it into mine i could order you out of my land this very instant tjiimpuu growled perhaps i should for your insolence go ahead park said cheerfully im sure you will make the son of the sun happy by disgracing tawantiinsuuju before all skrelleland and for showing it thinks itself above the international court you and the emir had me brought down here to do a job and by godpatjakamak allah or plain old father son and holy ghost im going to do it someone behind park spoke up well said he turned the newcomer was a tall smiling man dark but not skrellingcolored and wearing a neat black beard no skrelling could have raised he had on flowing cotton robes and a satin headscarf held in place by an emeraldgreen cord he was in short a moor bowing to park the fellow said allow me to introduce myself sir i pray i am daud ibn tariq ambassador from the dar alharb to the pagans of tawantiinsuuju i greet you in the name of allah the compassionate the merciful he is himself perfect justice and so loves those who end disputes among mankind his ketjwa was elegant and eloquent park got to his feet even with the coca tea it took a distinct physical effort also in ketjwa he replied i am honored to meet you your excellency tjiimpuu had risen too his face like thunder daud smiled a smile park guessed intended to get further under the skin of his rival the ambassador suddenly shifted to english hes a rick ugly misbegot isnt he park glanced at tjiimpuu he hadnt understood but he didnt look happy about dauds using a language he didnt know park decided he couldnt blame him he stayed in ketjwa as he bowed to daud if you admire justice so much excellency you will see it is only just to keep to a language all of us know as you say of course daud agreed at once i hope though that you have also applied yourself to learning the tongue of the dar alharb for where is justice if the judge knows one speech and not the other he was smooth where tjiimpuu was blunt park thought but he looked to be equally stubborn park kept a poker face as he sprang his surprise i am working on it yes he said in the berberflavored arabic of the emirate inshallah i shall succeed tjiimpuu burst out laughing he has you there he told daud also in arabic park had figured he would know that language so he does daud plucked at his whiskers for a moment as he studied park tell me judge scoglund did you know either of these tongues before you were assigned our dispute park shook his head this world had no international diplomatic language the dominance of english and french in his own world sprang from the longlasting might and prestige of those who spoke them power here was more fragmented how does it feel studying two new languages at the same time tjiimpuu asked park thumped his temple with the heel of his hand as if trying to knock words straight into his head the minister and ambassador both laughed park was pleased with himself for defusing their hostility maybe that would prove a good omen it didnt tjiimpuus frown returned as he rounded on daud i got a report on the wirecaller this afternoon that raiders from the emirate attacked a town called kiiniigwa in tawantiinsuujan territory they burned the suntemple kidnapped several women from the sacred virgins there and fled back toward the border how say you taller than tjiimpuu daud looked down his long nose at him i could answer in several ways first my ruler the mighty emir hussein does not recognize your seizure of kiiniigwa second surely you do not claim this was carried out by the army of the dar alharb if i claimed that the tawantiinsuujan foreign minister growled my country and yours would be at war now international court or no international court and you sir would be on the next train out of kuuskoo well then you see how it is daud spread his hands even assuming the report is true what do you expect my government to do tracking down the raiders and striking off their heads would be a good first step tjiimpuu said sending those heads to the son of the sun with a note of apology would be a good second one but why when theyve broken no law again daud smiled that silky irritating smile wait a bit allister park broke in sharply since when arent arson and kidnapping and probably rape and murder too against the law since they are worked against pagans by muslims seeking to extend the sway of islam answered daud ibn tariq in that context under the sharia under islamic law nothing is forbidden the ghazi the warrior of the jihad he meant it park realized hed read about the holy war islam espoused against what it called paganism but what hed read hadnt seemed quite real to him jihad smacked too much of the crusades which hadnt happened in this world and of medieval times in general for him to believe the concept could be alive and well in the twentieth century but daud a clever intelligent man took it seriously and so by his expression did tjiimpuu ghazi the tawantiinsuujan made it into a swear word the emirate uses this as an excuse to send its criminals and wild men to the frontier to work their crimes on us instead of on its own good people if such there be and to lure more criminals and wild men to its shore from the emirate of cordova from north africa even from asia so they too can kill and steal in our land to their hearts content the answer is simple daud said tjiimpuu looked at him in surprise so did allister park if the answer were simple he wouldnt have been here halfway up the andes antiis they spelled it here then the ambassador went on if your people acknowledge the truth of islam the frontier will no longer be held against pagans and strife will cease of its own accord i find my faith as true as you find yours or the onetime bishop scoglund here finds his tjiimpuu said park had the feeling this was an old argument and sensibly kept his mouth shut about his own occasional doubts but it is false a trick of shaitan to drag you and all your stubborn pagan people down to hell daud said aka tjiimpuu pronounced the word as eric dunedin had but he did so deliberately patjakamak is the one real god he set the sun aflame in the sky as a token of his might and sent the sons of the sun down to earth to light our way one day the whole world will see the truth of this the ache that started pounding inside parks head had nothing to do with the altitude gentlemen please he said ive come here to try to keep the peace not to see you fight in the hall can there be true peace with pagans daud demanded they are far worse than christians thank you so much park snapped the moor he thought angrily was too fanatical even to notice when he was insulting someone tjiimpuu though was every bit as unyielding one day we will rid skrelleland of you hairy sundenying bandits would that we were strong enough to do it now instead of having to chaffer with you like potato merchants potatoes is it one fine day we will roast potatoes in the embers of kuuskoo daud ibn tariq whirled around and stormed off his exit would have been more impressive had he not bumped into the envoy from araukanja the skrelling land south of tawantiinsuuju and knocked a mug of corn beer aka in the other sense of the word out of said envoys hand dripping and furious daud stomped out into the chilly night even in summer even within thirteen degrees of the equator early morning in tawantiinsuuju was cold allister park pulled his llamawool cloak tighter as he walked through the towns quiet streets the exercise made his heart race he knew a cup of cocaleaf tea would be waiting for him at the foreign ministry he looked forward to it here it was not only legal but he was finding necessary a goodwain chuffed by its steam engine all but silent its staked bed much like those of the pickup trucks he had known back in new york was piled high with ears of corn probably taken from a tamboo a storehouse to feed some hungry village park supposed a third of everything the locals produced went into tamboos tawantiinsuuju was more socialistic than the soviet union ever dreamed of being the goodwain disappeared around a corner the few men and women on the streets went about their business without looking at allister park in new york in new belfast in this world such an obvious stranger would have attracted staring crowds not here the town was as alien as the people it had its own traditions and cared nothing for the ones park was used to many buildings looked as old as time huge square made from irregular blocks of stone some of them taller than he was only the fresh thatch of their roofs said they had not stood unchanged forever even the newer structures those with more than one story and tile roofs were from a similar mold and one that owed nothing to any architecture sprung from europe vinlands close neighbors among the skrelling nations dakotia especially had borrowed heavily from the technically more sophisticated newcomers but tawantiinsuuju had a thriving civilization of its own by the time european ideas trickled so far south it took what it found useful wheels the alphabet iron smelting it had already known bronze the horse and later steam power and incorporated that into its own way of life as japan had in parks home world the foreign ministry was in the district called kantuutpata east of parks lodgings a kantuut he knew was a kind of pink flower and sure enough many such grew there in gardens and window boxes the tawantiinsuujans were often very literalminded the ministry building was of the newer sort though its concrete walls were deeply scored to make it look as if it were built of cyclopean masonry the guards outside however looked thoroughly modern they were dressed in drab fatigues very much like the ones their vinlandish counterparts wore and carried pipescompressedair guns at the ready their commander studied parks credentials with scrupulous attention before nodding and waving him into the building thank you sir the judge said politely the officer nodded again and tied a knot in the kiipuu whose threads helped him keep track of incoming visitors inside the ministry building park felt on more familiar ground bureaucrats behaved similarly the worlds around be they clerks in a das office clerics or tawantiinsuujan diplomatic officials the measured pace of their steps their expressions either selfcentered or worried the sheaves of paper in their handsall were things park knew well he also knew all about cooling his heels in an outer office when some flunky of tjiimpuus tried to make him do it he stepped past the fellow sir the excellent tjiimpuu will see you when it is convenient for him the skrelling protested hell see me when its convenient for me tjiimpuu looked up in surprise and annoyance as the door to his sanctum came open so did the man with him a solidly built skrelling of middle years dressed in a richer version of the graybrown uniform the ministry guards wore the two men stood over a map table the maps park saw were of the area in dispute with the emirate of the dar alharb judge scoglund you have no business intruding uninvited tjiimpuu said coldly no by your companion id say i have every business if you are talking with a soldier at the same time you talk with me that tells me something of how serious you are about my mission unlike dauds parks nose was not really long enough to stare down but he did his best the soldier said i will handle this then he surprised park by shifting to english let him who wants peace foreready himself for war some old roman wrote that judge scoglund in a warly book it was a rick thock then and rick it stays in our ain time vinland regretted forgetting it last year nay you have a point park admitted with any sort of decent army to overawe potential rebels the bretwaldate would not have gone through a spasm of civil war but still ah i am kwiismankuu apuu maita marshal you would say in your tongue of tawantiinsuuju kwiismankuu returned to ketjwa now i will leave this matter in the hands of you two gentlemen so learned in the arts of peace if you fail i will be ready to make good your mistakes bowing to both tjiimpuu and park he tramped out of the foreign ministers office park walked over to the table and examined the map tjiimpuu and kwiismankuu had been using little kiipuu figures with knots drawn in different ways were scribbled by towns park suspected they stood for the sizes of local garrisons but could not be sure to the uninitiated kiipuus were worse than roman numerals he noticed how far east the tawantiinsuujan map put the border well into what he thought of as venezuela clicking tongue against teeth he said not even tjeroogia or northumbria recognizes your claim to so much territory and theyre the best friends tawantiinsuuju has we won the land we will keep it tjiimpuu declared as he had at the reception a few days before if this was what he thought negotiating was all about park thought gloomily the upcoming sessions would be long boring and fruitless he tried another tack how many folk in the land you conquered in your last war with the emirate are still muslims he asked a fair number tjiimpuu said adding though day by day we work to convert them to the true faith of patjakamak and the sun thereby endearing yourselves both to the locals and to the emirate park thought he didnt know whether the tawantiinsuujans had borrowed the idea of one exclusive religion from christianity and islam or thought of it for themselves either way they had their own full measure of missionary zeal dakotia is neutral in this dispute park said not least because it borders no state that has a boundary with yours dakotian mapshe drew one out of his leather briefcase to show to tjiimpuushow your border with the emirate running so this might be a line from which you and daud could at least begin talks and abandon everyone east of it to the muslims savagery and false faith the foreign minister sounded appalled they feel the same way about your worship of patjakamak park pointed out but they are ignorant and misguided while we possess the truth park resisted a strong temptation to bend over and pound his forehead against the top of the table that tjiimpuu was sincere made matters no better if anything it made them worse a scoundrel was much more amenable to persuasion than someone honestly convinced of the righteousness of his cause sighing park said i had hoped to sound you out before we began facetoface talks with daud ibn tariq maybe this will work out better though if he is as stubborn as you the whole world will see neither side is serious about ending your life of war after war tjiimpuus face turned a darker shade of bronze i will speak with you again when these talks begin till then i want nothing to do with you you are dismissed let the moors try to claim im biased toward skrellings now park thought as he walked out to the street on the whole he was more pleased than not over his confrontation with tjiimpuu he would have been happier yet however had the tawantiinsuujan foreign minister shown even the slightest sign of compromise kuuskoos streets nearly deserted an hour before now swarmed with life the locals quiet and orderly as usual all seemed to be going in the same direction what are you doing park asked a man walking by the man turned stared in surprise for all park knew he had never seen a pinkcheeked sandyhaired person before neither travel nor communication between distant lands was as easy here as in the judges native world still the kuuskans answer was polite enough we go to the festival of raimii of course raimii eh that was the most important religious festival in tawantiinsuuju the solemn feast of the sun curiosity got the better of park though he knew the original inhabitant of exbishop ib scoglunds body would not have been caught dead attending such a pagan rite too bad for old ib he thought maybe ill come with you the local beamed shifted the big cud of coca leaves in his mouth i always thought foreigners were too ignorant and depraved to understand our religion perhaps i was wrong park only grunted in response to that he walked with the crowd now instead of trying to cut across it the skrellings lowvoiced talk grew louder and more excited as they filed into a large plaza near the center of kuuskoo the square was as big as two football fields side by side maybe bigger park tried to work out how many people it could hold lets see he thought assuming each person needs a little more than a square foot to stand in if thisplace is say feet by he gave up the arithmetic as a bad job for he suddenly saw that the walls of two sides of the square had a golden chain stretched along them a little above manhigh each link was thicker than his wrist instead of figuring out people he started reckoning how many dollars or even vinland crowns that chain would be worth a lot of them for sure the tawantiinsuujan who had told him of the festival was still beside him he saw park staring at the chain this is as nothing stranger this is but the common peoples square we call it kuusipata the son of the sun and his kin worship one square over in the plaza called awkaipata there you would see gold and silver used in a truly lavish way this is lavish enough for me park muttered just one link of that chain he thought and he wouldnt have to worry about money for the rest of his life for the first time he understood what francisco pizarro must have felt when he plundered the wealth of the incas back in parks original world hed always thought pizarro the champion bandit of all time but the sight of so much gold lying around loose would have made anyone start breathing hard several men strode out onto a raised platform at the front of the square some wore gold and silver wreaths and had plates of the precious metals adorning their tunics others used the hides of pumas and jaguars in place of robes with their own faces peering out under the big cats heads when one man held his arms wide others had to step aside for his costume included huge condor wings feathered in black and white one of the priests for such they were raised his hands to the sky all the people in the square somehow found room to squat park was a beat late and felt rather like an impostor trying to pretend he belonged in a marching band his knees creaked as he held the squat he grumpily wondered why the tawantiinsuujans couldnt kneel when they worshiped like everyone else that would have been a lot more comfortable the locals tilted their heads back so they looked up toward the sun they must have had a trick for not looking right at it park didnt know the trick he kept on staring blearily upwards dazzled and blinking his eyes full of tears the tawantiinsuujans held their hands up by their faces and loudly kissed the air somehow again a beat slow park managed to do the same without toppling over into one of the people by him the priests on the platform began to sing a hymn still squatting the squareful of worshipers joined in everybody everybody but park knew the words some voices were good others not taken all together they were impressive almost hypnotic the way any massed singing becomes after a while the hymn was long parks knees hurt too much to let him be hypnotized back in his new york days hed never thought much of baseball players as athletes but now he started feeling no small respect for what catchers went through at last the hymn ended people stood up another hymn started when it was done the tawantiinsuujans squatted again so stifling a groan did allister park yet another hymn began by the time the service was finally done park felt as though hed caught a doubleheader he also desperately needed to find a public jakes is that not a magnificent festival asked the skrelling whod inveigled him into going to the square of kuusipata well maybe it hadnt happened exactly like that but at the moment parks memory was inclined to be selective most impressive he said lying through his teeth raimii will go on for nine days in all the local told him each days worship being different from the last will you come to kuusipata tomorrow your foreign excellency if i can park said that seeming a more politic response than not on your life after nine days of squatting he was convinced he would walk like an arthritic chimp forevermore then something he had noticed but not thought about during the service sank home nine days he exclaimed i saw no books for prayer among you do you remember all your songs and such of course we do the skrelling said proudly they are graven on our hearts only people whose faith is cold have to remind themselves of it books for prayer indeed the very idea offended him park was thoughtful as he filed toward the edge of the square reading was obviously easier and more trustworthy than memorizing and therefore to him anyway obviously more desirable for keeping records straight the tawantiinsuujans though as he had already discovered in other contexts did not think the same way he did maybe that was what made him notice the goodwain parked near a wall fifty yards or so beyond the edge of the square in new york or even in new belfast he would not have given it a second glance parking spaces were where you found them in kuuskoo though it surprised him it impeded the flow of people coming out of kuusipata and that was unlike the orderly folk here the locals must have thought the same a man climbed up onto the running board reached out to unlatch the driversside door so he could get in and move the truck out of the way the door wasnt locked few were in lawabiding thwantiinsuuju he yanked it open the goodwain blew up park felt the blast more than he heard it the next thing he knew he was on the ground the cobbles were hard and bumpy as if from very far away he heard people shrieking he shook his head trying to clear it and scrambled to his feet the carnage closer to the goodwain was appalling he shivered as he saw how lucky he was only the bodies of the people in front of him had shielded him from the full force of the explosion half a dozen men sprang up from behind the wall which was of ancient megalithic stonework and hence undamaged by the blast for a moment park thought theyd got up there to direct help to the writhing victims near them then he saw they all had air rifles they raised them to their shoulders started shooting into the crowd allister park had seen combat as a young man in his own world and again during his brief tenure as vinlands assistant secretary of war at the sound of the first sharp pop he threw himself flat he knocked over the person behind him they fell together the men with guns shouted in unison as they fired park took a moment to notice first that the shouts were not in ketjwa then that he understood them anyhow allahu akbar the gunmen cried god is great allahu akbar someone screamed right in parks ear only then did he realize he was lying on a woman her fist pounded his shoulder let me go she yelled she tried to push him off her no stay down by some miracle he remembered to speak ketjwa instead of english as if to punctuate his words a bullet felled a man standing not three paces away the woman screamed again and shuddered but seemed to decide park was protecting rather than attacking her she quit struggling beneath him around them the noise of the crowd changed from horror to animal fury people surged toward the men on the wall had the gunmen been carrying the automatic weapons parks world knew they would have massacred their assailants with air rifles that had to be pumped up after every shot they slowed but could not stop the outraged mob allahu akbar park lifted his head just in time to see the last gunman raise a defiant fist and jump down in back of the wall the locals scrambled over it to give chase one was shot but more kept on others men and women both began to tend the scores of injured people near the twisted wreckage of the goodwain park cautiously got to his feet after a few seconds he was convinced no more guntoting fanatics were going to spring from nowhere he stooped to help up the woman he had flattened when the shooting started thank you she said with some dignity accepting his hand i am sorry i screamed at you you saw the danger from those madmen she shivered before almost anyone else i am glad you are not hurt park said for the first time he had the leisure to take a look at her she was he guessed only a few years younger than he one or two white threads ran through the midnight mane that hung almost to her waist she was attractive in the longfaced highcheekboned local fashion her mantle and brightly striped skirt were of soft fine wools the derby shed been wearing was crushed beyond repair she picked it up made a wry face threw it down again then she studied allister park with as much interest or perhaps curiosity as he showed her you are not one of us she said why were you at the festival of raimii to see what it was like he answered honestly i probably will never be in kuuskoo again while i am here i want to learn and see as much as i can she considered that nodded did the beauty of the service incline you toward the worship of the sun and patjakamak despite wearing an exbishops body park wished people would stop asking him loaded religious questions he temporized the services were very beautiful ah my name is kuurikwiljor she said park gave his own or rather ib scoglunds name then said kuurikwiljorgolden star thats very pretty so by the way are you he played that game almost as automatically as he breathed his attitude toward women was decidedly pragmatic but just as genuine a sense of duty made him look around to make sure he was not needed here before he asked where are you going now may i walk there with you so you will feel safe kuurikwiljor he saw with approval looked toward the wounded herself before she answered with the usual tawantiinsuujan efficiency teams of uniformed medics were already on the scene they slapped on bandages set broken bones and loaded the worst hurt onto stretchers for more extensive treatment elsewhere they did not seem to need any unskilled help park also saw kuurikwiljor eye him appraisingly he did not mind that he was sensible enough to think well of good sense in others whatever kuurikwiljor saw must have satisfied her for she said thank you i am staying at my brothers house in the district of puumatjupan that district park knew was in the southern part of the city with kuurikwiljor following he started in that direction on to the house of your brother he declared he thought he sounded rather grand but kuurikwiljor giggled he mentally reviewed what hed just said oh hell he muttered in english then he switched back to ketjwa more careful ketjwa this time i mean the house of your waukej not your toora hed tripped himself up by echoing kuurikwiljor waukej was the word men used for brother while toora was reserved for women thats better kuurikwiljor said you dont speak badly from what ive heard most foreigners would never have noticed their mistake ib scogljund in his turn he tried to get her to say the l in his name without pronouncing it as if it were ly he had no luck the simple l sound did not exist in ketjwa after teasing her a little he gave up never mind it sounds charming as you say it but i should be right kuurikwiljor said seriously ib scogscogscogljund oh a pestilence they both laughed the fumbling with languages and names helped break the ice between them they talked all the way down to kuurikwiljors brothers house park learned she was a childless widow that sort of thing was only too common in this world which knew less of medicine and a lot less about immunization than his own kuurikwiljor sounded suitably impressed about parks reasons for coming to tawantiinsuuju we need to find some way to live at peace with the emir she said either that or wipe his country from the face of the earth sometimes i think muslims are viler than the dogeating wankas the way those terrible men took advantage of the accident to work even more harm on us she shook her head my mantle is all splashed with blood truly park thought this world was more naпve than the one from which hed come as gently as he could he said kuurikwiljor i dont think that was an accident i think they made that truck blow up i think they were waiting for it to blow up so they would have a confused and frightened crowd to shoot at she stared at him what a dreadful thing to say but after walking a few steps in silence she went on that does make sense doesnt it they would hardly be waiting with guns just in case there was an explosion hardly park agreed he let it go at that telling her the tawantiinsuujans were little kinder to muslims would have accomplished nothing her brothers house was a large impressive stone building next to one of the streams that defined the boundaries of puumatjupan servants came rushing out when they saw kuurikwiljor they exclaimed over her bedraggled state and once they found park had helped her come home safe praised him to the skies and pressed llama meat cornmeal mush and aka on him before long he found himself meeting kuurikwiljors brother a stocky solemn man of about his own age named pauljuu most kind of you foreign sir and most generous pauljuu said i know you sought none but let me reward you for the service you have done my family he drew a heavy gold signet ring from his right thumb tried to hand it to park thank you but i must say no park told him as pauljuus face clouded over park went on quickly i am a judge how will people say i judge fairly if i take presents from one side ah pauljuu nodded i have heard it said that all foreigners will do anything for gold i am glad to see it is not so any saying that claims all of some group will do a particular thing is not to be trusted park observed spoken like a judge if not gold then how may i express my thanks pauljuu asked you should know my father ruuminjavii is kuuraka governor of the province of sausa to the north i need not stint park bowed as i say i am a judge i will not i must not take your gifts he hesitated for a moment then said still if you would not mind me coming to see your sister he carefully used the right word not wanting to embarrass himself again that would be very kind pauljuu glanced toward kuurikwiljor who had been sitting quietly while the two men talked in some ways park thought tawantiinsuuju was positively victorian too bad no one here had any idea what victorian meant kuurikwiljor nodded as it pleases her and pleases you i have no objection pauljuu said park bowed again to him then to kuurikwiljor thank you both he said have you a wirecaller here in this world the telephone had been invented in northumbria its ketjwa name was a literal translation of what english speakers called it here of course ask for the house of ruuminjaviis son the man who connects calls will make sure it goes through pauljuu said good i will call soon may i also use the wirecaller now to let my own people know i am all right they will be wondering after me of course pauljuu said again come this way he stood up to take park to wherever he kept the phone park rose too as he followed pauljuu out kuurikwiljor called after him thank you for looking after me so fortunately pauljuus house had high doors and tall ceilings otherwise park thought he was so swelled up with pride that he might have bumped his head on them he let pauljuu place the call for him before long he heard eric dunedins reedy voice on the other end of the line hallowuh judge scoglund monkeyface exclaimed are you hale where have you been with the burg all bestirred by the goodwain blast i was afeared after you im fine eric and among friends park repeated himself in ketjwa for pauljuus benefit then returned to english ill be home soon see you then take care of yourself bye he put the mouthpiece back into the big square box on the wall said his goodbyes to pauljuu and started back to the small house he and dunedin were sharing he whistled as he walked north through the streets of kuuskoo he hadnt met a woman like kuurikwiljor since since he came to this world he thought and that was a goodly while now she was pretty had some brains and seemed to think well of him he liked the combination liked it a lot of course he reminded himself as he walked a little farther one reason she interested him so much was that he hadnt had much to do with women since hed come here celtic christian bishops were depressingly celibate and hed stayed discreet even after he left the church judges didnt have to avoid women but they did need to keep away from scandal yes park thought if kuurikwiljor were just one of the girls i was seeing i might think she was pretty ordinary but at the moment she was the only girl he was seeing that automatically made her special park grinned a wolfly grin hed enjoy whatever happened and keep his wits about him while he did so keeping his wits about him meant taking a wide detour around the plaza of kuusipata he hadnt had a good look at the gunmen there for all he knew they could have been converted skrellings even so the locals especially those near the square were liable to be jumpy about anyone who looked foreign better safe he thought he never found out whether his precautions were needed he did get home safe and sound which was the idea tawantijnsuujan doors had neither knockers nor bells a polite person here clapped his hands outside a house and waited to be admitted at the moment park didnt care whether he was polite by local standards he pounded on the door from the speed with which dunedin opened it he must have been waiting just inside his welcoming smile turned into a grimace of dismay when he saw his master hallow patricks shinbone he gasped what befell you what are you talking about park said irritably im downrightly fine nothing wrong with me at all i mistrust i need a bath but thats no big dealing why are you looking at me as if i just grew a twoth head dunedins smile returned hesitantly you do ah sound like your ain self judge scoglund maybe you ock to peer into the spickleglass though park let his servant lead him to the mirror his jaw dropped as he stood in front of it he looked as though hed been through a waron the losing side he was dirty his cloak was ripped and there was blood both on it and on the side of his face hed seen how bedraggled kuurikwiljor was after the truck blew up yet never thought to wonder whether he was the same as a matter of fact he wasnt the same he was worse its not my blood he said feeling like a fool praise god and the hallows for that dunedin said now shall i get the bath you spoke of ready aye put the kettle on park said kuuskoo had cold running water but not hot and cold water here was cold water the judge looked at himself again he was filthy im near lured into not waiting for it when you were bishop youd have been well bethock for mortifying your flesh so dunedin said shall i draw you a cold bath then hell no im not bishop any more thank god and my flesh came too damn close to being mortified for good this afternoon thank you very much dunedins eyes got big hearing such language from his boss could still shock him though he knew someone new was living in that formerly saintly brain ill get the kettle filled he said park felt a prick of guilt turning monkeyfaces wrinkled cheeks red was a cheap thrill thanks eric he said while youre back there why dont you see if our hosts have given us anything stronger than aka if they have find a couple of glasses and join me tawantiinsuujan whiskey tasted like raw corn liquor park had never gotten drunk in a bathtub before it was fun after a couple of protests for effect dunedin got drunk too park taught him ninetynine bottles of beer on the wall he liked it they got louder with every bottle that fell after some considerable while monkeyface asked ish is that fortytwo bottles left or fortyone ihic cant bethink park tried to find an appropriately judicial solution well jusht have to start over but dunedin was sprawled against the side of the tub snoring softly he was almost as wet as his master a good deal of splashing had accompanied the singing the water park noticed was cold he wondered how long it had been that way he started to sing solo discovered his teeth were chattering it had been cold for a while then he pulled the pottery stopper from the drain climbed out of the tub eric he said dunedin kept on snoring park dragged him to his bed then he staggered into his own bedroom and collapsed the next morning altitude turned what would have been a bad hangover into a killer coca tea helped a little but not enough park wished for aspirins and black coffee wishing failed to produce them eric dunedin was still out like a light envying him park got dressed and braved the vicious sunlight outside as he walked over to the foreign ministry the handful of guards outside the building had been replaced by a platoon of troopers a good many of them were standing in a tight circle around someone they waved their arms and shouted at whoever it was at the moment park disliked shouting on general principles whats going on here he said then he saw for himself the man in the midst of the angry tawantiinsuujan soldiers was daud ibn tariq heads turned his way another foreigner one of the troopers growled he lifted his air rifle not quite pointing it at park his headache made park even more irascible than usual go ahead he said scornfully shoot me and the emirates ambassador both why dont you see if tawantiinsuuju has a friend left in the world the moment after you do the officer who had noted and knotted parks previous arrival on the kiipuu recognized him now it is the judge of the international court he said stand aside let him by let daud ibn tariq come too park said i think the minister tjiimpuu will be interested in seeing him exactly what ive been trying to tell them daud said i was summoned here by the minister himself maybe we dont care about that murderer a soldier said maybe wed sooner cut out your guts with a tuumiiknife the tawantiinsuujans ceremonial knife had a halfmoon blade on a long handle they did not practice human sacrifice any more even aztecia had given it up not officially anyhow but they remembered stop that park yelled and flinched at the sound of his own voice you are not at war with the emirate of the dar alharb even if you were your own embassy in ramiah may answer for how you treat daud so let him come with me and stop acting like dogeating wanka fools parks gibe struck home all the other tribes in the tawantiinsuujan empire mocked the wankas for their addiction to cynophagy the officer said grudgingly the judge may be right our overlords will treat the wretch as he deserves let him through sullenly the soldiers obeyed one of them slammed the big trapezoidal double doors behind the two foreigners so hard that park thought the top of his head would come off he rather hoped it would i am in your debt judge scoglund daud said in english bowing deeply its nothing i was just trying to get them to shut up the moor glanced at him one elegant eyebrow rose perhaps i should backpay the debt by talking you into ontaking islam that i would seek to do anyhow for the good of your ghost now though it strikes me your body would also be the better for having winebibbing forbidden it it wasnt wine and its not your dealing park snapped seeking to win a good man to islam is the dealing of any muslim daud said park was about to snarl at him when he went on smoothly but here we are at tjiimpuus door so let us backturn to ketjwa and perhaps speak of this another time you were not bidden to come here judge scoglund the foreign ministers secretary said when he saw park yes i know but here i am and what are you going to do about it park followed daud ibn tariq into tjiimpuus private office having failed once already the secretary didnt do anything about it to parks surprise tjiimpuu didnt fuss about his walking in in fact a grim smile briefly lit the foreign ministers face well met judge scoglund he said now the world will have an impartial account of the latest outrage the emirate of the dar alharb has visited upon us the emirate has done nothing against tawantiinsuuju daud said i presume you are referring to yesterdays explosion here and the gunmen who set it off and took advantage of the terror it caused to kill even more tjiimpuu said ninetyone people are dead at last count more than three hundred wounded two of the murderers survived being captured both are muslims both say they and the rest wanted to strike a blow against the true holy worship of patjakamak and the sun heaven will receive our dead as it receives all who fall in the jihad daud replied but they did not act by the will of the emir allahs peace be upon him the emirate is blameless i do not believe you tjiimpuu ground out nor does the son of the sun this looks to be this is all of a piece with the murder and banditry your people engage in throughout the border provinces we can tolerate it no more the foreign minister breathed heavily i am sorry judge scoglund but your presence in kuuskoo is no longer required it will be war wait allister park said immediately then realized he had no idea what to tell tjiimpuu to wait for he thought frantically if ah if the emir without admitting guilt expresses his sorrow for those killed at the raimii festival will that not show enough ah good feeling from him for talks to go on tjiimpuu frowned the emir hussein has never been known for his compassion that is not so daud said at once his highness feels more compassion for pagans than for muslims in fact as he knows that when pagans die they have only the pangs of hell to anticipate then let him say so park urged such a statement were it to come would surely be looked on with pleasure by the son of the sun tjiimpuu agreed if you think it might arrive daud ibn tariq i will urge maita kapak he shaded his eyes for a moment to delay the declaration i do not know whether the emir would make such a statement daud said in any case i do not intend to seek it of him what why the hell not park exclaimed startled out of both his diplomatic manners and his ketjwa he got no satisfaction from cursing in a tongue he had just learned because of this daud drew a rolled sheet of paper from inside his robe handed it with a sober flourish to tjiimpuu when the tawantiinsuujan undid the ribbon that held it closed park saw the sinuous characters of arabic he was learning to speak that tongue but could read it only very slowly tjiimpuu plainly had no problem with it he looked up in sharp surprise at daud this is not a forgery you made up this past evening after you knew i had summoned you by allah i swear it is not daud turned to allister park explaining last night i received a courier dispatch from ramiah not far outside the city a mosque was put to the torch at the hour of evening prayer some days ago many are dead how many no one knows on a wall nearby was scrawled the name patjakamak jesus park said he supposed both tjiimpuu and daud thought he was swearing by his own god he was swearing all right but not in that sense of the word i will take this to the son of the sun tjiirnpuu said slowly do so daud agreed we have as much cause for war as you more since you claim lands rightfully ours they are ours tjiimpuu said wait park said again this whole business of the lands has been stewing for a generation a few days more wont matter one way or another what we need to do right now is to get each of you to stop trying to harm the other over what you find holy maybe knowing how much even a few zealots can hurt you will make both sides think twice i will take your words to the son of the sun tjiimpuu said it was as big a concession as park had seen him make from the way daud ibn tariq bowed it might have been as big a concession as hed seen too he and park left the foreign ministers office together tjiimpuus secretary smiled nastily is it to be war he asked as if he already knew the answer no park told him and watched his face fall the judge and ambassador walked out toward the doorway park tried his halting arabic a lesson here ah and would you deign to enlighten this ignorant one o sage of wisdom flowery in any language daud grew downright grandiloquent when using his own as usual park spoke plainly keep your holy warriors in line and maybe the other fellow will too not quite the golden rule the real ib scoglund would have preached he thought but a step in that direction anyhow wisdom indeed and fit for the emirs ear daud said save only this what if those who delight in fighting the jihad refuse to be held in check so who is stronger then park asked in turn the emir or them daud gave his beard a thoughtful tug and did not answer under the hostile glare of the soldiers outside the foreign ministry the two men went their separate ways park hurried home to take care of eric dunedin who as hed thought still had a case of the galloping jimjams you ocknt to be tending me monkeyface protested feebly im your thane not the other way round oh keep quiet park said here drink some more of this cocaleaf tea soup and finally a small shot of tawantiinsuujan moonshine in tomato juice restored dunedin to a mournful semblance of life park had a makeshift bloody mary himself he figured hed earned it thus fortified he picked up the telephone receiver whom are you wirecalling dunedin asked keep quiet park said again he shifted to ketjwa as the operator came on the line could you please connect me to the house of pauljuu son of ruuminjavii in the district of puumatjupan when he showed up at pauljuus house that evening park was carrying a large bouquet of pink kantuuts he didnt know if flowers were customary here but didnt think theyd hurt from the way the maid who opened the door exclaimed over them hed guessed right kuurikwiljor exclaimed over them too and had a servant fill a bowl with water so they could float in it very lovely she said such an unusual gift so they werent customary he thought they were a hit anyhow in a way that was even better it got him points for originality a moment later he had to risk them where shall we go he asked what shall we do this is your city not mine this world had never invented movies eliminating one obvious way for couples to spend decorous time together we could walk the walls of saxawaman kuurikwiljor suggested the old fortress park said surprised she nodded he shrugged it wasnt what hed had in mind but why not before they could walk saxawamans walls they had to walk to saxawaman which lay on a hill north and west of the builtup area of kuuskoo park let kuurikwiljor take the lead to him one poorly lit street seemed much like another you dont have many robbers here do you he asked impressed by the way she confidently strode ahead in his new york or vinlands new belfast he would have been nervous about strolling around like this after dark but kuurikwiljor only answered no not many as if the idea that things could be otherwise had never entered her mind park suspected it hadnt she was lucky he thought a path zigzagged up the hillside to the fortress park puffed along after kuurikwiljor hed long since put ib scoglunds body on a calisthenics program but no lowland man could match someone equally fit and native to this altitude when he finally struggled up a stone stairway to the top of a wall he panted could we rest on the walls of saxawaman of course kuurikwiljor said to his relief his admission of weakness did not make her scornful she went on the view is magnificent is it not hmm why so it is kuuskoo lay spread out before them flickering torches and the occasional brighter steadier glow of electric light defined its irregular grid of streets one square in the northern part of the city was especially welllit park pointed to it whats that the royal square the square of awkaipata kuurikwiljor answered i should have guessed if anyone wanted such lavish illumination it would be the king and his court park turned they had ascended only the lowest of saxawamans walls other curtains of unmortared stone pale in the starlight climbed the hill behind them and beyond those walls were the greater stone ramparts of the andes black against the sky the sky in the north and overhead lay the constellations with which park was familiar though here they looked upside down but to the south the stars were new to him and made strange patterns and there were so many of them in kuuskoos thin clear air they seemed almost close enough to reach out and touch kuuskoos air was also chilly park had been sweating as he went up the stone stairs but a few minutes of quietly looking about were plenty to make him start shivering now i see why you wanted to walk the walls he said matching action to word wed freeze if we just stood here this is a fine mild night kuurikwiljor protested but she fell in step beside him are all people from vinland so sensitive to cold its like i told your brother i dont think all people from anywhere are any one thing in vinland though most people would not think this night is mild how odd kuurikwiljor said in what other small ways are our folk different i wonder color is plain at first glance and faith soon becomes clear but i never would have thought we might find different kinds of weather comfortable tawantiinsuuju has provinces that get much hotter than vinland and stay hot the whole year around park said how do people from those lands like it here kuurikwiljor laughed they shake all the time and wrap themselves up in blankets even at noon i did not think you were so delicate im not but its park paused trying to work out how to say its a matter of degree not kind in ketjwa he was still thinking when he heard someone kick a pebble not too far away what was that his fists bunched kuuskoo had to have a few footpads and no one was close by to hear him if he needed to shout for help but kuurikwiljor laughed again just someone else or rather some two else walking the walls of saxawaman did you think we were the only ones i hadnt thought about it at all now park did hard so shed taken him to the local lovers lane had she in that case his arm slid round her waist she didnt pull back in fact she moved closer that was doubly nice not only was she a pleasant armful of girl she was also warm he kissed her she put her arms around his neck when at last they separated she stared up at him eyes wide and wondering you really do still care for me knowing i am a widow yes i care for you park said and what does your being a widow have to do with anything im very sorry you lost your husband but kuurikwiljors soft breathy laugh made him stop she said another of those small differences between your people and mine i see in tawantiinsuuju most widows stay chaste and most men want little to do with them indeed if i had children it would be against the law for me to marry again thats a foolish law park blurted then lawyerlike he hedged at least it would be in vinland as you say our people are not the same he noted that shed told him she wasnt forbidden to remarry which probably meant she wanted to he thought marriage a fine institution for people who liked living in institutions that didnt mean he had anything against some of its concomitants he kissed kuurikwiljor again she responded with an ardor he found gratifying but when he slid a hand under her tunic she twisted away its fine to feel cared for wanted she said but i do not give myself to a man ive known only a day if that is all you want from me better you should find a pampairuuna a woman of the marketplace of course its not all park protested hoping he sounded indignant i like your company and talking with you but forgive me because i do not know how to say this in fancy talk you are a widow and you know what goes on between men and women yes i do kuurikwiljor did not sound angry but she did not sound like someone who was going to change her mind either i also know that what goes on between men and women as you say is better when they are people to each other not just bodies otherwise a pampairuuna would be honored not scorned hmm was all park said to that she had a point although he was not about to admit it out loud after a moment he went on i would like to know you better may i call on you again she smiled at him i hope you will for i also want to know you now though i think we should go back to my brothers house it has grown cooler all right feeling as if he were back in high school park walked her home just around the corner from pauljuus house where none of his people could see them she stopped and kissed him again as warmly as she had up on saxawaman then she walked on to the door do call she said as she clapped for a servant to open it i will he said thanks just then the door opened kuurikwiljor went in allister park headed back toward the house where he was staying as he walked he wondered purely in a hypothetical way he told himself how to go about finding a pampairuuna for the next several days kuuskoo stayed quiet park met with tjiimpuu and daud ibn tariq both alone and together in diplomatic language the joint discussions were frank and serious which is to say agreement was nowhere to be found at least however the two men did seem willing to keep talking to park whose job was heading off a war that looked like progress he enjoyed his wirecaller talks with kuurikwiljor much more they went out to a restaurant that she praised for serving oldstyle tawantiinsuujan food park left it convinced that the old tawantiinsuujans had had a dull time what do they call this dried meat he asked gnawing on the long tough strip ktjarkii she answered her teeth apparently had no trouble with it jerky he said we have the same word in english how strange with a little thought he realized it wasnt so strange the english hed grown up with must have borrowed the term from his worlds quechua for that matter he didnt know whether jerky was a word in the bretwaldate of vinland have to ask monkeyface he thought the dinner also featured tjuunjuupowdered potatoes preserved by exposure to frost and sun it was as bland as it sounded afterwards they went walking on the walls of saxawaman park whose judgment in such matters was acute could tell he was making progress if he pushed matters he thought kuurikwiljor would probably yield he decided not to push next time he figured shed come around of her own accord that would keep her happier in the long run not leave her feeling used by the time he got home that night hed forgotten all about asking eric dunedin about ktjarkii he remembered the next morning but dunedin was still asleep park never had got fully used to the idea of having a servant he got dressed made his own breakfast and left for the foreign ministry with monkeyface still snoring tjiimpuu was in a towering fury when he arrived the tawantiinsuujan hurled two sheets of paper onto the desk in front of him slammed his open hand down on them with a noise like a thunderclap patjakamak curse the muslims for ever and ever he shouted as you asked we showed restraint and here are the thanks we got for it whats gone wrong park asked with a sinking feeling they like their little joke making goodwains into bombs tjiimpuu ground out here is one report from kiitoo in the north another from kahamarka closer to home deaths injuries destruction well we will visit them all on the emirate of the dar alharb i promise you that nor will you talk me out of war this time either park sat down to do just that after a couple of hours he even began to think he was getting somewhere then a real thunderclap smote kuuskoo tjiimpuus windows rattled faintly far in the distance park heard screams begin tjiimpuus face might have been carved from stone you may leave now he said your mission here is ended when i have time i will arrange for your transportation back to vinland now though i must help the son of the sun prepare us to fight seeing he had no chance of changing the foreign ministers mind park perforce went home he was not in the best of moods as he walked along here hed been called in to stop a war from breaking out and it had blown up in his face what with the muslim zealots using trucks as terror devices that was almost literally true even so hed failed his first major test the other more senior judges on the international court might well hesitate to give him another dunedin gaped at him when he slammed the front door to announce his arrival judge scoglund why are you here so soon his servants wrinkled cheeks turned red and why did you not rouse me when you got up this morn its my job to help you after all sorry park said he grinned at monkeyface but you looked like such a little angel sleeping there with your thumb in your mouth i didnt have the heart to wake you i do not sleep with my thumb in my mouth park had never heard eric dunedin yell so loud i know i know i know when he had dunedin partway placated park went on if you feel you have to make like a thane why dont you run back into the kitchen and fetch me a jug of aka im home early because it looks like tawantiinsuuju and the emirate are damned well going to fick a war regardless of what i think about it fick em all i say monkeyface brought back two jugs of aka park gave him a quizzical look youre learning old boy youre learning each man unstoppered a jug park sat down halfemptied his with one long pull for the first time since hed been named judge of the international court he gave some thought to visiting joseph noggle once he got back to vinland maybe whoever was currently inhabiting his body hadnt made too bad a botch of things while hed been gone he put that aside for further consideration nothing he could do about it now anyhow he finished the aka got up and walked over to the wirecaller get me the house of pauljuu son of ruuminjavii please if tjiimpuu was going to kick him out at any moment he might as well have a pleasant memory to take home a servant answered the phone may i please speak to the widow kuurikwiljor this is judge scoglund tonight kuurikwiljor exclaimed when park asked her out this is so sudden she paused park crossed his fingers then she said but id be delighted when will you come around sunset fine ill see you then goodbye park was whistling as he hung up aka made the present look rosier and kuurikwiljor gave him something to look forward to he was going through his wardrobe late that afternoon deciding what to wear when someone clapped outside the front door answer it will you he called to dunedin before monkeyface got to the door though whoever was out there started pounding on it that didnt sound good park thought maybe pauljuu was worried about his sisters virtue even as the idea crossed his mind dunedin stuck his head into the bedroom and said theres a big skrelling outside who wants to see you i dont much want to see him park said he went out anyhow looking for something that would make a good blunt instrument as he did so but it was not pauljuu standing there ankowaljuu whom were you outlooking the tukuuii riikook fixed park with the knowing cynical gaze he remembered from the ship never mind come in im glad to see you aware that he was babbling park took a deep breath and made himself slow down he waved ankowaljuu to a chair here sit down and tell me what i can do for you you came here to stop a war not so the skrelling demanded aye i did and a fat lot of good its done me or anybody else park said bitterly tjiimpuu just gave me my walking papers seeing ankowaljuu frown he explained he told me my sending here was done and that i would have to backgo to vinland the son of the sun would order war outspoken against the emirate of the dar alharb thats sooth ankowaljuu said hes done it but then you never got a chance to set the whole dealing before maita kapak himself he made the ritual eyeshielding gesture before maita kapak park was too upset to bother with tawantiinsuujan niceties if ankowaljuu didnt like it too bad how could i go before maita kapak the way the son of the sun is hedged round with mummery its a wonder any of his wives get to see him he realized he might have gone too far forgive me i pray i am not trying to wound you its all rick judge scoglund there are those among us who say the like i not least but as for getting the let to see him remember i am tukuuii riikook i have the rick of a seeing at any time i think needful i think this is such a time a wain is waiting outside for us park hadnt heard it come up but that meant nothing not with the silent steam engines this world used he started for the door lets go nay so quick ankowaljuu sprang up made as if to head him off you needs must pack first pack park gaped as if hed never heard the word before what the hell for are you shifting me into the kingly palace otherwise whats the point the palace has naught to do with it maita kapakagain the eyeshielding which had to be as automatic as breathing for tawantiinsuujansleft by airwain this morning to lead our warriors to winning against the heathen who deny patjakamak and slay his worshipers i have another airwain waiting on my ordering at the airfield i want us on it as fast as doable park wasted a moment regretting that kurrikwiljors bronze body would not be his tonight then he dashed for the bedroom shouting to monkeyface come on eric goddammit give me a hand here dunedin was right behind him they flung clothes into a trunk hey wait a minute park pointed to a shirt thats yours we wont need it take it out his thane shook his head dont need it indeed what do you reckon me to wear on this trip i didnt reckon you to wear anything and i dont mean i thock youd come along naked either i reckoned youd let tjiimpuu ship you home thatd be easiest and safest both so it would if i meant to leave but i dont my job is to caretake you and thats what i aim to do he gave allister park a defiant stare park slapped him on the back staggering him slightly youre a good egg eric all rick you can come but dont say i didnt warn you he thought of something this worlds steampowered planes were anything but powerful performers will the airwain bear his heft ankowaljuu reckon so the skrelling said im more afeared for all the books youre heaving into that case judge scoglund i need these park yelped stung whats a judge without his books a lickter lawyer ankowaljuu retorted well as may be i reckon well fly be you ready i guess we are park looked around the room at everything he and dunedin were leaving behind whatll happen to all this stuff though itll be kept for you were an orderly folk we tawantiinsuujans we dont wantonly throw things away having seen how smoothly kuuskoo ran park suspected ankowaljuu was right the skrelling watched monkeyface wrestle the trunk closed then said come on lets be off ankowaljuu not only had a wain outside but also a driver the fellows face was a perfect blank mask part skrelling impassivity part the boredom of flunkies everywhere waiting for their bosses to finish business that doesnt involve them he stayed behind the wheel and let park and dunedin heave the trunk in by themselves go ankowaljuu told him the wain sprang ahead shoving park back in his seat he was no milquetoast driver himself but ankowaljuus man did not seem to care whether he lived or died eric dunedins face was white as they shot through kuuskoo like a dodgeem car evading trucks by the thickness of a coat of paint and making pedestrians scatter for their lives park sympathized with his thane though he wasnt really bishop ib scoglund hed never felt more like praying ankowaljuu turned to grin at his passengers when ljiikljiik here isnt swinking for me hes a champion wainracer i believe it park said who would dare stay on the same track with him ankowaljuu laughed out loud he translated the remark into ketjwa for ljiikljiiks benefit the drivers face twitched park supposed that was a smile soon they were out of town that meant less traffic but ljiikljiik sped up even more rocketing south down the valley at whose northern end kuuskoo sat the airfield was just that a grassy field ljiikljilk drove off the road as far as park could tell he didnt slow down a bit though everyone in the car rattled around like dried peas in a gourd when ljiikljiik slammed on the brakes park almost went over the front seat and through the windshield the driver spoke his only words of the journey were here praise to hallow ailbe for that dunedin gasped he jumped out of the wain before ljiikljiik could even think about changing his mind park followed with equal alacrity still grinning ankowaljuu tipped the trunk out after them then got out himself ljiikljiik sped away only one airwain presumably the one at ankowaljuus beck and call sat waiting on the field next to a dc from parks world even next to a ford trimotor the machine would have been unimpressive with its squaresectioned body hung from a flat slab of a wing it rather reminded him of a scaleddown version of a trimotor it had no nose prop though and the steam engines on either side of the wing were far bigger and bulkier than the power plants a plane of his world would have used the pilot opened a cockpit window stuck out his head and spat a wad of coca leaves onto the grass that did nothing to increase parks confidence in him but ankowaljuu seemed unperturbed hail waipaljkoon he called to the man can we still fly with another manhe pointed at dunedinand this big cursed box waipaljkoon paused to stick another wad in his cheek is the box much heavier than a man he asked when he was done not much no ankowaljuu said with a sidelong look at park who resolutely ignored him well manage then waipaljkoon said one of my boilers has been giving me a little trouble but well manage hearing that park thought hard about mutiny but found himself helping his thane manhandle the trunk into the airwain monkeyface was chattering excitedly park decided he hadnt picked up enough ketjwa to understand what the pilot had said he did not enlighten him takeoff procedures were of the simplest sort the airfield did not boast a control tower when everyone was aboard and seated waipaljkoon started building steam pressure in his engines the props began to spin faster and faster after a while waipaljkoon released the brake the airwain bumped over the itjuugrass just when park wondered if it really could get off the ground it gave an ungainly leap and lumbered into the air used to the roar of his worlds planes park found the quiet inside the cramped cabin eerie almost as if he werent flying at all that was kuuskoo flowing by beneath him though he wished he had a camera best you and your thane don your sourstuff masks now judge scoglund ankowaljuu said returning to english so park and dunedin could not misunderstand him youre lowlanders and the air will only get thinner as we climb over the antiis he showed the two men from vinland how to fit the rubber masks over their noses bethink you to outbreathe through your mouths and youll be fine the enriched air felt almost thick in parks lungs which had grown used to a rarer mix before long at waipaljkoons signal the tawantiinsuujans also started using the masks not even their barrel chests could draw enough oxygen from the air as the wain climbed higher and higher tiny as toys llamas wandered the high plateaus over which the airwain flew its almost silent passage overhead did nothing to disturb them then the altitude grew too great for even llamas to endure the backbone of the continent was tumbled rock and ice and snow deadseeming as the mountains of the moon the cabin was not heated waipaljkoon pointed to a cabinet eric dunedin who sat closest to it reached in and pulled out thick blankets of llama wool even under three of them park felt his teeth chatter like castanets he wanted to cheer when greenery appeared on the mountainsides below the airwain descended as the land grew lower the tawantiinsuujans took off their oxygen masks a couple of minutes later waipaljkoon said were down to the height of kuuskoo even you lowland folk ought to be all right now park shed his mask and immediately began feeling short of air the pilot chuckled at his distress how well do you do in hot sticky weather down by the sea smart boy park growled that smelly soup i hate it waipaljkoon said park laughed in turn the pilot glared then said grudgingly all right you made your point they landed at a town called viiljkabamba for the night park tried to phone kuurikwiljor to tell her where he was after assorted clicks and pops the call went through when someone answered it though the connection was so faint that he could not make himself understood at all finally swearing he hung up they flew on the next morning below them foliage grew ever more exuberant jungle stretched ahead as far as the eye could see to allister park viewing it from above it might have been a great green ocean only an occasional cleared patch or the glint of sunlight off a pond or river spoiled the illusion how do you find your way when everything looks alike park asked waipaljkoon for all he could tell they might have been flying in circles by the blessed sun of course and the lodestone the pilot tapped a compass on the instrument panel in the profusion of other dials park had not noticed it he felt foolish until waipaljkoon went on and by keeping track of my air speed and guessing whether the wind is with or against me and by a good deal of luck he hasnt crashed yet ankowaljuu said jovially slapping the pilot on the back eric dunedin intoned patjam kuutiin the world changes in a voice so sepulchral that everyone stared at him the two tawantiinsuujans in surprise park in admiration monkeyface grinned he sometimes showed unsuspected depths park thought hed drunk aka with breakfast at viiljkabamba now it began to have its revenge he fidgeted in his chair soon fidgeting did not help how do i make water here he asked waipaljkoon handed him a stoppered jug make sure you put the plug back in tightly the pilot warned in case we hit choppy air though relieved when he gave back the jug park reflected that tawantiinsuuju still had a lot to learn about proper airline service the aka also left park sleepy he was wondering if he could doze in his uncomfortable seat when the airwain lurched in the air what the he began while ankowaljuu and dunedin made similar dismayed noises waipaljkoon redbrown face grim pointed wordlessly to the starboard engine the steam plants exhaust usually scrawled a big vapor trail across the sky now though vapor was spurting from several places in the engine housing where it did not belong park watched the spin of the threebladed wooden propellor slow stop boiler tubes must have failed the pilot said the jungle all of a sudden seemed terribly far below and much too close both at the same time no it was closer the airwain was losing altitude park was glad hed used the jug not long before are we going to hit the ground hard he asked not knowing how to say crash in ketjwa waipaljkoon understood him unless we find a town or a clearing soon he said we cant fly long with just one motor thats certain the next few minutes were among the worst of allister parks life the slow descent of the airwain only gave him more time to think about what would happen at its end the lower they got the hotter it grew park would have been sweating just as hard though had the engine quit during their frigid passage over the antiis just as he was wondering when some high treetop would snag their landing gear and flip them into the forest eric dunedin pointed off to the left isnt that a break in the trees it was waipaljkoon fiddled with the controls to parks amazement the airwain climbed a little now that i have somewhere definite to go i can give my one engine full power the pilot explained before i had to save some to make sure it didnt fail too before we had a place to land all four men cheered when the clearing proved to hold not only cultivated fields but also snug against the riverbank a small town farmers in the fields gaped up at the airwain park wondered if theyd ever seen one up close before im going to set it down waipaljkoon said hang on tight and pray patjakamak is watching us cornstalks swished and rattled against the wings as the airwain bumped to a stop parks teeth clicked together several times but hed been braced for worse thank you waipaljkoon dunedin said that park thought about summed it up people came rushing toward the airwain from the fields and from the town probably the most exciting thing thats happened in years ankowaljuu said drily i wonder how many people here speak ketjwa the locals were skrellings of course but with rounder faces and flatter features than the men from the mountains men and women alike wore only loincloths in the moist heat of the jungle park could hardly blame them rude to stare eric he murmured though i own shes worth staring at he wondered if kuurikwiljor would forgive him for not showing up ankowaljuu was sitting closest to the door he opened it climbed out onto the wing whats the name of this town he called someone understood him for an answer came back iipiisjuuna well good people of iipiisjuuna i am tukuuii riikook to maita kapak they all shaded their eyes back of beyond or no this was still tawantiinsuuju the son of the sun i need your help in furthering the travels of this man here judge ib scoglund of the international court he beckoned to park from the way the locals gabbled when he came out park was sure sandyhaired white men did not come to iipiisjuuna every day hello he said in ketjwa and waved as if he were making a speech on a stump a fat man with a large scar on his belly and streaks of gray in his hair which looked park thought irreverently as if it had been cut under a bowl and then soaked in vaseline pushed through to the front of the crowd what sort of help do you need he demanded in a deep importantsounding voice tukuuii riikook or no sir i mankoo am chief at iipiisjuuna of course ankowaljuu agreed wisely park thought for mankoo reminded him of a redskinned halfnaked version of ivor macsvensson the way people moved aside for the chief the way they watched him when he spoke said that iipiisjuuna was as much his town as new belfast had been macsvenssons and here park had no leverage to break his hold on it ankowaljuu went on if you have a mechanic who can fix our airwain engine we will be on our way very quickly we have no steam engines here save on a couple of riverboats mankoo said parks heart sank of all the places he did not care to be stranded iipiisjuuna ranked high on the list mankoo was saying roads hereabouts arent good enough for them but i will have our blacksmith look at it if you like you are very kind ankowaljuu said wincing almost imperceptibly if patjakamak prevent it your smith is unable to make the repairs how would you suggest that we go on our way northwards we must to stop the war that has broken out between the son of the sun and the sundeniers of the dar alharb the crowd muttered to itself suddenly suspicious no longer mankoo said word of this war has not reached us the wirecaller lines are down again somewhere in the jungle hell park thought there went another chance for calling kuurikwiljor and it was getting late for excuses after this it would be awfully late mankoo went on i fought the sundeniers a generation ago i know what war is like anything to stop it is worth doing he rubbed his scar then turned and shouted at the fellow next to him in the local tongue the man dashed away mankoo returned to ketjwa he will fetch the smith what if he cant fix it park spoke up you didnt answer that mankoos massive head swung his way he boldly looked back let the chief get the idea that he was somebody in his own right not just tagging along with the bigshot tukuuii riikook after a moment mankoo nodded if that happens i will give you a boat and supplies our river the muura flows into the huurwa and the huurwa into the great river on the towns of the great river you may be able to command another airwain is it well now he looked a challenge at park the thought of sailing down the amazon did not fill park with delight the thought of all the time he would lose left him even less happy unfortunately though he recognized that mankoo really was doing his best to help it is well he said answering before ankowaljuu could it was afternoon by the time the smith got there he and waipaljkoon wrestled off the engine housing when the smith looked inside he whistled that engine dead he said in halting ketjwa meltedtwisted maybe patjakamak bring back to life but not me the glum look on waipaljkoons face said he agreed with the verdict a boat then ankowaljuu sighed he turned to allister park i am sorry judge scoglund this did not turn out as i planned park shrugged im just glad to be in one piece and well you might be mankoo said i saw airwains fall from the sky when i fought in the war no it is the last war now you tell me seldom did i see any flying man walk away from them afterwards were i you i would offer prayers of thanks to patjakamak for your survival tomorrow at sunrise we will be in the temple here doing just that ankowaljuu said then he caught himself or waipaljkoon and i will at any rate judge scoglund here is a christian i do not know if he will join us all eyes turned to park hed hoped to sleep late but that didnt look politic ill come he said and everyone beamed he didnt much mind praying to patjakamak as far as he was concerned god was god no matter what people went around calling him the real ib scoglund wouldnt have approved but the real ib scoglund wasnt around to argue either perhaps we will win you to the truth mankoo said park shrugged his politest shrug the chief smiled recognizing it for what it was he said and now a feast to make you glad you came to iipiisjuuna even if unexpectedly nothing could make me glad i came to iipiisjuuna park said but in english eric dunedin and ankowaljuu the only two people who understood him both nodded the food these jungle skrellings ate was different from what park had grown used to in kuuskoo he hadnt tasted tomato sauce in this world till now the sauce in question was heated with chilies it smothered several roundish lumps nearly the size of parks fist what are these he asked poking one with his knife stuffed peppers stewed monkey heads mankoo told him the brains are a rare delicacy oh park wished the rare delicacy were extinct but with the chief expectantly watching him he had to eat the monkey tasted like flesh the clinging spicy sauce kept him from knowing much more than that just as well he thought he spent the night in a hammock the iipiisjuunans seemed ignorant of any other way to sleep from the size of the cockroaches hed seen before he blew out his lamp he suspected he knew why he wouldnt have wanted anything that big crawling into bed with him without an invitation reliable as an alarm clock dunedin woke him while it was still dark if youre bound for this heathen church youd best be on time he said primly mrff park always grumpy in the morning wondered how monkeyface would look slathered in tomato sauce the service to patjakamak and the sun went on and on and on as at the festival of raimii everyone but park and now dunedin had all the prayers and responses memorized after things finally ended it was nearly noon park asked ankowaljuu how do you folk heartlearn all those words all those songs the tukuuii riikook also used english by beginning with them as soon as we begin to speak of course how else would one do such a thing we have a saying everyone is a faithly kiipuukamajoo a knowledge keeper you might say ive seen that you speak sooth park agreed admiring such diligence without sharing it he continued now we have one mair thing to do his stomach rumbled interrupting him no two mairfirst lunch then on to the steamboat youd never make a worshiper of patjakamak ankowaljuu chuckled glancing at ib scoglunds incipient bay window all along the wheel of if parks analogs ran to plumpness for some of our festivals we fast three days straickt that idea did not appeal to park at all eric dunedin came to his defense aye judge scoglunds not thin thank you too much eric park said but monkeyface was going on but hes wild for bodily fitness he drills himself most mornings with sittingups and i dont ken what all else is that so ankowaljuu stood facetoface with park set his right foot next to the judges and seized his right hand lets see what his swink has got him then he locked eyes with park first man to pull the other off kilter wins all rick by god park said going into a halfcrouch eric count three to give us a mark to begin at he almost lost the match in the first instant when the absurdity of indianwrestling a veritable indian hit him but the painful jerk ankowaljuu gave his arm made him stop laughing in a hurry he and the tukuuii riikook swayed back and forth tugging yanking grunting finally park with a mighty heave forced ankowaljuu to take a couple of staggering steps to keep from falling ha ankowaljuu opened and closed his hand several times to work out the numbness you cauckt me by surprise there judge scoglund he said reproachfully i didnt know that wasnt in the rules park grinned ankowaijuu raised an eyebrow you should be a tukuuii riikook yourself you look to getting around rules that make trouble not just blindly carrying them out not so much to getting around them that would be bad in a judge but in reckoning the rick onputting of them aye theres the rub ankowaljuu said park blinked ankowaljuu most certainly had never heard of shakespeare the skrelling went on i will own this not being any hick holy day my belly could do with filling too shall we see what good food mankoo has in store not mair monkey heads i hope park and dunedin said in the same breath ankowaljuu laughed sooth to tell so do i had anyone told rising young prosecutor allister park that within three years he would be sailing down tributaries of the amazon he would have called the teller crazy had the fellow gone on to say he would be bored doing it he would have laughed in his face but bored he was in short order neither the muura nor the huurwa was a big enough river to be impressive in its own right and one stretch of jungle looked much like another of the riverboats crew of three only iispaka the pilot spoke ketjwa and he was so taciturn he might as well have known no language at all thrown back thus on his own resources park plunged into his books by both inclination and training he was a creature of the printed page he was convinced the answer to the endless strife between tawantiinsuuju and the emirate of the dar alharb was set forth there could he but find it monkeyface had learned to leave him severely alone when such fits came upon him in them he often bit his thanes head off other times as when he was learning ketjwa he insisted that dunedin share his zeal to his servant that was worse even the air of good cheer ankowaljuu cultivated wore thin as park kept his nose in his books and spoke almost as little as iispaka only the swarms of mosquitoes that buzzed endlessly round the steamboat made him sit up and take notice their bites roused him to brief spasms of insecticidal frenzy then one day about a week after they had left iipiisjuuna park slammed shut the volume in which hed been lost tell me he asked ankowaljuu his voice suddenly so mild that the tukuuii riikook gave him a suspicious glance does your faith outandout forbid you from writing down what you believe in no one ever does ankowaljuu said after a moment of frowning thought as youve seen we of tawantiinsuuju pride ourselves in heartlearning everything we need to know aye aye park said impatiently but thats not what i asked i want to know if you may not if you do but why would we want to ankowaljuu persisted park rubbed his chin hmm reckon you had an upgrown man like like me say who wanted to become a changer to the faith of patjakamak upgrowns arent as good at heartlearning as children would you be allowed to put things in writing to help him grasp your faith like you ankowaljuu said is that why youve been toiling so hard because youre thinking on joining the brotherhood of the sun and the allmaker his english failed him with shining eyes he switched to ketjwa we would welcome you my friend i thank you park felt like a heel he had no intention of converting but plunged ahead could you make such a writing for me aye and i will ankowaljuu promised after that first moment of emotion he had his english back you are rick the writing in itself is naught shameful nor sinful and so you will have it as quick as is doable that did not prove so quick as either ankowaljuu or park for rather different reasons hoped a search of the ship revealed only three or four sheets of paper why more iispaka demanded when the two eager men upbraided him for the lack i dont write wheres the nearest storehouse ankowaljuu asked public storehouses in the towns and along the highways of tawantiinsuuju kept vast quantities of all sorts of supplies against time of need next town is tejfej iispaka said maybe two days away ankowaljuu fumed at the delay he spent as much of the intervening time as he could preaching at park perhaps expecting oral argument to work as well as written to the tukuuii riikooks disappointment park responded by diving back into his books while he was studying he could ignore distractions he could not so escape eric dunedin when they were bedding down on deck under mosquito netting his servant whispered do you really have truck with that heathen foolishness i ken youre truly no hallow and even if you were you left the church to take up your judgeship but i thock you still a christian wick i am park said after some moments thought all the same though i need to learn as much as i can about faithly dealings here for the strife between tawantiinsuuju and the emirate is ungetawayably tied up in em he paused again dyou believe me the answer mattered to him dunedin was friend as well as thane relief flowed through him as the small wrinkled man said reckon i do if i cant trust you i cant trust anyone thanks eric park said softly he got no reply and repeated himself a little louder still no answer only soft regular breathing monkeyface was asleep park let out a snort of laughter and joined him that night they passed from the huurwa to what park persisted in thinking of as the amazon it was as if a giant hand had pushed the jungle back from either side of the steamboat the great river was a couple of miles wide its own mighty current added to the speed the steamboats engine could produce as iispaka had predicted they reached tejfej toward evening of the second day after ankowaljuu had asked for paper the little town lay on the south bank of the amazon just past a tributary smaller than the huurwa a few kuuskoostyle public buildings of massive stonework contrasted oddly with the huts of leaves and branches all around them one of the massive buildings was the storehouse using his authority as tukuuii riikook ankowaljuu requisitioned a ream of paper he would sooner have commandeered an airwain but tejfej had none maybe this is for the better ankowaljuu said as they steamed away the next morning now i will in sooth have the time to write out what you need to know and write he did with a furious intensity that reminded park of his own obsessive leaps into projects each evening he delivered to park the pile of papers he had filled that day then park had to wrestle with written ketjwa for ankowaljuu expected him to read every word and absorb it with proper converts zeal how can you keep track of so much eric dunedin asked one night seeing his boss studying by lamplight and occasionally batting away the big bugs the lamp attracted park looked up grinned wryly it is rather like baptism by thorough indunking isnt it he wondered for a moment what the real bishop ib scoglund would have thought of that comparison then went back to his labors even in the first couple of days he saw how much constant exposure to tawantiinsuujus written language improved his command of it he also learned enough about the local religion to develop a considerable respect for it patjakamak ankowaljuu wrote was the creator and sustainer of the earth and heavens he had placed the sun above all the stars and made them the suns handmaidens the moon was the suns sister and wife a pattern echoing that of the ruling house of tawantiinsuuju which sprang from the sun the suns warmth and light was the medium patjakamak used to shape the world and everything in it the sun deserved worship for its light heat and beauty and also for its legendary descent to earth to give rise to the empires royal family patjakamak by contrast did not allow himself to be seen nevertheless he was the supreme god and lord worshiped inwardly by every tawantiinsuujan that appealed to park the suns cult had more show but the invisible god behind it was the more powerful patjakamak judged the souls of the dead those of the good went up to a heaven literally an anan patja an upper house of rest and pleasure while those of the bad went to helluuka patja the lower house where they had toil and pain and sickness forevermore it was in short a faith about as sophisticated as christianity or islam though growing from different roots it had its own pride ankowaljuu wrote tartly christians say gods son died we know patjakamaks sun lives a man who followed its tenets would live a good life by any reasonable standard none of that was enough to convince allister park that he needed to switch religions but he didnt see that the tawantiinsuujans needed to have their beliefs changed either he carefully stowed away every sheet that ankowaljuu gave him a little more than a week after they left tejfej they came to manaus at the junction of the great river and the almost equally impressive black river iispaka moored the steamboat at one of the floating docks that let the town cope with the rivers evershifting level you find airwain here he said park felt sure he was right manaus was a real city nearly as big as kuuskoo bigger ships lay to either side of iispakas vessel though manaus was a thousand miles from the atlantic oceangoing craft could sail up the amazon to it none would though not any time soon not if the war went on the mouth of the great river lay inside the emirate of the dar alharb as soon as ankowaljuu was off the docks and on ground that stayed at the same level he stepped in front of a wain the driver slammed on the brakes though the tukuuii riikook was not that close he stuck his head out the window and loudly wished ankowaljuu down to uuka patja the orderly tawantiinsuujans did not take kindly to having order flouted then ankowaljuu announced his rank and demanded to be driven to the residence of the local kuuraka the skrelling in the wain sang a different tune he jumped out helped park and dunedin load their trunk inside and whizzed off to the governors palace impressed at such complete and instant obedience park asked how often does someone get into hot water for feigning that hes a tukuuii riikook he could have a rare old time till he was cauckt only seldom ankowaijuu said most folk here would never think of it its not like that in new belfast park said so i ken but our way suits us the kuuraka of manaus was a thin aging man named antaaklja he hustled the tukuuii riikook and his companions out to the airfield with breathtaking celerity park again spoke in english to ankowaljuu is he falling all over himself to be helpful or does he have something going on here that he doesnt want a tukuuii riikook to see you have a mistrustful turn of thock judge scoglund ankowaljuu said in the same language were my sending with you less weighty i might want to infollow that more closely as is one eyelid fell rose well i am not the only tukuuii riikook in tawantiinsuuju the airwain to which antaakljas minions hurried the newcomers was of the same model as the plane that had crashlanded at iipiisjuuna eric dunedin crinkled up his face at it id not like to have this twoth one fail he said also in english whats that waipaljkoon asked in ketjwa monkeyface made the mistake of translating the pilot burst out you keep quiet it was just after you came out with your cursed patjam kuutiin that the other airwain had trouble are you some jatiirii some cocaleaf reader trying to illwish everything we do he took several minutes to calm down so park thought under the fine cult of patjakamak and the sun superstition lives he was unsurprised as anyone who has ever decorated a christmas tree would be manaus airfield was smoother than kuuskoos parks teeth rattled only a couple of times before the airwain climbed off the ground below he could see the black rivers clear dark water flowing side by side with the redbrown stream of the great river only after some miles would they fully mix together where now waipaljkoon asked as he swung the airwain northward the son of the sun flew to mavaka near the headwaters of the ooriinookoo ankowaljuu said to park that meant they were heading for southern venezuela here though it was a town in the province tawantiinsuuju had wrested from the emirate after their last clash waipaljkoon gradually shifted course to the northwest this would be a faster easier flight if we hadnt had to sail halfway down the great river to find another airwain he grumbled when next you tell patjakamak how to order the universe i suggest you take that up with him ankowaljuu said waipaljkoon grunted and shut up the flight was as boring as the earlier one had been until that planes engine went out park reminded himself he too hoped this leg of the trip would not be so strenuously interrupted he sat back and watched jungle go by below now dark green now yellowgreen again it reminded him of the sea with its unending notquitesameness then suddenly not long before waipaljkoon expected them to reach mavaka they saw a great cloud of smoke rising high into the air from below the pilot scowled pursed his lips ive seen big fires before aye but seldom one that size he said thats no fire ankowaljuu said as they got closer thats a cursed battle is what that is he got the words out only an instant before they burst from allister park he too had seen the flashes from exploding shells down there men were too small to spot from several thousand feet but goodwains and machineguncarrying warwains were visible in clearings carved from the jungle waipaljkoon needed no urging to steer wide of the battlefield as the airwain was approaching from the southeast he chose to fly more nearly due north saying well cross the line in a quieter place then swing west to mavaka that sounded good to park who had no desire to catch antiaircraft fire from either side in a war not his own unfortunately though airwains rushing up to the front to add their pinpricks to the fighting spotted the intruder two peeled off to give the strange aircraft a onceover in a quavering voice eric dunedin said they have the star and sickle moon on their tails waipaljkoon turned west with everything his airwain had that was not nearly enough the emirates fighters would have been sitting ducks for a messerschmitt or spitfire but they were like sharks against a fat ocean sunfish compared to the slow lumbering transport the tawantiinsuujan was flying one zipped past the airwain so close that park could see the pilots grinning bearded face in the cockpit the other came alongside fired a burst from its airpowered machine gun that fighters pilot made a comewithme gesture then fired his gun again what he meant was depressingly obvious slavery waipaljkoon groaned as he followed the fighter eastward the other one stayed on his tail to make sure he didnt try anything tricky theyll sell us into slavery if they dont kill us on the spot for following patjakamak thats all we are to the stinking muslims fair game they wont kill us and they wont sell us either park said confidently remember youre with judge ib scoglund of the international court of the continent of skrelleland if they harm me they have an international incident on their hands lets hope they bother to find that out ankowaljuu said or that they care theyll find out park promised he left the other half of ankowaljuus worry alone he didnt much want to think about that himself the fighter in front of them landed on a strip hacked out of the jungle waipaljkoon followed it down moors who had been standing around or working on other airwains came trotting over at the sight of the unfamiliar craft bouncing to a stop some of them have pipes judge scoglund dunedin said he didnt mean the kind from which tobacco was smoked of course they have pipes eric theyre warriors for gods sake hoping he sounded braver than he felt park unbuckled his safety harness i have to get out first he said shrugging waipaljkoon opened the door park ducked through it and scrambled onto the wing the bearded fighter pilot was already out of his airwain and running toward the craft he had forced down these are my captives he yelled brandishing a large knife theyre mine to keep and sell as the pagan dogs they are park did not follow all of that but he caught enough he hoped the moors would be able to understand his selftaught arabic ketjwa at least hed been able to practice over the past weeks not captives he shouted at the top of his lungs not pagans either the pilot understood all right what do you mean youre not a captive youre here lying fool at our base the emirates base at siimaranja and thats a tawantiinsuujan airwain so youre a filthy patjakamakworshiping pagan im no tawantiinsuujan park said his fair skin sandy hair and light eyes told the truth of that better than any words well who in shaitans name are you then someone called from the ground park sternly suppressed a sigh of relief if nobody asked that question he would have had to plunge in cold as it was he had the perfect chance to give them his name and impressive title then into abrupt silence he went on i am a citizen of the bretwaldate of vinland and a christian by religion you will treat me as muslim law requires you to treat a person of the book the moors started arguing among themselves that was as much as park had expected the pilots voice rose above the babble loud with outrage well what if he does belong to the ahl alkitab the people of the book those other three i see in there dont theyre pagan skrellings and theyre mine when no one argued with him he started toward the downed airwain again still clutching that knife one is my servant from vinland and a christian like me park said the pilot shook a fist at him he continued the other two men are of tawantiinsuuju yes but they fly me i ask them to fly me to help make peace between the son of the sun and your emir you should let us go on our way free from harm he didnt expect that to happen he figured though that if he only asked for what he wanted hed end up with less one thing hed never been short on was gall he stood on the wing trying to look as impressive as possible while the moors kept on arguing finally when they seemed about to come to blows one of them said lets take it to the qadi yes park said at once take us to the qadi he will judge the truth theyre mine curse it the frustrated fighter pilot said again but most of the moors on the airstrip shouted him down come down one of them said to park by allah the compassionate the merciful you will all stay free and unhurt till the qadi lays down his judgment agreed park stuck his head back into the airwain come on out one of their judges is going to figure out what to do with us despite the moors promise men crowded close to park and his companions to make sure they did not break and run he wondered where they could run to but on second thought was just as glad to have a lot of bodies around the pilot never had put away that knife the qadis tent was at the edge of the jungle close by several dozen mansized rugs spread on the ground the airfield crews worship area park realized excellency a moor said everyone bowed when the qadi came out park was slower than the muslims but quicker than dunedin ankowaljuu or waipaljkoon when he straightened he got his first good look at the muslim judge all hed noticed before was the arabstyle robes the man wore the qadi was no arab though with his round copperskinned face he was plainly of jungle skrelling stock park knew he shouldnt have been surprised just as vinlands skrellings were christian so naturally those of the emirate would follow islam he needed a moment to adjust all the same the qadi said who are these strangers why do you bring them before me park spoke up before anyone else had a chance excellency i am qadi myself a judge of the international court of the continent of skrelleland your pilot made my airwain land by mistake they are my prisoners my battlefield booty the fighter pilot cried even this christian who calls himself a qadi admits that thesehe pointed at the two tawantlinsuujansare but pagans deserving only death or slavery the qadi frowned this is too complicated to decide at once come into my tent muawiyah that was evidently the pilot and you foreign folk as well and to keep anyone from getting ideas perhaps he should not have you come too harun and you walid with your weapons the tent was crowded with so many people inside but it held them the muslims with pipes sat behind park and his companions the qadi also found a place on the rug he picked up a book a quran park guessed now we may begin he said then added i suppose i should tell you and yours o qadi of the christians that i am called muhammad ibn nizam do you all speak arabic i do qadi muhammad ankowaljuu said at once waipaljkoon and dunedin did not understand the question which was answer in itself translate as you need muhammad ibn nizam told park and the tukuuii riikook we shall allow the time allahs judgment surely will come to pass do not try to hurry it along as allah says in the chapter called the bee now unfold me your tale park again spoke first describing how he had been chosen to arbitrate the dispute between tawantiinsuuju and the emirate of the dar alharb and how in spite of his efforts war had broken out between them he told how ankowaljuu still had hopes for peace and had arranged to have him fly to meet the son of the sun and all the trouble hed had since i also hope for peace now he finished but not for the same reasons i had heard of your mission muhammad said beyond your frankish look can you prove who and what you are yes excellency my papers are in the trunk inside our airwain other important papers too muhammad nodded to the moors behind park have this trunk fetched here one of the men hurried away the qadi went on while we wait i will hear what muawiyah has to say park halflistened as the pilot told how he had intercepted the tawantiinsuujan airwain and forced it to land the pagans at least are mine he insisted and their airwain as booty won in our righteous jihad just then two men lugged the trunk into the tent park opened it and extracted his credentials he had three sets english ketjwa and arabic all gaudily scaled and beribboned muhammad ibn nizam carefully read the arabic version he kept his face still until he was through then he nodded it is as the christian qadi says he declared both the emir allah grant him long years and prosperity and the pagan king have agreed to harken to his judgment may it be wise he bowed to park then we are free park asked bowing back in delight that was better than hed dared imagine you and your servant yes not only are you an honored judge but as you said a person of the book even if your christian gospel has only in corrupted form the truth of the glorious quran still by allahs holy law you may not be wantonly enslaved that is not the case however for the tawantiinsuujans with you what why not park said they are with me they fly me to try to make peace there can be no peace between islam and paganism the qadi said in the words of the quran kill those who give god partners wherever you find them seize them encompass them and ambush them he turned to ankowaljuu you pagan who knows the arab speech will you and your comrade yield yourselves to the truth of islam the tukuuii riikook spoke briefly with waipaljkoon then shook his head no qadi we will not we have our faith just as you have yours then you know what must become of you you are the pilot muawiyahs to slay or to sell into slavery as he alone shall decide you menhe nodded to the armed moors in back of park and his partyhelp the good pilot take them away no wait park said muhammad ibn nizam shook his head i understand your concern qadi of the christians i even have some sympathy for it but under the sharia the law of islam this thing must be i am sorry wait park said again he was not about to let his friends go to a fate he thought worse than death certainly not over a dispute where as far as he was concerned no sure right answer existed and so he trotted out for a qadi of no particular importance the argument hed intended to use on the emir or his envoy to tawantiinsuuju these men are not pagans they too are people of the book for they have the truths of their religion set down in writing do you see what a liar this christian is qadi muawiyah the pilot said we have been fighting these pagans since our ancestors crossed the sea to bring islam to this newer land and never yet have we seen one sign of a scripture among them now he invents it out of his own head let him show it to us if it is there with pleasure park dug into the trunk he pulled out the sheets ankowaljuu had written as theyd traveled down the amazon presented them with a flourish to muhammad ibn nizam ill read this if you like and translate into arabic no muawiyah burst out ive already said the man is a liar ready for anything who knows what these papers say and whether he translates them truly yes that is so the qadi said thoughtfully the more so as lying would be to his advantage have we any other man here who knows the pagans tongue as well as our own one of the armed guards a thin grizzled man somewhere in his fifties spoke up i do excellent qadi i was raised not too far from here before tawantiinsuuju stole this province from us and learned to read and write the language so i could better deal with the folk who knew it but no arabic good muhammad said read then walid and translate for us by allah i charge you to translate the words here as they are written by allah i will excellency walid took the papers from the qadi studied them they do speak of patjakamak the tawantiinsuujans false god he said grudgingly i begin how patjakamak made the sun and the world and the stars enough muhammad said some time later more than enough muawiyah said loudly i will take these two now as the excellent qadi has justly agreed is my right they are not muslims what we just heard proves that therefore their religion must be false in essence the pilot is right muhammad said the quran recognizes but three faiths as failing under the status of peoples of the book those of the christians jews and sabians all others are pagans truly i admit there is more that approaches truth in the religion of tawantiinsuuju than i had thought but under the sharia that has no bearing what of those who follow zoroaster park said not for nothing had he spent his time on the steamboat immersed in books on this point of islamic law if on no other he was ready to do battle with the subtlest of sages the qadi frowned they are not specifically mentioned in the quran either what of them indeed no not in the quran park agreed but when arabs conquer persia zoroastrians write down their holy book their avesta till then it had only been recitedhe used the word on purpose for the literal arabic meaning of quran was recitationjust like faith of patjakamak now and arabs recognize zoroastrians as people of the book do you see excellent qadi precedent for what i say precedent was one arabic legal term hed made sure he knew of course all his research would go down the drain if muhammad ibn nizam was the kind of judge who used the law only to justify what he had already decided park had known enough judges like that in new york and new belfast both not all of them were though he waited for the qadi to reply what the muslim judge said was are you sure you are a christian you should be made to convert to islam for you argue like one of us la ikraha fildin park answered there is no compulsion in religion you even quote the holy quran at me muhammad shook his head i find that your precedent has some validity muawiyah let out a howl of outrage ankowaljuu and a moment later waipaljkoon cheered be still all of you the qadi said sternly more learned men than i must make the final decision in this case until they do i declare these two tawantiinsuujans people of the book under the protection of the christian qadi here if i am overruled however they shall become the property of the airwain pilot muawiyah i have spoken now what park asked him now i send you on to my more learned colleagues which means in the end on toward the court of the emir allahs blessings upon him the qadis eyes were shrewd which no doubt is what you had in mind who me park grinned at muhammad ibn nizam it was always easier to do business with someone who understood him you did that aforethockly ankowaljuu said the next day as they jounced along in one of the emirates military goodwains toward its rulers headquarters did what aforethockly park asked they used english for privacys sake had park been in muhammad ibn nizams shoes he knew he would have salted away a ketjwaspeaker or two among the guards who made sure nobody tried diving out over the rear gate park had no intention of escaping but since hed fallen into the emirates hands in the company of two enemy citizens was certain the moors would not believe that had me make that faithly writing ankowaljuu said you never planned to change to patjakamak you wanted the writing to show the muslims we tawantiinsuujans are people of the book who me park said just as he had to the qadi aye you and dont naysay it either you made me so hopeful of the ghostly good coming to you that i forgot to think straight through as a tukuuii riikook ock but tell me this thane readyforaught how were you thinking of getting the writing to the muslims had we gone on to the son of the sun as we reckoned we would id have had you take me over the lines park answered calmly id nay do that oh yes you would if youre as hot for peace as you say you are the best chance to get it is to show the muslims youre no heathen country but earnful of being treated like other folk with a godshown faith id have talked you into getting me over there all right never fear you just might have ankowaljuu said after a pause in which he seemed to be examining his own feelings i thock i was good at fingertwisting men into doing what i want judge scoglund but i own ive met my thane in you thats sooth eric dunedin put in he even got me to learn ketjwa hes the slyest man i ken for park never did find out why monkeyface thought he was so sly just then a beetle almost the size of a kitten flew into the goodwains passenger compartment christians patjakamakworshipers and muslims spent a couple of frantic minutes knocking it down and squashing it by the time the remains were finally scraped off the floor and tossed out the conversational thread was broken when they arrived at the base from which the emir was directing his war park did not find the arabian nightsstyle encampment he had half expected instead the neat rows of massproduced shelter tents reminded him only of the vinlandish camps hed seen the year before the industrial revolution even this worlds less complete one inevitably brought industrialized warfare with it he had hoped he and his companions would be whisked straight to the emir but that did not happen muhammad ibn nizam led them to a qadi he knew one of hardly higher reputation than himself that judge listened with the same skepticism muhammad had shown and only slowly came round to reluctant acceptance of the possibility that the tawantiinsuujans might have had some longago share of divine revelation however much their current doctrine distorted it ankowaljuu bristled at that park could not even kick him under the table as they were sitting on rugs again instead the qadi said how ancient are these beliefs of yours park knew the cult of patjakamak had sprung up in the fourteenth century before he could answer though ankowaljuu said proudly they date from the time of the creation of the world thousands upon thousands of years ago hmp the qadi gave an audible sniff there were many prophets before muhammad maybe one did indeed visit your folk unlikely as i would have thought it had you told me your religion grew up after the prophets time i would know it for a sure falsehood as he was the seal of prophecy you said something judge scoglund nothing excellency park swallowed a gulp he had forgotten about that detail a good thing ankowaljuu had been irritated enough to interrupt with that bragging he thought or all his plans would have gone down the drain please let us deliberate by ourselves for a time now judge scoglund muhammad ibn nizam said why i am judge too park was anything but happy at having the two qadis decide things without his being there to see to it they decided his way but the other religious judge said pointedly you may be a qadi of qadis among christians judge scoglund but you are not a muslim park knew a warning to back off when he heard one he got out taking ankowaljuu with him even if they do ontake us as folk of the book theyll still be as faithproud as ever the tukuuii riikook said while they waited and worried you are a wick of the book and look how the qadi brushed you aside we and they will still find grounds for ficking each other i dont doubt it park said what then if youre folk of the book that makes you a civilized country what kind of country ankowaljuu asked i dont know that word huh civi oh it was a wonder park thought that he didnt absentmindedly use his native brand of english by mistake more often a burgish country i mean in muslim eyes not a bunch of savages to be fickt whenever the mood takes the emir and surely not a fit dumping ground for ghazis whod likely be in jail if they werent out hunting heathens i hope youre rick ankowaljuu sald because if youre not muhammad and the other qadi came out of the tent the more senior judge looked as sour as if hed been sucking on a lemon but he said come with us well lay your case before the emirs qadi to let him make the final decision getting in to see the emirs qadi took most of the afternoon though he did not seem that busy he was one of those important people who show how important they are by making everyone else wait his name muhammad ibn nizam told park was uthman ibn umar parks heart sank when he was finally led into uthmans presence the chief qadi was an ancient man whose hair and beard were white but whose bushy eyebrows somehow remained defiantly dark the deepset eyes that glittered beneath those brows were also dark and as unyielding as any park had ever seen convincing him of anything new was not going to be easy well what is it uthman asked peevishly by way of answer muhammad ibn nizam handed him the sheets ankowaljuu had composed he put on spectacles and began to read you know ketjwa park said in surprise those eyes like an old hawks lifted from the paper why should i not uthman said even pagans may produce worthy thoughts surely the greeks did for all their wisdom though they burn in hell he read on dismissing park from consideration park glared at his turban but did not interrupt again finally uthman set down the sheets so he said you claim the tawantiinsuujans are people of the book and not pagans yes excellent qadi everyone said together from this i might even believe it but for one thing uthman said what park asked wondering how he would have to finagle with the sharia next this book is no book uthman tapped the pages with a skinny finger it is but one mans belief written out not a true holy text like the torah or the gospels or the perfect book the quran let the tawantilnsuujan priests accept it and i could do the same his laugh told how likely he thought that was park winced the qadi had a point one that could be stressed if the emirate wanted to go on reckoning the tawantiinsuujans pagans wanted an excuse to fight their neighbors whenever they got the whim how fares the war excellent qadi he asked tensely if the muslims were winning but uthman did not start to gloat many souls have mounted to paradise martyrs in the jihad he said on this earthly plane which he obviously thought of smaller importance gains are small on either side then urge the emir to call a truce ankowaljuu said he loses little and may gain much consider perhaps we will be less harsh to the muslims in our land if you stop tormenting those who follow patjakamak in yours if they are people of the book you may honorably stop tormenting them park added uthman ibn umar plucked at his beard let it be so he said at last i think you will fail in your effort thus showing that tawantiinsuujus faith truly is pagan but if i am in error if revelation did reach you in the ancient days i would be sinning if i denied you the chance to prove it wait here i shall speak to the emir he rose tottered out of the tent a squad of soldiers soon appeared to take charge of park and his companions they led them to a bigger fancier tent one of the soldiers frisked them quickly and efficiently before they were allowed inside a servant shouted bend yourselves before the mighty emir hussein beloved of allah ankowaljuu and waipaljkoon prostrated themselves as they might have before the son of the sun park and following his lead eric dunedin bowed from the waist rise hussein said uthman tells me you have a curious tale for me i would hear it hussein was not what park had imagined an emir would be he was short and thin and wore glasses in the dark green uniform of the dar alharb he looked more like a corporal from the typing pool than a ruler he thought like a ruler though he proved that at once asking judge scoglund if i agree to seek a truce so you can try to show that the tawantiinsuujans are in fact people of the book what is the advantage for me park carefully did not smile but he felt like it he approved of people who got down to brass tacks he said if the followers of patjakamak are people of the book you do not need to persecute the ones in your land any more make them pay jizya instead the tax for the privilege of keeping their religion in peace eh behind the lenses of his spectacles husseins eyes grew calculating he was figuring out how much the tax would bring park thought probably down to the last copper he must have liked the sum for he said aye that is interesting what else if you stop persecuting those who worship patjakamak the tawantiinsuujans likely will go easy on their muslims that gives you both one less thing to fight about this could be so hussein was a cool one all right he steepled his fingers a hell of a thing park thought for a muslim to do what else damn park muttered if all that wasnt good enough he racked his brains at last carefully he said lord emir how do you feel about your ghazi raiders why hussein was cautious too revealing nothing if you want to be without them hope the tawantiinsuujans do show they are people of the book then ghazis will have less excuse to come to your country from overseas and you will not need to worry so much about what so many ruffians running around loose in your land may do he wondered if hed gone too far but hell if he were running a country the last thing hed want in it was a bunch of gangsters and terrorists no matter how holy their motives were he just hoped hussein thought the same way the emir said they are men given over to allah and park was sure hed stuck his foot in it then hussein went on but it is true they are sometimes difficult to control park breathed again hussein finished i will try to arrange a truce then of ten days time if you fail we fight again what if i dont park said what if i do what i say hussein stared at him do you challenge me only this far if i succeed do as you agreed to do before this stupid war started accept my settlement of your dispute with tawantiinsuuju do it on the spot right here right now or then i mean you do not lack courage the emir said slowly or gall uthman added park only waited now he grinned finally hussein said we have a bargain after that park did prostrate himself hussein he figured had earned it neither the moorish officers who escorted park and his companions across the line of battle nor the tawantiinsuujans who received them seemed to have much faith in the greenandwhitestriped flags of truce both sides bore the two parties hastily separated from each other members of both kept looking back over their shoulders to make sure no foe was going for a weapon is the truce holding park asked the skrelling soldier next to him so far the tawantiinsuujan replied who knows how far we can trust the cursed sundeniers though park knew the men of the dar alharb were saying the same thing about tawantiinsuuju he also knew that telling the soldier so would do no good a very young tawantiinsuujan officer tried to take charge of the newcomers as soon as they were out of airrifle range of the front line come with me he said i want to get a complete written record of everything you saw and did while under the control of the forces of the emirate no ankowaljuu said hell no park agreed but you must the lieutenant said proper procedure requires ankowaljuu said aka to your proper procedure boy i am tukuuii riikook to the son of the sun proper procedure is what i say it is he produced the documents that proved he was what he claimed the young officers eyes got big as he read them he put a hand over his eyes as if ankowaljuu were the son of the sun himself better the tukuuii riikook nodded now get us moving toward maita kapak so i can carry out my duties within ten minutes park found himself bucking along in a goodwain different from one of the emirates only in the color of its canvas top and that of the accompanying soldiers uniforms i admire the efficiency he said to ankowaljuu but i wish the ride were smoother you mean you want peace and kidneys both ankowaljuu exclaimed as if he was asking much too much maita kapaks encampment proved far more imposing than husseins the emir was not even caliph commander of the faithful merely a secular prince the son of the sun though claimed divine descent and lived in pomp that did its best to make the claim seem real prominent as his office made him park might have waited weeks before gaining an audience with the ruler of tawantiinsuuju the words tukuuii riikook however melted obstacles as if by magic the sun was not yet down when ankowaljuu and park were ushered into a tent just outside the son of the suns pavilion his radiance will see you shortly a majordomo said just don one of these packs he handed out a pair of what looked like hikers backpacks ankowaljuu who knew the routine strapped on his without comment park balked why do i have to wear this silly thing the majordomo sucked in a shocked breath it is a symbol that you would bear any burden for the son of the sun in the old days judge scoglund ankowaljuu said grinning slyly it would have been no symbol but a fully laden pack be thankful you get off so easy park sighed and put on the pack if the locals didnt think it looked stupid he supposed he could stand it a servant stuck his head in and said the son of the sun will see his tukuuii riikook maita kapak had been conferring with his aides as park came in with ankowaljuu he nodded to tjiimpuu and kwiismankuu the only two he knew kwiismankuu nodded back tjiimpuu kept his face still park had no chance to speak to either of them the servant was taking him straight to the son of the sun he followed ankowaljuu to his knees and then to his belly as they offered the son of the sun their symbolic burdens rise maita kapak said as park gained his feet he got his first good look at tawantiinsuujus master maita kapak was older than he younger than tjiimpuu he bore something of a family resemblance to tjiimpuu in fact considering the inbreeding of tawantiinsuujus royal family and high nobility that was not surprising like the foreign minister he wore plugs in his ears his were of gold and almost the size of saucers the vestigial muscles in parks own ears quivered at the thought of supporting so much weight the son of the sun said so ankowaljuu why have you chosen to exercise the tukuuii riikooks privilege as he spoke he tossed his head park was sure the gesture was unconscious instead of a crown maita kapak wore a tassel of scarlet wool that descended from a cord round his head to cover most of his forehead with that fly whisk so close to his face park would have done some headtossing too radiance i present to you judge ib scoglund of the international court of skrelleland ankowaljuu said he has i believe a plan to bring us peace now and perhaps even an enduring peace with the emirate of the dar alharb before park could speak tjiimpuu said such a plan would have been easier to bring off before the fighting started now passions are aroused on both sides nobody listened to me before the fighting started park said you people and the emir got me down here and then ignored me i think the whole appeal to the international court was just so you could feel righteous about the war you felt like fighting anyway but this ones not as much fun as waskars is it now that youre in no big breakthroughs here just a bloody fight no one is winning we may yet force the muslims back tjiimpuu said or we may not kwilsmankuu said ignoring tjiimpuus glare the marshal went on if you have peace terms you think fair judge scoglund i will listen to them and i maita kapak said the prospect of enduring peace especially intrigues me the only reason we and the emirate did not go to war years ago was that we thought ourselves too evenly matched so it has proved on the field i will listen you may not like what you hear park warned him if not i will send you back to the emir and go on fighting the son of the sun said he sounded perfectly calm and selfassured all the tawantiinsuujans in earshot nodded even ankowaljuu if maita kapak said it they would do it so park thought this is what being an absolute monarch is all about he began first radiance you will have to write down and publish the tenets of the faith of patjakamak never everyone is a religious kiipuukamajoo tjiimpuu and kwiismankuu said together they stared at each other as if unused to agreeing your faith does not forbid it park looked first to maita kapak then to ankowaljuu so i have been told reluctantly in this company he was of lowest rank ankowaijuu nodded it may not forbid but it certainly does not ordain maita kapak said he asked the same question hussein had what is the advantage of breaking a centurieslong tradition if you put your beliefs down in writing the muslims will recognize you as people of the book park said that means those who worship patjakamak in the emirate will be able to keep their religion if they pay a yearly tax and it means you wont be pagans to the muslims any more it will gain you status not only that but you could put a similar tax on the muslims of tawantiinsuuju it would he glanced at kwiismankuu be only fair let me think maita kapak said he did not ask for advice and no one presumed to offer it one of the few advantages of absolutist states park thought was that decisions got made quickly the son of the sun did not have to convince or browbeat stubborn recalcitrant thingmen into going along with him all he had to do was speak he spoke it shall be done park expected some kind of protest but none came having heard their ruler state his will tjiimpuu and kwiismankuu would carry it out that was a big disadvantage of absolutist states if maita kapak made a mistake nobody warned him about it this time park didnt think he was making a mistake thank you radiance he said bowing i might add that the emir hussein did not think you would do this in fact we had a sort of he had to ask ankowaljuu how to say wager in ketjwa on it trust a muslim to guess wrong about what we will do tjiimpuus chuckle had a bitter edge theyve been doing it since their state first touched ours almost three hundred years ago maita kapak picked up something that went by his foreign minister that made sense park thought since no one spoke straight out to the son of the sun for his own sake hed better be alert to tone now he asked why do you mention this wager judge scoglund what were its terms to let me settle the dispute between the emirate of the dar alharb and tawantiinsuuju and to accept the settlement i set down will you also agree to that radiance or will this useless war go on anyone would know you are not one of my subjects judge scoglund maita kapak said fortunately he sounded more amused than angry park wondered just how close hed come to lиse majestйpretty close by the expressions on the tawantiinsuujans faces the son of the sun said let me think then after a pause first tell me the terms you propose no park said boldness had got him this far and suited him in any case he went on you and hussein agreed to put yourselves under the authority of the international court when you summoned me if you didnt mean it keep fighting and send me home i tried that tjiimpuu said it didnt seem to work park grinned at him no it didnt did it he worried a little when he saw the look the foreign minister was giving ankowaljuu if maita kapak went along though the tukuuii riikook couldnt be in too much hot water if the son of the sun had screened out the byplay he was like allister park in that when he was thinking he let nothing interfere finally he said very well judge scoglund if the emir thinks you have terms that will satisfy both him and me i too will put myself in your hands how shall we become friends i doubt you will park said being able to live next to each other is something else again your becoming people of the book will go a long way toward solving that as the muslims will lose their ritual need to persecute you out of existence what about our need to show them the truth of our religion kwiismankuu said park scowled hed forgotten that patjakamak had his holy terrorists too after some thought he said i do not know sir if you have heard that before i became a judge i was a christian bishop a senior priest i am not trying to change your religion you and the muslims have both had enough of that i think but i will tell you one of the things we christians try to live by we call it the rule of gold do to others what you want them to do to you for once he thought the real ib scoglund would have been proud of him there are worse ways to live than that perhaps maita kapak said so have we heard all your terms of peace if we have i tell you i am well pleased not quite all park said i was summoned to give my judgment on where the border should lie between tawantiinsuuju and the dar alharb especially in this disputed sector my judgment is that the best line between you is the ooriinookoo river he walked over to a map ran his finger along the river and waited for hell to break loose the tawantiinsuujans did not keep him waiting long you thief tjiimpuu cried did you bother to notice that we are east of the ooriinookoo now and in territory that has been ours for a generation yes i noticed that park said i it cannot be judge scoglund maita kapak interrupted were this land i myself had won in war i might think of yielding it but i would be forfeiting my inheritance from my father waskar if i gave it up that patjakamak would never suffer me to do when the son of the sun said it cannot be his subjects heard and obeyed he turned back in astonishment when allister park kept arguing radiance i have good reasons for proposing the ooriinookoo as a border what possible reasons can there be for giving up a third of what waskar won maita kapak said in a voice like ice im glad you asked park said pretending not to notice the son of the suns tone for one thing the ooriinookoo is a wide powerful river that makes it a good border between countries that do not get along well it keeps them apart i think kwiismankuu would agree the tawantiinsuujan marshal jerked as if poked by a pin then nodded as both park and maita kapak looked his way not only that park went on but having such a border would make it harder for muslim zealots to get into tawantiinsuuju to work harm on your people kwiismanknu nodded again this time without prompting tjiimpuu however said i thought you told us we would be free of muslim zealots if we became a people of the book damn the man for listening park thought aloud he said your problem with them will certainly be smaller no one can promise to make all fanatics happy though if they could be made happy they wouldnt be fanatics having the ooriinookoo as a border will help keep them out of tawantiinsuuju though because they wont be able to sneak into your land so easily as they can now maita kapak started to say something stopped looked annoyed at himself park doubted the son of the sun often found himself of two minds when he did speak it was to ask his aides what do you think of acting as the judge suggests militarily it makes good sense radiance kwiismankuu said even from the religious point of view it could be worse so many of the people on this side of the ooriinookoo are still muslims despite our best efforts to bring them to truth tjiimpuu did not sound happy about what he was saying but said it anyway park admired him for that the foreign minister went on if your radiance is able to reconcile a withdrawal with your principles no said a man who had been quiet till then his tunic bore a large sun image picked out in gold thread from the size of that sun and from the way he had dared interrupt tjiimpuu park figured him for a highranking priest tell me why you say no when these others agree viiljak uumuu maita kapak said because radiance you were right when you first rejected this mad scheme viiljak uumuu said patjakamak would turn away from you reject you cast you from his grace should you decrease his realm by so much as a clod of river mud the priest burned with outrage at the idea well there goes the ball game park thought religious fanaticism had started this idiot war and religious fanaticism would keep it going just when he was beginning to think hed talked maita kapak around too but fire and brimstone or whatever their tawantiinsuujan equivalents were could drive out logic every time then maita kapak said viiljak uumuu do you presume to expound the will of patjakamak to me if his voice had been icy to park now it was somewhere around the temperature of liquid air the priest turned as pale as a skrelling could nno radiance of course not ii only thought to remind uh to remind you of what you yourself always uh sometimes said enough maita kapak said i am the son of the sun and i am the instrument through which patjakamak expresses his will do you doubt it viiljak uumuu went down on his belly no radiance never he sounded horrified arguing with the son of the sun wasnt merely lиse majestй allister park saw it was a lot more like blasphemy what is your will radiance park asked into the ringing silence that followed maita kapaks outburst let me think the son of the sun said and silence stretched again at last the tawantiinsuujan ruler gave his decision the benefits that will come to us as a result of improving our standing with the muslims outweigh i think the loss we suffer from restoring to the emirate this land east of the ooriinookoo therefore patjakamak must be seeking our acceptance of the terms judge scoglund has presented should the emir keep the promise he made the judge to honor those terms tawantiinsuuju will also cleave to them let there be peace let there be peace his aides echoed viiljak uumuu loudest among them park wanted to go over and shake the bigmouthed priests hand if he hadnt got maita kapak angry the son of the sun might have come down the other way on some different turn of the wheel of if park thought blinking maybe he did he deliberately turned his back on that thought he liked the way things had turned out here just fine no one will be waiting for us judge scoglund eric dunedin said a little wistfully as the train pulled into kuuskoo park shrugged i didnt want a brass band he wouldnt have got a brass band anyhow the tawantiinsuujans greeted their returning heroes with reed pipes flutes and drums made from gourds it wasnt what park liked in the way of music but then it wasnt for him either well you ock to have a brass band dunedin said if not for you all these warriors would still be out in the jungle ficking and dying the international court will know that park said which is what counts to me to these folk im just some funnylooking outlander thats all rick i did what i did whether they care or not someone here would care though park thought as the train brakes chuffing glided to a halt he looked forward to explaining to kuurikwiljor just exactly how exciting his adventures had been and how important his role in making the peace he wouldnt really have to exaggerate he told himself only emphasize what needed emphasizing of course she would be fascinated and then park thought and then hed been imagining and then in odd moments ever since ankowaljuu started banging on his door soon with a little luck and hed only need a little he wouldnt have to imagine any more the train stopped park leaped to his feet come on eric he said when his thane was slower to rise lets head for our house i want to use the wirecaller what of seeing to our trunk dunedin said hell with it the tawantiinsuujans will make sure it catches up with us sooner or later theyre good at that sort of thing hardly a thiefly wick among em we didnt pack everything you know theres still enough stuff to wear back at the place monkeyface looked dubious but followed park to the front of the car as they went down the steps the thanes wrinkled face split in a big delighted smile he pointed look judge scoglund someone came to meet us after all theres the vinlandish spokesman to tawantiinsuuju osfric lundqvist spotted park and dunedin at about the same time dunedin saw him he waved and used his beefy frame to push his way through the crowd toward his two countrymen haw judge scoglund the ambassador pumped parks hand as if he were jacking up a wain well done i say again well done without your tireless swinking on behalf of peace the son of the sun and the emir would still be bemixed in uproarious war the very thing i told him eric dunedin chirped the very thing youre most kind bestness park murmured he sent monkeyface a glance that meant shut up he had no interest whatever in standing in the railway station chattering with this political hack what he wanted was to get to a wirecaller dunedin unfortunately didnt catch the glance he said singlehanded the judge talked maita kapak and hussein into ontaking peace wonderful lundqvist boomed though as you said judge scoglund you came here as a forstander of the international court and not of vinland still what you did here brings pride to all vinlandish hearts it wasnt as big a dealing as all that park said where hed intended to magnify his accomplishments for kuurikwiljor now he downplayed them in an effort to make lundqvist give up and go away that however the ambassador refused to do park had picked off amazon leeches with less cling than he displayed finally he said isnt that tjiimpuu waving for you thane lundqvist lundqvist looked around where hes behind those two tall wicks now reckon i ock to learn what he wants of me ill see you later judge scoglund i have much mair to talk about with you lundqvist plunged back into the crowd moving quickly in the direction park had given him i didnt see the warden for outlandish dealings back there eric dunedin said neither did i park told him lets get out of here before lundqvist finds out and comes back he and his thane hurried off going the opposite way from lundqvist soon they were standing outside the station park had hoped to flag a cab but saw none for one thing they werent as common here as in vinland for another as he realized after a moment cabbies didnt come swarming to meet a troop train not in tawantiinsuuju where anything pertaining to military transportation was a state monopoly as he watched soldiers started filing onto government folkwains by now park seldom thought of them as buses the station was a couple of miles from the house hed been assigned he was about to give up and start walkingthough his lungs newly returned to two miles above sea level dreaded the prospect when a familiar looking wain pulled up nearby ankowaljuu stuck his head out need a ride judge scoglund yes and thank you very much park and dunedin climbed into the wain park shifted to ketjwa hello ljiikljiik he told the tukuuii riikooks driver ljiikljilk nodded then set off at the same breakneck pace hed used before ankowaljuu said you have a fine recall to bethink yourself of the name of a man you met just for a brief while thanks park didnt point out that any aspiring politician learned to remember peoples names he also didnt say that he wouldnt forget ljiikljiiks driving if he lived to be ninety it had its uses though faster than park would have thought possible the wain pulled up in front of his house i hope everything is still in there he said it will be ankowaljuu said confidently in the olden days a tawantiinsuujan who was going out put a stick across his door to show he was not home and no one ever bothered his goods were not so lawful now worse luck but i was sad when i got to new belfast and saw lodgingroom doors with three locks youd have been sadder yet if you hadnt used them park said still despite the years hed spent in the das office battling crime he found slightly inhuman the idea of letting the world know a house was standing empty if anywhere though it might have worked in tawantiinsuuju as ankowaljuu had predicted the inside of the house was untouched the tukuuii riikook clasped his hand i wish i could stay judge scoglund but i have dealings elsewhere that will not wait its all rick park said but i thank you again for everything without you no one would have had the chance to listen to me up there in the jungle you were the needful one no one would have listened to me the tukuuii riikook nodded one last time hurried out the door and back into his wain ljiikljiik zoomed off at last park said he fairly ran to the telephone get me the house of pauljuu ruuminjaviis son in the district of puumatjupan the phone rang and rang just as park began to lose patience a servant answered yes who is it this is judge ib scoglund park said grandly id like to speak to kuurikwiljor please oh judge scoglund the woman exclaimed just one moment please she set down the receiver faintly park heard her calling someone he preened while he waited just hearing his name he thought had been enough to impress the servant a voice he knew came on the line judge scoglund how are you today excellency fine thanks pauljuu park answered frowning a little but i asked to speak with your sister not with you kuurikwiljor is not here when should i call back then judge scoglund pauljuu hesitated as if unsure how to go on judge scoglund the last time you called here some weeks ago you made arrangements to see my sister that evening and then never came i couldnt help it park said i was called away i was almost dragged away on the mission to make peace with the dar alharb the mission that succeeded i might add i know that now so does kuurikwiljor and we honor you for it but we only learned the truth in the past few days at the time at the time judge scoglund all we knew was that you had not come my sister was not pleased i see i was afraid of that im sorry i did try to get in touch after i left but i had no luck but if she isnt angry any more pauljuu perhaps i am sorry too judge scoglund but i fear you do not see yet a few days after you well after you disappeared as we thought then a noble named kajoo toopa made an offer of marriage for kuurikwiljor the rank of our family which is higher than his own made him willing to overlook her being a widow after some thought she accepted the ceremony was performed eight days ago patjam kuutiin judge scoglund the world changes park echoed dully uhhuh after a moment he remembered enough manners to add i hope they will be happy together thank you for letting me know pauljuu he hung up dunedin came in saw his face bad news judge scoglund the lady is ill worse than that eric the lady is wed he had the somber satisfaction of watching monkeyfaces jaw drop what now his thane said thats a good asking park slowly walked into the kitchen dunedin tagging along behind when he opened the pantry his eye lit on a jug whose shape he knew he undid the stopper sniffed nodded this was the stuff all right one whiff was enough to make his eyes cross heres what now by god thanes thane that he was monkeyface had already found two mugs park poured both men drank both men coughed after the coughing was done though the pleasant glow remained in parks middle and rose rapidly to his head he poured again after three or four shots dunedin said judge scoglund do i rickly recall you teaching me some song hmm then park remembered too so you do old boy so you do he took a deep breath turned his baritone loose ninetynine bottles of beer on the wall ninetynine bottles of beer if one of those bottles should happen to fall monkeyface chimed right in ninetyeight bottles of beer
