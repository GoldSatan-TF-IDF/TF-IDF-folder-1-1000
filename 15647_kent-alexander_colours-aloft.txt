alexander kent colours aloft bolitho epilogue to kim my love and the sailor lost his heart to her but she had given him hers long before ebb tide it was unusually cold for midseptember and the cobbled streets of portsmouth point shone like metal from the overnight rain viceadmiral sir richard bolitho paused at a corner and stared back at the george inn where he had stayed for two days since his arrival from falmouth there was the old blue posts inn too a plume of smoke pouring from a chimney a reminder of longlost times when he had begun a voyage as a lowly midshipman he sighed and turned to his companion who was waiting for him and as they rounded the corner bolitho felt the solents chill wind like a challenge it was morning and yet the narrow streets were all but deserted for this was and the fragile peace had been swept away in the first broadside of may no young man or casual idler loitered here for fear of the dreaded pressgangs like a lesson repeating itself with little learned from before he thought he saw his nephew watching him his eyes troubled and was reminded of a remark made at the george inn just that morning while he and adam had played out a last cup of coffee the man had been a traveller and had been watching the two sea officers in conversation and later had said that he had originally taken them for brothers bolitho faced his nephew hating the moment of parting but knowing it was selfishness to detain him further adam bolitho was twentythree and in his uncles eyes was little changed from the day he had first joined his ship as a midshipman but there was a difference a marked one adam had gone through danger and pain sometimes at his side other times not the line of his mouth and the firmness of his chin showed he had learned well and the solitary gold epaulette on his left shoulder said all the rest a commander at twentythree and now with a ship of his own the little fourteengun brig firefly lay out there beyond the wall lost amongst the sprawling anchorage with its big menofwar transports and all the life of a naval port at war bolitho looked at him fondly without really seeing him but catching glimpses of small swift pictures of what they shared he said almost without realizing it your father would have been proud of you today adam stared at him his eyes anxious but pleased that was good of you bolitho tugged down his goldlaced hat to compose himself then he said if i had to discover a reward for myself in all this it is here and now seeing you about to sail with your own command impetuously he gripped his arm i shall miss you adam adam smiled but his eyes remained sad you were looking back just now uncle aye they fell in step again and bolitho tried to contain the feeling of depression which had been his shadow since leaving falmouth was this then the last time was that the cause of his apprehension would he end up like so many others on some torn and bloodied deck never to return home adam said he thought we were brothers a compliment to me i thought he laughed and bolitho saw the midshipman again bolitho adjusted the boatcloak about his shoulders his flagship was waiting for him too perhaps the weight of responsibility which lay in his sealed orders would drive away his doubts and lose them far astern like the land they would all be out there waiting for him thank god he had managed to keep valentine keen as his flag captain there would not be too many other familiar faces this time he thought the peace of amiens as it was called had lasted less than a year but in that time their lordships and a complacent government had seen fit to run down the fleet in numbers and men to a maniac proportion sixty out of a hundred sail of the line laid up and forty thousand sailors and royal marines thrown on the beach bolitho had been lucky to stay employed when so many had lost everything it was ironic that his last flagship achates had fought and won the first real battle after the peace against the odds at a time when the fleet needed to hear of a victory of any kind it was a further twist of fate that the french admirals ship argonaute which they had taken as a prize after one of the fiercest close actions bolitho could recall was now about to break his flag at the foremast achates had been an old ship and would remain in the dockyard for many more months she had never really recovered from her earlier battles in the caribbean argonaute was new by comparison and had been on her first commission when they had beaten her into surrender he wondered briefly if prizeships ever resented their new masters and onetime enemies bolitho had once been flag captain in a prizeship but could not recall any strange behaviour in his command anyway there was no choice they needed every ship and experienced seaman they could get for whereas england had allowed her strength to sap away the old enemy across the channel had done the reverse new ships young eager captains and a vast army bent on final victory painted a gloomy picture for the future some royal marines were sheltering by the sallyport wall and sprang to life as the two officers drew near it felt strange not to have allday with him at this moment bolitho thought hogg keens coxswain would be at the stairs with the barge this time allday had asked to go and visit someone that in itself was strange allday never asked favours or discussed personal matters and for a moment bolitho had wondered if he had intended to accept his earlier offers to stay ashore he had been at sea all his life apart from a brief spell when he had learned to be a shepherd he had earned his freedom from the navy a thousand times over and in achates his life had nearly ended bolitho often thought of that day when his coxswain had taken a sword thrust in the chest which should have killed him instantly he was usually his old cheerful irrepressible self but the wound showed itself none the less he found it hard to straighten his back when he walked and bolitho knew just how much it hurt his pride he had often compared allday with an oak or a faithful dog he was neither he was a true friend one whom he could trust who saw more of bolitho the man than any other they reached the stairs and bolitho saw the barge swaying below him hogg the coxswain and a young lieutenant standing by the boat faces upturned heads bared the tossed oars were in perfect white lines the tarred hats and checkered shirts of the bargemen saying much for what keen had already achieved with a new company keen would be watching him right now with his telescope and probably his new flaglieutenant hector stayt whom he had also sent on ahead of him stayt was a fellow cornishman whose father had served with bolithos father he was highly recommended but looked more like an adventurer than someone who was supposed to show diplomacy when so required a thousand worries and regrets rushed through his mind but his face was composed as he turned to his nephew once again from one corner of his eye he had seen adams little gig standing well clear while they waited for their youthful commander the tide was on the ebb and he saw an old man gathering driftwood where the shingle showed itself the man glanced up and looked directly at the two officers they could be brothers each with black hair and the same steady grey eyes adams hair was cut short in the new fashion for sea officers bolitho retained the queue at the nape of his neck the man on the shingle threw up a mock salute and bolitho nodded a last farewell he said take each step with care adam youll get your frigate after this if you stay out of trouble adam smiled i am sailing for gibraltar with your dispatches uncle after that i fear the fleets apron strings will tether me bolitho returned his smile it was like seeing himself being reborn apron strings can stretch he clasped him against his boatcloak oblivious of the rigid marines and the watching bargemen almost to himself he said god be with you then as adam doffed his new goldlaced hat and allowed his raven hair to ruffle in the wind bolitho hurried down the stairs he nodded to the lieutenant a face from the recent past except he had been one of achates midshipmen then good day mr valancey it will be a hard pull in this wind he saw the flush of pleasure on the youngsters face because he had remembered his name any link would help he seated himself in the sternsheets and then waved to adam as with oars dipping and rising like wings the smart greenpainted barge thrust clear of the piles with unseemly haste the little gig pulled towards the stairs and as they swept around the stern of an anchored transport the sallyport was hidden from view there were many vessels at anchor their black and buff hulls shining dully in the rain and spray beyond them the isle of wight was little more than a misty hump but the wind was steady was he glad to go this time the lieutenant coughed nervously the frigate yonder is barracouta sir he flinched as bolitho glanced at him the frigate must have dropped anchor this morning otherwise he would have been informed she was to be one of his new squadron under jeremy lapish who had commanded a brig like adams when he had last served under him in war the chance of promotion like death was ever present but it was sensible of the lieutenant to tell him and also showed that he took an interest in the comings and goings within the fleet bolitho said what is your appointment sixth lieutenant sir one step up from the gunroom hogg swore under his breath and snarled oars easy there the oar blades hovered dripping and motionless as hogg put his weight on the tiller bar a longboat was cutting directly across their path so full of people it looked almost awash hogg glared at the youthful lieutenant and when he remained silent cupped his hands and bellowed stand away there make way for a kings officer somebody waved and the longboat veered towards some nearby transports bolitho saw that one of the passengers was a young girl her head and shoulders unprotected against the spray and wet breeze she twisted round between two companions to see who was shouting and bolithos eyes met hers across fifty feet of tossing whitecaps he stared at one of her hands as she gripped the gunwale she wore manacles on her wrists but she turned away before he could see more he asked quietly who are those people hogg eased the tiller carefully still outraged that such a thing could happen under the eyes of his admiral he said gruffly convicts sir bolitho looked away going to botany bay probably what had she done he wondered who was she ready bowman hogg was gauging the last cable or so with great care bolitho saw the tapered masts of argonaute as the barge swept around another twodecker she was a finelooking ship he conceded shining in her new livery with a huge red ensign streaming out from her poop to welcome him aboard she had fine graceful lines and bolitho knew from hard experience she was an excellent sailer her poop deck was rather longer than her english counterparts but otherwise she was little different from any seventyfour the backbone of the fleet but as she drew closer bolitho saw there were slight differences which any frenchman would notice the stronger bow and stiffly raked jibboom and the gilded stern gallery which seemed almost flamboyant after earlier french ships it was hard to see her with her decks puddled in blood as embattled men hacked and thrust at each other to hold their ground many good hands died that day and on their way home to plymouth the dockyard had done magic with their battered charge bolitho thought he had been tempted to visit his new flagship several times during her refit and repairs but had stayed away keen would hardly have been pleased to have his admiral come aboard in the midst of such confusion bolitho had wanted to go needed to see and speak with people he understood he tossed the cloak from his shoulders to reveal the gleaming epaulettes each with its two silver stars viceadmiral of the red apart from nelson the youngest on the navy list even that he could not get used to like the title which had made everyone so pleased but which left him feeling awkward embarrassed more pictures flashed through his mind as he watched the ship and gripped the old family sword between his knees london the bright liveries and bowing footmen the hush as he knelt before his britannic majesty the lightest tap of the sword on his shoulder sir richard bolitho of falmouth it had been a proud moment surely belinda had looked so radiantly happy adam and allday beaming like schoolchildren and yet he saw a cluster of figures around the entry port the blues and whites of the officers the scarlet of the marines his world they would be watching his every move usually allday would have been on hand to make sure he did not lose his balance or trip over his sword the thought of ever being without allday was beyond belief after what they had seen and endured together he would be aboard before the ship weighed he must i need him more than ever he saw the lieutenant staring at him and for a terrible moment imagined he had spoken aloud but valancey was merely anxious and stood aside as bolitho waited for the barge to sway heavily against argonautes fat flank then he was swarming up the side and through the entry port his ears cringing to the slap and click of bayoneted muskets presenting arms and the fifes and drums breaking into heart of oak there was keen his fair hair visible as he doffed his hat and strode to meet him even as bolithos flag broke smartly from the foremast truck welcome sir richard keen smiled not realizing that the greeting had caught bolitho unawares it sounded like somebody else i am glad to be here bolitho nodded to the assembled officers and the watch on deck if he had still expected to see some sign of the battle he was disappointed newly paid deck seams and blackeddown rigging neatly furled sails and every upper deck eighteenpounder with all its tackles and gear perfectly in line as if on parade he looked along the deck and through the crisscross of standing and running rigging he could see the white shoulder of the figurehead depicting the handsome youth who had been one of jasons crew in the mythical argo less than three years old from the day she had slid into the water at brest a new ship by any standard with a full complement of six hundred and twenty souls officers seamen and royal marines although he doubted if even the resourceful keen had gathered anywhere near that total they walked aft beneath the poop deck by making it longer than in english thirdrates the builders had given better and more spacious accommodation to the officers in battle however as in any manofwar the deck would be completely cleared from bow to stern so that every gun large or small could be worked without obstruction they ducked beneath the deckhead beams and bolitho saw a marine sentry marking the screen doors of his quarters right aft when allday comes aboard val i want keen glanced at him curiously he preceded you sir richard bolitho felt a great sense of relief as he had of fear when allday had been hacked down on that terrible day it was quite dark between decks and bolitho allowed his feet to guide him by instinct the smells were like old friends tar oakum paint damp canvas like the ships fabric itself he nodded to the marine sentry and entered the stern cabin a spacious dining table brought from falmouth the wine cabinet which followed him from ship to ship and aft in the broad day cabin a fine carpet laid upon the black and white check canvas covering of the deck keen watched his reactions as little molelike ozzard who had been aboard for several days hurried from the sleeping space he too watched as bolitho walked slowly to the chair bolitho had had it made in falmouth belinda had disagreed about it and thought he should have something more elegant as suited his position bolitho touched the high back which like the rest of the chair was covered with dark green leather it was soft as a womans skin under his hand he handed his sword to ozzard and sat down in the chair which would become so important when he could share none of his doubts and worries with his subordinates strong arms to rest on a high back to shut out things or people when needed keen grinned came aboard an hour before we quit plymouth sound feet pattered overhead and keen moved towards the door bolitho smiled be off with you val youve much to do we shall speak later the door closed and he watched his cabin servant padding about with a tray and some glasses was ozzard sorry to be leaving the security and safety of falmouth if so he did not show it bolitho waited for ozzard to place a glass of claret by his side and then withdraw to his pantry a fine servant dedicated even beyond his unfailing terror whenever a ship cleared for action he was well read and full of surprises for one so small and mild he had once been a lawyers clerk it was said he had gone to sea to escape jail or worse like allday he was totally dependable he glanced around the great cabin contreamiral jobert must have sat here often enough in those other days must have cocked his head when he heard the lookouts cry out that they had sighted achates the other door opened and yovell entered with the usual pack of letters under one arm good day mr yovell good morning sir richard they smiled at one another like conspirators for if bolitho had gained a title yovells status had been raised from mere clerk to secretary with his sloping fat shoulders and small goldrimmed spectacles he looked like a prosperous merchant yovell had found a new clerk to assist him a freshfaced youth named john pinkney whose family had lived in falmouth for many generations ozzard too had gained an assistant his name was twigg but bolitho had only seen him once when he had called at the house in falmouth he found he was on his feet and was pacing the cabin as if he was trapped there was so much he had wanted to say to belinda there had been a strangeness between them since their visit to london she loved him but because of the difficult time she had had during elizabeths birth there had been a barrier a coolness he could not be certain ifhe looked up angry without knowing why as the sentry tapped his musket on the deck and called admirals coxn sir that marine would soon get to know that allday came and went as he pleased allday came in and stood in the middle of the carpet his head just beneath the skylight he looked little changed bolitho thought in his blue jacket with the special gilt buttons and his nankeen trousers to mark him out as the admirals coxswain all done allday perhaps he would shake him out of his gloom allday stared around the cabin and then back to bolitho and the new chair fact is sir he fidgeted with his coat i had a bit o news bolitho sat down well what is it man ive got a son sir bolitho exclaimed you what allday grinned sheepishly somebody wrote a letter sir ferguson read it to me me not bein able bolitho nodded ferguson his steward in falmouth could always keep a secret he and allday were as thick as thieves allday continued there was a girl i used to know on the farm it was pretty little thing smart as paint seems she died just a few weeks back he looked at bolitho with sudden desperation well i mean sir i couldnt just do nothin could i bolitho sat back in the chair and watched the emotions hurrying across alldays homely face are you certain about this aye sir iid like you to speak with him if its not too much to ask feet moved overhead and somewhere a boatswains call trilled to summon more hands to hoist some stores inboard in the cabin it seemed apart remote from that other shipboard life you brought him aboard then he volunteered sir hes worn the kings coat afore there was pride in his voice now i just need he broke off and looked at his shoes i shouldnt have asked bolitho walked over to him and touched his arm bring him aft when youre ready blast your eyes man you have the right to ask what you will they stared at each other then allday said simply ill do that sir the door opened and keen looked in at them he said i thought you should know sir richard firefly has just weighed and is setting her topsls bolitho smiled thank you he looked at allday come well watch him leave eh allday took the old sword down from its rack and waited to clip it to bolithos belt he said quietly hell need a good coxn of his own afore long an thats no error they looked at each other and understood keen watched them and forgot all the demands the signals which awaited attention and which he must discuss with his admiral bolitho and allday were the rock which would stand when all else fell he was surprised to discover that this realization still moved him deeply several of the hands working about the quarterdeck withdrew as bolitho and their captain walked to the nettings bolitho could feel their eyes even though his back was turned they would be pondering on his reputation both as their leader and as a man the little brig was heeling over to the wind showing her copper as she tacked between two anchored seventyfours bolitho took a glass from the signals midshipman the youth seemed vaguely familiar he trained the glass across the nettings and for a few moments saw firefly s commander staring across at him near enough to touch he was waving his hat slowly from side to side then one of the ships shut him from view bolitho lowered the glass and the scene fell away into the distance he handed the telescope to the midshipman thank you mrsheaffe sir richard bolitho eyed him curiously of course he should have remembered that admiral sir hayward sheaffe had made a point of putting one of his sons in argonaute it was unlike him to forget such things even keens comment lose the brat overboard and ill lose my command to boot he had visited sheaffe at the admiralty several times since his return to england one rank only separated them it could have been an ocean keen was watching him and as they walked to the opposite side said there was no real urgency to come aboard just yet sir it may be another week before the full squadron is assembled here he thinks i need to leave the land bolitho thought he said a small enough squadron it will be too val four sail of the line barracouta and the little brig rapid keen grinned there is also supreme sir bolitho smiled ruefully topsl cutter she hardly ranks with her name eh he considered the three other seventyfours one familiar face amongst them captain francis inch was in command bolitho swung round his voice almost pleading as he asked what has become of us val we happy few remember keen said i think of it often bolithos mood disturbed him he had heard the reason or some of it the rest he could guess bolithos beautiful wife was concerned about his career although to most sailors a viceadmiral with or without a knighthood was about level with the almighty she wanted him to leave falmouth to purchase a fine residence in london where his name would be noted and acted upon leave falmouth keen had been at their wedding there and knew the bolitho house below pendennis castle better than most bolithos had always lived there it was as much a part of them as the sea itself bolitho was looking across at his one frigate barracouta lapish her young captain had less than three years seniority not even posted the sight of the anchored frigate her yards and decks alive with working seamen jabbed at another memory the first time he had spoken sharply to belinda she had been talking about nelson practically everyone did in london but not of his courage and his victories but about his outrageous and unacceptable behaviour with that woman belinda had said you rank the same as nelson but he has a fleet whereas you are being given a squadron bolitho had said a fleet is not built on favours curiously enough despite his fame and his position nelson had only two frigates for his whole command but bolitho had been too upset to mention the point at the time the little admiral had hoisted his flag in victory that old and respected firstrate and had sailed for the mediterranean to seek out the french at toulon or make sure they stayed bottled up like those in the channel ports he had seen belinda recoil at his tone and they had stared at each other like strangers she had said quietly i say and do things because i care bolitho had retorted because you think you know best this is our home not london now watching the ships remembering lost faces he wondered what had really provoked him enough to bring him here no matter what it was he said softly all those men little more than boys some of them farquhar keverne veitch he looked away young john neale remember and the rest where are they dead maimed ekeing out their lives in one poxy hospital or another and for what keen had never seen him like this before well beat the frogs sir bolitho gripped his arm i daresay but a lot of good men will have to pay for others complacency and stupidity he controlled his voice and said calmly i will go aft and read my despatches dine with me tonight eh val keen touched his hat and watched him leave the quarterdeck he saw stayt the new flaglieutenant strolling towards the poop and wondered if he could replace bolithos nephew or the previous aide browne he smiled sadly with an e keen walked to the quarterdeck rail and rested his hand on it soon the ship would be alive again a working creature driven by her pyramids of canvas expected to deal with anything anywhere he glanced up to bolithos flag at the fore there was no man he would rather serve none he respected more loved from the moment he had joined bolithos ship as a midshipman he had found his affection growing amidst death and danger in the great south sea when bolitho had almost died of fever he had still found the strength to support him in his own loss keen still thought of the lovely malua who had died of the same terrible fever unlike most sea officers he had never married had never really recovered from losing her he looked along his command and felt vaguely pleased with all they had achieved in so short a time he recalled the neverending broadsides the carnage above and below decks in that last battle he touched his left shoulder where a splinter had smashed him down it still ached on occasions but he was alive he looked at the men high above the decks working at their endless splicing and other ropework it had been his good fortune to retain some of the older seasoned men from achates big harry rooke the boatswain grace the carpenter who had been worth his weight in gold during the refit at plymouth even black joe langtry the fearsome looking masteratarms had come aboard argonaute but they were still well short of seamen he rubbed his chin as he had seen bolitho do when he was considering a problem the portadmiral and a local magistrate were doing their best but keen wanted prime seamen not felons the thought made him glance across at the two big transports one an exindiaman by the look of her they were to carry convicts to the new colony was it the right way to expand a place he wondered a felon was a felon and the gallows a fitter end for his kind paget the first lieutenant crossed the deck and touched his hat permission to exercise the lower battery during the afternoon watch sir keen saw him glance aft to the poop and smiled have no fear mr paget our admiral greatly approves of efficient gunnery so do i paget walked away a good lieutenant slightly older than the others he had been in the merchant service for a time during the peace of amiens he should have a command albeit a small one the little supreme s new commander hallowes had been keens fourth lieutenant until the battle keen could see it now adam bolitho and hallowes in a madcap attack on argonautes stern with a handful of men they had placed charges around the mainmast and brought it down like a gigantic tree the enemy had struck almost immediately so why not paget his report was good and he seemed competent enough keen began to pace up and down his chin in his neckcloth momentarily oblivious to the rattle of blocks and the hoarse cries of his petty officers as more stores were hauled aboard time would tell one thing was certain it would be a harder war this time the feeling of being cheated even betrayed after so shortlived a peace would put an edge on every temper it would be good to see inch again to watch his long horseface light up when he met bolitho it was a sobering thought to realize that inch and himself were the only postcaptains in the squadron inchs twodecker helicon would arrive from the nore at any time then under orders once more they would put out to sea where every sighting would likely be hostile to gibraltar and then while keen paced the deck immersed in his thoughts bolitho wandered about his unfamiliar quarters as ozzard and some extra hands moved his possessions into their new places the old sword was on its rack above the fine presentation one from falmouths public subscription he could remember quite clearly his father giving him the old blade in the grey house where he had been born he said gravely england needs all her sons now he had been grieving for hughs disgrace his desertion from the navy hugh should have been given the sword it would be adams one day bolitho walked into the sleeping compartment and stared at himself in his mirror where had the years gone he would be fortyseven next month he looked ten years younger but the thought like the others disturbed him he thought of belinda back in falmouth would there be more changes when he returned he grimaced at his reflection then turned away if more like ozzard started sir bolitho smiled nothing i have been ashore for too many weeks the next horizon will cure that directly ozzard was packing things into drawers and a fine hanging wardrobe he liked to be busy he hesitated over one drawer and made to tidy some new shirts his fingers touched a miniature portrait of a girl with long chestnut hair and green eyes she was so beautiful he thought twigg his new assistant peered over his shoulder shall we ang it tom i would if i ad a wife like er get about your work ozzard closed the drawer carefully it was not twiggs fault the miniature looked very like lady belinda but ozzard knew differently he had heard bolitho call out her name when he had been badly wounded cheney why did she have to die he picked up a pair of shoes and regarded them unseeingly the deck rolled slightly and ozzard sighed this was a life he had come to understand better than those poor devils in the convict ships he gave a gentle smile if fate had been less kind he might have taken the same oneway passage three days later the small squadron with argonaute in the van stood downchannel in a brisk northerly wind they had sailed on the ebb but there was no letter bolitho locked his own in the strongbox and watched the land slipping away into the dusk my england when shall i see you again it was like a cry from the heart but only the sea replied in distress bolitho walked across the poop and idly watched the other three ships of the line following astern it was two long days since they had weighed anchor at spithead and apart from sail and gun drill there had been little to break the monotony inchs helicon was directly astern with despatch and icarus in direct line although not without a few forthright signals from the flagship they had to learn good stationkeeping and to respond to every signal without delay there would be no time later on far away on the starboard quarter with only her pale topsails showing above the sea and spray the solitary frigate barracouta held carefully to windward ready to dash down and investigate any sighting or support her heavy consorts if so ordered bolitho could picture them all and their captains whom he had seen just briefly prior to sailing the brig rapid and the small rakish cutter supreme were sweeping far ahead of their flagship bolithos eyes and intelligence bolitho had decided to leave the briefing to keen when the captains had assembled in argonautes wardroom he had always hated speeches just for the want of making them when they reached the rock he would know better what was expected and would then lay his intentions before the others inchs face had been creased with delight when bolitho had greeted him aboard he had not changed still eager and completely trusting bolitho knew he could never share his doubts with one so loyal inch would agree with everything he said and did even to the mouth of hell he turned to watch the hands at work on the gun deck he had noticed several faces he knew from the achates he had remarked to keen that it did him credit they had volunteered to serve under him again he had not seen keen smile to himself just as it had never occurred to him that they might have volunteered because of their admiral he had seen the loping misshapen crocker the gun captain who had blown down this ships mainmast and so finished the battle looking no different despite his new uniform he had gained promotion to gunners mate and was rarely far away when the drills were carried out he saw allday on the larboard gangway with a freshfaced youth he guessed was his newly discovered son it did not seem possible and he wondered when allday would decide the time was right and proper to bring him aft to the great cabin allday would know better than anyone bolithos dislike of showing favours in a crowded manofwar he would doubtless judge the moment perfectly two bells chimed out from the forecastle and bolitho stirred restlessly he felt so apart from the ship and those who followed his flag keen and his officers dealt with everything and day by day argonautes company were led encouraged and driven into a working team minutes were knocked off the time for clearing for action for reefing and making sail but bolitho could only share it at a distance the hours dragged heavily and he found himself envying keen as well as the other captains who had their ships to fill their days he walked to the opposite side and stared at the dull grey sea with its serried ranks of wave crests one hundred miles abeam was lorient he glanced forward to the figureheads pale shoulder they had passed brest in the night where this ship had been built did argonaute feel it he wondered curiously enough inchs helicon was also a french prize but had had her name changed as was the custom when the battle where she had been taken had been badly fought bolitho touched the nettings nobody could say that about this ship she had fought well from start to finish nelson would be hard put to control the mediterranean if the enemy had more admirals of joberts breed deck there rapids signallin sir bolitho glanced up at the masthead lookout on his precarious swooping perch the wind had backed slightly and was almost directly astern it would be lively up there he opened his mouth to speak but keen was already present get aloft mr sheaffe with haste now bolitho watched the slim midshipman swarming up the shrouds he was sixteen but looked older and rarely skylarked with the other young gentlemen off duty or during the dogwatches he wondered momentarily if adam would have been so serious had he been his son eventually sheaffe was able to level his big signals telescope and shouted down to the deck from supreme repeated rapid sir all eyes were raised to his foreshortened silhouette the clouds seemed to be racing directly above the masthead sail in sight to the southrd keen exclaimed i wonder he looked at bolitho frenchies sir bolitho said doubt it we saw some of the blockading squadron yesterday the enemy would have to slip past them first he smiled at keens expression he was disappointed it was as clear as if he had said it aloud bolitho said signal supreme to investigate she carries only popguns but can outpace anything that floats the signal dashed up to the yards and broke stiffly to the wind rapid would be waiting to repeat it to the cutter which was out of sight from the flagship he knew lieutenant hallowes reputation for recklessness and hoped he would take care otherwise his new command would be shortlived bolitho heard a step beside him and saw his flaglieutenant watching the signal party critically as sheaffe slid down to the deck again stayt said slow you must do better mr sheaffe or i shall know why bolitho said nothing at least stayt did not care about reprimanding an admirals son stayt said whoever it is will probably turn and run sir bolitho nodded if it was a merchantman no matter what flag she wore her master would not wish to lose any of his prime seamen to a kings ship he wondered about stayt his father had quit the sea a sick man and owned some land around the little village of zennor stayts brothers were both clergymen but it was hard to picture the lieutenant wearing the cloth stayt had a swarthy complexion and dark restless eyes like a gypsy he was not handsome like keen but had the rugged good looks which would appeal to women bolitho knew that stayt always carried a small pistol under his coat and wanted to ask him why a curious habit as if he was expecting trouble sheaffe spoke urgently to his assistant midshipman and then climbed swiftly up the mizzen shrouds with his telescope he was smarting whereas most midshipmen would have taken stayts comment as part of their lot a midshipman was neither fish nor fowl who stood between the lieutenants and the people and was respected by neither for the most part it was strange they never remembered that fact when they became lieutenants bolitho thought from supreme sir sheaffes voice was sharp shes the orontes keen said one of the convict ships but they sailed two days before us he eyed bolitho questioningly strange from supreme sir ship requires assistance make to supreme keen had seen bolitho nod heaveto and await the flag he waited for the signal to break out now a general signal make more sail stayt closed his glass with a snap the squadron has all acknowledged sir bolitho watched the hands dashing up the shrouds and out along the yards to set more sail the other ships were doing likewise there was no obvious danger but the squadron would keep in formation bolitho had known traps in the past his own and the enemys he was taking no chances the deck staggered and spray lifted above the taffrail as argonaute responded to the extra pressure of canvas well be up to them by noon sir keen watched the set of each sail and then shouted another pull on the weather forebrace mr chaytor your division is in confusion today he lowered his speakingtrumpet and turned aside there was little wrong with the lieutenants division but it did no harm to drive them a bit more he saw bolitho smile and knew that he had seen through his guard luke fallowfield the sailingmaster watched the hardening sails and put another man on the big doublewheel he had been master in flagships before but had never known one like bolithos most admirals stayed away in their great cabins but not this one fallowfield was short but massively built like a huge cask he had no neck and his head sat directly on his shoulders like a great red pumpkin he was a shabby shambling mass of a man who usually cast the smell of rum in his wake but his knowledge of navigation and shiphandling was unsurpassed bolitho was getting to know their faces the way they responded to their superiors and subordinates it kept him in touch without this small contact he knew he would be forced into his shielded quarters in his heart he admitted he did not want to be left alone with his thoughts the orontes grew and lifted from the grey water with each turn of the glass lyingto nearby the supreme remained an onlooker her hull rolling and pitching in the troughs as soon as argonaute was within signalling distance keen observed lost their rudder damn them stayt said the other ship was an exindiaman and in good condition his lip curled this one is a hulk im glad for their sakes the bay is being kind bolitho took a glass and watched the slow exchange of signals stayt was right about the ships appearance more like a slaver than a government transport he said if we take her in tow val he saw keens dismay and assist her back to port we will reduce our strength and slow our passage we cannot abandon her old fallowfield mumbled squall gettin near zur he stared blankly at the officers no doubt in my mind that settles it bolitho folded his arms send a boat across and discover what has happened to her consort the philomela he watched big harry rooke the boatswain beckoning a boats crew towards the tier it was bad luck but they had no choice we will escort her to gibraltar keen protested well take days longer with her in tow sir he was eager to get there more so to become involved against the enemy he did not alter the first lieutenant clambered down into the waiting boat and was soon speeding across the water towards the drifting vessel what a way for the convicts to begin what was already a terrible voyage bolitho thought he tried to shut it from his mind and concentrate on what he must do if he left the squadron and went on ahead in barracouta or rapid to discover what was required of him there might be an unexpected attack during his absence a barely trained squadron without its admiral would certainly attract the french if they learned of it he made up his mind signal barracouta to close on the flag captain to repair on board he could already see lapishs youthful face grateful to be released from his ponderous companions to be free of authority then signal helicon to prepare to tow inch was by far the most experienced captain but he would not thank him for it not even loyal inch it took the remainder of the day to pass the massive hawser to the rudderless transport and some hundred sailors from inchs command to do it by the time they had formed up once more in some sort of order barracouta was already hull down on the horizon and soon out of sight altogether lapish would carry despatches from bolitho to the governor and commanderinchief at least everyone would know they would eventually arrive under the rock darkness closed in and when bolitho went aft to the great cabin he saw that the table was carefully laid the sides and deckhead glittering to the swinging lanterns and new candles the exercise with the orontes and the passing of the tow had given bolitho an appetite it had helped to pass the time to see his squadron doing something other than running out guns or shortening sail ozzard watched him and was satisfied it was good to see bolitho in a warmer mood he would dine with the captain and the new flaglieutenant ozzard was reserving his opinion on the latter there was something false about lieutenant stayt he decided like the lawyer he had once worked for ozzard said the coxns waiting sir richard bolitho smiled good allday was right aft by the big sloping windows he faced bolitho and touched his forehead even that he did with massive dignity bolitho thought there was neither subservience nor indifference there how is it coming along bolitho sat on the new chair and stretched his legs when do i meet er your son allday replied tomorrow forenoon if it suits sir richard even the title rested easily with allday he seemed prouder of it than its recipient allday continued hes a fine lad sir he sounded anxious i was wonderin now to the truth of the matter bolitho said encouragingly come on old friend there are no admirals or coxswains down here allday watched him worriedly i knows that sir ive always known it you treated me like one of the family in falmouth i dont reckon anyone would forget that he tried again i get a bit o pain from time to time sir yes bolitho poured two glasses of claret i fear there is no rum within reach the memory brought a slow grin to alldays bronzed features remembering the rum which had brought him back to life if only because his reeling mind had recorded that bolitho was drinking some out of despair bolitho never drank rum in some strange way it had dragged allday across the margin of survival and death i wants to do my duty for you sir like always but somehow bolitho said gently you think i might need a second coxn is that it allday stared at him awe astonishment gratitude it was all there god bless you sir allday nodded it would help the lad an i could keep an eye on him like keen entered and stopped by the screen door i beg your pardon sir it seemed quite natural to find the big coxswain having a quiet drink with his admiral keen had cause to know and respect allday when he had been a midshipman under bolithos command he had been cut down by a great splinter which had driven into his groin like a bloody lance the frigates surgeon had been a drunkard and allday had carried the barely conscious midshipman below and cut the splinter away himself it had saved his life no he would never forget especially as the respect had become mutual bolitho smiled all done with your permission id like to take er he glanced at allday what name does he use allday looked at his feet john like me sir he became serious bankart that was er name keen nodded his handsome features expressionless his own coxswain hogg had told him about it bolitho said a second coxn good idea eh keen replied gravely none better they watched him leave and keen said god he even looks like a father now bolitho asked do you know this bankart keen took a glass from ozzard and held it up to a lantern i saw him sworn in sir about twenty or so served in the superb before the peace a clean bill bolitho looked away keen had checked up already to protect him or allday it did not matter which keen said i am in despair over the orontes sir her master ignores captain inchs instructions and i am fast becoming impatient with the fellow he eyed bolitho thoughtfully ive a mind to go aboard tomorrow bolitho smiled yes i think my flagcaptain will get more done than inchs lieutenants stayt entered the cabin and handed ozzard his hat he too had apparently been considering the orontes i think i have discovered why the other transport sailed on without orontes sir he leaned over to move a chair and for a second or so revealed the bright pistol beneath his coat philomela carries gold as well as human beings the paymaster for new south wales is with it bolitho rubbed his chin that was strange nobody had mentioned it before keen said bitterly afraid to put his money in a manofwar is he in case we have to fight for him damn his eyes ozzard hovered by the other screen door he had heard everything but would keep it to himself he had known all about the gold as did most of the squadron it was funny that the officers were always the last to hear such matters he thought dinner is served sir richard he said meekly when bolitho went on deck the following morning he saw the disarray in his ships after a mounting overnight gale now as each captain endeavoured to place his ship on the required station the wind just as mischievously dropped to a wet breeze to leave the heavier vessels rolling uncomfortably in the troughs their sails flapping and banging in confusion keen glared across at the orontes quite rightly inch had cast off the tow during the night to avoid a collision and now it would have to begin all over again keen sounded exasperated call away the gig i shall go over to her he took a glass from the midshipmanofthewatch and trained it on the drifting transport half to himself he said i have already had words with my carpenter sir richard with his aid i intend to coax orontes master into rigging a jury rudder bolitho raised his own telescope and studied the other vessel her decks seemed to be full of people crew or convicts it was impossible to tell no one appeared to be working and he said quietly take some marines with you val keen lowered his glass and looked at him aye sir he sounded uneasy some of their people are drinking at this time of the day the gig and then a cutter were lowered alongside while the flagship came into the wind and lay hoveto her reefed canvas flapping wetly in the spray keen hurried to the entry port and bolitho said go with him mr stayt you may learn something less basic then seamanship today keen waited impatiently as a squad of royal marines clattered down into the cutter with their junior officer lieutenant orde he was a haughty young man who obviously resented the idea of soaking his immaculate scarlet coat on the crossing keen touched his hat to the quarterdeck and then hurried down the side where hogg waited with his gig keen had no doubts in his mind that the next months would be crucial as england and her old enemy circled one another to seek out and exploit a first weakness he wanted to begin to use his ship where she was most needed for keen it was like a driving force he had nothing else once he glanced astern and saw his ship riding easily in the swell and bolithos straight figure by the quarterdeck rail argonaute would serve him well keen thought i owe him that and so much more the coxswain swore silently as the gig shuddered alongside and hooked onto the mainchains the cutter caught on a sudden crest was carried past the marines watching with amusement as the oarsmen fought to regain control stayt stood aside to allow keen to climb the ladder after the lively motion and stinging spray the orontes broad deck seemed almost sluggish and without wind there were figures everywhere on the deck and gangways even in the tops overhead a few carried weapons guards probably the rest looked like the sweepings of a jail but keen saw only the drama being enacted below the poop the rigged grating a great brute of a boatswains mate with what looked like a long whip in his hand as he stared at the figure seized up for flogging keen hated the savage ritual of a flogging more so the occasional need for it ever since he had seen his first punishment as a young midshipman like most sea officers he had fought to conceal his revulsion for the sake of discipline others it seemed could watch it without turning a hair but this was different he felt his spine go cold as he stared at the spreadeagled form on the grating a seaman exclaimed behind him christ amighty sir its a girl she was stripped almost to her buttocks her face and shoulders hidden by her hair her arms stretched out as if she had been crucified keen stepped forward but before he could speak the boatswains mate drew back his arm and curled the whip across the girls back with the sound of a pistol shot keen saw her arch her body her torn clothing falling still further but she did not scream for the force of the blow had smashed the breath from her body then after what seemed like several seconds a bright scarlet line showed itself from one bare shoulder to the opposite hip and then the blood ran down her back and as the man drew back his arm she began to struggle keen said sharply belay that he felt stayt beside him but did not take his eyes from the scene around and above him he could hear a baying chorus of voices anger disappointment they had wanted to watch her flogged in the sudden silence keen said mr stayt if that man so much as lifts his whip i order you to shoot him dead stayt stepped forward the pistol already cocked in his hand he raised his arm not like a man going into battle but as a duellist would balance his weapon for that one vital shot a portly figure in a blue coat pushed towards keen his jowls jogging with fury keen regarded him calmly although he was feeling cold anger sweeping through him blinding him to everything but the desire to smash this man the master in the face what the hell do you think youre about blast you the man was almost incoherent with rage and drink keen met his angry glare i am sir richard bolithos flagcaptain you abuse your authority sir he felt his relief as he heard the marines scrambling up the side at last inch had obviously withdrawn his own men before the squall in another moment he stayt and the others might have been overwhelmed most of the crew looked too drunk to be able to think let alone take orders lieutenant orde seemed unable to respond to what he saw but blackburn his big sergeant rasped fix bayonets marines if they moves cut em down blackburn did not trust anyone who did not wear the scarlet coat of the corps the rasp of steel seemed to shock the vessels ungainly master he said in a conciliatory tone shes a damned thief thats what no better than a common whore i must have order and discipline in my ship if i had my way he broke off as keen said gently cut her down cover her with something a seaman called shem fainted sir keen made himself cross to the grating he saw the way her slight figure was dragging on her bound wrists the blood running down her spine her breasts were pressed into the grating and he could see where her heart pumped against the scrubbed wood she had fainted but the pain would be waiting for her hogg had appeared on deck and keen heard him sheathe his cutlass he must have thought the worst to quit his gig and come aboard without an order a riot a mutiny hogg was ready to save his captain like allday had done for bolitho hogg strode over and cut the bonds and caught her as she fell the last of her bloodspattered clothing gathered up in his arms as he hid her body from the silent onlookers the ships master said thickly i have a surgeon keen eyed him i can well imagine it must have been the way he looked rather than what he said because the master fell back as if he had seen his own danger in keens eyes take her to the gig hogg and return to the ship you go with the boat mr stayt i have work to do here he saw the barest hint of resentment in the lieutenants dark eyes he wanted to shoot to kill the man with the whip anyone keen knew that look perhaps i have it also now captain latimer keen was surprised he had remembered the mans name when moments earlier he had wanted to smash him to the deck i intend that you shall put your best hands to work on a jury rudder i will supply more men when required but you will waste no more time do you understand the girl the earlier anger showed itself im responsible for every living soul aboard keen eyed him coldly then god help them there are women in captain inchs ship wives of the gibraltar garrison officers they can take care of the girl for the present after my surgeon has examined her the other man knew his authority was dwindling with each second it must be said captain youve not heard the last o this keen raised one hand and saw the man flinch but he tapped his blue lapel and said nor you i can promise that another boat ground alongside and he heard argonautes carpenter and his selected crew climbing aboard keen turned away he was needed aboard the flagship for a dozen things but some last warning made him turn if you are thinking captain latimer that it is a long long way to new south wales let me assure you that you will not even see gibraltar if you abuse your authority again he climbed down into the cutter and waited to be pulled back to the ship he was breathing hard and thought his hands must be shaking he saw the cutters midshipman staring at him he must have seen most of it keen said you are all eyes today mr hext hext just thirteen years old nodded and swallowed hard iim sorry sir but but go on mr hext hext flushed crimson knowing that the oarsmen were watching as they pushed and pulled on their looms when i saw it sir ii wanted to stand with you keen smiled moved by the boys sincerity it was probably heroworship and nothing deeper but it did more to steady keens mood than he could have believed possible he had heard it said that hext wrote many letters to his parents although there was little time to post any of them he said never be afraid to help the helpless mr hext think on it the midshipman clung to the tiller bar and stared blindly at the towering masts and rigging of the flagship he would write about it in his next letter toss your oars he piped it was a moment he would never lose no deadlier enemy bolitho was leaning on the sill of the great stern windows when keen entered his cabin his hat beneath one arm astern of argonaute the other ships tilted over on the larboard tack the courses and topsails braced round to hold the wind apart and yet still with her escort the orontes was making better progress with her jury rudder but the squadrons speed was still severely reduced the ship felt cold and damp bolitho thought of the mediterranean and the warmth they would find there it was a full day since the trouble aboard orontes and bolitho could imagine the speculation on the lower deck wardroom too about the girl in the sickbay keen looked at him and asked you wished to see me sir richard it would not be lost on keen that ozzard and the others were absent it was to be a private conversation yes a letter has been sent to me by orontes master keen nodded my coxn collected it sir in it he protests at your behaviour our behaviour since you are under my command and threatens to take the matter to higher authority keen said softly i am sorry i did not mean to involve you bolitho said i would have expected no other action from you val i am not troubled by that oafs threat if i were to press home a claim from his employers for salvage captain latimer would be on the beach before he knew it his sort are scum they work for bloodmoney like their counterparts in slavery keen waited half surprised that bolitho had not taken him to task for interfering in the first place he should have known bolitho asked have you spoken to this girl keen shrugged well no sir i thought it best to leave her with the surgeon until she recovers you should have seen the whip the size of the man who struck her bolitho was thinking aloud she will have to be cared for by another woman i did consider inchs ship after your suggestion but im not sure officers wives and a girl sentenced to transportation though for what crime we cannot yet know i will ask latimer for details of her warrant keen said it is good of you to take the trouble sir if i had only known bolitho smiled gravely you would still have acted as you did feet thudded overhead and blocks squealed as the officerofthewatch yelled for the braces to be manned in a crowded kings ship a solitary woman could be seen as many things not least bad luck landsmen might scoff at such beliefs if they went to sea they would soon know differently see the girl yourself val then tell me what you think at gibraltar we can shift her to the philomela from what you say latimer would certainly take his revenge otherwise keen made to withdraw he had meant to visit the girl and speak with the surgeon further about her no matter what she had done in her young life she did not deserve the agony and humiliation of a flogging bolitho waited for the door to close and then sat down again beneath the stern windows time and time again he kept thinking of falmouth of the sheer happiness of his homecoming holding his new and only child elizabeth in his arms so awkwardly that belinda had laughed at him bolitho had always understood how difficult it must be for any woman to cross the threshold of the bolitho home too many shadows and memories so much expected of a newcomer and in belindas case she had been replacing cheney or so it would seem to her it had hit bolitho hardest when he had discovered that cheneys portrait the companion to the one she had had done of him had been removed from the room where the two pictures once hung together she with the headland behind her her eyes like the sea and he in his whitelapelled coat as the captain she had loved so much his portrait now hung with the others alongside that of his father captain james he had said nothing he had not wanted to hurt her but it still disturbed him like a betrayal he kept telling himself that belinda only wanted to help him to make others appreciate his worth to the country but falmouth was his home not london he could almost hear the words so harsh in that quiet room he sighed and turned his thoughts to allday he had probably felt the new atmosphere at falmouth it was impossible to guess what he made of it or maybe allday had been so concerned with the discovery of his son that he had had no time for speculation he pictured the two of them as they had stood here in the cabin allday powerful proud in his blue jacket with the prized gilt buttons head cocked to listen and watch as bolitho spoke with the young sailor john bankart bolitho could remember when allday had been brought aboard his frigate phalarope a victim of the pressgang it was twenty years ago although it did not seem possible ferguson bolithos steward now at falmouth had been dragged aboard with him no wonder they had remained so close allday had been very like this young sailor cleareyed honestlooking with a sort of defiance just below the surface he had met with a recruiting party and signed on with little hesitation when he was around eighteen he disliked farm life and knew that as a volunteer he would get better treatment than pressed men in a kings ship his mother had never married allday had hinted uncomfortably that the farmer had often taken her to his bed under the threat that otherwise he would get rid of her and her bastard son it had touched a nerve for bolitho the memory of adams arrival on board his ship after walking all the way from penzance when his mother had died it was too similar not to move him bankart had already proved himself a good seaman and could reef splice and steer equal to many his senior in age and service as second coxswain he would have little contact with his admiral his duties would be confined to maintaining the readiness and appearance of the barge going on errands to ships and the shore and helping allday in any way that he could it seemed a satisfactory solution for the present he got up and walked into his sleeping compartment then after a slight hesitation he opened a drawer and took out the beautiful oval miniature the artist had caught her expression perfectly bolitho replaced it under his shirts what was the matter with him he was happy he had a lovely wife ten years his junior and now a daughter and yethe turned away and reentered the day cabin when they joined the fleet things would be different action danger and the rewards of victory he stared at his reflection in the saltencrusted windows and smiled wryly sir richard yet at the actual moment the king had seemingly forgotten his name bolitho tried to gather his thoughts for the months ahead how lapish would react the first time the squadrons only frigate was called to arms but it eluded him he thought instead of the portrait which had gone from the room which looked towards the sea and wished suddenly he had brought it with him far beneath bolithos spacious quarters and the view astern from its gilded gallery argonautes sickbay seemed airless for the orlop deck below the level of the waterline was completely sealed a place of leaping shadows from the swaying spiralling lanterns where the massive deckhead beams were so low a man could not stand upright from the day the ship had been built the orlop had not and would never see the light of day tiny hutchlike cabins lined part of the deck where warrant officers clung to their privacy with barely room to move nearby was the midshipmens berth where the young gentlemen lived their disordered lives and were expected to study for promotion by the light of a glim an oiled wick in a shell or an old tin the hanging magazine and powder stores where a single spark could bring disaster shared the deck with them and below them the great holds carried everything to sustain the ship for many months if need be right aft at the foot of a companion ladder the sickbay seemed bright by comparison with its white paint and racks of jars and bottles keen strode towards it his head automatically lowered to avoid the beams his epaulettes glittering as he passed from one lantern to the next dark shapes and vague faces loomed and faded in the gloom that other world away from sea and sky he saw james tuson the surgeon speaking with his assistant a tall pallid channel islander named carcaud the latter was more breton than english but was intelligent and could both read and write keen knew that tuson who had been achates surgeon took a great interest in his lanky assistant and had taught him as much as he could they even played chess together keen liked the silverhaired tuson although he knew him no more than in their previous ship he was a fine surgeon twenty times better than most of his profession who served the kings ships but he kept to himself not an easy thing in this teeming world between decks and often went to the wardroom only for meals a marine his crossbelts very white in the poor light straightened his back and made tuson turn towards the captain it had been a wise precaution to place a sentry at the door keen thought many of the hands had been aboard one ship or another without a break for many months any woman might be at risk one labelled a felon even more so tuson murmured something and his assistant bent almost double melted into the shadows keen said how is she tuson unrolled his shirt sleeves and considered the question she says nothing to me anyway shes young under twenty id wager and her skin is fine and her hands have not worked in a field he turned away from the rigid sentry whose leather hat seemed to be wedged against the deckhead and dropped his voice there are several bruises i fear she may have been raped or savagely molested he sighed id not risk an examination under the circumstances keen nodded the girl had suddenly become a person someone real and not just a victim the surgeon was watching him thoughtfully he rarely smiled she cant stay here sir keen avoided the issue ill speak with her he hesitated unless you advise to the contrary the surgeon led the way towards the small bright place she knows where she is but be patient i beg you keen stepped into the sickbay and saw the girl lying face down on a pillow and covered with a sheet she appeared to be sleeping but keen could tell by her quick breathing that she was pretending the surgeon pulled down the sheet and keen saw her back tense tuson said in his soft matteroffact tones the scar is healing but he lifted a loose dressing and keen saw the deep cut left by the whip if he had not acted promptly or had not gone over to the ship at all she would be crippled or dead in the lantern light the scar looked black tuson pointed to hair which was long and dark brown it was matted and tangled and as he touched it keen saw her stiffen again he said she needs a bath and some fresh clothing keen said ill send a lieutenant over to the orontes as soon as we anchor she must have some possessions surely his words seemed to strike her like the whip and she rolled over violently covering her breasts with the sheet and oblivious to the immediate droplets of blood which broke from her scar ao not back there please not back to that that place keen was taken aback by the outburst the girl was almost beautiful something which bruises and disordered hair could not conceal she had small wellshaped hands and eyes so wide they were almost starting from her face as she pleaded with him he said easy girl easy now he reached out to steady her but saw tuson give a quick shake of his head the surgeon said this is the captain he saved you from the flogging she looked at keens anxious face and said you sir it was little more than a whisper it was you she had a soft west country voice it was impossible to imagine her standing trial and being transported in that filthy vessel with the other prisoners yes around him the ship kept up her continuous chorus of creaks and groans with the occasional boom of water beyond the massive timbers as the keel crashed into a trough but keen was conscious only of stillness as if all time had suddenly stopped he heard himself ask whats your name she glanced quickly at the surgeon who nodded encouragingly carwithen she clutched the sheet tighter as tuson readjusted the dressings on her back where are you from dorset sir from lyme her small chin lifted briefly and he saw it tremble but im cornish really tuson grunted thought so he straightened his back now lie still and dont open the cut again ill have some food brought down he turned to the door and beckoned to his waiting assistant she looked at keen once more and said in a hoarse whisper you really are the captain sir keen knew that her guard was about to break he had grown up with two younger sisters and knew the first signs god alone knew she had suffered enough he moved to the door pausing as the hull dipped and then reluctantly lifted her eighteen hundred tons for the next challenge the girl did not take her eyes from his face what will you have done with me sir her eyes were shining he must not be here when the tears broke through instead he asked bluntly whats your first name she seemed caught off balance zenoria he backed away well zenoria do as the surgeon directs i will ensure that no harm comes to you he passed the sentry without even seeing him what had he done how could he promise her anything and why should he he did not even know her as he hurried up the first companion ladder he already knew the answers to both questions it was madness i must be mad it seemed to mock him and he was suddenly grateful to see the sky once again lieutenant hector stayt leaned over the table and placed another copy of bolithos orders for his signature they would be passed to all the other captains when they finally anchored at gibraltar that would be in two days time if the wind remained in their favour it had been a long empty week since the incident aboard orontes but now as the small squadron steered to the southeast with the spanish coastline from cadiz to algeciras barely visible to the most keeneyed lookout the passage was almost over bolitho glanced over yovells round handwriting before putting his own signature at the bottom the same orders but each would be interpreted differently by the captains who read them once in the mediterranean there would be neither time nor opportunity to get to know his officers nor they him he thought of keen and his visits to their unexpected passenger the french builders had allowed an extra chart space abaft the masters cabin and this had been made as comfortable as possible for the girl zenoria carwithen a cot a mirror some clean sheets from the wardroom had somehow transformed it ozzard had even managed to discover a spare officers commode in the hold and had installed it for her use they must not get too fond of the idea of having her aboard he thought once at the rock stayt said i did hear something about that girl sir richard it was not the first time the flaglieutenant had seemed to read bolithos thoughts it was unnerving and irritating and bolitho looked up from the table stayt sounded almost indifferent now that he had his admirals attention oh she was mixed up in a riot of some kind i understand it was near to my fathers property someone was murdered before the military arrived he gave a thin smile late as usual bolitho looked past him at the swords on their rack one so bright and gleaming the other almost shabby by comparison stayt took his silence for interest her father was hanged bolitho dragged out his watch and opened the guard time to exercise the squadrons signals mr stayt ill be up directly stayt left he had a springy walk it seemed to show his great selfconfidence bolitho frowned conceit anyway yovell moved to the table and gathered up the papers he glanced at bolitho over his small gold spectacles and said it wasnt quite like that sir richard bolitho looked at him tell me id like to hear it from you yovell smiled sadly carwithen was a printer sir a fine one im told some of the farmworkers asked him to print some handbills a sort of protest it was about two landowners who had been keeping them short of money and chattels carwithen was a bit of a firebrand by all accounts believed in speaking his mind especially when others were being wronged he flushed but bolitho nodded speak as you will man it was strange that yovell should know he lived at the bolitho house when he was ashore but he was a devonian a foreigner as far as local folk were concerned yet he always seemed to know about the people around him carwithens wife had died previous to that so they sent the girl out of the county to dorset aye sir that were it so something else must have happened since the riot as stayt had described it he heard the trill of calls from the quarterdeck as the signalling party were mustered under stayts eagle eye signals especially in battle should be few short and precise bolitho made up his mind and said fetch allday allday glanced questioningly at the secretary as they entered but yovell merely shrugged his sloping shoulders sir go with yovell and fetch that girl aft he saw their surprise now if you please keen would be busy on deck watching the other ships as they acknowledged and obeyed the signals from the flag alldays jaw looked stubborn if you thinks its wise sir bolitho eyed him firmly i do he saw ozzard lifting his coat from a chair but shook his head any sort of liaison would be destroyed before it had begun if she found herself confronted by a viceadmiral from what keen and tuson had said she seemed to be an intelligent girl and her fathers influence had obviously gained her some education he was interfering but he had seen keens face whenever he had mentioned the girl bolitho had not forgotten what it was like he must act before the girl was taken from the ship he was totally unprepared for what happened next yovell opened the screen door and the girl walked hesitantly towards the stern cabin against alldays powerful figure she looked small but her head was up and only her eyes moved as she paused below the skylight she was dressed in a white shirt and breeches of one of the midshipmen and her long brown hair was pulled back to the nape of her neck with a ribbon so that she almost looked as if she belonged in the gunroom but her feet were bare small like her hands and yovell explained hastily even the young gentlemen didnt have shoes small enough for her bolitho said sit down i wish to talk with you he saw the stiff way she held her shoulder tuson had said her back would be scarred for life and that had been from just one stroke i should like to know he saw her eyes level on his they were dark brown misty no wonder keen was under some kind of magic what brought you to these circumstances yovell murmured tell sir richard lass hell not eat you she started with alarm her lips parting as she exclaimed sir richard bolitho wanted to glare at yovell but said just tell me please but she stared at him butbut ive met the captain yovell said patiently the admiral here commands all the ships all the captains miss and some two thousand eight hundred jack tars and marines he watched her gravely a big job to do so speak up an dont you waste his time eh bolitho smiled he means well er zenoria isnt it she looked at her hands in her lap then she said they took my father sir he was a fine man a clever man too he believed in peoples rights her eyes took on a faraway look and bolitho found he was holding his breath just to hear her speak it was like hearing cornwall again i saw him hang sir but why it was the squire sir he came to the house with some of his men and they tried to smash his press my father soon showed them her chin lifted with sudden pride so that she looked all the more vulnerable he pulled the squire from his horse and others came from the village to help him someone was killed then the dragoons came and took him away how old were you then seventeen sir that was two years ago they sent me to dorset to work in a big household and help teach the children there it was difficult to speak as he wished with yovell and allday listening but he had to be certain she was not lying not a whore as stated by orontes master it could be dangerous to be alone with her tell me about what happened in lyme yovell said severely your warrant will come aboard my lass so no use lying about it for gods sake man hold your tongue bolitho saw the girl cringe as if his anger was directed partly at her he said fetch her a glass allday he was trying to cover his own confusion i must know she dropped her eyes everyone knew about my father and what had happened the master was always touching me making remarks telling me how lucky i was to have a roof over my head then one day he came to my room she was beginning to shake he tried to she took a glass from allday but did not drink from it he forced me to do things she looked up her eyes wild and pleading id been making some repairs to the childrens clothing she could barely get the words out i took the scissors and i stabbed him bolitho stood up and walked slowly behind her chair it was so clear in her voice he could almost see it happening and then he didnt die sir but i was sent to the assizes you know the rest sir transportation for life you may return to your cabin zenoria bolitho looked down at her upturned face nineteen years old but in the midshipmans shirt with her hair tied back she looked like a child she stood up and handed her glass to allday it was still full that captain latimer wanted me too sir it was all she needed to say tomorrow my secretary will help you to write all this down i cannot must not pretend that i can help in this matter he touched her shoulder and this time she did not flinch but i promise you i shall try he turned aft to the windows and waited to hear the door close when allday came back he said simply that were kindly done an thats no error sir shes sobbin fit to bust now but itll do her good you think so bolitho watched the flags soaring up helicons yards but saw only the girls eyes the pain that was so deeply lodged there i saw him hang he thought of the squire who had married his sister nancy at falmouth a rich landowner who had always had his eye on the bolitho house local people called him the king of cornwall behind his back but he was good to nancy even if he was a braggart who lived too well in peace and war he was also a magistrate but even he would have recommended mercy rather than deportation or would he more calls trilled and he knew that the drills were ended for another day he watched the door and heard the sentrys heels bang together keen entered and exclaimed may i speak sir richard allday and yovell left the cabin and keen said i have just heard sir i regret that you did not feel free to ask me when bolitho said quietly sit down val we are not going to fight i saw the girl because of you not in spite of you keen stared at him me bolitho gestured to a chair she sat there now pray do likewise bolitho watched the emotions crossing keens features he had rarely seen keen angry but this was different protective he said she will have to be put ashore once we anchor it is only a temporary solution but i think i can arrange it from what she has told me and what was left unsaid i believe there is some hope if only he broke off as keen exclaimed i can write to my cousin in the city of london i am sure we can he turned and looked at bolitho his eyes steady it was good of you sir i should have understood bolitho poured two glasses of brandy and guessed that ozzard was pressed against his pantry shutter she has been cruelly used val he let his words drop like shot into a still pool raped it would seem and thats just the half of it he watched the pain in keens blue eyes he had guessed correctly bolitho did not know whether it gave him satisfaction or grief keen said quietly i have a great affection for her sir he looked up his eyes defiant as if he expected bolitho to explode i know that val i think i knew that day when you went down to visit her maybe even earlier he nodded thats settled then keen put down the empty glass although he had barely noticed what he was drinking its impossible i am mad even to think of it bolitho said how old are you val thirtyfive or six a year older than that sir and she is just a girl a woman val so remember it eh as you get older the gap between you will lessen not widen he put his head on one side and smiled at keens expression perhaps he had done wrong by both of them the senior officer or the governor at gibraltar might refuse to allow the girl to remain there but at least the truth was out and bolitho found that he was surprisingly lifted by it keen said i am deluding myself sir bolitho touched his arm we shall see he glanced at the skylight as a lookouts cry floated down from aloft a minute later the midshipmanofthewatch appeared breathless at the door beg pardon sir he stared from keen to his admiral mr pagets respects and we have just sighted a sail sir it was midshipman hext his eyes now moving around the great cabin doubtless remembering it for another letter bolitho smiled gravely and are we to be told where this sail might be in due course the boy blushed iim sorry sir richard it bears to the soueast keen said my compliments to the first lieutenant i shall come up he still sounded different as if only half his mind was working on the news bolitho said signal rapid to investigate his thoughts clung to that small moment of warmth they had shared and then he said might be news of the french keens eyes cleared aye sir then he was gone but it was to be news of a graver sort as the other ship drew closer she was soon identified as the barracouta bolitho took a telescope and joined keen at the quarterdeck rail to watch as lapish clawed his way to windward to draw closer to the squadron there were men at work on her yards and several of her sails were patched even as he watched bolitho saw a great mass of cordage being hoisted aloft the work not even faltering as the business of sailing the ship went on shes been in a fight keen nodded to his first lieutenant prepare to shorten sail mr paget bolitho kept his face impassive as the men around the quarterdeck stared at him so it was beginning already the momentary calm was over you are right val captain repair on board immediately an hour later captain jeremy lapish sat in bolithos cabin he seemed to have aged since he had left the squadron to carry despatches to gibraltar he explained i sighted a schooner inshore and closed to see what she was about he took a goblet gratefully from ozzard before i knew where we were there were two french frigates coming around the point with the wind under their coattails bolitho saw the despair and misery on the young captains face just what he had feared had happened the schooner had been the bait and the two frenchmen had almost run lapishs ship onto a lee shore i shall read your report later bolitho eyed him sternly did you lose any hands lapish nodded his eyes dull two sir quite rightly lapish had run from his attackers outsailed and outgunned he had had little choice would i have done the same bolitho looked at him what of gibraltar lapish shook himself from his thoughts he had nearly lost his ship so soon after taking command almost as bad he may have lost the confidence of his people he said gibraltar is closed sir he laid a heavy envelope on the table and they all looked at it as he added fever it has struck down half the garrison bolitho walked across the cabin and back again the rock was notorious for outbreaks of fever but what a time for this to happen there is no deadlier enemy he looked at keen we shall have to stand offshore until we know what is happening to lapish he said return to your ship he wanted to share his pain to commiserate with him instead he closed his mind and said sharply think yourself fortunate to have a ship left to command keen left to see the crestfallen lapish over the side fever bolitho shivered just the word brought back the nightmare when he had nearly died of it it might still return he shook himself and tried to consider how the news would affect them with gibraltar closed to them he would have to decide for himself what to do he smiled grimly he was no longer just an onlooker bait with the crash of a salute lingering in the air the small squadron came round into the wind and anchored in succession bolitho stood by the nettings and saw the relief on keens face the manoeuvre was executed well despite so many new hands throughout the ships he turned and looked up at the great towering mass of gibraltar in the past it had always been a refuge a safe anchorage now it seemed edged with menace there were few menofwar present and they were moored clear of the jetty near the other convict ship philomela and some local craft several guardboats plied slowly back and forth bolitho saw that they carried redcoats and each mounted at least one swivel it was as bad as that we call the other captains aboard today he saw keen training his telescope on one of the boats which was pulling towards the flagship aye sir i think we have a visitor the boat paused the oars backing water below the mainchains while the crew stared up at the twodecker as if she was part of another world a postcaptain stood in the sternsheets and squinted up at the quarterdeck i cannot come aboard sir richard i have to tell you that the governor has taken charge here the admiral is ill he kept his voice unhurried and level as if well aware of the countless ears and eyes which were gauging the danger bolitho walked to the entry port and stood looking down at the boat each man in it would probably give all he owned to be allowed on board even though he might bring the fever with him the sunburned captain in the boat called i have sent a courier brig firefly to lord nelson it was strange that only inch had ever met the little admiral and had rarely ceased to tell of it now adam might meet him the captain added i understand that officers wives are taking passage in your squadron sir richard i have to tell you that if they land they must do so now it is their right to be with their husbands if they so wish but they cannot leave until this fever is broken bolitho saw the orontes swinging to her anchor a guardboat idling nearby to deter anyone from trying to swim ashore it would require a lot of planning water supplies repairs the squadron would need them all and more i have despatches from the governor sir richard a satchel was being lifted to the mainchains on a boathook bolitho saw carcaud the lanky surgeons mate leaning down to seize it in a flannel bag tuson was taking no chances even with that bolitho felt keen watching him as he called all the ladies are astern of me in helicon i have one woman aboard my ship the captain shrugged apologetically if she is not of the garrison sir richard i am ordered to inform you no other person can be landed the boat began to move away the oars stirring unwillingly the captain raised his hat i shall collect the ladies now sir the contact was broken keen lowered his voice you did not tell him that the girl is a prisoner sir bolitho watched the flannel bag being carried aft i do not recall that he asked val he left a patch of shade and stared up at the rock its ancient moorish castle shrouded in heat haze the governor might easily have shut her in a cell val he has raised a state of seige here one girl more or less would stand no chance keen stared after him knowing that his lieutenants were waiting with their demands and lists bolitho had to search through his despatches and compare them with his instructions from the admiralty it was a great responsibility to his ships and his men but he had still found time to think about the girl named zenoria it was unnerving he turned and looked at his officers well mr paget where shall we begin his face was quite calm he was the flagcaptain again if one hint of this matter reached higher authority bolithos name would be smeared too and yet he had not hesitated by the boat tier allday peered up at the greenpainted barge and frowned it would not be lowered here at gib anyway he climbed up to peer into the sleek hull biting his lip as if he expected the hot pain to surge through his chest again the boat was half filled with water the seams would not open in the sunlight he glanced down at bankart and grinned youve made a good start lad he was pleased although still dazed by the change of events which had given him a son that was the strange thing they spoke a lot with each other but apart from bankarts dead mother they had nothing in common except the navy but he was a pleasant lad and did not abuse his small authority of second coxswain as some might allday dropped to the deck and said time for a wet well not be needed just now he glanced aft the admirals too busy for chatter bankart ducked beneath a gangway and asked what is he like ive heard tell youve been with him since allday eyed him fondly since around the day you was born i reckon a fine man brave an loyal to his mates he thought of the girl in midshipmans clothing all bloody hell would break if keen wasnt careful he had heard some of the seamen laying odds on whether the captain had had his way with her all right for the officers eh lads poor jack is the one to suffer allday had silenced that one with his fist but there would be plenty more who thought as much he said ill take you with me to the house when we gets home its a grand place but they found room for me like one o their own the mention of falmouth made him suddenly uneasy he had seen bolithos dismay change to resentment over something lady belinda had said or done allday would back bolitho anywhere against all odds but he felt sympathy for his lovely wife it could not be a smooth passage to follow in cheneys shadow bolitho would have to accept this there was no going back he shook himself out of his mood as he caught the heady aroma of rum a good wet thats what we need the surgeon was standing just inside the door of the makeshift cabin wiping his strong fingers on a cloth as keen appeared keen glanced at the royal marine sentry and saw that his blank face was wet with sweat for despite the hastily rigged windsails to every hatch the air felt hot and sluggish how is she tuson eyed him for several seconds ive removed the dressing sir keen walked past him and saw the girl sitting on a stool her hair released from its ribbon and covering her shoulders he asked does it still hurt very much her eyes lifted to his it is bearable sir she moved her shoulders warily beneath the shirt and winced it feels stiff she seemed to realize that her borrowed shirt had fallen open and dragged it together quickly then she said i heard what happened today about me she looked up and he saw the anxiety stark in her eyes will i be sent to that ship again sir ill kill myself before keen said no dont speak of it tuson watched from the door the tall elegant captain and the longhaired girl on the stool miles apart and yet there was something like a shaft of light between them he cleared his throat ill fetch some ointment for that scar my girl he looked at keen and added quietly i shall be about ten minutes sir then he was gone she asked would you like to sit with me sir she gestured to a heavy chest then she smiled it was the first time keen had seen her smile she said not what youre used to im sure her sudden confidence left her and she added huskily i am sorry dont be keen watched her hands in her lap and wanted to hold them i wish i could make you more comfortable she lifted her gaze and watched him steadily what is it you want of me she sounded neither angry nor frightened it was as if she had been expecting him to demand freely what she had already been brutally forced to give keen said i want to take care of you he looked at the deck he thought she would call for the sentry or worse laugh at him and his clumsiness without a word she moved from the stool and knelt down against his legs and rested her head on his knees keen found that he was stroking her long hair saying meaningless words anything to prolong this impossible moment there were footsteps on a companion ladder and outside the door the sentry dragged the butt of his musket across the deck tuson was coming back then she looked up at him and he saw that her eyes were streaming with tears could feel them wet through his white breeches you mean it dont you the words were torn from her keen stood up and raised her to her feet without shoes she barely reached his chest he touched her face and then very carefully as if he was handling something precious and delicate he lifted her chin with his fingers believe it i have never meant anything so much then as tusons shadow moved between them he stepped back through the door tuson watched them surprised that he could still feel so emotional after what his trade had done to him it was like sharing something a secret but it would not remain one for long ozzard and his assistants had brought extra lanterns to the great cabin so that the windows overlooking the harbour seemed black by comparison it was the first time that all the captains of bolithos squadron had been gathered together like this there was an air of good humour and perhaps some relief that they were staying away from the fever keen waited until all the goblets had been filled and then said pay attention gentlemen bolitho stood by the windows his hands tucked behind him under his coattails a landsman would be impressed he thought his little band of captains made a fine sight beneath the slowly spiralling lanterns francis inch was the most senior his long face empty of anxiety or concern about anything keen the only other postcaptain looked tense as he glanced at his companions his mind was still turning over what had happened between him and their passenger one good thing had occured bolitho decided a jamaican girl one of the servants who had been travelling with the garrison wives had pleaded not to be sent ashore in view of the governors order this seemed a suitable solution for a companion for zenoria carwithen it would not stop the speculation but might halve the gossip philip montresor of the despatch was a young eagerfaced man who was not in the least daunted by the solitary epaulette on his right shoulder next to him tobias houston of the icarus looked old for his rank and had indeed gained it by a roundabout route through john company and later the revenue service he had a round hard face like a weathered nut and a mouth little more than a slit commander marcus quarrell was leaning across to whisper something to lapish who had commanded his brig rapid before him quarrell was a lively friendly man from the isle of man but his humour was failing with lapish who still looked sunk in gloom lieutenant hallowes of the cutter supreme was also present and quite rightly he was as much a captain as any of them for the present anyway they were a mixed bunch bolitho thought the whole fleet must be like this as their lordships tried to produce ships and men for a war which even an idiot should have expected he looked over their expectant faces the gold and blue of their uniforms the confidence he had heard in their voices he said gentlemen i intend to sail with a minimum of delay in his despatches the governor has informed me that an east indiaman will be arriving any day now to take passage around the cape of good hope with her trained company and heavy artillery she will be able to offer a suitable escort to the two convict vessels until they are clear of french interference i am sure the governor will be able to persuade the grocery captain they all laughed the heic was not known for losing time on a fast passage no matter for what reason it hid bolithos relief he had been afraid that the governor might demand one of his ships for the task there were too few already without that he continued this is unlike the blockades of brest and the bay there foul though it is for the ships involved they can be relieved and sent to england for restoring or repairs in a couple of weeks in the mediterranean there is no such relief toulon is our main cause of anxiety to watch the enemy and discover his intention will need constant vigilance but where can we go for our supplies and even more important our fresh drinking water gibraltar is eight hundred miles from toulon and malta about the same a ship sent from malta might be away from her admiral for over two months he smiled wryly pleasant for her captain maybe he saw them grin but in the meantime the enemy could be away on the wind i have no doubt that viceadmiral nelson has already found a possible solution if not i intend to act independently he could see the captains of the seventyfours considering what he had said each ship carried fresh water for only ninety days and that was on a restricted ration they had to find a source of water above all else you must continue regular gun and sail drills at all times apart from improving both it will keep the people occupied there was a smell of food and he guessed that ozzard was waiting to serve dinner for the gathered captains he said we will speak later but do you have any questions montresor got to his feet like keen he had fair hair and the fresh complexion of a schoolboy he asked are we to blockade the french at toulon and the other ports sir richard bolitho replied not entirely our main task is to catch them if they break out and destroy them they will be testing us remember feeling our strength as well as our ability he saw keens face he alone knew what bolitho had left until now there is one french squadron newly formed but not yet reported in toulon even as he said it he found it hard to believe impossible to accept rearadmiral jobert commands it he saw their exchange of glances for some it had not sunk in he looked round the great cabin this was his ship gentlemen we took it from him some five months ago how had jobert managed it to obtain an exchange with some british prisoner of equal rank perhaps but bolitho had heard of no such arrangement he will know our movements also that my flag flies above the squadron he is a brave and resourceful officer and will be out for revenge inch leaned forward and bobbed well finish him this time bolitho looked at the three junior officers your importance is paramount i have no doubt in my mind that jobert was behind the trap laid for barracouta it was little more than a guess but fitted what he knew about jobert the look of gratitude on lapishs face more than made up for it he would not repeat his mistake bolitho said jobert may intend to seek out any small detached vessel and destroy her and so leave the flagship deaf and blind with his exflagship and helicon another french prize trailing their coats in his waters jobert would need little encouragement to level the score at the back of his mind bolitho wondered if admiral sheaffe had known about this when he had last seen him an encouragement for one was a goad for the other perhaps i am the bait keen murmured bitterly we should have done for him there and then it was unusual for him to sound so vehement worrying about the girl and what would become of her now that they were moving deeper into the mediterranean what should be done with her perhaps after all his plan had gone wrong and might eventually do her some real harm he thrust it from his mind the war would not wait it was something greater than any of them had known he said quietly so let us dine together gentlemen inch beamed and think of our loved ones eh captain houston gave a thin smile some can do more than think about them to all accounts keen looked pale but managed to remain silent bolitho said captain houston i am not sure if that was meant to be offensive if so then i am offended his grey eyes were suddenly hard i am waiting the silence was oppressive like the humidity in the cabin houston met bolithos gaze and said hesitantly i meant no offence to you sir richard i am glad to know it bolitho turned aside houston was a fool worse he might become the weak link in their slender chain he thought of inchs words which brought houstons response i shall write to belinda tomorrow but the thought remained motionless in his mind like a cloud as the others made their way towards the long table with its gleaming candles keen said urgently it is beginning sir i blame myself i would not have had this happen bolitho faced him and ignoring the others gripped his arm with sudden force say no more on the matter tomorrow next week maybe we could join our lost friends or be whimpering as our parts drop in tusons wings and limbs tubs he tightened his grip still more it is something you could never have foreseen then he smiled and released his hold in truth val i damned well envy you he turned away before keen could speak two days later as a lordly east indiaman dropped anchor in the bay bolithos squadron weighed and put to sea in watery sunlight throughout the squadron every purser was worrying over fresh water and rations and each captain considered the need to be sparing with cordage and canvas as they sailed farther and farther from the land a thousand miles ahead of the squadron the little brig firefly lay hoveto under the flagships lee adam bolitho stood on the broad quarterdeck and glanced across at the other ships and then up at the viceadmirals flag at the fore like his uncle and yet it was all so different several other visitors were aboard and the flagships own captain had barely paused to offer him a nod the solitary epaulette counted for very little here he thought but the challenge and the thrill of making his first rendezvous in his own command still held him even sighting the rock in all its majesty had seemed exciting and personal and now he was here in the old victory ignored perhaps but here he shaded his eyes to look across at his small command she was young and alive the way he felt he owed it all to his uncle although he would be the first to deny it adam sighed it was his uncles birthday tomorrow although without someone to remind him he would let it pass unnoticed he would more likely be thinking of the day after two years exactly since he had married belinda at falmouth they had been a hard two years much of them spent at sea as was the way of the bolitho men now there was little elizabeth but something was missing the flaglieutenant joined him on the quarterdeck and eyed him curiously the secretary is completing the despatches you are to carry it will not take long thank you in the meantime lord nelson would be pleased to receive you please follow me adam walked aft his mind awhirl he was twentythree years old and with firefly had thought he had everything a voice announced commander adam bolitho my lord in fact it was just beginning darkness at noon bolitho paced slowly along argonautes handsome stern gallery his neckcloth untied his shirt open to his waist october it might be but the air was hot with little more than a light breeze to fill the sails he liked the stern gallery a luxury he had never enjoyed in an englishbuilt ship beyond the tall windows of his day cabin or above on the poop was the ship and all the responsibility she represented here on this narrow catwalk there was complete privacy no eyes to watch him to study his confidence or lack of it even the sounds were more muffled here masked by the surge of water below the counter the creak of the rudderhead as the helmsmen held the twodecker on course one sound did intrude however the regular staccato roll of a drum the agonizing pause and the crack of the lash on a mans naked back one more note in the punishment book and little comment from the ships company discipline was discipline less harsh in many ways than that meted out by the lower deck if they found someone stealing from their own kind crack bolitho thought of the girl and wondered why he had not told adam about her when firefly had joined the labouring squadron just long enough to pass some despatches and collect letters for home for firefly was returning to england nelsons link with a faroff admiralty adam had said wistfully i have only just come here uncle he had brightened when bolitho had given him a letter for belinda but i shall be back soon with any luck bolitho walked to the end of the gallery and rested his hand on the gilded shoulder of a lifesized mermaid the twin of the one at the opposite side he smiled well almost this one had been decapitated by a ball from achates on that murderous day in may adam and hallowes who now commanded supreme had boarded this ship with a small handful of men each knowing it was a last chance with the possibility of survival too unlikely to consider adam had told him about this mermaid and how he had clung to her before the last mad dash the old woodcarver at plymouth who had fashioned a new head must have a sense of humour he thought he had given the mermaid a sardonic grin as if she was enjoying a secret he had asked adam of his impressions of nelson and had seen him putting them together in his mind he was not at all as i expected he seemed restless and in some pain from his arm and although i am taller than his lordship he seemed to fill the cabin i cannot explain it and his contempt for authority is astounding the name of admiral sheaffe was mentioned and nelson laughed he said that sheaffes oceans were made of paper and fine intentions that he had forgotten that it took men to win wars you liked him despite his outspokenness to a subordinate adam had seemed uncertain i am not sure uncle once i thought him vain even shallow and the next instant i was struck by his total grasp of the war out here he had grinned shyly i know now that i would follow him to hell and back if he required it of me but i cannot say why it is just something i know it was much as others had said hated by most of his superiors but loved by the men he led the majority of whom had never laid eyes on him bolitho wished he had been there adam had said he asked of you uncle and wished you well now firefly was gone speeding to gibraltar and then on to spithead without effort bolitho could see portsmouth as he had left it cold and wet but so strong in his life he began pacing again nelson had left him in no doubt as to a suitable wateringplace for his ships sardinia and a small group of islands at the eastern end of the straits of bonifacio the madalena islands as they were named lay less than two hundred miles from toulon trust our nel to know such things no wonder he could thumb his nose at men like sheaffe until his luck ran out pipes trilled like distant birds without seeing it bolitho knew the hands were being dismissed the flogged man cut down the gratings unrigged and swabbed clean justice had been done bolitho thought of his instructions it made him smile to himself as a captain you received orders a flagofficer had to discover his own solutions the squadron had been given a twohundredmile sector west of toulon and the main blockade to the spanish frontier it was of course possible that if the french did break out in force they might try again for egypt and the nile it had been a very close thing the last time if they succeeded in a new attempt bonaparte would look further to india it would be like opening a vast sack of booty to say nothing of a tactical advantage bolitho thought it just as likely that the french fleet would head for the strait of gibraltar and force their way to biscay and double the size of their squadrons there if he had read nelsons mind correctly no matter what adam thought nelson would want the lions share of the fight for himself the sea seemed empty without half his ships he had sent inch with despatch in company with lapishs frigate as scout and gobetween icarus her sails filling and then emptying in the weak breeze followed astern her gunports open as the sourfaced captain houston drilled his crews the cutter was like a pale sharks fin far to windward and rapid was visible only from the masthead as she led her big consorts like beasts on a line far to starboard the horizon looked deep purple corsica he leaned on the rail and looked at the water as it bubbled from the rudder in these light airs it would take longer than he had hoped to find anchorage and take on fresh water the nearness of land would do wonders for the seamen and marines he thought a door opened onto the gallery and allday said apologetically capn keens respects sir an rapid has sighted a sail to the eastrd masthead reports its just in sight bolitho nodded ill wait down here it was strange he had heard nothing like his new chair the gallery was private and personal he grinned at his reflection in the windows must be getting old keen came down a few minutes later a schooner sir genoese according to mr pagethe went aloft with a glass bolitho walked into the cabin and crossed to his chart so long as shes not spanish the dons may not be in the war not yet at least but they are still an enemy and will tell the french everything they can about us keen suggested shell be a trader hereabouts sir id like to speak with her myself when were up to her bolitho thought of rapids commander quarrell a good officer but like lapish he lacked experience yes you go the trader may know something he said with sudden anger like groping in the dark i wonder what hes up to keen watched him jobert was rarely mentioned by name but he was always on bolithos mind bolitho was saying these islands there are quite a few hiding places amongst them it will be well to keep a sharp lookout until we know they are secure he tapped the chart with some dividers on this hill for a beginning a good man could see for miles from there keen waited knowing there was more to come bolitho rubbed his chin id like to see for myself once you have investigated this schooner signal supreme to close on the flag i intend to board her and go on ahead he saw keens uneasiness and added dont worry val i have no intention of becoming a prisonerofwar a second time keen should have been used to bolithos unorthodox methods but he always seemed to have something new up his sleeve it would certainly keep the cutters little company jumping with their admiral dropped amongst them bolitho pulled his shirt away from his damp skin how are things val keen replied she is well sir if only there was a way to reassure her he shrugged the gesture one of helplessness we do not even know ourselves there was a rap at the door and after a small hesitation midshipman sheaffe looked into the cabin mr pagets respects sir the schooner is hoveto bolitho said we shall be up to her before dusk we dont want to lose her keen smiled in spite of his thoughts what bolitho really meant was he needed to get started now that he had decided on something bolitho saw sheaffes eyes watching perhaps comparing them and wondered what he would say if he knew what nelson had said of his father sheaffe was very like his father in one way keen said that he had made no friends and in fact avoided any close contact not an easy thing in an overcrowded ship of the line bolitho said mr sheaffe will come with me good experience thank you sir richard either sheaffe did not care what he was being told to do or he had been listening at the screen door allday protested as soon as the others had gone you cant go without me sir dont be such an old woman allday he smiled i may go ashore and ill not have you undoing all the good the surgeon did by dragging you up a mountain he saw the stubborn light in alldays eyes and added besides i think my er second coxn should be given the chance eh allday nodded slowly but said mistrustfully if you says so sir bolitho had been right about timing it was nearly dusk by the time they had the shabby schooner lying under their lee and when keen returned he had little to offer the master says he sighted a frigate four days ago sir could have been a frenchie he did not loiter to find out he is making for lisbon in that bolitho shook his head not only menofwar had their problems but a solitary frigate must be assumed to be an enemy nelson had only two otherwise there was just barracouta spanish then unlikely to be sailing without company in these disputed waters he marked the place on the chart which keen had gleaned from the trader out of toulon or trying to get back into that port he made up his mind ill go over to supreme before night closes in see to it will you val keen could manage very well without him and inch would be well able to take care of the rest of the squadron if anything happened he heard the calls shrilling and the clatter of tackles above the boat tier he felt sorry for allday but there was no point in overtaxing his strength the savage wound had healed but it had not gone away he waited while ozzard fussed about with his seagoing coat and the hat with the tarnished lace in his heart bolitho knew he needed to be alone away from those he trusted even loved barge alongside sir richard a last glance around the cabin it seemed to be watching him waiting maybe for its old master to return bolitho allowed allday to clip the old sword to his belt never in a thousand years he thought then he loosened the blade in its scabbard and thought of those other times aloud he said ill see him dead first at the entry port where the side party had assembled bolitho took keen aside and said quietly i shall see you at our rendezvous he glanced at the sky we are in for a blow so make sure that icarus stays in close company keen opened his mouth to speak and changed his mind the breeze barely pushed the reefed topsails against the shrouds as the ship lay hoveto and apart from a few arrowhead clouds the sky was as before old fallowfield the sailingmaster was nearby and walked towards his helmsman even he was impressed he glared at a midshipman who was watching the viceadmiral openmouthed and growled wait till you can fathom out the weather like that mr penton but i see no chance o you learnin nothin keen touched his hat aye sir ill send rapid after you if need be bolitho glanced up to his flag this would be a private ship but for my presence val use my quarters while i am away they would have been yours he tugged down his hat and clambered over the side as the boatswains mates trilled their salute it was good that keen should also have some freedom while there was an opportunity what he did with it was his affair as the early light filtered across the nearest island bolitho walked up the cutters tilting deck his shirt rippling from his body in the wind it was difficult to find somewhere to stand he thought as supreme s deck seemed filled with busy figures and snaking halliards the topsail cutter was only seventy feet in length but carried a company of sixty bolitho had once served temporarily in one as a midshipman that vessel had been commanded by his brother hugh even so it was hard to believe that all these busy seamen could eventually find enough space below supremes flush deck to eat and sleep the squall bolitho had predicted had swept down after dark and he felt sorry for the heavier ships he had left astern supreme on the other hand flew with the wind her enormous boomed mainsail jib and foresail bulging under the pressure she seemed to skip across the waves a cutter had proportionally more agility and sailpower than any other manofwar and could manage to sail as much as five points into the wind he saw hallowes shouting to his first lieutenant a round redfaced man who looked old enough to be his father which he probably was lieutenant okes had been promoted from the lower deck and had last trod the planks as a masters mate it was just as well hallowes had more than proved his skill and courage as a fighting officer when they had seized argonaute but supreme required a knowledge of seamanship which could only come from long experience the rising wind and sea had kept the hands fully occupied too busy to worry about the presence of their admiral amongst them but now as the wind backed slightly and the sturdy hull thrust closer into sheltered waters many of the men paused to stare bolitho with his hair plastered down by spray his shirt open from the throat and grubby from the cutters lively motion was not most peoples idea of a flagofficer bolitho watched as some seamen bustled past midshipman sheaffe who was clinging desperately to a backstay his face was pale green and he had been sick several times lieutenant stayt was below not sick but out of sorts at being a passenger and always in somebodys way hallowes crossed to bolitho and said with your permission i shall round the next headland and feel inshore sir he had to shout above the din of canvas and rigging he looked very young and was obviously enjoying his freedom in spite of bolitho two leadsmen were already up forward loosening their lines in readiness the chart was a poor one but hinted at shallows and some spurs of rock although to the naked eye in the bluegrey light the sea looked deceptively welcoming bolitho took a telescope and waited for the supreme to complete the next leg of her tack before he steadied it on the land dark lush green with purple beyond that must be the mountain as it was described more like a tall bald hill he thought as it swam into the dappled lens bolitho stepped back as more seamen lurched past with a tangle of halliards and blocks oblivious to everything but the boatswains yell the long boom which extended well beyond the counter swung above the helmsmen at the tiller and filled out on the opposite tack spray dashed over the deck and bolitho wiped his face with his sleeve he felt alive again the demands of land and flagship momentarily put aside he looked at supremes armament twelve tiny cannon and two swivels but she could give a good account of herself in anything but a shiptoship action the headland fell back in a towering curtain of spray hallowes saw okes watching him and shouted all hands shorten sail leadsmen in the chains lively now hallowes waited until some of the way had gone from his command and said is it your intention to land here sir richard bolitho hid a smile hallowes obviously still thought it incredible that he should wish to go ashore when others would do anything which was required while your watering party is employed i shall take a glass to that hilltop it was a long walk and a climb too but now he had told hallowes he felt better he would have to do it to avoid a loss of face it was as well allday was in the flagship he would not be strong enough for a long time he thought sadly if ever he saw bankart in his blue jacket below the great single mast and wondered what he really felt about his father look sir hallowes leaned on the bulwark and pointed at the sea alongside as the bow wave receded bolitho saw the seabed rising and falling beneath the keel as if it were breathing scores no thousands of fish scurried this way and that and every so often a line of solid rock showed menacingly through the pale sand by th mark five the leadsmans chant was somehow reassuring the boats were already made ready for hoisting out over the sides a gig and a jollyboat hallowes was sensibly going to replenish his own water supply before he rejoined the squadron he heard sheaffe taking deep breaths the worst was over a pleasant landfall mr sheaffe the midshipman straightened his shoulderbelt and dirk and said indeed sir am i to come ashore with you sir bolitho grinned it will do us both good stayt came on deck unlike bolitho he wore his uniform coat and hat and doubtless had his fine pistol close to hand stand by to come about hands wear ship feet pounded on the wet planking and as the sails were checked and fisted into shape the anchor plummeted down into clear water hallowes put his hands behind him and bolitho saw that the fingers were tightly entwined he was nervous but that did no harm at all sway out the boats hallowes said ill send a good lookout up to that ridge sir with a glass hell be able to see across the next headland according to the chart he smiled selfconsciously and mr okes of course stayt beckoned to bankart the gig his voice was sharp and bolitho knew that had allday been here he would have reacted just as curtly but bankart had to learn bolitho waited for the others to clamber down amongst the oarsmen lieutenant okes was taking the jollyboat his weatherbeaten face like some old figurehead bolitho thought the navy could do with a lot more okeses just now sheaffe and stayt squeezed into the sternsheets with him and supreme s only midshipman a spotty youth named duncannon piped give way all bolitho clutched his sword between his knees and thought of cornwall of how he and his brother and sometimes his sisters had played amongst the coves and caves near falmouth he sighed a thousand years ago what would belinda think when she received his letter he had tried not to dwell on it to keep his mind free of personal encumbrances sheaffe said the jollyboats ashore sir bolitho saw okes wading through the shallows his whitestockinged legs like huge inverted flasks there was a broadshouldered seaman already leaving the others naked but for some tattered trousers and widebrimmed hat one of hallowes best men and as bronzed as any native with a telescope carelessly jammed under one arm he was striding towards the trees and the hills beyond the gig grounded and bolitho climbed outboard and then trod on firm sand as the seamen hauled the keel up the beach the trees looked almost tropical and their bushy tops moved in the sea breeze as if in a dance the gigs crew were already returning to the cutter to fetch some water casks bolitho touched his forehead and then as if to test his reaction he felt beneath his dangling lock of hair and along the deep scar which had almost killed him that had been a watering party too it always made him feel uneasy it was a strange thing that the lock of hair was now tinged with white the rest of his hair was as black as before what was it vanity or the anxiety about the difference in his and belindas ages which made him worry about it two seamen armed with cutlasses and muskets strolled behind the little group as with bolitho in the lead they started to make their way up the first slope once sheltered by the scrub and overhanging fronds it seemed moist and very warm no birds sang or screamed out a warning it was almost drowsy stayt said you could shelter two squadrons hereabouts sir he was already breathing hard for one so young nelson was right did that innocent remark have a sharper edge was stayt implying that if nelson had not suggested sardinia nobody else would it was not long before they saw the glitter of a stream with a chattering waterfall at its head okes was already there his booming voice calling for axes to cut a passage for his casks which would be hauled to the boats on crude sledges when they walked into bright sunlight again bolitho shaded his eyes to look back at the anchored cutter she looked like a graceful toy her great sails folded like wings bolitho raised his glass and saw the barebacked sailor settling himself on top of the adjoining hill his long telescope propped on some loose stones he should see the whole coastline from there bolitho felt his shirt dragging at his skin he was wet through but felt elated and pictured himself swimming in that clear inviting water he thought of keen and whether he had been alone with the girl bolitho knew he trusted him but it was more important that others should know it the climb to the top took longer than bolitho had imagined but he was secretly pleased that he had managed it the others looked weary and wet with sweat only bankart seemed fresh as allday used to be the thought stabbed bolitho like a marline spike bolitho looked down at the cutter again her deck alive with tiny antlike figures while the boats moved slowly between her and the beach like water beetles he moved his glass to the lookout and saw the sunlight flash from the mans glass he had sensibly put some dried branches on his back to protect himself from the rising glare and his hat was pulled across the telescope as an extra shield it felt good to be here bolitho wished he was completely alone stayt would soon protest if he even suggested it he sat down on the hot ground and unfolded his small map where was jobert now he wondered what was the overall intention of the french fleet he heard the others resting the sound of a water flask being shaken what would he not give for some of ozzards clear hock which he always managed to keep cool in the bilges bolitho slipped one hand inside his shirt and touched his skin it was only too easy to picture her in his arms her hands on him whispering to him arching with pleasure when he entered her he folded the map with sudden despair of whom was he really thinking stayt said look at the birds there are enough of them now a vast flock of gulls swept round and down as if held together by thread there must be a thousand of them as they dived down and past the anchored supreme bolitho saw swift darting movements in the water and remembered the fish he had seen the gulls had timed it perfectly and even at this distance bolitho could hear them mewing and shrieking as they plunged to the attack work on the cutters deck had stopped as the seamen paused to watch as gull after gull rose flapping wildly a shining fish gripped in its beak stayt said weve a good lookout sir never took his eyes off the proper bearing even for that ive never seen birds act like bolitho said abruptly the lookout he snatched his glass and opened it quickly as he swung it across the bright water and darting seabirds his eyes stung with sweat for some reason the old wound was throbbing what was the matter with him bolitho relaxed very slowly the bronzed lookout was still in position he said put a ball into the rocks below the crest the bloody mans asleep stayt scowled and gestured angrily to one of the seamen did you hear that man the seaman grinned aye sir ill wake jake up right nough he dropped on one knee and raised the musket to his shoulder it might startle the boats crews but a sleeping lookout was a real danger the crack of the musket sent the birds wheeling and flapping away while here and there a fish dropped once more into the sea bolitho closed his telescope and stood up his face impassive even though he thought his heart was bursting the lookout had not moved although the telescope still glinted as before that man is not asleep he tried to keep his voice level i fear we are in some peril he felt them stir their eyes swivelling from the drifting musket smoke to his face stayt exclaimed here sir he sounded stunned bolitho snapped mr sheaffe you are the youngest run back to the beach warn lieutenant hallowes the midshipman was watching his mouth his lips forming the words as if he could not believe what was happening you bankart go with him he forced a smile as fast as you like as the other two blundered downhill and into the trees bolitho said see to your weapons he cursed himself for not bringing a pistol he stared around at the nodding fronds but who would suspect danger in a place like this he walked deliberately down the slope straining his ears in every direction but only the rustle of the trees mocked him as if a hidden army was on the move they reached the trees and bolitho said well circle around the hill he saw the doubt in stayts dark eyes the way that the two armed seamen had suddenly hunched together bolitho said they must have seen us after the musket shot but were out of sight now theyll think were following the others stayt hissed who are they sir bolitho drew his sword and gripped it firmly how many times he realized what stayt had asked must be french they seemed to outguess everything they did where they went what the ships were doing it was unlikely that anyone knew he had moved to the cutter but supreme was one of his strength even the wind on a lee shore was the same as that which had nearly done for barracouta stayt had drawn his hanger and together they moved slowly towards the hillside avoiding patches of sunlight anything which might betray them he wondered if sheaffe had reached the beach yet unlikely even running at full tilt he gritted his teeth to prevent him from despairing aloud why didnt i think i should have realized it was just the kind of trap jobert might think of the secret was out now that musket shot would have made sure of that look stayt dropped on his knees there were two men taking their time their weapons sheathed as they strolled down through the trees sailors obviously and as they drew nearer bolitho heard that they were speaking french they must have left a larger party to go back to the hill for the lookouts telescope bolitho could remember the seaman exactly the glass under one arm a good reliable hand now another carried it and there was dried blood on the case at them bolitho bounded over the bushes and charged onto the man with the telescope he stared with utter astonishment and then made to draw his cutlass he was hampered by the telescope bolitho slashed him across the face and as he toppled sideways drove the blade beneath his armpit at no time did the man cry out the other dropped to his knees and reached out imploringly the lookout must have been popular for one of the seamen swung his musket and smashed him in the skull the musket rose again but stayt snapped curtly enough you fool hell not move again the man with the musket picked up the telescope and followed bolitho down the slope but for their detour they would have been ambushed and the alarm given before they reached the beach he heard the dull bang of a cannon supreme had at last realized what was happening and had fired a recall there was a sudden fusillade of shots and wild shouts then the brief clash of steel bolitho broke into a run and burst through the last bushes and onto the beach in seconds he saw it all the grounded jollyboat the gig caught halfway between the beach and the anchored cutter lieutenant okes stood by the waters edge a pistol in either hand one he had just fired the other he trained on a zigzagging figure which with several others was running towards his handful of seamen bolitho found time to notice that okes stood quite still despite the yells and occasional musket balls more like a wildfowler than a sea officer the pistol cracked and the running man tore into the sand like a plough and lay still that seemed to deter the others especially as bolitho and his three companions charged towards them stayt fired twice his silver pistol must have two barrels and each shot found its mark okes mopped his face with his sleeve lor bless you sir i thought the buggers ad done for you beggin yer pardon bolitho saw bankart by the boat and okes said as he reloaded a pistol wed ave bin caught in th open but for that lad bolitho looked past him wheres mr sheaffe okes dragged out his other pistol i thought e was with you sir bolitho beckoned to bankart wheres the midshipman bankart said he fell sir back there there was a hole he rolled down some sort of cliff bolitho stared at him cliff there are none here the others were clambering into the boats there had been no casualties except for the lookout four corpses lay in attitudes of abandon their blood already soaked into the sand stayt tossed his hanger into the air and caught it by the blade before sliding it into its scabbard it was a neat trick for the blade had an edge like a razor but bolitho was in no mood for games cant leave him stayt said ill go he eyed bankart coldly show me where it was damn you they reached the top of the beach and then saw sheaffe stagger into the sunlight his face was cut and bleeding but otherwise he seemed unharmed into the boats bolitho put his hand on sheaffes shoulder are you all right i fell sheaffe dabbed his lip i hit two tree stumps he grimaced knocked the wind out of me sir his eyes cleared as he saw bankart where were you bankart faced him stubbornly i brought the message like i was ordered bolitho walked towards the gig there was more to it than that but he was grateful they had survived he climbed into the boat and stared across at supreme she was already shortening her cable and her sails were flapping in disorder as hallowes made ready to leave bolitho rubbed his chin unaware of the oarsmens curious glances the french must have landed a party to see what they were doing but for the seabirds and the lookout apparently ignoring the spectacle they might have been attacked when the french had had time to land more men so where were they another fourpounder banged out from the cutter and stayt said harshly theyre aweigh hallowes anchored where he was had seen what the lookout would have reported had he been alive to cry out as if a piece of the headland itself was tearing adrift bolitho saw a ship coming around the point her jib flapping as she tacked sharply to avoid the reefs she was a frigate bolitho said pull lads with all your might they needed no urging if they had not realized the lookout was dead this frigate would have sailed right across the bay and raked supreme into a bloody shambles then the gig ground alongside and men clambered wildly aboard to throw themselves into the business of setting more sail the two boats drifted away bolitho saw hallowes strained and anxious it was a pity about the boats they might need them he clung to a stay and watched the frigate taking up her courses to hold on the present bearing whatever hallowes did he could never beat clear of the land in time bolitho said get your leadsmen to work mr okes do you know these waters well okes had somehow lost his hat aye a fair bit sir he turned as the leadsman began his chant the frenchie wont dare come after us or hell be in worse trouble i agree the frigates captain would realize he had lost the bonus of surprise and would lie off and maybe attempt a cuttingout action with her boats at nightfall that was half a day away bolitho beckoned to hallowes i suggest you anchor hallowes nodded suddenly unable to think clearly okes remarked the frenchies changed tack a piece sir the frigate was nearly a mile away with the next headland already reaching out to hide her it would take her captain most of the day to claw offshore to beat back again and attack at leisure but first he intended to try to cripple his small quarry bolitho watched the forward division of guns shoot out their long orange tongues and saw the iron making ripples across the seas face like streaks of light it was a poorly aimed attempt the second one was not the sea boiled and shot skywards alongside and bolitho heard the balls slamming into the lower hull a terrible scream as someone was cut down by splinters hallowes was staring at the chaos torn rigging and punctured sails with blood already trickling down the larboard scuppers anchor damn you bolitho shook his arm you command here so do it two balls hit the cutter together one ploughed a black furrow across the deck and killed a man on the opposite side the other smashed on to the mackereltailshaped stern and blasted several buckets of sand and planking to fragments it was like being punched in the face bolitho fell on his side dazed by the explosion and feeling the ache from his old wound probe through him from the fall men were crying out and he felt the deck shiver as something smashed down from aloft he clawed at his face and felt droplets of blood an unknown voice shouted ere sir ill give e a and bolitho gasped anchor now his voice suddenly loud as the firing stopped he stumbled over an inert body and clung to some dangling ropes here sirthe voice broke off as bolitho dragged his hands from his face and stared round him except that he could see nothing it was noon when the frigate had fired but he was standing in darkness hands touching him voices all round him in wild confusion im here sir it was stayt bolitho covered his eyes as the pain increased im blind oh dear god i cant see he groped out and found stayts arm get me below dont let them see me like this he gasped as the pain mounted i were better killed supreme captain valentine keen clung to the weather netting his eyes raw from staring into sea and wind even his palms felt torn from gripping the tarred nettings to keep his balance all night long the gale had lashed the sea into a fury of leaping crests and great torrents of water which had boiled over the gangways and hurled men from their feet like flotsam now as silvergrey streaked the sky the motion was easier dawn had come to mock their puny efforts there had been no point in trying to keep station on icarus like the little brig rapid she had been out of sight throughout the onslaught argonaute had laid into the wind hoveto under a reefed maintopsail for most of the time if the ships had attempted to remain under sail they would have been scattered miles apart before dawn the first lieutenant staggered towards him i can get her under way again sir keen glanced at the sailingmaster in his sodden tarpaulin coat old fallowfield said nothing but it looked like a shrug very well pipe all hands change the masthead lookouts too well need good eyes today if we are to reform the squadron paget had done well he thought and his voice had kept the men at it from nightfall until now all hands all hands aloft to make sail the yells of the petty officers and here and there the slap of a ropes end drove the battered weary men back to the braces and yards keen tugged at his neckcloth like the rest of him it was sodden from spray and perhaps rain the ship had responded better than he had expected she was as claimed an excellent sailer he was vaguely pleased with his own efforts he had controlled his ship throughout and the men and discipline which drove her the deck trembled as the foretopsail and jib were set and flapping wetly brought the helm under control again tuson would be busy keen had seen several hands injured worse one seaman had been swept overboard a terrible death for anyone to watch the wind driving your ship away your friends unable to help while you drown alone steady she goes sir noreast by east the sky was already clearing it might even be a fine day after the nights fury it was a strange sea keen thought take over the watch mr paget keen rubbed his sore eyes as soon as the galley fire is alight send the hands to breakfast by divisions tell the purser to break out a tot per man theyve earned it paget grinned thatll rouse them sir he turned away obviously pleased to be left in charge with a big sea still running keen decided to mention him in his report he needed a good first lieutenant but the fleet needed those who could command keen walked beneath the poop his figure swaying in the darkness he had not realized he was so tired and under so much strain a scarlet coat loomed through the shadows and he saw captain bouteiller of the ships royal marines waiting for him morning major keen never really understood the marines although he admired them even the term major for the officerincharge seemed odd bouteiller said i thought i should tell you myself sir he had a clipped way of speaking like a piece of equipment the er passenger wishes to speak with you keen nodded i see when was this the marine considered it two hours back sir you were very busy at the time it was too dark to see his face not that bouteiller would give anything away what was he thinking very well thank you keen groped his way to the small door and could almost hear the sentry holding his breath for once guard duty would have been most welcome he thought every other man and boy even the afterguard had been on deck fighting their natural enemy a lantern shuttered low swung from the deckhead and he saw the girl lying on the cot one leg hanging over the side and swaying with the ship as if it was the only part of her alive keen closed the door tuson would definitely not approve he thought very gently he took her ankle and raised her leg towards the cot she was still wearing her shirt and breeches and as a beam of light swung across her face keen thought she looked incredibly young then her eyes were wide open and she stared at him with terror her fingers gripping the shirt to her throat keen did not move and waited the fear like a stormcloud was slowly departing he said i am sorry i only just heard you were asking for me you were asleep i would have gone she pulled herself into a sitting position and peered at him then she reached out and touched his coat and shirt she whispered you are soaking captain even the simple formality tore at keens heart he replied the storm has passed over he watched her fingers on his lapels and wanted to seize them to press them to his lips instead he said were you frightened not as much as the other thing ozzard had told him how he had found her cowering hands pressed to her ears while a seaman had been flogged for insubordination she said such a big ship and yet there were times i thought she would break apart she played with a lapel her lashes lowered i thought you might be worried for me i wanted to tell you i was safe keen said thank you once during the storm he had imagined her beside him in the gale her hair streaming her teeth white while she had laughed had ridden the storm with the ship yes i was worried you are not used to this life despite his guard he pictured the convict ship what she would be like in a storm he knew at once the girl had read the same thought she said i still cannot believe i am safe she looked up her eyes bright and dark in turns as the lantern pivoted round am i safe he saw his hands take hers and hold them she did not protest or pull away nor did she take her eyes from his face tell me please keen said i had hoped to put you ashore at gibraltar as you know now it seems i must wait i sent word with the courier brig the one commanded by sir richards nephew letters will be sent as soon as mine reaches the city maybe you will have to remain aboard until my ship is ordered to malta part of our work here is to protect the convoys in malta i have friends too he found he was pressing her hands in time with his words one thing i do know zenoria he let his voice linger over her name you will not be put aboard any convict vessel i shall see to that she asked quietly all this you do it for me you do not know me sir only what others have told you you have seen me stripped and beaten like some whore her chin lifted but i am not he said i know that she looked past him into the leaping shadows would you care if we were somewhere else in london maybe or where your wife might see us keen shook his head i have never married once i she responded by holding his fingers in hers but you loved somebody keen nodded aye she died it was a long time ago he looked up i cannot explain it but it is real call it fate gods will call it luck if you wish but it is there and it is not imagination some might say that everything is against me he tightened his grip as she made to speak no it must be said i am so much older than you i am a kings officer and my duty lies with my ship until this damned war is won he raised her hands to his mouth just as he had seen himself in his thoughts of her do not laugh at me but hear me i love you zenoria he expected her to pull away or to interrupt but she sat completely still her eyes wide he continued it is like a great weight hoisted from my mind he said it again slowly i love you zenoria he made to rise but she threw her arms round his neck and whispered do not look at me her voice was in his ear i am dreaming it cannot be happening we are both bewitched very gently he prised her away and studied her face the two bright lines of tears on her cheeks then still holding her he kissed each cheek tasting the salt feeling his elation the swift impossible happiness he said do not speak try to sleep now he stood back her hands still in his it is not a dream and i mean what i said his mind rushed on you can come aft for breakfast later on i shall send ozzard he was speaking quickly and he knew it was to prevent her from stopping it here and now he reached the door but her arms were still outstretched as if she was holding on to him outside the little cabin there were two sentries and a marine corporal who was relieving the guard hissing out his orders in a fierce whisper keen nodded to them and said good morning corporal wenmouth i think we have ridden out the storm eh he strode aft and did not see the astonishment on their faces keen entered the stern cabin and stared around at the shadows and at the tossing water beyond the windows he was tingling almost helpless with an excitement he had never known before he threw his hat on to the bench seat and said aloud i love you zenoria with a start he realized that ozzard was watching him from the other screen door his paws folded over his apron ozzard asked politely breakfast sir keen smiled not yet i am expecting er company for that in an hour or so i see sir ozzard made to leave oh i see sir others might be less pleased but keen did not care is everything satisfactory miss ozzard hovered by the table seizing a dish as it slid dangerously towards the edge she turned and looked up at him it was lovely from across the table keen watched her profile as she spoke with ozzard she was beautiful with her hair loose now across her shoulders even the midshipmans shirt could not disguise it she turned and saw him watching her what is it he smiled you i could admire you all day and find something new every minute she looked at her empty plate that is nonsense sir and you know it but she looked flushed perhaps even pleased then she said quickly tell me about your sir richard have you known him long keen listened to her voice so alien here in a mans world yet so right i have served under him several times i was with him when he nearly died of fever she studied his features as if to remember them was that when you lost your love he stared at her yes i did not say so it was written on your face she nodded to ozzard as he removed the plate then said war fighting you have seen so much why must you do it keen glanced round the cabin its what i am i have been at sea since i was a boy it is what i am trained to do and do you never miss your home her eyes were misty again but she seemed quite controlled sometimes when i am on land i want to get back to my ship at sea i think of fields and cattle my brothers both farm in hampshire sometimes i envy them he hesitated he had never spoken like this to anyone she said now i can tell you not to be afraid your words are safe with me overhead feet slapped across the wet planking and near the skylight a man laughed another snapped a reprimand she said you love these men dont you where you lead they will follow he reached across the table the one where he had sat with the other captains give me your hand she offered it they could barely reach one another he said one day we will walk ashore together somewhere somehow but we shall she pushed some hair from her eyes and laughed but her eyes were sad like this i would be some companion for one of the kings officers she squeezed his hand and whispered the kings finest officer keen said i boarded a genoese trader the other day she looked surprised at his change of subject keen added i bought a gown for you i will have my servant bring it to you he felt unsure and clumsy you may not like it or it might not fit but she said softly you are a sweet man captain even to think of it when you have all this to do and i will like it keen ended lamely i have two sisters you see he broke off confused as the sentry beyond the screen doors shouted surgeon sir keen released her hand it felt like being cast adrift guilty he called enter then said i do not wish this to end tuson entered and eyed them impassively his hands looked red as if he had been scrubbing them some breakfast keen waved him to a chair the surgeon gave a wry smile no sir but id relish some strong coffee he looked at the girl how are you today she dropped her eyes i am well sir tuson took a cup from ozzard more than can be said for your companion young millie millie was the jamaican maidservant she seemed to have no other name tuson added i think shed risk fever on the rock rather than go through another storm like last night keen looked up at the skylight as the masthead lookout shouted to the deck tuson said sounds like another ship but he was watching the girl her small hands gripped into fists the quick movements of her breasts keen must have said something she looked different she said to keen is it friend or foe keen restrained himself from getting up and opening the skylight they would come to him when he was needed another lesson bolitho had taught him well he replied both of our ships were sighted an hour ago he watched her mouth while you were asleep she held his gaze i did not go back to sleep tuson pricked up his ears but masked his curiosity the sentry called first lieutenant sir paget entered his coat black with spray the masthead has sighted a sail to the souwest his eyes stayed firmly away from the girl at the table this made his interest all the more obvious keen said southwest without looking at the chart he could picture the other vessels icarus was almost three miles abeam and rapid far ahead little more than a shadow against the murky horizon paget added i went aloft myself sir shes a frenchie ill stake my life on it keen eyed him thoughtfully he was learning more about paget every day paget waited and dropped his shot with great skill shes rigged like us sir sail o the line no doubt about it keen was on his feet unaware that the others were watching him paget with pride at what he had discovered without being ordered tuson with interest as he studied keen as he had bolitho on many occasions weight of command a captains ability determination it was all there only in the girls eyes was there tenderness anxiety too for this other side to keens character she will know what we are about keen paused by the stern windows and pictured the other vessel she is following us reporting our movements to another ship maybe paget said stubbornly shes made no signals sir ive put mr chaytor aloft with a glass hell tell me if he sees any hoists keen walked reluctantly to the chart and wished suddenly bolitho was here the french were using one of their heavy ships even though frigates had been reported argonaute could come about and give chase it might be hopeless it would certainly take a long time with a southerly wind across the starboard quarter he said make a signal to icarus to remain on station in his mind he saw not the ship but the sour face of her captain then signal rapid to close on the flag paget hesitated by the door shall we chase her sir we might catch her if the wind backs a mite further i reckon this shipd outfly anything keen smiled grimly warmed by pagets enthusiasm make the signals then call all hands and set the tgansls after that the royals too paget glanced quickly at the lively crests astern blurred and unreal through the saltcaked glass it was blowing hard to set more canvas just yet but his captain seemed to hold no doubts the door closed and moments later the shrill calls and the stampede of feet made the ship stir herself yet again tuson asked shell run wont she sir keen brought his mind back to the cabin ive no doubt he smiled im a poor host what did you come to see me about tuson stood up and swayed to the slope of the deck news of last nights injuries sir ten in all broken bones mostly it could have been far worse not for the wretch who went outboard but thank you they are in good hands i think you know how i appreciate your presence amongst us tuson walked to the door in his plain dark coat with his white hair hanging neatly over his collar he looked more like a cleric than a ships surgeon he never drank keen had seen his eyes on some of the others when they had been filling their glasses something terrible must have happened in his past the door closed and he said quietly a good man they faced each other across the table she spoke first i will leave she looked at her bare feet small against the checkered canvas i saw you just now the man the one who cried out aboard that ship after the whip had cut my back the one who comforted me and now who insists he loves me she walked round the table her slim figure angled to the deck what will become of us he waited until she had walked up to him and said i will make you love me he shut his mind to a cry from the masthead that must be chaytor the second lieutenant shes making more sail sir so the french ship was in pursuit did not want to lose them she reached up and laid her palm on his cheek when he made to hold her she said quickly no not like this she held her hand to his face for several seconds her eyes never leaving his then she said i shall go now she sounded reassured satisfied by what she had discovered if ozzard can take me keen nodded his mouth quite dry do not forget she turned by the door and looked at him that would be impossible ozzard opened the door and she was gone keen walked round the cabin touching things seeing none of them then he paused by the new highbacked chair and smiled at it what would he have done then he went on deck and saw paget and the officerofthewatch studying the braced yards and the set of every sail the great mainyard was bending like some huge bow even the master glanced at him with some apprehension a midshipman called rapids acknowledged sir he saw keen and fell into a confused silence keen gripped his hands together beneath his coattails and felt suddenly chilled lieutenant chaytor yelled shes set more sail sir keen looked at paget shorten sail if you please take in the main course he saw something like relief on their faces keen watched icarus responding her sails being fisted to the yards as she followed the flagships example minutes dragged past perhaps he was wrong suppose the french captain wanted to close and fight two to one but it could happen he let out his breath very slowly as the masthead called shes shortening sail sir keen walked to the foot of the mizzen and touched the boarding pikes which were racked around its fat trunk that frenchman wants me to turn and go after him hes goading me it is what he expects of me the realization was still a shock he said as soon as rapid is close enough tell her to make all sail and find supreme quarrell will have noted the first landfall on his chart paget watched him guardedly aware of keens sharpness his change of mood tell him that our admiral must know we are being followed but not pursued there is no time to write him separate orders the same chill swept through him the french captain expected him to begin a chase it would divide their force even further the realization made him feel pale he added tell rapid to make haste as soon as quarrell understands we shall set all plain sail he glanced at the masts and added even if we tear the sticks from her later in the stern cabin again keen heard paget repeating his orders his voice booming through a speakingtrumpet rapid would live up to her name he felt suddenly anxious and when he looked at bolithos chair it was with the thought it might remain empty for ever bolitho sat on the side of a low bunk in supremes tiny cabin it was stiflingly hot between decks and he knew it must be evening someone squeezed through the door and said getting dark sir bolitho reached out and seized his arm it was hallowes he sounded beaten and subdued so much so that he had not noticed what he had said bolitho thought despairingly he touched the damp bandage across his eyes perhaps it will always be dark for me why the sudden fear he should have expected something like it to happen god knew he had seen enough good men struck down but like this he said tell me what youre doing there was a bite in his tone and he knew it was to crush his own selfpity during the afternoon hallowes had tried to recover one of the boats a strong swimmer had volunteered to go out for it it was maddening for hallowes to see both of his boats drifting in the distance out of reach and unconcerned it was strange but men who could swim well were rare in the navy this one had got only twenty yards when a solitary musket shot from the shore had killed him there had been a great groan from the watching seamen as their messmate threw up his arms and vanished a pink cloud rising above him the french sailors who had been landed earlier must be still there watching the cutter and waiting for their own ship to recover them hallowes said tightly ive had all the guns loaded with grape and canister sir well give a good account of ourselves when those devils come at us bolitho released his hold and sank back against the curved hull the sobs and cries had all but finished seven men had been killed in that brief mauling one the diminutive midshipman named duncannon had died lying across bolithos lap he had felt the boy sobbing quietly his tears mixing with his blood bolitho said help me on deck wheres my flaglieutenant here sir stayt had been with him and he had not known the realization made him suddenly angry they had all depended on him now they were losing heart so fast they would have no fight in them despite what hallowes thought he said put more swimmers over the side if we can get the boats we might kedge supreme closer to the headland there are rocks there wed be safer from that damned frigate aye sir hallowes sounded doubtful ill see to it right away he hurried away and stayt murmured ready sir bolitho stood up carefully to avoid the deckhead every time he moved the pain in his eyes returned stinging like fire pricking them into torment he held stayts arm and felt the mans pistol bump against him the frigate had left them alone prepared to wait until nightfall they were in no hurry it would have been different if they had known they had the english admiral almost in their hands bolitho winced as his eyes stung with emotion a useless helpless admiral on deck it felt clammy although a steady breeze slapped wavelets along the hull like catspaws stayt whispered hes had them all keep down sir behind the bulwarks they all seem to be armed good bolitho moved his head from side to side he could smell the land could picture it in his mind what a place to die he thought like the young midshipman the hill lookout all the others he had not even known he heard okes resonant voice and sheaffe answering wheres my coxn bankart was right behind him present sir if only allday were here bolitho held his bandaged eyes in his palms no allday had done and suffered enough hallowes said in a hushed voice the swimmers are here sir sheaffe sounded very near im going sir richard i learned when i was a child bolitho held out his hand here take my hand he said i was taught early too somehow he had known it would be sheaffe listen to me when you reach the boat either of them no matter i want you to stay there drop a stream anchor if you will its shallow enough who is with you the seamans name was moore he had a soft kentish dialect like thomas herrick bolitho thought desperately keep together sheaffe asked but why must we stay out there bolitho wanted to tear the bandages from his face it was a nightmare and he felt the urge to scream as the pain probed his eyes again what can you see bolitho moved towards the bulwark and grated his knee against a gun truck stayt touched his left shoulder the headlands that way sir then as you turn slowly right theres the bluff on the other side of the bay where the frigate first appeared yes yes bolitho gripped a belayingpin rack he could see it he remembered it just those last moments before he had been cut down the french will come around the headland he moved his face what say you mr okes okes replied most like sir theyll be closer to their bloody beg pardon sirto their friends ashore my thought exactly he touched the midshipmans bare back the flesh felt icy like a corpse off you go take care both of you as they moved away bolitho said no heroics when you see boats on the move yell out he heard them splash down the side and he half expected a shot to follow is it very dark he felt so helpless like a child in the night aye sir no moon as yet when they reach the first boat he had almost said if be ready we shall see nothing but if sheaffe can see the french coming we shall open fire hallowes asked shoot blind sir he stammered im sorry sir that was stupid of me bolitho reached out again and touched his coat no but that is exactly what we shall do stayt said in a low voice the frogs will follow the coastline and expect to get between us and the beach once alongside they could overwhelm us its what i would do bolitho gripped his sword and let it fall into its scabbard again even that seemed to mock his helplessness how could he tell belinda he could not face being a prisonerofwar again he would die first hallowes asked if they board us bolitho said quietly fire the ship he felt his words rip into the young lieutenant like canister he added there is no easy way lieutenant the enemy must not take your supreme as a prize he pulled him closer so that the others were excluded strike if you must to save the people but sink the ship he let his words sink in when hallowes spoke again his voice was changed firm determined ill not let you down sir bolitho turned away to hide his agony i knew that when i recommended your appointment oh belinda the foolish things i said and wrote now it is all too late he thought of keen and knew he would command the squadron in his own way he would fly an admirals flag one day bolitho gasped so god help him a man murmured i eard somethin another said an oar in a boat hallowes said theyve got one of the boats sir bolitho thought of sheaffes unsmiling features his father would be proud of him or would he did he even envy his son as he did leaders like nelson bolitho rested his head in his hands hell not have to envy me any more the cry came across the water and seemed to hang above the gently swaying deck like an echo sheaffes seen em there was a single shot and someone jeered couldnt hit a bloody barn door stayt said by god that fool with the musket has marked down their position well enough sir he sounded excited ready to kill as keen had described him aboard the convict ship theyre still coming stayt must be crouching down eyes level with the bulwark to seek out the dark shapes on the water three boats at least sir voices murmured along the deck and okes rumbled not a bloody squeak out of any mothers son right bolitho heard the metallic clink of a swivel gun being depressed and here and there a handspike squeak as a fourpounder was made snug against the side each little muzzle pointing blindly into the darkness bolitho said bankart come here he felt the young seaman beside him as allday would have been i shall use you as my eyes to stayt he added go forrard and take charge of the focsle be ready to cut the cable if need be he heard stayt move away and felt suddenly lost without him he thought of the girl keen had brought to the flagship the look in his eyes whenever he mentioned her name if argonaute was called on to fight she might still be aboard the pain pricked his eyes again as like an additional torment another memory came to him called on to fight cheney had been aboard his ship when the decks had thundered to the roar of broadsides cheney ready lads hallowes was drawing his sword his face hidden in the darkness as was his despair as you bear bolitho leaned forward he had heard the splash of oars fire the night exploded surrender or die the whiplash bangs of supremes fourpounders were deafening hemmed in by the land the explosions echoed from every side as if two ships were engaged in battle bolitho gripped bankarts arm tell me bankart winced as the packed charges of grape and canister smashed into the leading boat like an iron flail it was just possible to see the leaping feathers of white spray the sudden glare of an exploding lantern before the darkness shut down again hallowes yelled easy lads sponge out and reload bolitho cocked his head and heard someone screaming others shouting and thrashing in the water it had been a lucky broadside and must have completely destroyed one of the boats a solitary voice was shouting commands and bankart whispered th boats is splittin up sir okes growled pity they dont try to rescue their mates wed ave got them too in the next broadside he meant it all loaded sir fire gun by gun the shots crashed out and men retched and coughed as the smoke funnelled inboard bolitho clutched his bandage he had seen some flashes through it not much like lightning through a curtain it was something a few musket shots whined overhead and one hit the hull half dazzled by the guns the officers and lookouts were now finding it hard to locate the enemys boats bolitho said what do you see bankart replied one o th boats is ead on sir comin straight for us starboard bow bolitho grasped his fingers around his sword until the pain steadied him around him he heard men whispering to one another the hiss of steel as cutlasses were drawn boarding pikes handed to the gun crews fire as you bear again and again the fourpounders blasted the night apart the grape ripping across the water like lethal hail but none found a mark bankart said excitedly i saw th frogs boat in the flashes sir bolitho twisted his head where were the others repel boarders hallowes cheered like a madman like the time when he and adam had boarded the argonaute at em supremes bolitho heard the thud of grapnels screams rising seemingly at his feet the rasp of steel and several shots from friends or enemies he could not tell a man cannoned into him and bankart dragged at bolithos arm back sir that ones done for a voice yelled port quarter lads bolitho gritted his teeth as more shots clanged around him as he had expected he heard a boat crash into the stern the yells and curses of boarders and defenders alike as they came to grips with blades axes and pikesthere was not time to reload he was pushed aside and two figures fought one another with bolitho pressed against the bulwark at any second he expected to feel the slashing agony of a blade or the thrust of one into his body a man screamed almost in his face he could feel his terror his pain before a sickening thud silenced him how often had allday protected him like that had driven his cutlass into a mans head like an axe into a log he exclaimed thank you bankart stayt said between gasps its me sir thought you looked surrounded so to speak a pistol exploded at waistheight and stayt said savagely take that you bugger theyre falling back someone raised a cracked cheer and bolitho heard men tumbling into a boat others hurling themselves into the water to escape the maddened english seamen okes bellowed stand aside you booby let me at that swivel bolitho heard the thrash of oars he knew that if he could see he would be looking down on one of the french boats right alongside stayt pulled his arm here we go the swivel gun gave a tremendous crack for a split second beforehand bolitho thought he heard someone scream pleading perhaps as he realized what okes intended stayt said quietly there cant be a man left alive there bolitho could barely hear him his ears still cringing from the last explosion a whistle shrilled and he heard hallowes shout cease firing then with a break in his voice well done my supremes stayt said weve lost a few not too many though silence on deck the sudden quiet was almost worse bolitho heard some of the wounded gasping and sobbing how would they manage without a surgeon then he heard the distant splash of oarsso there had been another boat maybe several but for sheaffes warning they would have swamped the cutters defences no matter what it cost them unable to contain themselves the seamen cheered and cheered again bolitho felt the pain returning and wanted to lay his head in his hands but somehow he knew stayt was watching him get lieutenant hallowes for me he fought back the need to cry out and asked between gasps wheres bankart over his shoulder stayt said casually gone somewhere sir it was all he said hallowes arrived and knelt beside bolitho i am here sir bolitho felt for his shoulder that was bravely done hallowes said huskily but for my men bolitho shook him gently because they respect you you led they responded in the only way they know hallowes did not speak for several seconds and bolitho could guess why in victory and defeat he had known emotion more than many hallowes was just discovering the pride as well as the pain of command hallowes said theyll be back not tonight too costly thanks to sheaffe hallowes sounded as if he was grinning your idea sir with respect bolitho shook his shoulder he seemed to need a physical contact without it he felt completely cut off a burden call him alongside we may need that boat he heard the insane bellow of supremes copper foghorn and wondered what sheaffe and his companion had thought as the fight had exploded on board the cutter stayt came back and helped bolitho to seat himself with his back against a small companionway everyone was talking friends seeking out friends others sitting in silence remembering a messmate who had been killed or badly wounded bolitho knew they would not survive in daylight when the frigate came for them after their bloody repulse the french would be out for revenge and give no quarter he felt the other officers standing or squatting near him hallowes was in command what would he do hallowes asked what would you advise sir bolitho held his eyes again hating the spectacle he must present to these men we must try to break out hallowes sounded relieved i was going to suggest that sir strangely enough in that brief angry fight during which he had not even been a spectator bolitho had lost all sense of direction the headland the bluff at the end of the bay even the rocks seemed all jumbled together mr okes okes belched and bolitho smelled rum he had been having a wellearned wet as allday would call it the thought touched off stayts words what had happened to bankart he was close by now he had heard him several times was it fear everyone was afraid in a fight but he thought of allday and tried to shut it from his mind like something foul and unclean okes rambled on unperturbed by his murderous attack with the swivel with the capns permission ill send the boat for tother one we could warp supreme clear i think the wind as backed not greatly but this beauty dont need that much hallowes said see to it mr okes and thank you okes strode off and bolitho pictured his thick legs in their white stockings when he had shot down the running frenchman he said that man is worth a pot of gold stayt said the others have gone sir bolitho laid back and tried to ignore the pain to think of something which might distract him but it was hopeless if anything it was getting worse and stayt knew it the flaglieutenant said quietly we could parley with the french sir their surgeon might be able to help bolitho shook his head vehemently until stayt said i felt i should speak out sir ill not mention it again he stood up and leaned over the bulwark to stare at the blacker mass of land it was spoiled now the smell of blood and gunpowder was too strong he considered bolithos driving almost fanatical determination if only he could sleep and escape from his pain a voice called the two boats are comin sir bolitho stirred and exclaimed your hand get me up stayt sighed perhaps the strength which was holding bolitho together was what they all clung to they would soon know there was something unreal about the way supremes weary company set to and prepared to weigh anchor bolitho remained by the companionway and tried to picture the cutters deck as with barely a word of command the seamen went to their stations below the long bowsprit the two boats were already in position with extra hands to throw their weight on the oars if the cutter looked about to go aground leadsmen whispered together on the forecastle and behind his back bolitho heard okes rumbling to the helmsmen at the tiller bar while hallowes attended to the shakenout sails bolitho heard someone cursing that a french ball had ripped a hole through the topsail big enough for two men he tried to remain calm as he felt figures brush past him as if he barely existed a petty officer called in a hushed voice anchors hove short sir bolitho shivered as a warm breeze rattled the loose rigging and made the deck tilt as if supreme was eager to get away hallowes had told him that the nearest beach was about half a cable away the french were bound to have left men there they would soon know what hallowes was trying to do okes said stand by hallowes called ready two more men on the larboard braces anchors aweigh sir bolitho craned forward and tried to put a picture to every new sound the anchor being winched home and made fast to its cathead loose or severed lines being flung aside to leave the deck clear almost the whole company was now employed either in the boats or in the business of making sail when required if they had to fight they would be lucky if they could loose off a single gun in time okes hissed helm down boy the tiller creaked and bolitho heard a sail slap impatiently as the wind plucked at it a man cried out with shrill urgency but his voice was muffled far away and bolitho knew he was one of the badly wounded who had been carried below to die the cry rose to a higher pitch and bolitho heard a seaman hauling on a halliard nearby utter a terrible curse urging this unknown sailor to die and get it over with the cry stopped as if the man had heard the curse for him at least it was over let er pay off okes raised his voice as the cutter gathered way and the oars of the two boats ahead of her thrashed the sea like wings the lines would be lifting from the water as the gig and jollyboat took the strain of the two they had steerage way not much but okes sounded breathless confident good warmly done lads hallowes said we have to use whatever passage we can sir bolitho had not heard him approach hallowes continued ive a party by the anchor to let go if we get into trouble he seemed to chuckle more trouble that is stayt asked how long hallowes said as long as it takes bolitho pictured him looking everywhere as his command edged painfully ahead at a walking pace the pumps thudded and creaked and bolitho guessed that supreme had been badly damaged and was taking a lot of water the leadsman called by th mark five bolitho recalled when he had been about twelve and in his first ship like little duncannon he thought too young to die but he remembered watching the leadsmen sounding their way through a sea mist off lands end while the upper yards and wet sails of the big eightygun manxman had been out of sight from the deck skilled seamen like those who were sounding now their hard fingers feeling the marks on their lines or guessing the depths in between deep six that was plenty of water for the cutter even with her bilges filling from several shot holes the french would know now bolitho thought not that they could do much about it the clank of pumps and the occasional cry from the leadsman would mark their slow and precarious passage better than anything stayt waited for hallowes to go aft and said she may be small sir but in these waters she feels like a leviathan there was a splash alongside and bolitho knew it was the dead seaman being dropped overboard no prayer no ceremony to mark his brief passing but if they lived through this he would be remembered even by the ones who had cursed his reluctance to die bolitho cupped his bandaged eyes in his fingers and shook as more pain tested his resistance it came in waves slashing down his defences like a bears paw how could he go on like this what would he do by th mark seven the other leadsman called sandy bottom they had primed their leads with tallow which would pick up tiny fragments from the seabed anything helped when you were feeling your way bolitho dragged his hands down to his sides like a blind man hallowes was speaking with okes again i think we might recover the boats and make sail eh mr okes okes answered but bolitho could not hear but he sounded doubtful thank god hallowes was not stupid enough to ignore okes skill he said very well the deck leaned slightly and he added brightly the wind is backing by god luck is with us for a change after an hour which felt like an eternity the gig fell back and there was a quick change of crew the returning hands were utterly exhausted and fell to the deck like dead men even okess promise of rum did not move them next it was the jollyboat and bolitho heard sheaffe speaking to the supremes only masters mate the midshipman came aft and said i have reported back sir it sounded so formal so empty of what the youngster had done that bolitho forgot about his own pain and despair that was a fine piece of work mr sheaffe but for you we would have been swamped by the enemy he heard sheaffe dragging on his shirt his teeth chattering it was not the night air it was the sudden realization the shock of what he had carried out go and rest youll be needed again before long sheaffe hesitated and then sat on the deck near bolitho he said if this does not disturb you sir bolitho looked towards his voice your company is welcome believe me he leaned against the companionway and tried not to anticipate the next wave of pain sheaffe had his knees drawn up to his chin and was instantly asleep bankart crouched down and whispered ive brought you some wine sir he waited for bolithos fingers to grip the goblet mr okes sent it bolitho sipped it strong rich madeira he drank it slowly let it run through him restore him he could not remember when he had last eaten perhaps that was why the wine seemed so potent he touched his face below the bandage several cuts and some dried blood he needed a shave badly he tried to smile allday would soon see to that big and powerful like an oak yet he was as gentle as a child when need be both bolitho and keen had good reason to remember it what is it like to discover your father bankart the question seemed to shock him well its fine sir it really is like my motherd never tell me ysee sir i always knew e were in the navy sir that was why you volunteered there was a long pause i suppose it were sir bankart poured him another goblet of wine and when sheaffe was roused to take charge of the jollyboat again and take up the tow bolitho barely stirred okes left his helmsmen and walked over to the companionway he was satisfied with what he saw hallowes asked is he asleep at last okes fumbled with a red handkerchief and blew his nose loudly aye sir so e should arter what i put in is madeira bolitho felt a hand on his arm and twisted round with sudden fear as his senses returned stayt said first light sir bolitho touched his bandage and tried not to show his pain how do i look stayt sounded as if he was smiling ive seen you somewhat better sir he took bolithos hand ive got a bowl of warm water and a towel of sorts bolitho nodded grateful and ashamed as he dabbed his mouth and face with the wet towel such a simple thing and it was unlikely that stayt realized how it had moved him tell me whats happening stayt thought about it i reckon were about a mile from where we set out sir he sounded neither bitter nor even surprised were in some shallows at the moment he broke off as the leadsman called by th mark three bolitho forgot his pain and dragged himself to his feet three fathoms of water and a mile from their last anchorage he felt the wind on his cheek and heard the splash of boats as his head rose above the bulwark one of the coxswains was calling out the time for the stroke the oarsmen must be worn out he thought is it really light stayt said i can see that bluff sir and just make out the horizon skys a bit angry could be in for a blow im thinking hallowes was calling rouse the hands im going to make sail okes replied no choice sir them boats are useless now the deck lifted on a swell and bolitho felt a catch in his throat the open sea was waiting for them the cranking pumps the tattered sails nothing would stop them once they found sea room room to bustle in stayt was watching him and saw him give a small smile hallowes said recall the boats be ready to shake out the mainsl get the topmen to report on damage now that they can see it he was speaking quickly sharply bolitho had known such moments many times covering doubts and uncertainties to show confidence when there was little a call shrilled and someone gave a mocking cheer as the lines to the boats were slacked off and the oarsmen slumped over their looms by th mark five hallowes rubbed his hands well show em who bolitho wondered men charged past him hauling on tackles as first one boat and then the other was hoisted into position on the tier the cutter seemed to stir herself and bolitho wished he could watch as men swarmed to their stations somewhere overhead a sail cracked out noisily in the damp air shallows ahead fine on the starboard bow hells teeth hallowes yelled stand by to let go the anchor okes said in a harsh whisper belay that sir well swing round an strike if we does hallowes sounded confused if you believe but okes was already acting and thinking let er come up a point steady as she goes he must have cupped his hands bolitho thought as his voice boomed along the deck set the jib thomas here we go again stayt sounded dangerously cool shallows the lookout said i can see breakers for christs sake he added forgive me sir i am not used to this bolitho lifted his chin as if to see some light beneath his bandage there was only darkness nor i okes barked now lee helm bolitho heard several shouts and a clatter of rigging as with a fierce jerk supreme surged into a bar gear torn loose in the onesided fight rolled about the deck and a fourpounder reared up on its trucks as if it had come to life the grinding shaking motion continued for what seemed like an age with okes coaxing his helmsmen or throwing an occasional instruction to his petty officers the shaking stopped and after a while a voice called pumps are still holding it sir stayt said between his teeth a damned miracle there were rocks an arms length abeam but we hit only sand deep six the leadsman must have been nearly hurled from his precarious perch bolitho thought but they were through loose tops once in open water nothing could catch the cutter even with her damaged hull men were calling to one another the fear and the danger forgotten or put aside for this moment in their lives stayt said our surgeon will know what to do sir as soon as we sight he broke off and gasped it cant be the lookout called sail sir fine on th weather bow bolitho heard stayt murmur its the frigate sir bolitho was almost glad he could not see their stricken faces the french captain had not been so overconfident that he had waited around the headland while hallowes men had toiled at their oars the frenchman had spent his night clawing to windward and towards the bluff where he had first appeared now he held the windgage and was sweeping down on them with only his braced topsails visible against the dawn horizon bolitho did not need stayt to describe it he could see the hopelessness of it as if he were seeing it through hallowes eyes another mile and they could have lifted their coattails and run from the frigates guns but they were still on a lee shore despite the change of wind and the two vessels were converging on some invisible rendezvous no escape this time hallowes shouted run up the colours thomas have the guns loaded and run out as men ran to obey bolitho was conscious of the other silence no yells or threats certainly not a cheer men facing certain death could still work well but their minds would be elsewhere seeking refuge with a memory which moments ago had been a hope bankart present sir go below and fetch my coat and hat filthy and bloody but he was still their admiral and would be damned if they should see him already beaten crashcrashcrash the frigate was already firing some of her forward guns balls hurled waterspouts into the air or ricocheted across the sea in short fierce spurts bolitho heard okes murmur will you fight sir would you have me strike hallowes sounded calm or was he beyond that more shots made the air quiver and bolitho heard a ball crash down close by the water tumbling across the weather shrouds like lead shot bring her up a point mr okes hallowes was drawing his sword bolitho touched his own and wondered what would become of it he would fling it into the sea if he was given time and life to do so another series of bangs made stayt swear under his breath and a ball slapped through a sail and parted a stay like a piece of cotton on the uproll stayt said fiercely hes no chance sir most of his popguns wont even bear yet bolitho said it is his way there is nothing else now fire the air cringed as the fourpounders recoiled inboard on their tackles their explosions almost blanketed as the frigate fired yet again the deck jumped and wood splinters flew over the cowering gun crews then a second salvo tore overhead and a man fell kicking and screaming into the sea alongside supreme was moving so fast despite her torn canvas that the man was soon lost far astern how is it now stayt said tonelessly lighter sir he winced as more balls slammed close alongside and one hit the bows with a terrible jerk torn rigging drifted down from aloft and trailed from the spars like shabby banners the gun crews did not look up but sponged out rammed home fresh charges and tamped down their shot because it was what they were trained to do if necessary until death itself more shots struck the hull and bolitho said she cant take much more sail to leerd sir men gaped at each other not understanding unable to judge anything in the earshattering din of cannon fire stayt shouted its rapid sir he almost shook bolithos arm shes catching the sun right now sir shes hoisted a signal by god the squadron must be here another explosion rocked the deck and men screamed as splinters scythed them down it must have been a full broadside for someone yelled with disbelief the frenchies goin about the bastards are runnin for it you showed em capn but stayt said bitterly hallowes is down sir he took bolithos arm that last bloody broadside take me to him the seamen had been cheering at this impossible intervention but now fell silent as their blind admiral was led aft to where hallowes was being held by okes and the masters mate bolitho murmured how bad is it stayt swallowed hard both his legs sir bolitho was guided to hallowes side hallowes said in a strong voice i didnt strike given the chance he broke off and cried out help me then mercifully he died bolitho had been holding his hand and felt it die he lowered it to the deck and said given the chance that was the measure of this mans courage he was helped to his feet and turned to where he knew okes was waiting supreme is yours mr okes youve more than earned her and ill see that your appointment is confirmed if it is the last order i give rapid is heavingto sir that was stayt but that was all part of something else it did not seem to belong here there was only this moment and the pain take good care of her ii will sir its just that i didnt want didnt expect bolitho tried to smile it is your moment now mr okes seize it he felt the pain grinding into his eyes again and knew they were all watching him he said never fear mr okes supreme has a fine new commander and she will fight again okes stared after him as stayt and sheaffe guided the bandaged admiral to the bulwark then he said brokenly aye sir an please god so will you the fire still burns as argonaute s anchor cable took the strain men were already hoisting out boats while others were mustered into a landing party icarus had dropped anchor too and even without a telescope keen could see the busy activity on her upper deck and gangway the island looked so peaceful he thought it would be sunset in an hour and he needed to get a landing force of royal marines ashore with another detachment from houstons ship in case any french were still present he removed his hat and rubbed his forehead could so much have happened in a single day he looked across at the anchored brig rapid with the listing and scarred cutter lashed alongside why had he sent rapid to find bolitho instinct a sense of danger it had almost been too late perhaps it was too late he thought of her young commander as he had described the scene the frigate turning away when one more broadside would have finished what she had begun quarrell had said simply in his isle of man dialect i knew i couldnt fight the frenchie sir so i hoisted enemy in sight as sir richard once did and the enemy took the trick as fact and made off but for it supreme and my own command would have been on the bottom his voice hardened i would not have hauled down my colours with the admiral out there watching us no more than poor john hallowes did keen recalled the shock when he had seen bolitho being hoisted up the side on a boatswains chair something he would always refuse even in bad weather the whole ship had held her breath or so it seemed keen had wanted to run across to take hold of him but some last warning had told him that for bolitho the moment of return had almost broken him it fell to allday who had stepped past the marines and watching officers to take bolithos elbow and say in an almost untroubled voice welcome aboard sir we was a mite worried but now youre back so theres an end to it as they had walked past keen had seen alldays face and had known his demeanour was a lie all day they had continued to the watering place with the squadrons surgeons aboard supreme doing what they could keen gripped the nettings and stared at the streaks of coralcoloured cloud calm storm gale and bright sunlight it changed like the pages in a book paget joined him and touched his hat shall we rig awnings sir no we will begin to take on water tomorrow at first light i want no i need to be out of this place quickly i intend to join the squadron without delay my bones tell me that things are moving fast paget eyed him doubtfully but chose his words with care nearly everyone knew how the captain felt about bolitho he said it may be serious sir if he is blind keen swung on him angrily damn you how would you know he relented just as swiftly that was unforgivable i am tired but so is everyone else he nodded i know it must be faced as soon as supreme is ready i will send her south to malta her wounded can be cared for i shall make my report for the admiral there he will be concerned about his convoys no doubt he glanced at pagets impassive face he is wondering if i am going to put her aboard for malta but paget said it is a bitter blow keen turned away call me when the royals are ready to leave he hurried aft past the immobile sentry it was like a group painting stayt still in his stained coat sitting on the stern bench with a goblet between his fingers ozzard slowly polishing the table which did not need it and allday standing quite motionless as he stared at the old sword which he had returned to its rack yovell was slumped by bolithos charts keen glanced at the sleeping compartment and thought of the girl in there with tuson the surgeon had asked for her to assist him he did not explain why when keen had gone to her she had exclaimed of course i had no idea what had happened no tears not a trace of hesitation she had been in there for most of the day keen asked anything stayt made to rise but keen waved him down the flaglieutenant replied wearily i think the bandage is replaced sir there were splinters as well as sand he sighed i fear the worst keen took a glass from ozzard and swallowed it quickly it could have been brandy or beer he was too concerned to notice it would be up to him to decide what to do the other captains would obey but would they trust him it might take an age before supreme reached malta or they joined with the other ships of the squadron how could bolitho remain here suffering and fretting destroying himself with each agonizing day to send him to malta would mean losing another ship it was brutal but a fact which bolitho would have been the first to emphasize the sentry called officerofthwatch sir even his voice was hushed the lieutenant hovered in the doorway first lieutenants respects sir i am to inform you that the boats are ready signal from icarus sir asking permission to proceed at any other time keen would have smiled captain houston was always trying to be a jump ahead of the flagship but not this time signal icarus to await orders he saw the lieutenant flinch and tried again i am sorry mr phipps my compliments to the first lieutenant and i shall come up in a moment the youthful lieutenant had been a midshipman in keens achates keen eyed him sadly yes it is true about lieutenant hallowes he died bravely im assured i know you were his friend the exmidshipman withdrew he was still too young to shrug off grief and it showed boys all boys keen realized he had spoken aloud he said i shall return as soon as the boats are gone come for me if you hear anything he glanced at alldays broad shoulders anything at all stayt stood up and walked to the door the same for me allday turned slowly and looked at his companions i should have been there with him ysee yovell took off his glasses there was nothing you could have done man allday was not hearing him by is side like always i must speak with my lad about it ozzard said nothing but polished all the harder allday said he should have let me kill that bloody mounseer up there on deck when i had the chance he spoke so quietly it was all the more fearful to watch him yovell suggested have a tot of rum allday shook his head when its over when i know then ill drink a bloody keg of it bolitho lay very still in the cot his arms at his sides he was not relaxed and every muscle in his body seemed to be stretched taut how long was it everything merged and overlapped in his mind the cutter the sounds from the wounded then being half carried into a boat and a voice he thought he recognized saying attention in the boat there what a sight he must have been then more hands some gentle others less so as he was hoisted into a boatswains chair and hauled up the ships side like a piece of cargo tuson had spoken only to identify himself and had got to work with his examination they had cut away his clothes and someone had dabbed and cleaned his face and throat before applying something to the scars which stung like nettles tuson had left the dressing until last feet had moved round the cot and bolitho had felt the edge of his scissors clipping carefully at the bandage he had asked what time is it the surgeon had answered severely please desist from talking sir then tuson had said hold that mirror thats right i want you to reflect the sunlight from the open port when i say so it was only then that bolitho had realized that the girl was there helping tuson he had made to protest but she had touched his face her hand surprisingly cool easy sir youre not the first man ive seen the bandage had come away and bolitho had almost cried out as tusons strong fingers had probed around his eyes and rolled up the lids it was agonizing and he heard the girl exclaim youre hurting him hes already hurt now girl the mirror bolitho had felt the sweat running down his chest and thighs like a fever as the pain scraped into his very sockets it had been a blurred jumbled nightmare punctuated by sharp raw probes from some instrument the girl had stood beside the cot with the mirror and another held his head firmly like a vice as the torture continued bolitho had tried to blink but could not feel his eyelids move but there was light red and pink and shadows which he knew were people tuson had said enough the light faded as the mirror was removed then a new bandage had been carefully tied it had been soft and damp and after the probing and the pain it was almost soothing that must have been several hours ago twice more the bandage had been removed and changed with more agonizing manipulation and some oily liquid which had at first made his eyes sting worse than before then the pain had eased when he had asked tuson about the liquid tuson had said offhandedly something i picked up in the indies sir useful at times like these really bolitho listened to the girls voice it made him think of falmouth and the thought made his eyes smart all the more she said i dont know how you can work in this light sir tuson replied its far better than im used to he rested his hand on bolithos arm you must rest a sheet was pulled over his nakedness and tuson added i see that you have gained a few honourable scars for king and country sir to the girl he said youd better go and get some food inside you ill come if you need me sir bolitho raised an arm over the cot and turned his head towards the door she came to him and took his hand in hers sir bolitho barely recognized his own voice i just want to thank youshe squeezed his hand after what youve done for me she seemed to run from the cabin and tuson said heavily fine girl bolitho lay back in the cot and pictured the deckhead as he had seen it each morning well i cant say sir and thats the truth both eyes are scarred but there is little i can decide until the ruptures heal or bolitho persisted will i see tuson walked round the cot he must be looking through an open gunport bolitho thought for his voice was muffled tuson said the left eye is the worst sand and metal particles your cheek was cut by a sliver of metala bit higher and thered be no eye for us to worry about i see bolitho felt his body relax it was easier somehow when you knew the worst the inevitable truth he thinks im done for bolitho said i must speak with my flagcaptain at once tuson did not move he is busy sir it can wait dont you dare to tell me what can and cannot wait tuson rested his hand on his arm again that is my duty sir bolitho covered the surgeons hand with his own yes my apologies none needed all men are different i once took off a seamans leg and he didnt even whimper then he thanked me for saving his life another damned me to hell for sewing up his head after a fall from aloft i have seen and heard everything from quarterdeck to the lowliest mess he yawned why do we do it why do you do it sir richard you have given so much for your country you must realize the consequences of staying at sea year in and year out there is an inevitability about it which cannot be ignored or silenced death tuson replied there can be worse things than death he added i shall leave you now it seems your captain is here anyway keen sat down beside the cot and asked how is it sir bolitho tried to push his despair into the darkness it was important maybe vital how he replied i saw some light val the pain is less and as soon as i have had a shave i shall be more of a man again keen said thank god bolitho found his arm and thank you val for saving us he clenched his other hand into a fist to contain his emotion tell me what you are doing when tuson returned he found them both in deep conversation he said sternly this must cease gentlemen bolitho held up his hand a moment more you impatient sawbones to keen he said finish watering then and we shall make haste to gather the squadron jobert had tried to scatter our strength destroy our ability to follow his movements like you i feel it is near the time for his next move send yovell to me he heard tuson tutting and ill have my own report sent with supreme almost to himself he said i was with hallowes when he died both legs gone he had promise that one bolitho laid his head on the pillow and tried to move his eyelids beneath the bandage he could hear keen and the surgeon whispering outside the door and suddenly wanted to get out of the cot to go on deck and make as if he was the same as before keen was saying but in truth will he recover and in honesty i do not know i would have said it was hopeless but with him i am not so sure he shook his head hes like a ship in a storm suddenly bent on its own destruction it seems as if nothing can stop him keen saw allday carrying a bowl of hot water and a razor he had heard what tuson had said to bolitho about terrible odds against survival he touched his side and felt the wound beneath his shirt first one then the other now hallowes was gone he hesitated by the little cabin with its scarletcoated sentry then he tapped on the door and stepped inside as she called on him to enter she was sitting on the big chest the gown he had bought from the genoese trader spilled across her lap filling the place with light she looked at him and said quietly it is lovely so good of you you are a kind man she laid it carefully across the cot and stood up she had been crying for bolitho for them he could not tell she said you have done so much and i have nothing to give you she turned away abruptly and when she faced him again he saw that her shirt was unbuttoned to her waist very deliberately she took his hand her eyes fixed on his with a kind of defiance then she pulled it inside her shirt and pressed it to her breast keen did not move and felt the rounded skin beneath his hand burning into him consuming him then she did lower her eyes and said in a small voice that is my heart now i have something to give it is yours for as long as you will it then with equal gravity she withdrew his hand and closed the shirt someone was shouting on the poop and feet clattered on a ladder but for just a few more seconds they stood motionless together then she said go now they must not see us like this he stooped and kissed her lightly on the forehead and then left the cabin for a long while afterwards the girl stood watching the closed door her hand touching her breast as he had done then she said softly indeed i do love thee too in two days the ships had completed taking on fresh water and with a brisk southerly wind to speed their passage they soon left the islands astern keen had watched as supreme her shot holes crudely patched her pumps still cranking had cleared the anchorage and headed for open water at the head of that same beach several of her company had been buried including lieutenant hallowes it was a sad parting keen had thought on the fifth day with rapid in the lead they entered the golfe du lion keen was walking the quarterdeck his chin sunk in his neckcloth and deep in thought when the masthead sighted a sail it was soon identified as barracoutathe squadron would be one again but today was also special for bolitho and down in the cabin he was seated in his highbacked chair breathing deeply as ozzard opened one of the stern windows and his assistant twigg put a cup of coffee in his hand bolitho listened to the sea and the creak of the rudderhead the ship was alive around him he heard allday speaking with yovell ozzard bustling about they were so bright did they think they could deceive him he heard tuson enter the cabin the soft barefooted step of the girl who was with him tuson put down his case and said plenty of light today bolitho nodded we have sighted a ship i believe tuson grunted barracouta sir bolitho tried not to show his dismay keen had not come to tell him even he thought it was over he gripped the arms of the chair and said then captain inch will not be far away he listened to his voice his empty words but he would play their game too not give in to his true thoughts now then tuson moved the bandage slightly and began to unwind it keep your eyes shut until they have been bathed he was breathing hard concentrating so that it was almost physical the bandage went and bolitho was aware of the complete silence around him a warm pad dabbed at his eyelids and for an instant a jab of pain shot through him tuson saw him recoil and said in a moment ill tell you bolitho held out his hand are you here zenoria he felt her grasp his hand between hers he said i want you to be the first one i see not these ugly characters she laughed but he recognized the anxiety tuson said flatly in your own time sir bolitho touched his left eye then his right with his fingers he could feel himself holding her hands so hard he must be hurting her he gritted his teeth together he tried again but was suddenly afraid tuson said now sir if you please bolitho gasped aloud as the eyelids opened it was as if they had been stitched down and were tearing themselves apart vague distorted lights beamed past him from the stern windows shadows too but there was light tuson was ready another soft pad forcing moisture into each eye they stung once more but bolitho saw the pale oval of the girls face the checkered floor covering something shining he craned his head around not caring how he looked straining with desperation as he tried to focus on something familiar then he turned back to the girl who was kneeling by his chair her eyes which he remembered so well were shining up at him and her lips were parted in a smile encouraging him tuson seemed to be behind the chair he put one hand over bolithos left eye bolitho said not too clear yet there will be discomfort but the liquid i am using will clear it eventually now look at the girl sir bolitho could sense the others watching not daring to move he felt his lips cracking into a smile that is a pleasure indeed he saw her flinch under his oneeyed stare but she said bless you sir bolitho whispered my captain is a lucky man tuson placed a hand over his right eye and said remorselessly now the left bolitho blinked rapidly and saw alldays gilt buttons the two swords at his back he whispered allday old friend i he wiped his face as if there was a cobweb across it something like a shadow was covering allday bolitho turned despairingly to the girl again the eyes the mouth and then the shadow moved over her so that she seemed to draw away although he held her hands and knew she had not moved tuson snapped bandage he stooped over bolitho and peered at his eyes early days sir he had tested the right eye first to give him hope tuson had known that the other one was the most badly damaged the disappointment left bolitho spent unprotesting as the bandage brought back the darkness a door opened and he heard keen ask well tuson replied better than i dared to hope sir bolitho said blind in one lamp not too fine in the other val the girl said id better go sir bolitho held out his hand no stay with me keen said the squadron is in sight sir he sounded defeated i shall report to you on the hour bolitho held the girls hand like a lifeline he leaned back in the chair and said if the weather allows val i want all captains to repair on board tomorrow but first signal barracouta to convey inchs report on board directly he had expected keen or certainly tuson to protest their silence brought home the reality more firmly than any words doors opened and closed and then bolitho asked are we alone yes sir bolitho reached out and touched her hair he must speak with his captains they needed leadership not despair jobert would use every weakness like a weapon he felt her move and said softly dont cry my girl you have given too many tears already he continued to stroke her hair soothing himself and unable to see the pity in her eyes then he said you must help me then when i meet my little band tomorrow they will find their viceadmiral not some helpless cripple eh later when a boat brought inchs report to the flagship and keen carried it aft to the great cabin he found bolitho sitting as before but with the girl asleep against his legs keen said i am glad she kept you company sir bolitho touched her hair again but she did not stir you understand dont you val i needed her presence her voice i have become too used to the ways of men the demands of strategy keen let him talk and all the while bolithos hand stroked the girls long hair as she lay curled up at his side bolitho continued in the same empty voice when your day comes to hoist your own flag let nothing distract you i was reluctant to let go of the personal contact when i became an admiral i longed to be a part of whichever ship flew my flag used to think of individual faces and names the people dyou see because i could not stay apart i now blame myself for those who died with supreme all but lost you must not think like that sir bolitho said so when your tune is piped val forget the faces the pain you may cause them he was shouting and the girl opened her eyes and stared up at him then questioningly at keen but i cannot he lowered his head the anger gone from him and it is tearing me apart bolitho took the girls hand go now but please visit me again he held her hand to his lips brave zenoria the door closed and bolitho heard allday escort her to her cabin keen waited feeling useless because he could not help bolitho said open the report val theres work to be done he touched the bandage and added briskly so lets be about it the following morning while the ships lay hoveto in their various angles the captains boarded argonaute as ordered in his cabin bolitho sat facing a mirror and tried to compose his thoughts as he had throughout the night he could not accept what had happened but he had told himself a thousand times he would not submit to it he listened to the shrill of calls as the last captain was piped aboard bolitho smiled bitterly it was more like being an actor than a sea officer should he have done this bravado or necessity he felt different in some way and it was not solely because of a clean new shirt and a careful wash under alldays supervision ready sir tuson always seemed to be there bolitho pressed his hands onto his knees and answered aye the bandage was removed from his right eye the now familiar pad with its sweetsmelling ointment did its work and tuson said with respect sir richard you are a better patient than you were bolitho opened his eyes and stared at his cloudy reflection in the mirror the small scars on his face were less noticeable because of his sunburned skin but the eye glared back at him angry and redrimmed it did not look like the one he could feel in his head he looked beyond the mirror at ozzard carefully brushing his uniform coat with its gleaming epaulettes his best coat it had to be a perfect performance allday craned forward to make certain he had not missed a single stray hair with his razor and yovell was busy with some papers at the table the scene was almost set he raised his eyes and saw the girl looking down over his shoulder she smiled gently like a conspirator which she was she moved a comb over bolithos hair loosening it across his forehead so that it partly covered the other bandage on his left eye she had already arranged his queue and tied a ribbon which even allday admitted was better than anything he could do bolitho heard faint voices and the stamp of feet the captains meeting would be in the wardroom beneath his cabin he had to leave his quarters free for escape if things went wrong he said thank you zenoria you have done your best with poor material their glances met in the mirror she did not reply but he saw the pleasure on her face with her hair tied back again she had a look of determination in her brown eyes bolitho tried to think of inchs report rambling as usual for he loved to write lengthy descriptions of everything no matter how trivial but each report contained something useful this one had an item which was more than that a key perhaps or was it one more sly trap tuson insisted dont overtax the eye sir and most certainly keep the other one covered if you get proper treatment soon bolitho looked at him the eye felt as if there was something in it tuson told him that would pass given time bolitho said your care has been excellent tuson would not be deterred unless you avoid the other demands of this squadron i cannot answer for the consequences the door opened and keen stood watching him his hat beneath his arm bolitho noticed that he too was wearing his best dress coat the second principal player he thought they are assembled sir bolitho glimpsed him in the mirror and saw the quick exchange of glances with the girl who dressed like a boy he saw too how her hand moved to her breast and the look of understanding on keens face bolitho touched his bandage he was glad for them no matter what difficulties lay ahead he was not jealous only conscious of a sense of envy he stood up and adjusted to the roll of the deck the ships layto in a hot southerly breeze from africa it would be good to get this done and be under way again he slipped his arms into the coat and held one up as allday clipped on the old sword allday muttered you watch yourself sir bolitho touched his thick arm and smiled i have work to do i believe i have the makings of a plan he added quietly but thank you old friend he glanced at their faces trying not to blink as his eye pricked painfully and all of you keen felt a chill at his spine he knew that look that voice something neither pain nor a bandage could disguise the fire still burns attack bolitho sat restlessly by his table and watched keens fingers busy with his dividers as he completed some more calculations on the chart several times bolitho had leaned forward to examine his progress and had felt the same rising sense of despair it was like being half blind as for reading the chart it was out of the question he thought of his little squadron so recently met in the golfe du lion and now drawing farther apart with each turn of the glass helicon and despatch had spread all the canvas they could muster and headed for the islands to take on fresh water bolitho frowned and immediately felt a painful response in his left eye when they returned they would stay together as long as possible and wait no longer for jobert to choose the next move inchs report had been excellent he had ordered barracouta to stop and search any coastal vessels he could find and from one he had discovered that two large french menofwar had been seen in spanish waters just beyond the frontier and less than two hundred miles southwest of toulon no wonder few french ships had been sighted by nelsons blockading squadron around the great port this small fragment of news had been like a glimmer of light at the captains conference bolitho had first sensed doubt if not disbelief but although he had been unable to see their faces clearly he had felt his words gaining their attention spain was still an ally of france whether she liked it or not on the face of it you could almost feel sympathy for her for bonaparte had offered her few alternatives he had demanded six million francs a month as a subsidy plus other important assistance to avoid the outrageous ultimatum spain had the choice of declaring war on england once again france had made it clear that a final option was that she would make war on spain if neither alternative was met it seemed unlikely if inchs report was true that jobert would have used spanish waters without instruction from a much higher authority in paris a further move to involve the dons in the conflict bolitho felt uneasy when he recalled the conference it had seemed like an eternity before the captains had returned to their ships how did they see him now undeterred by his injury or had they seen through his pathetic attempt to convince them of his ability to lead lieutenant stayt stepped through the screen door captain lapish is ready for his orders sir very well keen glanced at bolitho and laid down the dividers he knew how loath bolitho was to release his only frigate but if a fight was coming each ship needed to be selfsufficient for as long as possible you could ration gunpowder you could not survive without water as the flaglieutenant withdrew keen said lapish knows what to do i spoke with him when he came aboard he gave a wry smile he is more than eager to make amends i feel when lapish entered bolitho said return to this station as soon as you can he saw him nod but his eyes were smarting from so much use and he could see little of the young captains expression you know what to do lapish said as if repeating a lesson i am to transform my ship into a twodecker before i resume blockade duty sir there was no doubt in his voice but bolitho guessed he probably thought his admiral was not only half blind but unhinged as well bolitho smiled aye use all your spare canvas and hammock cloths it has been done before lashed to the gangways and painted buff with black squares for gunports no one could tell the difference from a third rate at any distance he added forcefully if they come sniffing too close either board or sink them bolitho knew that the lithe frigate would be able to catch up with the two seventyfours complete her watering and still return to the french coast ahead of them once on station she would be seen as one of his squadron it would leave bolitho with a full muster and lapish would be able to discard his crude disguise and run down on him should he sight any enemy movements lookouts friends or enemies usually saw what they expected to see that would leave rapid in a role of paramount importance his only feeler after lapish had been seen into his gig by keen argonaute made sail and with icarus in company altered course to the southwest the two ships sailed in line abreast and thus extended the range of their masthead lookouts rapid was so far ahead that she was barely visible even from the fightingtops keen returned to his chart and explained the frenchmen were sighted around the cabo creus sir an ideal anchorage and less than twenty miles from the frontier with france if they are still there shall we go for them bolitho toyed with the dividers it might provoke spain on the other hand it would show the dons we are prepared to discount their onesided neutrality for once it will put jobert on the defensive the more he considered it the less could he think of an alternative jobert had made all the moves and had nearly succeeded in crippling bolithos squadron he must be provoked into coming out into the open winter would soon be upon them and mediterranean or not the weather would favour the enemy not the ships battling up and down on blockade duty a convoy to malta would be expected within the next few weeks and the enemy would know it from the moment the supply ships anchored briefly at gibraltar their spies would pass on the news of the vessels and probably their cargoes as well there were not enough menofwar available nelson was right about that too bolitho massaged his eye he would probably find the sheltered anchorage empty suppose they met with spanish patrols fight or retreat he said grimly landfall tomorrow val yes sir if he was anxious about the girl being aboard with a prospect of battle he did not reveal it in his voice bolitho said it would be something to show for our setbacks val tit for tat jobert would be out for revenge that is a bad incentive for any flagofficer he turned away and walked to the stern windows it is what i am seeking after keen had gone allday entered and asked is there anything you need sir bolitho immediately sensed the emptiness in his voice whats wrong allday looked at the deck nothin sir bolitho slumped down in his new chair out with it man allday said stubbornly ill keep it battened down if you dont mind sir there was no point in pushing him further allday was like the oak and had deep roots he might tell him in his own time allday took down the beautiful presentation sword and tucked it under his arm he seemed to need something to occupy his mind tuson was the next visitor bolitho had learned to tolerate the surgeons regular treatment and to disguise his pain when the dressings were changed how many days had it been he opened his left eye and stared fixedly at the stern windows watery sunshine and a deep blue horizon he tensed feeling the hope surge through him then clenched his fists as the same shadow returned to curtain off his vision tuson saw him tighten his fists and said dont despair sir bolitho waited for the bandage to be retied it was almost better to see nothing from that eye than to lose hope he asked abruptly what is the matter with my coxn tuson looked at him bankart sir his son pity hes aboard if you ask me bolitho touched his shirtsleeve come on man you can speak with me you should know that tuson shut his black bag how would you like it sir if your nephew proved to be a coward bolitho heard the door close the tap of a musket as the sentry changed his stance beyond the screen a coward all the bitter memories surged through him as the word hung in his mind like a stain that moment when midshipman sheaffe had been left behind probably injured the times on supremes deck when bankart had been missing there was not much tuson did not glean from the men who came to him for aid he remembered stayts voice aboard the cutter he had known even then how could he waste time on such things when so much was expected of him he thought of his instructions to lapish board them or sink them the intruding hardness in his voice had blindness done that to him but he recalled how he had hacked down the french seaman who had been carrying the lookouts telescope without a thought with no hesitation no it was something inside him perhaps belinda had seen it and feared for him because he was being destroyed by war with the same ruthlessness as by a ball or a pike but he did care about people about allday most of all tuson had laid his finger right on it how would he have felt if adam had been a coward that night as argonaute dipped and lifted in an untidy sea of tossing white horses bolitho lay in his cot and tried to sleep when eventually he dozed off he thought of belinda or was it cheney of falmouth and of a sea battle which became a nightmare for he saw himself dead the next day rapid stopped a portuguese fisherman but only after she had put a ball across her bows eventually the news was passed to the flagship the fisherman had passed golfo de rosas below the cape two days earlier a large french manofwar lay at anchor there bolitho paced up and down his stern gallery oblivious to the wind and the spray which soon soaked him to the skin the french ship would not sail towards gibraltar she might remain at anchor or she could decide to head for toulon argonaute would stand between her and any such destination he sent for his flaglieutenant signal to icarus remain on station rapid will stay with her had he been able to he would have seen stayt raise one eyebrow bolitho groped his way to the table and stared helplessly at the chart then he faced stayt and grinned argonaute will sail under her old colours tomorrow suppose it is jobert sir hell surely recognize the ship it wont be he will be with his squadron when we know where that is he left the rest unsaid minutes later the flags broke brightly from the yards and were acknowledged by icarus and eventually by the little brig if the wind changed against them he would have to think again but if not and the master seemed confident it would remain southerly they might stand a chance of closing with the enemy the very coastline which the enemy had seen as a refuge might soon become the jaws of a trap in his cabin captain valentine keen took a few moments to ensure he had everything he needed for the next hours around and below him the ship seemed quiet except for the regular groan of timbers and the muffled sluice of water against the hull it is always like this he thought uncertainty doubt but beneath it all a determination which was without fear he saw his reflection in the mirror and grimaced in a short while he would go on deck and give the word to clear for action he felt the touch of ice at his spine that too was normal he checked himself as thoroughly as he would a subordinate clean shirt and breeches less chance of infection if the worst happened he touched his side and felt the soreness of his wound they said lightning never struck twice in the same place he was still looking at his reflection and saw himself smile he had put a letter to his mother in his strongbox how many of those had he written he wondered there was a light tap at the door it was stayt sir richard has gone on deck sir it sounded like a warning keen nodded thank you stayt vanished in the gloom an odd bird he thought it was almost time he loosened his hanger in its scabbard and made certain his watch was deep in his pocket in case he should fall he heard low voices outside the door and pulled it open before anyone could knock for a moment he could only see the pale oval of her face she was covered from chin to toe in his boatcloak which he had sent to her earlier it looked black outside but he sensed figures moving about and heard the creak of the helm from the quarterdeck he led her into the cabin soon like the rest of the ship it would be stripped bare ready to fight perhaps the french ship would not be there but he discarded the thought the wind was fresh and no captain would wish to fight it and end up on a lee shore he took her hands you will be safe my dear stay with ozzard in the hold he will take care of you where is your companion millie has already gone down she was staring up at him her eyes very dark in the shaded lantern keen adjusted the boatcloak and felt her shoulder tense as he touched it he said it will be cold below this will help he was conscious of the need to go the seconds and the minutes he said dont be afraid she shook her head i only fear for you in case he touched her mouth no we shall be together soon a man coughed in the darkness that would be hogg his coxswain he held her against him very gently and imagined he could feel her heart beating and remembered holding her breast in his hand he murmured in truth i do love you zenoria she backed away and turned once to look at him to remember to reassure he did not know he snatched up his hat and strode out towards the quarterdeck he found bolitho by the weather nettings his body angled to the deck as argonaute blundered her way on an uncomfortable larboard tack as closehauled as her yards would bear the quartermaster called norwest sir full an bye keen could see it in his mind all night the ship had clawed and beaten her way into the wind to pass the cape well abeam and then turn again towards the land and the small gulf where the frenchman was said to be lying all the backbreaking work of resetting sails and changing tack a dozen times would offer them an advantage once they made their final approach they would hold the windgage even if the enemy managed to elude them there was only one course of escape and he would find icarus and rapid blocking his path keen thought of the girl in his arms the crude comment made by icarus captain he had made an enemy there he thought bolitho turned and asked how long keen watched the painful way he was holding his head and sensed his hurt like his own i shall clear for action at dawn sir bolitho clung to the nettings as the ship shuddered into a massive trough it seemed to shake her from beakhead to taffrail will the people be fed keen smiled sadly yes sir the galley is ready he had nearly answered of course he had learned well under bolitho bolitho seemed to want to talk are the women below keen said yes sir he thought of the jamaican maid called millie he suspected she was having an unlawful liaison with wenmouth the ships corporal the very man chosen to protect her from harm he admitted i hate the thought of her being down there when we fight bolitho touched his bandage if we fight but she is better here for the present val than abandoned in some unknown harbour he tried to rouse his enthusiasm you are lucky to have her so near the calls trilled between decks and petty officers bawled at all hands to lash up and stow their hammocks in minutes the upper deck which had been deserted but for the duty watch was overflowing with men as they ran to the nettings to tamp down their podlike hammocks where they would offer the best protection against splinters and musket balls there was a strong smell of frying pork from the galley funnel and from one hatchway bolitho heard the thin note of a fiddle time to eat to change into fresh clothing to share a tot and a song with a friend for some it might be the last time keen had gone forward to speak with the boatswain and bolitho twisted round to seek the officerofthewatch mr griffin but the shadow was not the lieutenant but midshipman sheaffe bolitho shrugged no matter you can tell me what is happening sheaffe stood near him mr fallowfield says it will be first light in half an hour it is cloudy as you can see sir he broke off and said i beg your pardon sir richard bolitho replied i am getting used to it but i shall be glad when the day comes eventually it was time keen came aft again and touched his hat the galley fire is doused sir it was a hasty breakfast im afraid bolitho smiled but a bracing one i gather from the smell of rum shadows moved about merged and separated and there was a new greyness in the light deck there land on the lee bow bolitho heard fallowfield blow his nose probably out of relief keen exclaimed a timely landfall sir i can wear ship presently but first bolitho turned towards him his hair blowing in the wind remember what i told you val clear your mind of everything but fighting this ship the hardness left him and he added otherwise our brave zenoria will be widowed before she is wed keen grinned it was infectious he cupped his hands and then paused as a thin shaft of frail sunlight ran down the maintopgallant mast like liquid gold then he shouted mr paget beat to quarters and clear for action if you please bolitho took a deep breath as the drums rolled and the calls trilled yet again to urge guide and muster the ships company into a single team bolitho did not have to see it to know what was happening the crashes and thuds below decks as screens were removed and personal belongings taken below powder from the magazine sand scattered on the decks so that the gun crews would not slip and to contain the blood if any was to be shed bolitho felt allday beside him and raised his arm for him to clip his sword into place together another fight victory or failure how much would it count in the end he tried not to think of the ceremony when he had been knighted all those complacent pink faces did they really care about men like these what it cost in lives to keep landsmen in comfort pagets voice cleared for action sir keen said well done mr paget but next time i want two minutes knocked off the time aye aye sir it was a game captain and first lieutenant like me and thomas herrick bolitho thought he saw the nearest gangway taking shape the lines of packed hammocks like hooded figures the breeches of the upper decks eighteenpounders stood out sharply against the holystoned planking life was returning to the ship keen shouted alter course three points to starboard steer north by west paget raised his speakingtrumpet man the braces there keen gripped the quarterdeck rail and watched as the great yards were hauled round while the rudder went over it was not much but it took the strain out of the sails and shifted the wind more across the quarter as the bows lifted he saw a hint of land for the first time tilting to larboard as if to slide the ship to windward he turned to inform bolitho but said nothing as he saw the viceadmiral standing as before with allday close behind him bolitho had seen nothing and keen was both moved and troubled allday gave him a brief glance but it told keen everything it said i shall be here keen said aloft with you mr griffin and tell me what you can see he saw midshipman sheaffe and his signals party by the halliards and a huge french tricolour trailing across the deck keen took a telescope and climbed into the shrouds the land was touched with sunlight but without much substance they were steering almost parallel with it and about two miles distant the whole gulf was only ten miles across and at the end of it the craggynosed cape leaned out protectively to make a perfect shelter or anchorage bolitho called any ships none yet sir bolitho sighed bit different from our last commission together at san felipe eh then he seemed to lift from his mood run up the flag and then get the tgallants on her we shall need all our agility today if we are to be lucky keen gestured to the first lieutenant but paused as the voice from the masthead made them all look aloft deck there ship dead ahead keen stared up until his eyes watered fretting with impatience until lieutenant griffin yelled sail of the line sir at anchor keen saw the big tricolour break out from the gaff while men swarmed up the ratlines to set more canvas the anchored ship was not visible from the deck but even allowing for griffins telescope they could be up to her within the hour steady as she goes sir nor by west keen heard bolitho say quietly and it seems we are to be lucky after all by the time the sunlight had reached the upper deck bolitho could feel the tension rising about him while the lookouts called down their reports he was torn between asking keen what he was doing phase by phase or leaving him unimpeded by his questions keen joined him suddenly and shaded his eyes to look at the set of the sails beyond them the clouds had broken up slightly to allow the sun to colour the ship and the sea around it he said the frenchman is anchored by the bow only not fore and aft he let his words sink in so that bolitho could form his own picture with the wind still from the south the other ship would be swinging towards them as if on a converging tack only her larboard bow exposed keen added no sign of excitement yet mr griffin says there are craft alongside a waterlighter for one bolitho thought suddenly of supreme of hallowes holding his hand in death that is very apt i intend with your assent sir to pass between her and the land there is ample depth there then we can hold the advantage and rake her as we cross her bows a corner of his mind recorded the hoarse shouts of the gun captains the harsher tones of the fearsome gunners mate crocker he was with the first division starboard side he would enjoy that ship sir larboard bow keen snatched a glass from midshipman hext then he said spaniard one of their corvettes stayt murmured having a job to close with us sir shes almost in irons keen said watch for her hoist mr sheaffe shell challenge us soon he raised his voice you on deck keep your eyes on the frenchman not on this little pot of paint someone laughed bolitho said my guess is that therell be no signal the dons wont want to be too open about their collusion the little corvette was changing tack the choppy water seething along her gunports as if she had run aground beyond her the land looked high and green a few white specks here and there to mark isolated dwellings there might be a battery but bolitho doubted that the nearest garrison of any size was said to be in gerona only twenty miles inland enough to deter any wouldbe invader the small spanish manofwar was within a cables length now bolitho heard the clatter of tackle from argonautes forecastle as an anchor was loosened at its cathead as if they were preparing to drop it many eyes must be watching argonaute from the frenchman her preparations like her design would be noted bolitho fretted at his inability to see he took a telescope from stayt and trained it across the nettings he saw the corvette watched her heeling over her red and yellow ensign streaming almost abeam as she came up into the wind he could ignore the blindness forget that without the glass he would be helpless again tuson would rebuke him severely for straining his good eye but the surgeon was in his sickbay waiting for the next harvest bolitho thought of the girl her lovely eyes as she had exchanged glances with keen could they ever find happiness would they be allowed to fallowfield growled be god sir the winds a veerin men ran to braces and halliards again and keen said from the souwest by my reckoning sir bolitho nodded fixing the charts picture in his mind veering lady luck as herrick would have said was with them keen shouted be ready to brail up the forecourse mr paget a thin voice floated across the water from the corvette bolitho said wave your hat to them keen and stayt waved to the spaniard who was being rapidly driven towards the larboard quarter a mile to go bolitho gripped the rail and peered through the crossed rigging and straining jibsails he could see the enemy angled towards the starboard bow just as keen had described her keen glanced meaningly at paget load if you please the order was instantly piped to the decks below and bolitho could imagine the gun crews toiling with charges and rammers in semidarkness behind sealed ports their naked backs already shining with sweat he had seen and done it so often from the early age of twelve the men at the guns the redpainted sides to hide the blood and here and there an isolated blue and white figure of authority a lieutenant or a warrant officer it did not seem to take long before each deck had reported ready bolitho heard captain bouteiller of the royal marines whispering instructions to orde his lieutenant like the rest of the marines he was crouching out of sight of the enemy one sign of a scarlet coat would be enough to rouse a hornets nest take in the forecourse paget sounded hoarse it had to appear as if they were shortening sail and preparing to drop anchor bolitho stood away from the rail his hands clasped behind him it could not last much longer one thing was certain jobert was not here he would have been ready to fight as soon as his old flagship was revealed in the dawn light five cables sir bolitho felt a trickle of sweat run down to his waist half a mile the frenchies hoisted a signal sir that was it no coded acknowledgement meant instant discovery for what they were keen yelled belay that order mr paget get the tgansls on her calls shrilled and high above the decks the topmen spread out on the yards like monkeys to release the extra sails fallowfield said winds steady sir souwest no doubt about it he sounded too preoccupied to care about the enemy closing towards the starboard bow three cables sir faintly above the din of wind and rigging they heard the urgent blare of a trumpet voices called from every hand the anchor was catted again and as the marine marksmen swarmed up to the fightingtops with their muskets or manned the swivels there the rest of the detachment spread themselves along the poop nettings their weapons already resting on the tightly packed hammocks keen watched unblinking gauging the moment knowing that bolitho was sharing it and that paget was ready to act on each command open the ports along each deck the port lids lifted on their tackles like drowsy eyes awakening god theyre cutting their cable sir keen bit his lip too late run out squeaking and rumbling the argonautes powerful armament poked through the open ports like snouts the muzzles of the big thirtytwopounders on the lower gun deck were already lifting or dipping as their captains practised their aim bolitho took stayts glass again and trained it on the other ship he saw her foretopsail breaking free from its yard and men swarming aloft while others crowded the forecastle above the cable the waterlighter was still lashed alongside its hull lined with staring faces as argonaute bore down on them the cable parted and the french twodecker began to fall downwind more canvas flapping in disarray as men fought to bring her under command stand by starboard battery keens eyes narrowed in the strengthening sunlight as he waited for the tricolour to tumble across the deck and the red ensign to break out from the gaff in its place at the foremast truck bolithos flag flapped stiffly to the wind and keen heard one of his midshipmen give a shrill cheer argonautes tapering jibboom crossed the other ships bows barely a cable away keen lifted his hanger he heard the grate of a handspike from forward and saw the starboard carronade being inched round her massive sixtyeightpound ball would be the first to fire the rest would shoot as they found the target not in a full broadside but deck by deck pair by pair as you bear lads the hangers blade made a streak of light fire retribution without changing tack or altering course one degree argonaute swept past the drifting french twodecker her hull jerking violently to each resounding bang so conscious were the gun captains of this moment that each pair of cannon sounded like a single explosion bolitho swayed and almost slipped as the deck tilted into another offshore roller he felt his nostrils flare in the acrid smoke his ears quake to the thunder of gunfire the attack was begun by the carronade but at a range of almost a cable it was more of a gesture than any danger to the enemy keen wiped his face as the last division of guns recoiled inboard on their tackles and men scampered to sponge out and reload the frenchman had been badly mauled and smoking scars along her tumblehome marked the accuracy of the carefully aimed attack a few guns fired in return and one ball smashed into argonautes lower hull like a mailed fist some of the crews were calling to each other racing to beat their time to be the first to run out and be ready to fire again keen watched narrowly as the frenchman set her forecourse and then her maintopsail she was under command but almost beamon to sea and wind as she fought to bear up to her attacker he shouted ready on the uproll mr paget he glanced at bolitho just a fraction of a second but he saw him as he always remembered straightbacked facing the enemy yet now unable to see them full broadside this might be the only time he caught a vague glimpse of the spanish corvette now well astern a helpless and astonished spectator more shots hammered alongside and somewhere a man screamed out in agony keen held out his hanger his eyes watering again as the sunlight warmed his face now as the whistles shrilled and argonaute s topgallant masts began to tilt once more the whole broadside thundered out with such violence it was like hitting a rock smoke and charred wads drifted everywhere but not before keen had seen the broadside tear across the lessening gap the wavecrests breaking to the force and the weight of iron he saw the enemy ship shiver then sway over as the full onslaught smashed into her wood and rigging flew in all directions and the labouring hull was masked by falling fragments and leaping talons of spray stop your vents sponge out load pagets voice echoed above the wind and the squeal of tackles like a clarion call allday said in a sudden pause we hit em sir even her canvas is shot through he sounded tense slightly wild like men usually are when battle is joined bolitho held the quarterdeck rail afraid he might lose his balance again he thought he had heard the broadside strike home even at this range he said tersely close the distance captain keen lieutenant stayt lowered his telescope and looked at him he had seen keens quick glance as his mind had registered bolithos sharp formality alter course to starboard mr fallowfield keen broke off as several balls crashed into the hull and some hammocks burst from the forward nettings in a wild tangle like exultant corpses keen shouted that was chainshot he looked at the sailingmaster close as you can men ran to the braces while along the upper decks eighteenpounders others worked like demons with handspikes and tackles training and holding the enemy firmly in their ports fire the broadside thundered out again and bolitho heard someone cheering like a demented soul in hell he thought allday exclaimed her mizzens gone shes tryin to come about to save her stern from the smasher bolitho seized a glass and pressed it to his right eye all the jokes about nelson at copenhagen were not so funny now he saw the hazy outline of the french ship shortening as argonaute turned towards her the bowsprit pointing directly at her poop the other captain had not regained control completely when the second broadside struck and raked his ship from bow to stern instead of continuing to turn she was falling downwind her afterpart shrouded in fallen spars and canvas while here and there along her battered side a few guns fired independently and on her gangway tiny stabbing flashes showed that her marksmen were fighting back steady as you go keen crouched down to peer through the pall of smoke and straining rigging the wind had risen he had to hold the gage or lose all the advantage his attack had gained he saw the waterlighter tilting over spilling men and casks into the sea the hull so pitted with holes it was a wonder it had taken so long on the opposite disengaged side another harbour craft a big yawl had cast off and was probably trying to beat away from her big consort before she shared the lighters fate keen made up his mind mr fallowfield lay her on the starboard tack the frenchman was still beamon to the wind her progress further hampered by the trailing wreckage of spars and rigging alongside the shattered lighter was sinking rapidly and he realized that she was still made fast by the bow to the twodecker either they had not had time to cast off or the men so ordered had been scythed down by the last murderous broadside but keen had been in enough fights to know how quickly the balance could alter the french captain had kept his mind above the disaster which had caught him unprepared and had found time to order his gun crews to load with chainshot a wellaimed fusillade could bring down a vital sparvictory and defeat were measured by such delicate distinctions orders were yelled and men hauled at the braces yet again bolitho felt a shot fan past him heard a crack and something like a fierce intake of breath as the musket ball hurled a marine from the nettings the side of his skull blasted away his companions left their stations as the afterguard was piped to the mizzen braces while the ship tilted steeply and began to plough over to the opposite tack keen joined bolitho and shouted above the noise of gunfire and bellowed orders they see you sir put on my coat bolitho clung to a stay and shook his head i want them to see me more shots hissed past him and smacked into hammocks on the opposite side or cracked against the planking bolitho could feel the anger rising inside him driving away reason and caution had there been any keen did not understand bolitho was afraid to release his grip and move about as any sane man would his bright epaulettes marked him down as a prime target better that than lose his balance again while his men fought for their very lives around him crashcrashcrash the french ship returned fire yet again bolitho raised the telescope and jammed it to his eye it was heavy difficult to hold steady with one hand he saw the french ship suddenly stark and huge towering over the argonaute s starboard bow keens sharp change of tack had pared away the distance the french captain had no chance now to break off the action to turn and fight or even to run he saw the enemys helpless stern rising still higher isolated from the rest of the ship by the great gap in her silhouette left by the fallen mizzen keen said fiercely we shall pass barely a boats length away sir a masthead lookout waited for a pause in the firing and yelled hoarsely ships to larboard sir keen shouted send an officer aloft he ducked and coughed as a ball slammed through the nettings and hurled blasted hammocks everywhere but for the alteration of course there would have been a solid rank of marines there a ships boy a mere child who was running almost doubled over with fresh shot to a quarterdeck ninepounder was caught even as he reached the gun the horrified crew of the ninepounder were drenched in blood as the ball cut the boy neatly in half so that the legs appeared to run on after the torso had fallen to the deck steady she goes sir noreast by east as you bear keen waved to the forecastle although he doubted if the carronade crew needed encouragement this time every gun had extra hands to work it men taken from the disengaged weapons on the larboard side more shot whined overhead and several sails danced as holes appeared and broken rigging clattered across the nets and gangways captain bouteiller yelled get those bloody sharpshooters orde a swivel banged loudly and bolitho recalled okes firing into the french longboat he felt the deck quiver by his feet and knew that a ball had almost taken him he did not move he wanted them to see him to know who had done this a voice filtered through the noise theyre spaniards sir bolitho heard keen shouting orders spaniards some local vessels coming to drive the attacker from their waters fire the ship jerked violently as the carronade fired almost pointblank into the enemys stern it was a direct hit and the whole ornate stern appeared to fall inboard as the massive ball exploded within the poop its packed charge of grape bursting amongst the crowded gun crews and turning the confined deck into a slaughterhouse as argonaute continued to edge remorselessly around the enemys broken stern the murderous broadside swept across and into her the lower gun deck had somehow found time to load with double shot as if each officer knew it was their last chance before argonaute was carried either past or into their enemy by the freshening wind keen watched chilled by what he saw as the enemys maintopmast was carried away and one of the muzzles on the enemys lower gun deck exploded in a sheet of fire some terrified seaman had forgotten to sponge out before a fresh charge was rammed home or maybe the gun was old and had outworn those who crewed it keen shouted the donsll be up to us in an hour sir despite the wind shall we discontinue the action more shots roared from argonautes lower battery the long thirtytwopounders wreaking terrible havoc on the other vessel which now appeared to be out of control with either her helm shot away or none left to take charge aft bolitho did not speak and keen swung round on him fearful that a marksman had found him but bolitho was staring towards the other ship his head on one side as if to force a clearer view keen persisted shell not fight again for a long long while sir has she struck keen stared at him he barely recognized bolithos voice curt with all pity honed out of it no sir bolitho blinked as a ball from the enemy cut through the shrouds and a man screamed shrilly like a woman in agony she must never fight continue the action he caught keens arm as he made to hurry away if we leave her shell anchor i want her destroyed totally keen nodded his mind reeling to the crash and roar of cannon fire the excited chatter from the marines as they fired their long muskets reloaded with almost paradeground precision and then sought out fresh targets on the enemys decks he stared sickened as blood ran down the enemys side he could imagine the horror between decks paget stared up at him his eyes very clear in his smokegrimed face keen jerked his head and seconds later the broadside thundered out measured and deliberate with barely a gun firing back in reply keen watched through his telescope and saw the frenchmans foremast begin to dip through the smoke he gestured to stayt who snatched up a speakingtrumpet and then climbed nimbly into the mizzen shrouds abandonez but only musket shots answered him argonautes sails filled and gathered the wind as fallowfield guided her clear of the drifting dismasted hulk keen glanced quickly at bolitho but there was no change in his expression keen raised his hanger then thought of the girl who was sheltering in the hold far below his feet and the corpses that lolled by the guns someone had mercifully thrown some torn canvas over the ships boy who had been halved by the enemys iron it was no longer a battle the enemy was like a helpless beast waiting for the fatal blow to fall he saw the nearest gun captain watching him his triggerline already taut prepare to fire he heard his order being piped to the lower gun deck and braced himself for the broadside a voice shouted white flag sir keen looked at bolitho half expecting him to order the broadside to be unleashed bolitho felt his glance and turned towards him he could see only a misty outline the blue and white of keens clothing the fairness of his hair his eye stung with smoke and strain but he managed to keep his voice level as he said order them to abandon ship then sink her paget called theres a lot of smoke sir i think she may have taken fire bolitho waited for the deck to settle then walked across to the quarterdeck rail he heard faint shouts from the other vessel smelt the breath of charred rigging which at any moment might turn the beaten ship into an inferno he said quietly war is not a game val nor is it a test of honour for friend or foe his tone hardened think of supreme there was no mercy for poor hallowes and i will offer none to the enemy he turned and walked to the opposite side his foot slipping on blood where the marine had fallen when the ball had missed bolitho by mere inches paget yelled no its the yawl which has taken afire sir keen raised his glass and saw the smaller vessel drifting clear of the twodecker to his astonishment he could see men leaping overboard making no attempt to quench the flames a stray ball from argonautes last broadside perhaps or maybe some burning canvas had dropped from the twodeckers broken spars like a torch to a fuse bolitho must have heard the busy speculation on the quarterdeck and said sharply get the ship under way if you please that yawl must have been loading powder aboard the frenchman calls twittered and men rushed yet again to their stations while others spread out on the yards above the pockmarked sails as their ship slowly turned towards the welcoming horizon the explosion was like a volcano erupting catching men in their various attitudes of shock or dismay and shaking the hull as if to carry vengeance even to argonaute the twodeckers hidden side took the full blast of the explosion and even as the water began to descend again like a ragged curtain she started to heel over the explosion which had completely obliterated the yawl without leaving even a floating spar to mark her passing must have stove in the twodeckers bilge like a reef keen watched his mind refusing to contain the swiftness and the horror of the explosion much nearer and argonaute might have shared the same fate bolitho crossed the quarterdeck and paused to face the silent group of young officers there that will save us the trouble gentlemen he turned to see allday was marking his line of retreat the smoke had played havoc with his eye and he could barely see their faces but their shock was plain enough as he had meant it to be as he made his way aft several of the smokeblackened seamen raised a cheer one more daring than the rest touched bolithos back as he passed keens men his men he wished those at home who took such people for granted could see them now they did not care about the cause or the reason and none had come to this place of his own free will they fought like lions for each other for the ship around them it was their world it was enough he thought of the disbelief in keens voice when he had ordered him to continue the action for those few moments he had felt something more than anger more than the hurt which had been done to him by the shot which had all but blinded him it had been hate something white hot and without mercy which had almost made him order another broadside the enemy had already been defeated before some halfcrazed soul had raised a white flag on a boathook he considered it warily almost fearfully hate it was beyond his reckoning as alien as cowardice like another person the deck tilted and with the wind filling her newly spread main course argonaute stood away from the dying ship and the great spread of flotsam and floundering survivors they at least would be picked up by the spaniards keen had watched his face had seen the effect of his callous remark on his youthful lieutenants and midshipmen keen had seen bolitho in almost every situation and if he loved any man he would look no further but at moments like this he felt as if he knew him not at all tuson wiped his fingers individually on a small towel and regarded bolitho sternly much more of this sir richard and i cannot answer for your sight he expected a sharp retort but was more shocked to see that bolitho did not seem to notice he had moved to the stern windows and sat staring at the glittering water astern listless the life drained out of him the ship echoed and quivered to the bang of hammers the squeal of tackles as fresh cordage was run up to the yards to replace that lost or damaged in the swift battle there was almost a carefree atmosphere throughout the ship it was their victory five men had been killed and two more had been badly wounded tuson had described the rest as mere knocks and scrapes the fierceness of their attack had cut down their losses more than bolitho had believed possible he had heard what tuson had said there was no point in arguing or disputing it through the thick glass he could see the misty outline of icarus her topsail almost white in the noon sun rapid was on station ahead and apart from the repairs and the five burials there was little to show for the destruction of a french thirdrate keen had noted that her name was calliope before the terrible smasher had reduced her stern to boxwood tuson was saying if you want my advice sir bolitho looked towards him you are a good man but what advice when i try to walk i lose my footing like a drunken sailor and i can scarcely tell one man from another what advice you won a battle despite these things sir bolitho gestured vaguely towards the screen they won it man you could request another flagofficer tuson persisted stubbornly as bolitho turned on him so that you could obtain better treatment i do not command in the mediterranean and ill not ask favours even of nelson the french will come out i know it he touched his chest here i feel it and the girl what of her bolitho leaned back and felt the sun deceptively hot through the glass against his shirt i shall make arrangements tuson gave the nearest thing to a smile you do not wish to involve me is that it sir there was a tap at the door and keen stepped into the cabin in the three days since the battle he had barely been off his feet but like his company the swift victory had removed the strain the earlier uncertainty keen did not look at the surgeon in case he should discover bad news he asked are you well sir bolitho gestured to a chair no worse anyway keen watched him the way bolitho tapped one foot on the canvas deck covering rapid has signalled a vessel to the souwest sir small one closing under all sail see keen tried to conceal his concern bolitho sounded uninterested all the fire and determination he had shown when they had dished up the frenchman seemed to have vanished the marine sentry shouted midshipmanothwatch sir keen sighed and walked to the screen door he looked at the small untidy figure and asked well mr hickling dont keep me in suspense the boy screwed up his face as he tried to remember his message word for word mr pagets respects sir his eyes moved past keen to the other cabin to bolitho framed against the glittering seascape hickling was only just thirteen but had been on the lower gun deck throughout the engagement and had seen one man cut down by splinters and yet he seemed unchanged keen thought midshipman hickling continued the sail is reported as the brig firefly sir bolitho lurched to his feet and exclaimed are they sure hickling watched his admiral curiously and without awe he was even too young for that mr paget says that rapid is quite certain of it sir richard bolitho touched the midshipmans shoulders good news hickling stared at his hand not daring to move as bolitho added your lieutenant spoke highly of your behaviour under fire well done the midshipman hurried away and keen said quietly that was good of you sir not many would care he watched bolitho return to the bench seat noticed the way he took deliberate steps as if feeling the ships movement looking for a trap bolitho knew keen was watching him feeling for him how can i share it how can i tell him that i am beside myself with worry hate revenge callousness they should play no part in my life and yethe said i care because i have not forgotten val when i was his age you too remember it kicked and bullied neither respected nor trusted when one kind word could make all that difference he shook his head i hope i never forget while i breathe the surgeon walked past with his bag good day gentlemen he looked at keen i trust sir now that young mr bolitho is drawing near we may get an ally in this trying situation bolitho frowned bloody man keen closed the door he makes good sense the sudden shock made bolitho start adam did not know what would he think keen said gently as if he had read his thoughts your nephew is already proud of you so am i bolitho did not reply and was still staring astern when keen left to go on deck keen nodded to his officers and studied the clear sky bright but cool he walked to the rail and glanced down at the main deck the marketplace as bolitho called it the sailmaker and his crew were busy with their needles and palms repairing preserving the boatswain and the carpenter were conferring on their stocks of timber and there was a heady smell of tar in the air but keen was thinking of the aftermath to the battle holding her in his arms the relief the unbelievable happiness which each gave to the other like something pure and bright being lifted from a blacksmiths furnace she had buried her face in his chest while he had held her so closely that he had felt the remains of the scar on her back through the shirt the last terrible explosion had bellowed against the hold like a thunderbolt ozzard had told him the girl had held his hand and that of millie the maid she had more courage than any of them ozzard had insisted keen saw allday by the restacked boats on their tier he looked angry his face inches from the second coxswains it looked bad like the surgeon keen was beginning to regret bankarts presence in the ship deck there sail fine on th larboard bow keen glanced at paget and nodded firefly s arrival could not have been better timed young hickling had no idea how welcome his news had been news from home perhaps a letter for the admiral there would be no time yet for anything from london about zenoria but at least things were being done war or no war he thought of her in his arms how right it had felt and how he longed for her paget watched him and turned away satisfied the captain looked happy to any first lieutenant that was more than enough bolitho stood up yet again as familiar sounds thudded overhead and voices murmured near the skylight the hands had been piped to the braces and the flagship was preparing to heaveto and receive the brigs commander how he wanted to be there at the entry port when adam came aboard but that was keens privilege one captain greeting another bolitho heard the side party being mustered some marines falling in to do adam his rightful honours it was not just tradition which kept him away and bolitho knew it he was afraid of what his nephew would say and think when he met him allday moved from the sleeping cabin and held out his coat for him bolitho was so preoccupied that for once he did not sense alldays grim mood there might be a letter from belinda and shehe raised his head as pagets voice echoed along the deck argonautes helm went over and with her sails flapping noisily she swung heavily into the wind swaying steeply for a while until the remaining sails were reset for a brief moment he had seen the brig through the streaming windows her ensign making a dab of colour like metal in the wind he wondered if fireflys arrival had been noted by some unseen fishing boat her purpose already known by a spy at gibraltar or a traitor in london he heard a boat passing close by the bark of an order as the coxswain steered her towards the chains command adam had earned it twice over allday watched him dully he could not bear to see him so helpless and unsure he had tried to shield him when they had engaged the frenchman fearful for bolithos safety as he had stood there unwilling or unable to move away bolitho said its good to have him back if only for a moment eh allday inch will rejoin us in a day or so then we will go and seek out jobert together allday took down the old sword he hated jobert what he had made bolitho become pipes trilled and the marines slapped their muskets bolitho saw it clearly as he had a thousand times for others and for himself it seemed to take an age before yovell opened the outer screen door and bolitho walked to greet him careful to stay where he could reach support from a table or chair desperate not to show it but there were two visitors not one he grasped adams hands and knew that he already had the news how is it uncle he did not try to hide his anxiety well enough he shied away from it you are failing in your duty sir who is our visitor adam said mr pullen he sounded uncomfortable from the admiralty the man had a bony handshake on passage for malta sir richard he sounded as if he was smiling eventually well be seated allday fetch ozzard he knew adam was staring at him measuring his hurt as keen had done and what brings you here mr er pullen the man arranged himself in a chair he was all in black like a carrion crow bolitho thought he turned to keep the light behind him knowing they would see the bandage and nothing more i have certain affairs to manage in malta sir richard admiral sir hayward sheaffe has given me instructions bolitho forced a smile secret eh certainly sir richard as ozzard hurried to him with a tray he said some watered wine will suffice thank you adam said i wish to speak with you uncle bolitho sensed something in his tone will it not keep the man called pullen took an envelope from his coat and laid it on the table bolitho stared at it feeling trapped stripped of his pretence may i ask the same of you mr pullen the man shrugged i would imagine that you have many things on your hands sir richard you have been in battle although to glance around you you would scarce believe it bolitho controlled a sudden irritation we destroyed a french seventyfour that was all he said excellent sir hayward will be pleased he regarded the glass of watered wine id not trouble you sir richard it is after all a nuisance but a necessity none the less i am required to serve notice on your flagcaptain to attend a court of inquiry in malta with all despatch no wonder adam had tried to warn him bolitho said calmly to what purpose pullen seemed satisfied two bothersome reasons i understand sir richard he behaved somewhat foolishly by ignoring a government warrant and then removing a woman his voice lingered on the word as if it were obscene from custody i feel he can explain his reasons no matter how misguided but i must point out who had made this accusation pullen sighed it was a written report sir richard as i said it should not concern or trouble you a nuisance nothing more bolitho said quietly you are impertinent sir that woman was being abused flogged captain keen was doing his duty that is in the past sir richard bolitho stared at him and replied this is a battleground mr pullen not a safe and secure office here i command i could have you seized up and flogged to within an inch of your life and none would question my order he heard the mans quick intake of breath it would be months before anyone acted on it and i would like to know if you might call that a nuisance pullen swallowed hard i meant no offence sir richard well it was taken do you imagine that ill stand by and permit a gallant officer to have his name smeared by thisthis absurdity pullen leaned forward his confidence returning then it is not true any of it i do not have to answer that pullen stood up and placed his glass still full on the table not to me sir but you will see in your orders that you are also required to attend with your captain bolitho stared at him leave this station do you know what you are saying have you no conception of what the enemy intends to do pullen said it is out of my hands sir richard he gave a brief bow if i may i would like to withdraw while you decide for a long moment bolitho stood stock still beneath the skylight it was like a bad dream like his failing sight it must soon clear away adam said bitterly he explained nothing uncle you did not tell me about this woman he hesitated we must see that there is no gossip bolitho took his arm she is aboard this ship adam he turned him slowly to face him if that wretch made it sound coarse and indecent he has done more harm than i imagined she is a fine brave girl wrongly charged falsely transported and we shall prove it the door opened and keen walked slowly aft his hat dangling from one hand keen said but in the meantime she will be sent in irons to another transport he looked at adam you see i love her i love her more than life itself adam glanced from one to the other instantly aware of the strength of keens sincerity of his uncles compassion adam said pullen plays cards they both stared at him at his dark features which had become so grim i could accuse him of cheating and call him out bolitho crossed to his side and grasped his shoulders enough of that we are in enough trouble keep your steel covered he squeezed his shoulders bless you adam said wretchedly i have a letter from lady belinda he held it out i think i know why you did not read pullens brief uncle he sounded shocked stunned by the realization bolitho asked do you have to leave immediately aye adam looked down and his unruly hair fell across his forehead i heard about john hallowes uncle he was my friend i know they walked together to the screen i shall have to quit the squadron when i am most needed adam over this tragic affair i will place inch in command until we return he looked at keen have no fear i shall not desert that girl adam followed keen to the quarterdeck and saw pullen waiting by the entry port who was behind these accusations he wondered the fact that they were true seemed less important he touched his hat to the side party and then looked at keen he said you have my loyalty sir he touched his sword this too when and if you need it then he followed pullen into the boat keen waited only until the gig was under oars and then crossed to his first lieutenant we shall make sail as soon as a letter has been sent over to firefly from the admiral it was obvious that pullen had wanted to remain on board as an observer until they reached malta where he would change his role to that of jailer now he would be there waiting for them his determination sharpened by bolithos hostility im sorry about all this sir paget flinched under keens stare but stood his ground we all are its not fair keen dropped his eyes thank you i once believed it was enough to fight a war apparently there are those who think we are better used fighting each other a boat carried a hastily penned letter across to the brig and by the time dusk had closed in firefly had already dipped below the horizon keen walked the quarterdeck and watched the red sunset firefly had brought only bad news after all a time for caring it was early morning when bolitho made his way to the quarterdeck two days since firefly had found them and adam had given him the news argonaute was lying comfortably on the larboard tack under topsails and jib her decks damp from the night air her seamen moving about in the halflight clearing up loose lines and holystoning the poop under the supervision of their petty officers there was a sickly smell from the galley funnel and all hands would soon be dismissed for their breakfast bolitho saw the officerofthewatch glance at him startled then move hastily to the lee side the helmsmen too straightened their backs when moments before they had been clinging to the big double wheel tired after their watch thinking only of breakfast poor though it might be one or two of the seamen looked up at him from the main deck they had seen very little of bolitho since the injury and later the smoke of battle had hidden him better than any disguise he shaded his eye and stared towards the land purple and deep blue above a steely horizon there were clouds about rimmed with pink and gold from the sunrise the sea was calmer and the deck much steadier he walked a few paces inboard his hands grasped firmly behind him when he sought out individual figures he felt his heart quicken he could recognize all but those in shadow between the guns he called to the lieutenant in charge of the watch good morning mr machan the officer touched his hat and hurried towards him a fine day sir richard he sounded confused and pleased bolitho studied him detail by detail he could see him better than he had dared hope and recalled how he had once mistaken sheaffe for another officer entirely he realized that machan was visibly wilting under his stare bolitho said is helicon in sight from the masthead they had seen inchs ship and her consort just as night had closed in but daylight would bring them all together again except for barracouta in her odd disguise and they would be reduced again as soon as the flagship left for malta it was madness but bolitho knew that the orders left nothing to chance or conjecture if keen was required to face a court of inquiry he must go in his own ship to be sent as a passenger in some courier brig would be as good as condemning him and holding the door wide to a court martial he found he was pacing again and that machan had returned to his place at the lee nettings the news would spread first through the lower deck then to every ship in the squadron the admiral was up and about again bolitho allowed his mind to grapple with belindas letter he was still not sure what he had expected her letter was not brief but lacked any personal contact she had written of the estate of fergusons plans for extending the market garden of the old exciseman whose wife was having another baby it had been a strange experience but he had not wanted yovell or ozzard to read it to him instead he had asked for the girl to be brought aft and to do it belindas voice had become hers but the letter had been light and evasive no mention of london or the coolness of their parting bolitho paused as a shaft of sunlight lanced through the shrouds then took the letter from his pocket he held it to the light careful to hide what he was doing from the officerofthewatch and his midshipman he could just make out some of the words yesterday it would have been impossible it ended from your loving wife belinda he recalled the sound of her name on zenorias lips how it had moved him and made him vaguely uneasy because of it the girl had handed him the letter and had said she is a fine lady sir bolitho sensed her despair and her envy keen had told her about pullen bolitho had said sit closer when she had joined him he had taken her hands remembering how he had removed his coat with the proud epaulettes the first time he had met her he had said i shall keep my word have no doubt of that he had sensed her disbelief as she had replied how can you help me now sir they will be waiting he had heard her frightened determination theyll not take me alive never he had pressed her hands between his what i tell you must be our secret if you tell my captain he will be an accomplice and there must be no more blame she had hesitated i trust you sir whatever you say bolitho put the letter back in his pocket he was still not sure how to deal with the matter but her spirits must be held high otherwise she might throw herself overboard or do some other injury to herself rather than face arrest and custody again the masthead lookout yelled deck there sail in sight to the soueast bolitho could picture inchs ship her sails like pink shells in the frail sunshine as she headed towards argonaute he thought of the girl again she would soon hear of the other ships arrival another turn of the screw hastening her passage to malta and heartless authority keen came on deck hatless and without a coat he stared at bolitho and made to explain bolitho smiled easy val i could not sleep i needed to walk keen grinned with relief just to see you on deck again is like a tonic sir he became serious i do not wish to burden you further but bolitho interrupted i have a plan but sir bolitho held up his hand i know what you will say that you will insist that the responsibility is yours you are wrong my flag flies over this squadron and while it does i will pilot the affairs of my officers and in particular those of my own captain his voice sounded bitter as he added ever since my brother deserted to the american navy there have been those who have been eager to bring discredit on my family my father suffered because of it and more than once i have been a ready target for their malice and plotting adam too but then you know that so i shall not have you brought down merely because it might hurt me you really think that someone intends you harm sir i have no doubts at all but nobody will expect me to release you from responsibility and take it on myself no wonder pullen the carrion crow had seemed so confident the realization chilled him angered him with the same intensity as when he had almost ordered the last broadside on the french twodecker he heard himself say let me deal with it my own way val then we can go after the real enemy if it is not already too late keen watched him and saw the emotions like the lines on a chart perhaps bolithos injury had affected his reasoning more than he realized keen had heard about the attacks on bolithos family the way it had been used in the past to prevent promotion or stem recognition which had been bravely earned but surely in the middle of a campaign nobody would be mad enough to exploit such deeprooted malevolence keen said just so long as zenoria is safe sir she is merely being used val im certain of that he turned as the midshipman called rapids signalling sir bolitho watched the flags breaking from the yard and heard keen say you can see the signal sir bolitho tried to conceal his excitement well enough he turned towards the poop the other bandage would come off and to hell with tusons gloomy predictions when inch came aboard he would find his admiral again not some faltering cripple he strode beneath the poop and only once lost his balance as the ship dipped into a long trough the scarletcoated sentry made to open the door for him but bolitho said no need collins i can manage the marine gaped after him astonished that bolitho had even remembered his name yovell looked up startled from the desk his spectacles awry as he saw bolitho stride through the door i want to prepare some instructions for captain inch of the helicon mr yovell after that i will receive that gentleman on board before we part company again he watched yovell opening drawers and searching for a new pen and after that i shall want midshipman hickling to lay aft if you please yovell nodded i understand sir richard bolitho eyed him keenly you dont but never mind yovell said the surgeon is waiting to see you sir bolitho leaned both hands on his chair to study himself in the mirror the small cuts had almost healed and his eye looked almost normal even the occasional pricking sensation was less noticeable he said send him in he tugged the bandage i have a job for him directly allday came through the other door and watched anxiously as bolitho prepared to remove the bandage if youre sure sir i shall want you to perform as a barber later on allday glanced at bolithos black hair it looked suitable he thought but he knew better than to say or do anything which might dampen bolithos new mood tuson made no bones about it he even raised his voice as he said hotly if you wont listen to me at least wait until you can be examined by someone more qualified sir the bandage had fallen to the deck and bolitho had tried not to flinch or bunch his fists as tuson had examined the eye for the hundredth time it is no better he said at length if you will but rest it i bolitho shook his head the vision was misty clouded but the pain held back as if surprised by his sudden action i feel better that is the important thing he turned to tuson and added simply try to understand my friend tuson closed his bag angrily if you were a mere common seaman sir richard id say you were a damned fool he shrugged but you are not so i will say nothing bolitho waited until the door closed then massaged his eye until he realized what he was doing then he stared at himself in the mirror for several seconds he would find and destroy joberts squadron no matter what and like inch when his men looked to him at the cannons mouth they must find confidence and not lose heart to the cabin at large he said so let us be about it during the five and a half days it took for argonaute to take passage to malta bolitho remained for much of the time in his quarters it allowed keen time and scope to complete his repairs and to change his watchbill whenever he discovered a weakness in his company gun and sail drill he kept them at it on each monotonous day they might curse their captain but the results were clear to bolitho as he heard the creak of gun trucks on deck or the yells of the petty officers as they drove some reluctant landmen aloft to the dizzy yards as he studied his orders and information he was conscious of their slow progress sometimes only six knots often less he became very aware that it would take just as long to return to his patrol area if the enemy decided to move he trusted inch as a skilful and experienced captain he did not lack initiative but often hesitated about using it it troubled bolitho for over the years inch with his eager horseface had become like a brother keen reported as soon as the masthead had sighted the island it will be late afternoon maybe in the dogwatches before i can anchor sir unless the wind freshens bolitho looked at him and saw keen trying not to stare at his unbandaged eye it was never mentioned now but it was always there like a threat very well i shall come on deck when we enter the grand harbour keen left him alone and bolitho sat down in his new chair what would the next move be an order to remove him because of his injury replace him entirely it was all too much of a coincidence to think as keen probably did that he was imagining it there had been many letters sent home from the squadron in firefly bolitho frowned as he pictured his officers his captains houston of the icarus was the most likely anger and an obvious resentment made him first choice he certainly had no love for either his admiral or his flagcaptain he went on deck only briefly to train a telescope on the blue hump of islands as malta appeared to drift sleepily towards them he made up his mind if things went badly wrong nothing he could say would save their accusations or the girl either but he had to be ready he knew keen had been to visit the girl in her cabin it would have been a difficult farewell each trusting bolitho neither knowing if or when they might ever meet again they could not even speak freely with tuson and a marine sentry close by bolitho returned to his cabin ozzard send for allday now he walked to the windows and watched a small highprowed fishing boat bobbing astern malta fought over won and lost now accepting the navys protection more as a defence against the french than from any sense of loyalty allday had obviously been very near he entered the cabin and waited his face expressionless as he gauged bolithos mood bolitho said fetch her please allday took a deep breath im not at all certain about it sir richard about what old friend you have heard nothing allday sighed it was fine now but there would be squalls later if it misfired he padded from the cabin an unspoken argument left hanging in the air bolitho swore silently as the deck tilted and he heard the clatter of blocks and helm as the ship altered course slightly he had almost lost his balance again it was unnerving like the mist which hung over his eye like a piece of fine silk the door opened then allday closed it behind her it is almost time bolitho led her to a chair and watched her grip its arms making a lie of her composure he walked behind her and touched her long hair are you sure brave zenoria she nodded and held the chair even more tightly allday muttered hoarsely lie back miss she laid her head on the chairback and after a brief hesitation unbuttoned her shirt and bared her neck bolitho took her hand no wonder keen adored her allday said despairingly i cant do it sir not like this she said quietly do it please now allday released a great sigh and then pulled her hair out behind her his scissors poised like steel jaws bolitho watched the hair falling to the deck and said i will be on deck he squeezed her hand it was like ice in spite of the cabins humid air allday will care for you then he bent down and kissed her gently on the cheek your courage will yet sustain all of us zenoria later as he joined keen on the quarterdeck and watched the white forts and harbour opening up to receive the slowmoving seventyfour he had forcibly to restrain his anxiety the salutes began to boom across the placid water and a flag dipped above the nearest battery there were many ships at anchor and several large menofwar he raised a telescope and held it carefully to his good eye a smart twodecker lay nearest to the jetty a rearadmirals flag flapping only occasionally from her mizzen he felt a catch in his throat there was no mistaking the benbow pictures flashed through his mind he had been a rearadmiral when was it three years back in the baltic when his nephew had been the ships third lieutenant and herrick his flagcaptain he tried to thrust her fat blackandbuff hull from his mind as with something close to physical force he continued to examine the busy anchorage thank god the lens settled on a sturdy brig which was anchored almost end on no wonder he had not seen her he waited impatiently for the gentle breeze to swing her again on her cable until the sunlight glinted on her glided counter bolitho read her name lord egmont although he already knew it well she was one of the oldest in the fleet of falmouth packets he had known her since he had been a junior lieutenant he had felt certain she would be here he had seen her name in his admiralty instructions but wind and sea a change of events could have altered things and even nowhe lowered the glass and the brig fell away into hazy distance again the last smoke from the salute still hung over the yards as men were piped to hoist out the two cutters in case the wind was insufficient to turn the ship at her anchorage a swaying guardboat with a limp anchor flag in her bows waited pinned down on the glittering water probably the only interested group to watch their arrival warships were too common for comment only the transports and the mail carriers from england excited real attention nowadays keen cupped his hands be ready to let go mr paget he glanced quickly at bolitho his expression suddenly apprehensive but not for himself bolitho shaded his eyes and stared at the waterfront with its ancient fortifications and busy markets a sailors port a warren of activity he bit his lip a place for spies too the admiral would be watching pullen too keen said fireflys already gone sir aye adam at least would be well out of it no matter how he wanted to help is it something about us the cornish he wondered a senior officer had once told him to his face cornishmen pirates and rebels the whole bunch of you it seemed to take an age before argonaute finally took up her anchorage her sails furled neatly to her yards awnings were spread and the ship settled down to await events bolitho watched the boats coming to the chains the officeroftheguard a chandler from the dockyard an embarrassedlooking ensign from the garrison who had come to collect millie the maid she seemed unwilling to leave and despite the grins of the watching sailors clung to the ships corporal as if her life depended on it keen watched from the poop his thoughts elsewhere as visitors and some of his own officers waited to make their claims upon his time he saw lieutenant stayt speaking with the boatswain and then a party of seamen loosening the lashings on the barge in readiness for hoisting her outboard bolitho was going ashore earlier than he had expected and it made him uneasy the officeroftheguard touched his hat and handed keen an officiallooking envelope he looked ill at ease like someone performing his duty against his nature but at the same time afraid of being tainted by too close a contact it was a summons from the admirals headquarters to appear before a court of inquiry two days hence the flagofficerincharge must have sent it as soon as argonautes sails had been sighted stayt waited for the guardboat to leave the chains and then came aft i have to take sir richards despatches to the flagofficer here sir keen nodded so stayt was taking the barge that explained it he noticed that bankart the second coxswain was in charge of the bargemen that was unusual he thought allday usually handled her when they were in harbour or under the eyes of the fleet he heard midshipman hickling request permission to take the jollyboat to a nearby merchantman and pagets approval when he learned that there was a message to be carried across from the admiral keen glanced up at the flag when it was hauled down again it might mean the end for both of them midshipman sheaffe hurried up to the poop ladder and said the admirals compliments sir and would you see him at eight bells keen tightened his jaw if bolitho had any good news for him he would not wait for another hour almost savagely he called to paget i want all boats lowered send a lieutenant in each one to examine the hull it was unlikely that they had overlooked any damage from the brief battle and keen knew he was being unfair to give them extra work eventually keen heard the bell chime from the forecastle it was time he thought suddenly of his home in hampshire it would be cold there probably wet too as the villagers prepared for winter and if need be an attempted invasion by the french what would his brothers and sisters say when they heard the news of his court martial and he could see no alternative to one his father would be distressed especially as he had been against his youngest son entering the navy in the first place he passed the sentry and stepped into the glowing lights of the stern cabin keen was surprised to find bolitho dressed in his long boatcloak and for an instant imagined that stayt had misunderstood his orders but bolitho said calmly i am going ashore val i will take your gig if i may he gave a quick smile as if he was on edge less formal i thought keen said the ship is secured sir and both watches have been stood down bolitho watched him gravely except for certain lieutenants i gather he nodded good never trust to luck where hull damage is concerned allday padded across the cabin and took down the old sword keen watched so bolitho was not going to visit the admiral who commanded in malta it was getting a bit late for formalities anyway he decided bolitho settled his sword against his hip and said take charge of the gig allday he glanced towards the stern windows the thick glass was twinkling with countless lights from the shore like the dawn the night came swiftly there was a quick exchange of glances but bolitho faced allday steadily and said we dont have much time allday looked at keen but said nothing they were alone bolitho said i shall be aboard the lord egmont before i step ashore keen nodded he had seen the packet preparing to upanchor men swarming on her deck to secure some extra cargo probably her masters own booty bolitho said this were better done quickly val he raised his voice are you ready keen stared as the midshipman entered from the opposite screen door i did not realize you were he stared as the girl met his gaze and looked at him she was dressed in a complete midshipmans uniform and even wore a finely gilded dirk at her side keen stepped towards her his hands outstretched as she removed her hat and he saw what allday had done to her hair it was short the ends tied neatly with a black ribbon as befitted a young gentleman about to take charge of his admirals boat bolitho watched them suddenly glad of what he was doing with a court of inquiry about to begin and the enemy stirred into the mood for revenge there was little room for mere people he said ill be on deck no side party eh as the door closed keen took her in his arms he could feel her heart pounding against him despite the padding she wore beneath her shirt to disguise her figure you did not tell me even as he said it he guessed what bolitho had done his sudden agitation as they had entered harbour the lord egmont would be sailing to falmouth she was as familiar there as pendennis castle he asked me to remain silent she looked up at him her lashes shining in the soft lights i have a letter and some money in case he hugged her against him still tighter he had prayed for her safety even if it meant losing her but now that the moment had come he could scarcely bear it she said softly now i must tell you my dearest one you must be brave for both of us a boat clattered alongside and keen heard alldays voice taking command when i reach england she put her hands to his face and held it i will be waiting she watched him steadily no matter what happens i shall be there for you she kissed him slowly and then stood away i love thee my dear captain he watched her replace her hat and tilt it over her eyes she was very contained like brittle steel ready sir he nodded wanting to hold her again but knowing it would finish both of them carry on if you please mr carwithen it was almost dark on deck and keen saw that the lantern by the entry port had been doused the boat was waiting below the stairs and there were few figures on deck to notice that someone was leaving the ship keen saw that tuson was there paget too but nobody spoke even the masters mateofthewatch stood back as bolitho passed as if he did not exist keen brushed her arm the small contact tearing him apart it is their way they will miss you too she looked into the gloom and then touched her hat before she clambered down the side bolitho glanced at keen the lordegmonts master is an old friend val i made certain he was still in command before i entrusted our passenger to his care he flung his cloak over one shoulder there is not a moment to delay keen said we were just in time sir bolitho looked down into the boat where allday would be worrying about his descent a time to care val there must always be room for that then without another glance he lowered himself down to the boat as the oars slashed at the water keen could just see allday in the sternsheets one hand covering hers on the tiller but hidden from the oarsmen by bolithos shoulders ozzard bounded across the deck and exclaimed in a desperate whisper the gown sir shes forgot it keen watched until the gig had merged with the anchored shadows and then replied no matter i shall hand it to her myself in england divided royalties the residence of the flagofficer in charge of all his majestys ships stores and dockyards in the island of malta was a fine imposing building after the dusty sunlight of the streets bolitho found the room to which he had been ushered both welcome and cool one long window looked out across the harbour the crowded ships at the anchors the crisscrossing wakes of cutters and gigs as the navy got down to work for another day waiting in the navy you always seemed to be doing it as a midshipman or lieutenant and even as a captain when did it cease he wondered he thought of the brig lord egmont and pictured her under full sail heading for the rock she would not pause there for fear of fever but would head out to the atlantic and drop anchor only when she was in carrick roads within sight of the bolitho home he thought too of the brigs small cabin and her master isaac tregidgo facing him across the table the master had a face like a block of weathered wood lined and scarred by years at sea fast passages and quick rewards tregidgos name was legendary even amongst other masters in the falmouth packet service storms fever piracy and war the old man had faced them all he must be over seventy bolitho thought and he had known him all his life even his greeting had been typical sit ye down dick he had grinned hugely as bolitho had dropped his boatcloak an i hears yewm been honoured by king george no less he had wheezed in the thick air of pipe smoke and brandy but yewm still dick to me bolitho had heard the girl moving about in the adjoining cabin it was little more than a hutch but it was safe the master had eyed him curiously might ave guessed yewd be up to summat admirals flag or not he had raised a fist like a smoked ham not to worry dick shes safe with me i knows me crew are a bunch o roughknots but i often carry me grandchildren on short passages the men knows bettern to cuss an blaspheme in front o them he had shaken the fist grimly ill give any man even me own kin a striped shirt at the gangway if i catches im at it the brig had stirred at her cable and old tregidgo had squinted at the deckhead winds favourin me dick he had added slowly ill see er right just like you said in yer letter he had watched him from beneath his sprouting white brows yewm not seeing too well are yew dick he had turned aside to hide his compassion god will watch e the girl had entered the cabin selfconsciously the midshipmans coat and dirk in her hands keep the shoes bolitho held her hands mr hickling will not miss them you will have to remain a youth until you reach falmouth she had watched him with that same misty stare he had first seen it was like an unspoken question he was still not sure how to answer it he had said i am sending you to my sister nancy she will know what to do he had gripped her hands tightly knowing she would pull away as he added her husband is the squire and the senior magistrate but sir hell have me he had said no i am not overkeen on the man but he will not fail over this he wrapped his cloak around him and reached for the companion she had said i shall never forget you sir richard he had turned to see the tears in her eyes the sad beauty which even her shorn hair and crumpled shirt could not conceal nor i you brave zenoria on deck he had found the bewildered hickling waiting for him a midshipman had left with him one would return he had handed him his coat and dirk hickling would be safe no matter what happened no one could blame a mere midshipman for obeying his viceadmiral by the bulwark the old man said i ear youve one o th stayt boys as yer aide dick from up north bolitho smiled to a cornishman up north meant merely the opposite strip of coastline yes there were no secrets for long in cornwall except from the revenue officers tregidgo had gestured in the darkness towards the skylight shes best along of me then why dyou say that well er father was mixed up in the trouble near zennor when a man got killed an the dragoons was called stayt was a magistrate like the one whos wed to yer sister he had wheezed the one they calls th king o cornwall the master had leaned closer and had murmured it was im wot anged er father im fair surprised young stayt didnt mention that so am i bolitho had lowered himself into the boat and had told allday to head for the jetty he had to think and he knew that keen would want to see him as soon as he returned sentries had barred his way to the repair docks until he had thrown off his cloak and they had stared with astonishment at his epaulettes allday had followed him anxiously watching each step in case he lost his balance and fell into a dock there were some lanterns by the dock where supreme lay in the gloom she looked as before her wounds and state of repair hidden in shadow allday had whispered goin aboard sir no unwilling or unable he still did not know but he had walked along the rough stones until he had drawn level with the taffrail where the ball had struck and flung him down now standing in the sunlight by the window supreme seemed like part of a strange dream a cruel reminder he thought again of tregidgos words about stayt on his way here to present himself to the flagofficerincharge bolitho had been tempted more than once to ask stayt directly about it his flaglieutenant had said nothing even though he must have been aware that the girl was no longer on board bolitho had sent stayt ashore in the barge to protect his reputation and any suggestion of involvement or had he was the mistrust already there two servants threw open the high doors and bolitho turned to face the man who seemed to fill the entrance sir marcus laforey admiral of the blue was gross to a point which even his immaculate uniform could not hide he had heavylidded eyes and a wide mouth and when he walked with some difficulty to a chair bolitho saw that one of his legs was bandaged gout the curse of several admirals he knew admiral laforey sank carefully into the chair and winced as a servant eased a cushion beneath his foot when seated he looked like an irritable toad bolitho thought the admiral waved his handkerchief sit down bolitho the lids lifted slightly in a quick appraisal bothersome about all this what bolitho sat down and got the impression that his chair had already been carefully positioned so as not to be too close laforey had been on one land appointment after another and had not been in command at sea since before the war he looked dried out obscene and malta would very likely be his last appointment the next would be in heaven read the report bolitho good news about the french seventyfour make em think what bolitho tightened his hold on his sword with the chair half turned towards the window his vision was blurred he stared at a point beyond the admirals fat shoulder and said i believe the french will be out soon sir jobert may be hoping to make a diversion so that the main fleet can slip out of toulon egypt or the strait of gibraltar laforey grunted dont speak to me about gibraltar that bloody fever not safe to let anything or anyone land here if theyve been there en route this place is like a ship aground theres always some sort of sickness amongst the people an the military he touched his brow with the handkerchief good wine is gettin scarce spanish muck an little else dammit he had not listened to a word bolitho thought laforey stirred himself now about this court of inquiry what my captain is accused laforey wagged a spatulate finger no no dear fellow not accused others may have to do that it is all a mere formality i have not read the details but my flagcaptain and this mr er pullen from their lordships assure me that it will be a matter of hours rather than days bolitho said evenly captain keen is possibly the best officer i have ever had under me sir marcus he has shown his courage and excellence on many occasions from midshipman to command in my opinion he should rate flag rank laforeys lids lifted again and beneath them the small eyes were cold and without pity bit young id have thought too many inexperienced popinjays about these days what he glared at his bandaged foot if i could hoist my flag above the channel fleet instead of this this he stared round resentfully id soon make the mothers boys shed a few tears he tried to lean forward but his belly prevented him now see here bolitho what really happened eh he searched bolithos face as if for an answer needed a woman did he bolitho stood up i will not discuss my officers in this fashion sir marcus surprisingly laforey seemed pleased suit yerself the court will sit tomorrow if captain keen is sensible i am sure that you will be able to put to sea without further delay there is a convoy due and i cannot stand incompetence anything which might make life here even more unbearable he watched as bolitho stood up i hear you were wounded too sir richard he did not expand on it it is part of our service indeed sir bolitho could barely conceal the irony in his voice there will be many more if the french succeed in joining their fleets together laforey shrugged i am afraid i cannot entertain you longer sir richard my day is full i sometimes wonder if their lordships and whitehall realize the extent of my responsibility here the interview was over bolitho walked down a passageway and saw a servant with a tray carrying two decanters and a single goblet towards the room he had just left the admiral was about to extend his responsibility he thought bitterly stayt was waiting for him in the marble lobby he watched curiously as bolitho shaded his eyes to stare at the harbour then he said you asked about the benbow sir she has recently completed an overhaul here and whose flag has she hoisted i thought you would know sir she is rearadmiral herricks flagship bolitho turned towards the shadows in the lobby to contain his feelings the last part of the pattern as he had known there would be it was not imagination now he knew it even before stayt said rearadmiral herrick is to take the chair at the court of inquiry sir i shall see him it might be unwise sir stayts deepset eyes watched him calmly it could be misconstrued by some that is thomas herrick his best friend who had nearly died for him more than once in his mind he could see herricks eyes clear blue stubborn at times too easily hurt above all honest now the word honest seemed to stand out to mock him stayt said there will be a letter awaiting you aboard argonaute i understand sir you will not need to attend the court a written statement will suffice bolitho turned towards him his voice hard will you write one also stayt met his gaze without flinching i am ordered to attend the court to give evidence sir it was like being snared in an invisible net which was being squeezed tighter every hour i shall be there be certain of that stayt followed him into the dusty sunshine and waited on the steps which faced the harbour bolitho said did you imagine i would stand by and say nothing well did you if there is anything i can do sir bolitho felt his eye sting and knew it was anger rather than injury not for the present you are dismissed return to the ship he strode down towards the jetty where allday stood by the barge there were other argonaute boats nearby and stayt would have to use one of them the boat coxswains stood up and touched their hats as they saw him their routine did not allow for emotions like his stores had to be arranged and the purser would have been ashore since first light to carry out his bargaining with chandlers and traders alike bolitho said to the benbow if you please allday watched him enter the barge without any show of surprise herrick was here it was only proper they should meet no matter what some might think mates were mates high or low give way all the greenpainted barge slid through the busy thoroughfare other boats raising their oars or backing water to allow a flagofficer to have free passage bolitho sat stiffly in the sternsheets only his eyes moving as he focused them on familiar things masts and rigging seabirds and small clouds above the fortress damn laforey and his drinksodden indifference and anyone else who had a part in this he glanced at the stroke oarsman and quickly along the bronzed faces of the barge crew they all knew probably the whole fleet did too well let them vague thoughts flashed through his mind of belindas letter of stayts cool demeanour as he had mentioned his summons to the inquiry and of inch and the squadron who expected him to be above mere human reactionsor did they it would certainly not be the first time he had acted against the dictates of authority he gave a small bitter smile it must run in the family his father who to his sons had always appeared as the stern model example of a sea officer had once fallen out with his army equivalent during a siege in the east indies captain james bolitho had solved the problem by arresting the soldier for negligence and then going on to win the battle had he lost it bolitho had no doubt that the familys naval connection would have ended there allday murmured she looks proud sir richard it sounded unusually formal allday never forgot himself when others were present well hardly the seventyfourgun benbow did indeed make a fine sight newly painted and her rigging like black glass yards crossed with each sail furled to match its companion the ports were all open and bolitho had no difficulty in hearing their fearful thunder at copenhagen and later against the french flying squadron it never failed to tear at his memory of the time he had been a prisoner of france and his subsequent escape allday had been with him then had carried the dying john neale after his ship had foundered yes many memories lay stored within her deep hull the barge swept round a wide arc and he saw the side party rushing to their station the royal marines dressing into lines his unexpected arrival would get them on the move bolitho smiled again wrong herrick would have expected it benbow must be almost ready for sea he thought only a few local boats lay alongside and just one tackle was swaying up cargo nets to the men on the gangway bolitho murmured stand off allday ill not be long he saw alldays face in the sunlight caught it for just a moment as he carefully steered the sleek barge towards the mainchains bolitho was shocked to see the strain on his strong features ashamed that he had not thought about his worries over his son oarsup the pale oars rose dripping in twin lines their blades perfectly matched allday had done well up the tumblehome to the piercing twitter of calls and then the drums and fifes of the marines pipeclay floated like white dust above the guard as they presented arms for his benefit and here was thomas herrick hastening to meet him his round face beaming and letting the formality blow away like the pipeclay herrick exclaimed come aft sir richard he gave a shy smile im not yet accustomed to it nor i bolitho thought as they strode beneath the familiar poop here and here men had locked weapons and died up there shot had raked away seamen and marines alike and where two small midshipmen were listening intently to the sailingmaster he had been struck down in the great cabin it was warm although the windows and skylights were all wide open herrick bustled round the stench of paint and tar makes this place like chatham dockyard a cabin servant was placing goblets on a tray and bolitho sat down beneath a skylight his shirt already clinging to his skin he watched herrick affectionately his hair was tufted with grey and his body was stockier probably from married life and dulcies cooking but when he turned he seemed just as before the same clear blue eyes the searching curiosity as he looked at his friend originally his captain in another war when mutiny had been a greater threat than the enemy i saw young adam when he was here er richard bolitho took a goblet and placed it beside him claret herricks taste had risen with his rank herrick added a fine brig itll be a frigate next what hes always dreamed of the rascal if he stays out of trouble he paused his eyes suddenly worried well anyway heres to you dear friend and may lady luck stay with you bolitho reached for his goblet but missed it and caught it with his cuff the wine spilled over the table like blood and as herrick and the servant hurried to help bolitho said no i can manage it came out more sharply than he had intended and he said im sorry thomas herrick nodded slowly and poured another goblet himself i heard of course richard it was a shock he leaned over and stared at bolitho for the first time yet i see nothing no damage except perhaps bolitho dropped his gaze aye thomas except perhaps they sum it up very well he drank the goblet without knowing what he had done about the inquiry thomas herrick leaned back in his chair and regarded him gravely it will be here in this cabin tomorrow it is rubbish thomas bolitho needed to get up and move about as he had done so often in this place god you know valentine keen hes a fine man and is now an excellent captain of course i remember everything about him weve sailed together often enough he became serious i cannot talk about the inquiry richard but you know that you have had this filthy job yourself yes my flaglieutenant warned me that i should not come herrick watched him worriedly he was right any sort of discussion would might be seen as collusion we are all friends bolitho stared hotly at the windows i was beginning to wonder he did not see the hurt in herricks eyes when i flew my flag here and you commanded benbow young val was captain of nicator remember he did not wait for a reply but hurried on then when i went to the west indies and we fought over that damned island san felipe val gave up a larger vessel to come to achates a little sixtyfour because i asked him to be my flagcaptain herrick gripped the table i know i know richard but the fact is that we are all here to conduct an inquiry i have my orders otherwise i would say nothing more about it bolitho tried to relax anything and everything seemed to seize him like claws since his injury he picked up the goblet and knew herrick was trying not to watch in case he knocked it over again he said i shall come myself i had no intention of sending a written statement as if it were just a secondary matter my captains future is in danger and ill not stand by and see him slandered by enemies i can only guess at herrick stood up and gestured to the servant who immediately withdrew another ozzard herrick said steadily keen behaved wrongly when he removed a prisoner from a ship under a government warrant the fact that she is a woman could only add meat to the pot bolitho pictured the filthy convict transport and young zenoria as he had last seen her the girl who would carry a scar on her body for the rest of her life she would have died but for keen nobody could have foreseen what would transpire from that one savage incident it was a miracle that her mind had not been equally scarred herrick said had she been an ordinary male prisoner well she was not thomas she was wrongly charged and wrongly transported god man they wanted her out of the way because of her father herrick shifted under bolithos angry stare but others will say bolitho stood up my warm wishes to dulcie when next you write herrick was on his feet too dont leave like this richard bolitho breathed slowly to compose himself before he faced the side party and marine guard who else will be present you can at least tell me that surely he did not hide his bitterness herrick replied admiral sir marcus laforey will be taking part and the inquiry will be conducted by his flagcaptain he said abruptly the woman is she still aboard argonaute bolitho picked up his hat and i cannot answer that thomas he walked through the door it might be seen as collusion it was unwarranted and unfair bolitho knew it but there was more at stake now than strong words it would not require a bad verdict in the court of inquiry to damage keens future rumour would soon spread it had to be stopped overwhelmed like a forest fire under a cloudburst the two flagofficers walked to the entry port together but bolitho had never felt so isolated from his friend he had known him longer even than allday who had been pressed aboard that same ship he hesitated as the first rank of scarlet coats moved into his vision the coloursergeant on the end his eyes fixed on the nearest buildings along the shore was strangely stiff even anxious bolitho hesitated and then the face came back helping him on that terrible day just an ordinary marine then he said quietly mccall i remember you well the sergeant remained rigid his captain watching beyond bolithos shoulder but his eyes moved and he said thank you sir he hesitated as if afraid he was going too far it were a fierce battle that un sir an no mistake bolitho smiled aye im glad you are doing well in the corps his words seemed to have another meaning as he added take good care that others do not spoil your efforts the contact was broken as the calls trilled once more bolitho paused in the entry port and removed his hat to the quarterdeck after tomorrow this ship might never seem the same again he knew herrick was watching him his eyes filled with concern in case he stumbled because of his distorted vision or because he knew that not for the first time his own honesty had come between them captain francis inch leaned across his chart and tugged repeatedly at his left ear as he often did when he was contemplating his next move around him the cabin heaved and shuddered as helicon rolled uncomfortably in a rising wind it was almost noon but because of a thickening mist which even the wind was refusing to disperse visibility was reduced to a few miles he could see the ships in his mind despatch directly astern and icarus a blurred outline at the tailend of the line inch hated the uncertainty of the weather the wind had veered greatly in the two days since bolitho had left the squadron it now blew almost directly from the west from france he studied his chart more closely very aware of the other two captains who remained silent as they sipped their wine two hundred miles southwest of toulon and already floundering in the rising wind if it did not back soon or drop in force they might be driven far off their station or worse scatter so that they would lose contact altogether he pictured the little brig rapid far ahead of her companions inch was working her hard but he envied her commander quarrell more than he cared to admit at least he had freedom of movement while they blustered along keeping station ponderous and slow he looked up and saw the broken white horses through the stern windows captain houston said i must leave soon or ill never find my ship in this montresor of the despatch said cant do anything unless the wind quietens down inch looked at them impatiently negative neither willing to search beyond the obvious montresor was proving to be a good captain but always seemed to take a lead from the sourfaced houston the latter remarked i still think its madness to keep our one and only frigate on some wild deception when she could be with us encouraged by inchs silence he continued in his harsh voice we cant possibly seek out local craft with only rapid to do it inch glanced round his cabin it looked french still in spite of the paintings he had hung around it pictures of country scenes brooks and meadows churches and farms like his own dorset home he thought momentarily of hannah his wife she had already given him a little son and another child was on the way how could she imagine what he was doing he wondered he said viceadmiral bolitho has explained about barracouta i accept his judgement houston said naturally he smiled wryly at montresor but then we have not known him as long as you inch showed his teeth in a dangerous grin he made me actingcommodore until his return that should be enough for you i think houstons smile vanished at inchs change of tone i wasnt doubting the thinking behind this its just that quite inch listened to the groan of timbers the distant crack of canvas as the ship leaned uncomfortably from the wind it felt wrong and incomplete without bolitho he always seemed able to foretell what the enemy might do and inch had never known him to scoff at or underestimate what the french had up their sleeves houston said maybe we should pass word to the squadron off toulon nelson might have views on what were about i still think the french will head for egypt again as they attempt to break out we beat em once at the nile but they might favour a second attempt he stood up and swayed to the decks slant i must leave with your permission inch nodded regretfully there were many things he needed to discuss but houston was right much worse and he would never fight his way back to his own ship he heard a voice on the wind far away lost montresor said theyve sighted something he shuddered not a good day for it there was a tap at the door inchs first lieutenant had come in person signal from rapid sir sail in sight to the norwest he glanced at the others winds getting up sir shall i order another reef inch tugged his ear no prepare to see these gentlemen into their boats after that i want to signal rapid before we lose contact he turned to the others as the lieutenant hurried away rapid is unlikely to report or even sight a fishing boat in this weather he watched his words going home i must close on her immediately so keep station on helicon and be prepared to fight montresor stared at him he had not been a captain long enough to learn how to hide his feelings the french you really think so inch thought of bolitho how he would have presented it yes i do the wind is right for them equally it is unfavourable to us he shrugged his bony shoulders however we must do what we came to do at least we are ready for them the two captains left the ship with unseemly haste helicon heavingto for the minimum of time before butting into the heavy rollers once again inch stared up at the masthead the pendant standing out and seemingly almost at right angles to the ship he glanced at the compass northeast by east spray swept over the weather nettings and made the watchkeepers duck and swear savill his first lieutenant shouted above the wind masthead reports that rapid has her signal still hoisted sir he looked excited glad perhaps that they were doing something other than beating up and down inch considered it that probably meant that quarrell had sighted or anticipated more than one strange sail signal from despatch sir her captain is safely on board inch grunted fretting as he thought of houstons boat smashing its way further astern to his own command the masthead lookout yelled signal from rapid sir two sail in sight to the norwest inch looked at his secondincommand two sails it would not be any of nelsons fleet so far south in the golfe du lion and certainly no trader would attempt to break the blockade in this weather especially in company with another he pondered houstons words he was right about one thing barracouta would make all the difference if she were here i think the french mean business this time mr savill make more sail if you please i intend to close on rapid now he took a telescope and climbed to the poop to look for icarus he saw the wet mist far astern even despatch was shrouded in it god what a time for it to happen he snapped to the midshipmanofthewatch who had followed him like a terrier general signal make more sail he saw the flags break out to the wind very bright against the low cloud it was his chance for once he was not looking to the flagship for instructions he was in command today hannah would look at him with those adoring violet eyes when he told her nobody could have guessed or anticipated that bolitho would be struck down by a stray ball and not even in the midst of battle keen was in malta although to inch it had seemed absurd that he should be taken away for some stupid inquiry but no matter the whys and the wherefores francis inch was in temporary charge of the squadron it was like having a weight suddenly lifted he knew he had no doubts and could deal with this without anxiety he glanced around the deck proud of his ship and her company he watched the hands moving out along the yards their white trousers flapping wildly as they fought into the wind canvas thundered out and bulged to the pressure so that the deck heeled over even further another look astern there was icarus visible just briefly astern of despatch a ghost ship he grinned into the spray houston was a miserable man he thought deck there that was one of the lieutenants savill had done right to put an experienced officer up there rapid has signalled three sail of the line to the norwest inch felt a tingle run through his body three there was no doubt now they might try to avoid a confrontation but inch had no doubts about what he would do must do general signal mr savill prepare for battle he made himself smile after that you may clear for action he thought of bolitho and felt sudden pride that he had entrusted this day to him the drums began to roll and as helicon hurled spray over her beakhead the violence of sea and wind seemed like a foretaste of their destiny west wind inch stared up at the topsails as spindrift floated through the drumming shrouds like ragged banners there was much movement and the hull was staggering over each successive crest every stay and ringbolt protesting to the violent motion but he knew that all the noise and discomfort hid the fact that their progress was slow painfully so unless the wind backed in their favourhe pushed the conjecture from his mind bring her up a point mr savill steer noreast he heard the muted cries of the topmen the hiss of halliards and blocks as his men fought to obey him he dare not let her pay off just to gain more advantage from the wind he must leave that until the last moment when manoeuvrability would count the most the second lieutenant was up there on the crosstrees watching the oncoming vessels although even his vision must have been impaired by spray and the persistent layers of wet mist the land was only five miles abeam and yet it was invisible the sea had changed completely in a single hour from sharkblue to pewter and then to angered crests which broke in the wind as it moaned through shrouds and running rigging like an onslaught of demented souls savill lurched up the canting deck his face and chest running with water cleared for action sir inch bit his lip they could not attempt to open the lower gunports on the lee side they would flood the whole deck in minutes he comforted himself with the thought that the three french ships would not be finding it easy either how could he be sure they were french spanish maybe he discounted it instantly as he pictured rapids young commander quarrell would have signalled the fact by now he considered his feelings they were the enemy another time a different place the same flag savill said no sign of icarus sir he grinned a change indeed it was well known in the squadron that houston always liked to be the first and the best this time he was sadly lagging behind the others three to three good odds maybe the enemy would try to avoid them there was little chance inch decided if they headed for open sea helicon would lead the others round to take better advantage of the wind no it was far more likely that the french commander would continue on a converging tack with that same wind offering him all the advantage inch looked at his ship cleared of unnecessary gear the nets rigged above the gangways the arms chests opened below the mainmast the gun crews were stripped to the waist their bodies already wet from spray as they crouched around their weapons or listened to their captains inboard of the black breeches the lieutenants moved restlessly about their bodies angled to the tilt and shuddering vibration each time that helicon ploughed into a trough or roller run up the colours mr savill he looked round for the royal marines officer ah major i suggest you tell your fifers to strike up a jig eh he gave his wide horsy grin it will be a while yet before we match points with the frogs and so helicon followed as closely as her people could manage by despatch headed towards the distant sails the small marine fifers marched up and down the deck playing jig after jig sometimes barely able to keep on their feet inch saw his gun crews watching and grinning at the miniature parade it took their minds off the inevitable only here and there a man stared across the nettings or above a gangway to seek out the enemy new men probably he thought or those who had done it before too often he glanced at his first lieutenant a good and reliable officer he seemed popular with the hands and that was a real bounty it was a difficult thing for a first lieutenant to be deck there savill remarked god he has much to say today several of the men near him laughed but all smiles faded as the lieutenant in the crosstrees continued the leading sail is a threedecker sir inch felt them all looking at him a first or second ratebad odds but he had known worse signal despatch repeated icarus close line of battle the threedeckers captain would be quick to exploit any weakness in his adversary inch thought eventually the signals midshipman lowered his glass acknowledged sir inch paced back and forth deep in thought it was taking much too long he looked up as the air quaked to sporadic cannon fire what th devil the masthead yelled firin on rapid sir inch swore signal rapid to stand away what does that young fool think hes playing at if he tries to harass one of those ladies hell soon get a bloody nose savill had climbed on to the shrouds with his telescope and shouted one of the ships is closing with rapid sir trying to cut her off from us inch stared at him facing a battle and yet the french commander seemed prepared to waste time and strength on a small brig houstons words seemed to mock him as if he had just spoken them aloud rapid was their only link now that supreme was in dock but for bolitho she would have been on the bottom now with barracouta to the north the brigs importance was paramount no acknowledgement sir god damn inch looked round chase your younkers aloft and get the tgansls on her mr savill then the main course lively with it he watched the hands rushing to obey the pipe the wild freedom of the topgallant sails as they were released from their yards he felt the ship shivering to the extra power and when the mainsail thundered out he saw its yard bend and knew he was risking everything to cut down the range before one of the french guns scored a fatal hit on rapid he said urgently general signal make more sail savill glanced at the sailingmaster and saw him grimace aye aye sir the cannon fire continued with just an occasional gun being used it would only require one of those massive balls to bring down the brigs masts or hit something vital below deck signal from despatch sir the midshipman was almost yelling in difficulty inch snatched a glass and ran up a poop ladder where his marines leaned on the muskets and waited for something to do he rested the telescope on the hammocks and felt his heart go cold as he saw the other twodeckers outline changing as she paid off to the wind he did not notice the anguish in his voice as he exclaimed steerings gone he saw the sails being taken in tiny figures risking death on the madly pitching yards as they struggled to prevent the ship from being laid over or dismasted it was common enough in a gale the rudder or a parted yokeline it was just another hazard and could always be repaired but the gap was already widening and icarus was completely invisible in the lurking mist he hurried down the ladder and saw savills anxious expression others were staring at him with dismay when moments earlier they had been ready and willing to fight it will take despatch a hundred years mr savill she will be as helpless as rapid if we cry in our aprons and do nought savill seemed to relax you can rely on me sir inch looked at him i never doubted it now have the guns loaded but do not run out until i order it he turned away as the gun crews leaped from their various stances to seize their rammers and handspikes despatch was continuing to drift the enemy must be wondering what was happening some ruse or trap to make the french commander think again inch frowned not for long we will engage to larboard mr savill he narrowed his eyes as he stared across the packed hammocks he could see the other ships now without a glass the three of them were advancing in echelon their masts and sails overlapping to create one monster leviathan the rearmost ship was the one which was firing on the brig rapid was trying to haul off but the last waterspout from a falling ball showed how close it had been inchs coxswain hurried towards him his captains hanger in his hands inch looked at the curved fighting sword no the other one he thought of bolitho in his best uniform while the ship had rocked to the thunder of broadsides bolitho had known that he stood out as the captain a sure target at any time but he had also known it was necessary that his own people should see him until the end when was that it seemed a lifetime ago he allowed his coxswain to buckle on his best sword the one he had bought before getting married to his dear hannah just thinking her name was like a cry from the heart he forced the door closed on her and shouted well take em down with us eh lads they cheered as he had known they would here they come he watched the oncoming sails writhing and altering their outline as each captain reduced his canvas and prepared to fight the leading ship made a splendid terrible sight as she suddenly opened her ports and the black snouts showed themselves deck by deck inch watched in silence it was as if his heart had already stopped he was unable to move or drag his eyes from the enemy she was a ninetygun ship at least she had a bright figurehead beneath her beakhead and when inch raised his telescope he saw that it was fashioned in the likeness of a springing beast a leopard with both its front paws reaching out in anger it was jobert it had to be open the ports mr savill then run out to larboard there was still time time to run inch hardened his heart have the boats cast adrift mr savill it was always a bad moment when the boats were cut free to drift on a sea anchor until recovered by the victors being left aboard on their tier doubled the risk of flying splinters when the enemys iron pounded across the decks but to any sailor boats represented safety a chance to survive inch began to pace between the quarterdeck guns his chin in his neckcloth the bright sword slapping against his thigh except for his men there would be no survival bolitho felt the sun across his shoulders magnified by the thick glass as argonaute swung heavily to her cable he could hear the watch on deck shouting as they hoisted one of the boats inboard he put down his pen and looked moodily through the windows towards the shore and at the cluster of shipping which lay between it and the flagship it would soon be time to leave for herricks ship bolitho thought of yesterdays meeting more so of the parting it had grieved him and he felt trapped with few courses left to attempt he watched the craft huddled together as if the great harbour was no longer a haven and they wanted to put to sea the expected convoy had been sighted at first light bolitho had heard the warning gun while he had toyed restlessly with his breakfast the harbour would be crammed with ships he could not finish the letter to belinda before he had to leave boots tramped across the damp planking and he guessed the marines were preparing to see him over the side keens gig had already left bolitho had spoken with him only briefly they had shaken hands it had reminded bolitho of a highwayman he had seen doing just that with his executioner before the trap had dropped beneath his kicking legs why had he told belinda because she deserved to know or was it merely that he had to confide in her because he needed her was that it he sighed and stood up the pen left beside the letter the ship was swaying quite steeply and he wondered if the wind would be gone before he sailed if he sailed he stared at himself in the mirror much as herrick had looked at him his right eye felt almost normal or perhaps he had become used to it the left he sighed again it was no worse but the least strain and he felt it his balance still unsure even now in harbour he had to consider every move he heard ozzard in the next cabin brushing his best coat and thought of keen in his as he had left the ship he was youthful and mature all in one no wonder they loved each other he thought of the girl with the brown misty eyes how far had the packet reached he wondered there was a light tap on the door and as the sentry said nothing bolitho knew it was allday he too was in his best blue jacket with the gilt buttons which he prized his nankeen trousers looked newly cleaned and his buckled shoes would do credit to a postcaptain allday watched him grimly barge is alongside sir im coming i want to be on time not early allday nodded and tried to smile keep em guessin eh sir something like that he saw allday glance at the unfinished letter for the next courier allday sounded distant i heard that the convoy will unload today an tomorrow then itll sail for england again or some of it will bolitho looked at him what else have you heard allday was a better source of information than any signal and usually far more accurate allday said two of em are carryin gold from the sultan o turkey whoever he might be when es at ome for whatever reason or purpose the sultans wealth would be more than welcome in england it sounded like nelsons hand behind it he had received several favours from the sultan after their victory at the nile ozzard entered and held out the coat for him bolitho looked at the mirror a changed man again to any outsider he would seem to be and to have everything rank authority a beautiful wife everything he touched the gold nile medal which hung about his neck is this what a hero looks like hardly as he felt he decided let us go bolitho touched alldays sleeve then drew him aside i have not forgotten about your son allday met his gaze his eyes steady but sad i ave sir he wants to quit the service an good riddance i say ozzard had gone on ahead and bolitho heard captain bouteiller calling his marines to attention but he said you dont mean that allday allday stuck out his jaw dont you fret about im sir its you im fair bothered for after all you done for king an country an now youre goin across to benbow to smash all of it bolitho said dont be ridiculous man you dont know what the hell youre saying allday took a slow breath his chest wound bothered him sometimes when he became excited or angry yes i do sir an you knows it as they walked towards the screen door allday added fiercely ive said me piece one more thing sir ill be right there with you bolitho swung round shocked by the distress in his voice i know that old friend your loyalty means more to me than he did not finish if anything alldays simple acceptance had decided him as allday had known all the time bolitho barely noticed the swift pull to benbow through the entry port more salutes formal greetings and then aft to the great cabin herricks furniture had been removed and there were many chairs even benches all of which appeared to be filled with naval uniforms some civilians and one or two of the argonautes own company he saw stayt who still managed to stay apart from all the others keen with paget sitting beside him the latter was not required to attend but bolitho was glad he had made the choice athwartships was a long table its chairs backing on the stern windows so that the few officers already seated there were silhouettes against the sunny panorama beyond all heads turned as bolitho entered and as he walked down to an empty chair at the front he saw their searching glances awe pity curiosity there would be some who would be glad to see a flaw in his record if only because keen was under his command keen looked at him and gave a brief nod their glances held and spanned the years midshipman and captain now together once more fear love tragedy they had both shared it just as the girl zenoria had seen and understood she would more than most from a vast distance bolitho heard four bells chime ten o clock exactly to coincide with herricks arrival aft bolitho stood with the others as the court found their seats herrick in the centre gravefaced but very calm sir marcus laforey took some time to settle down at one end of the table while his servant adjusted a wooden goutstool beneath his bandaged foot bolitho saw a young lieutenant nudge his companion if laforey caught them at it they would think the world had toppled on them mr pullen from the admiralty still dressed in black his face severe two other captains whom bolitho did not recognize and lastly captain the hon sir hedworth jerram laforeys flagcaptain was tall and thin with a long nose to match his haughty demeanour as he rose now he looked along his nose like a man who had discovered something unsavoury herrick said shortly this court of inquiry at the direction of their lordships is open those advised of the content of the inquiry will be required to answer questions some written statements may be used but the court is gathered mainly to discuss the behaviour of captain valentine keen of his britannic majestys ship argonaute at the times and dates as specified he looked at keen for the first time please be seated you are not on trial here bolitho looked at captain jerram his expression clearly said not yet the captain stood facing the cabin some papers grasped loosely in his bony fingers in a penetrating tone he described the squadrons departure from spithead and its eventual meeting with the convict transport ship orontes at some time during this operation we are to understand that several attempts were made to take this vessel in tow she having lost steerageway for some reason the squadrons flagship decided to take control of the damaged vessel although prior to that the helicon he glanced sharply at his papers under captain inch had already achieved some success keen said the reason for that herrick tapped the table later captain keen bolitho looked at herricks eyes he was unhappy about this but there had been no recognition in his voice shortly afterwards captain keen went in person to the orontes his eyes fixed on keen as if he expected an argument he continued and this is where the captains behaviour becomes a matter for the court and perhaps a more serious one at a later stage in the cabin you could have heard a pin drop even the ship was unusually silent just the creak of wood and the lap of water below the counter the hon sir hedworth jerram said in his precise voice a woman being transported to new south wales was removed from that ship by theby captain keen bolitho clenched his fist jerram had all but called him the accused argonautes surgeon is present please stand tuson rose above the other heads and shoulders his hair very white against his plain blue coat jerram said the woman in question had been punished tuson eyed him bleakly beaten sir yes whipped sir yes jerram snapped punished how bad was the injury tuson described the cut on the girls back in his usual controlled voice if they had been expecting the average ships surgeon the court was soon made to realize they were mistaken jerram persisted but she was in no danger of dying tuson stared at him if she had been returned to that ship answer the question if you please well no sir but stand down jerram dabbed his mouth with a handkerchief bolitho watched keens profile he looked pale beneath his bronzed skin bitter too stayt was called next as it was only an inquiry the court could ask what it liked through jerram no sort of crossexamination was permitted bolitho gripped his sword until his fingers felt numb a gathering of facts it said in the book an exclusion of others you boarded the orontes lieutenant stayt what happened stayt began the ships crew were in disarray and had been drinking who said so i assumed that for myself i shall overlook your impertinence jerram added a punishment was being executed i believe before stayt could reply he said sharply and you were ordered to shoot the man carrying out the punishment i understand shoot him dead if he continued am i correct stayt said hotly it was an ugly situation sir hedworth we were without support or many reliable witnesses it would seem he nodded sit jerram looked at his papers momentarily although bolitho had the feeling he knew every detail by heart bolitho accepted that the procedure was right but without any mention of what had happened before and sincethe loss of supreme of the squadrons viceadmiral tooand without keens appraisal of what had happened the evidence was meaningless jerram continued no attempt was made to return the woman to the transport orontes captain was treated shamefully in front of his company he walked to the opposite side his feet tapping on the canvased deck at gibraltar when other women were landed the prisoner was retained on board in captain keens care someone at the rear of the crowd tittered in fact a native girl was taken on board to look after this prisoner his goldlaced sleeve shot out please stand captain keen do you deny any of this that you removed a female prisoner from orontes for your own purposes which we can only guess at keen said bitterly yes i took her off that ship she was being treated like an animal and that upset you a kings officer bolitho stood up he was on his feet before even jerram had noticed him herrick looked at him seemingly for the first time yes sir richard how dare this officer sneer at my flagcaptain i will not sit here and tolerate one more insult do you hear keen was looking at him imploring him to stop but bolitho did not nor did he want to all the frustration and disappointment had moulded together and he no longer cared what they might do not even herrick jerram said this is most unorthodox he was looking at laforey laforey grunted well lets get on with it what say your piece sir richard if you must you are known as something of a firebrand i believe it was quite unintentional but his remark seemed to take the edge out of the confrontation bolitho said in a calmer voice captain keen is a fine and brave officer he turned and saw their eyes shift to the gold medal on his chest the same one that nelson wore with pride i chose him as my flagcaptain because of his record and because i know him he sensed jerrams restored confidence as he had known it would return jerram would be quick to point out that his choice of a flagcaptain even his record was irrelevant if he got the chance bolitho was a good swordsman his father had seen to that he had never done well with any other weapon it felt like that right now letting the opponent test your arm lead him on and then take him off balance laforey said all we must do is return the prisoner under escort surely then captain keen will have to answer for his actions at a later date we are at war gentlemen bolitho felt the touch of ice at his spine but it was the same as the thrill of battle heedless of the outcome why not ask me sir hedworth jerram glared at him for several seconds very well sir richard since it seems we are forced to dally here where is the prisoner thank you sir bolitho felt his left eye sting and prayed it would not fail him now she has returned to england under my protection i paid for her passage and will produce the bill for same if you intend to courtmartial me not before i ordered captain keen to bring her to the flagship do you imagine that any captain can act without his flagofficer giving consent or encouragement he glanced at keens face i did both he continued that girl was unlawfully transported something i intend to prove sir hedworth in a far more convincing court than your charade here today how could you possibly know what the orontes master said or did not say my god man hes almost halfway to new south wales his voice sharpened and you will know about it when the proof is published gentlemen believe me you shall know about it and what greedy dishonest men will do for revenge pullen stood up you take all the responsibility sir richard bolitho faced him calm again yes captain keen is under my command and will remain so until i am ordered otherwise he looked as steadily as he could manage at the blackgarbed figure when you explain to your superiors of admiralty mr pullen and you tell them what i intend you may be surprised at the outcome and when that happens i trust you will show the same zeal as you did when you tried to arrest a young girl who has already suffered brutality beyond measure he looked again at keen that too is being taken care of laforey asked irritably why did we not know about this bolitho tried not to blink his damaged eye some were too eager for the kill sir marcus to hurt or to damage me through anothers reputation jerram dabbed his face i can proceed no further sir he looked at herrick at this stage herrick opened his mouth and then looked towards the screen doors as a lieutenant entered and after some nervous hesitation made his way aft he handed a piece of paper to laforey who thrust it across to herrick bolitho remained standing he may have ruined his career but keen and his zenoria were safe herrick looked up i think you should see this sir richard bolitho took the paper and read it carefully aware that every face was watching him he could feel the rising tension mounting to match his despair and anger he looked around the great cabin the same one where he had planned each battle had survived when so many had not he said quietly his majestys armed schooner columbine has entered harbour his voice was so low that many craned forward to hear him better my squadron was attacked last week and the helicon he glanced at jerram without expression under that same captain inch was severely damaged with many killed and wounded he saw keen watching him his handsome features quite stricken bolitho continued in spite of the catch in his voice which he could not control dear god not inch too what we anticipated has happened jobert is out and my squadron engaged them when they needed me i was here he picked up his hat as sir marcus said we are at war it is a pity that some still do not realize the fact herrick said you may leave with your flagcaptain bolitho looked along the table and said in the same level tone i have one more thing to say he glanced from face to face god damn all of you then he strode from the cabin and after a brief moment keen followed herrick sat quite still for several moments then he said this court is dismissed he was stunned by bolithos anger and yet not surprised he had done and given too much to care any more pullen said breathlessly hell never get away with this herrick said flatly you didnt understand did you the french are out man and nelson will be watching toulon like a hawk and be too hardpressed to release ships to search for jobert nothing stands between jobert and his intentions but that man we all wronged just now laforey watched the people leaving the cabin silent now as if they had pictured the battle through bolithos quiet voice herrick helped laforey out of his chair i know bolitho better than any man he thought suddenly of allday except one possibly to him loyalty stretches in both directions if people try to scar him through others he will fight back like a lion he tried not to think of the blazing anger in bolithos eyes but there are some battles he cant win he waited for his captain to see the visitors into their boats and then returned to the cabin of which he had been so proud if i were still his captain he would have acted the same way for me when he needed me what did i do my duty it was an empty word now if bolitho had been with his squadron the result might have been exactly the same but bolitho would feel it deeply nurse it like another wound until he conquered it or it killed him his servant peered in at him can i bring some hands to return the furniture sir herrick eyed him sadly aye do that and clean it too it smells rotten in here while herrick stared through the stern windows argonautes green barge moved slowly amongst the other ships bolitho noticed that the stroke was slower and guessed allday was taking his time to give him a moment to recover himself keen sat beside him his face grave as he watched the harbour he said suddenly you should not have done what you did sir bolitho looked at him and smiled you had no control over events where that girl was concerned val i took the responsibility because i wanted to she has come to mean a lot to me just as her happiness counts a great deal his face softened with you it was a matter of humanity to begin with then your heart took the tiller keen said in a low voice so that the oarsmen could not hear him may i ask how you know who is behind this attack sir no not yet bolitho tried to find comfort in the fact that a simple bluff had worked but it evaded him all he could see was inch facing the enemy the schooners message had little news of value except that the enemy flagship was named leopard almost to himself bolitho said the french went for rapid inch tried to support her and took the whole weight of the attack why did they want the brig i wonder keen watched his profile and wondered how much more there was about bolitho he did not understand bolitho shrugged remember achates val keen nodded and smiled oldkatie yes i remember her when jobert attacked us we were outnumbered three to one to draw him into close quarters we concentrated our fire on his smallest ship the diane and so we took argonaute understanding flooded keens face and now hes done the same to us argonautes shadow covered them as the barge glided alongside in the choppy water bolitho gripped his sword the wind was still strong the same one which had blown from the west and had brought the french with it he looked up at the faces of the waiting side party was this ship cursed after all still french no matter what they could do to her as his head lifted through the entry port and the salutes died away lieutenant paget who had preceded them in the gig raised his hat and yelled a cheer for the admiral lads keen had seen the look in bolithos eyes he said its men not ships sir bolitho raised his hat and held it above his head he wanted them to stop cheering just as he needed it to continue to drive back his thoughts like beasts into the shadows when they reached the stern cabin it felt like sanctuary bolitho sat down in his chair and tried not to rub his eyes they both ached and the vision in his good eye was blurred from strain and he knew emotion i would like to see the schooner columbines commander immediately he saw ozzard pouring some brandy the little man looked both pleased and sad he would remember inch too i must discover everything i can before we rejoin the others there must be something captain inch may be safe sir keen watched him fondly we can only hope a good friend val he thought of herricks face at the table losing one is bad enough he got up and walked vaguely round the cabin god ill be glad to leave here val the land has no warmth for me he glanced at the unfinished letter inform the admiral that i intend to weigh before dusk keen hesitated by the door ill go to the schooner myself he added quietly i can never thank you enough sir bolitho looked away unable to hold his depression at bay she is worth it val so are you now fetch that officer for me the door closed and bolitho picked up the letter then he screwed it up and with sudden determination began to write another my dearest belindaand suddenly he was no longer alone speak with pride bolitho stood quite still beside helicons wheel which had somehow remained intact he had forcibly to examine the ships upper deck masts and gangways if only to convince himself that the fight had been two weeks ago it looked as if it had been yesterday the wind which had brought the french down like thunder on this shattered vessel had died away completely in fact the last few miles before argonaute had made contact with the squadron had been an additional torment there was a deep oily swell above which a hard sun more silver than gold laid bare the scattered ships their disorder seeming to symbolize their combined shock and defeat figures bustled about the decks sailors from other ships for there were not so many from inchs company who were fit to work the clank of pumps was a reminder of the damage if anyone needed reminding and as a crude juryrig began to emerge from the tangle of cordage and tackles bolitho wondered how the ship had managed to survive ripped deck planking great patterns of dried blood black in the harsh glare upended guns and charred canvas only the dead were missing and the wounded were below fighting their own private battles while the ships surgeons did what they could for the ones who still refused to die bolitho could feel allday watching with him sharing it remembering all those other times it had not been a battle more like a slaughter but for the arrival of barracouta tearing down on the scene under full sail helicon would be on the bottom if the wind rose again she might still make that final journey he thought barracouta had tossed caution aside had even shredded her studding sails to the wind as she had endeavoured to turn aside the enemys calculated assault allday said why not go back to the ship sir good bath an a shave might do wonders bolitho looked at him not yet he felt sick stunned by the savagery of the destruction all around him if i ever forget this day remind me he added fiercely no matter what he saw tuson below the poop even that deck was mauled and knocked out of shape as if a giant had crushed it and left great black scars like burning clawmarks so many had died here and many more were paying for that day he asked how is he now tuson regarded him impassively the ships surgeon took off his arm too low sir i am not satisfied with it i would suggestbolitho seized his sleeve god damn you man that is my friend you are speaking of not some bloody carcass he turned aside and said quietly forgive me tuson watched him and said i understand but i would like to deal with it myself he did not say what bolitho already knew that helicons own surgeon had made a bad wound worse by his treatment in fairness he had been overwhelmed by the ferocity of the battle the tide of broken frightened men who had been dragged down to the orlop to face his knife and saw while the ship had quaked to the roar of guns the terrifying fire from the enemy i must see him bolitho watched some seamen flinging broken timber and other fragments over the side they had not been in this ship and yet they moved like survivors the heart gone out of them tuson said i cannot promise anything he glanced at bolithos profile i am sorry beneath the poop there was still the stench of burning and pain death and anger a few guns lay on their sides or at the full extent of their tackles where they had recoiled on a last broadside before their crews were scattered or cut down the sunlight shone through distorted gunports gouged into strange shapes by the intensity of the attack from the main deck the sounds of hammers and squeaking blocks became muted as bolitho groped his way down the companion to all that was left of the wardroom inchs own quarters had been swept away completely charred beyond recognition and had taken those of the gun crews and afterguard who had stayed to the last bolitho saw men glancing at him parting to let him through before returning to their work in saving the ship and preparing her for a passage to safety the regular clank of pumps seemed to sneer at their efforts and the cries from the wounded as they waited for relief or death added to a backcloth of hopelessness helicons wardroom seemed almost cold after the upper deck and even though the stern windows had been blasted away it could not free the place of its stench bolitho stood beside the cot and looked down at inchs pale features he did not seem to be conscious and bolitho felt his heart chill as he saw the bloody bandage where inchs arm had been the thing he had always feared most for himself had happened to his friend tuson drew down a blanket and said he took a metal splinter here sir he replaced the blanket and added heavily their surgeon says he removed it he sounded doubtful it was then bolitho realized that inch had opened his eyes and was staring at him his eyes did not move as if he was concentrating all his strength to recognize and discover what was happening bolitho leaned over him and took his hand im here old friend inch licked his lips i knew youd come knew it he shut his eyes and bolitho felt his grip tighten as the agony tore through him but the grip was feeble nonetheless inch said three ships of the line but for barracouta im afraid tuson whispered please sir hes terribly weak hell need all his will to survive what i must do bolitho turned to him their faces almost touching must you tuson shrugged gangrene sir it needed no more words bolitho leaned over the cot again dont give in youve a lot to live for he wanted to ask inch about the french ships but how could he he saw carcaud the surgeons mate and two assistants waiting by an upended gun like ghouls bolitho felt his eyes smart they would do it here and now hold him down while tuson did his bloody work bolitho lowered his head unable to look at him francis inch a man with all the courage and so much luck who would care his pretty young wife and a few old comrades but who would really spare a thought for the cost of unpreparedness of ignorance inch looked past him and saw allday a shadow of a smile creased his long face and he whispered youve still got that rascal i see then he fainted and tuson snapped now he glanced only briefly at bolitho i suggest you go elsewhere sir bolitho barely recognized this tuson steadyeyed coldly professional to him it was not a wrecked wardroom but a place of work bolitho walked up to the quarterdeck again and saw that a young lieutenant one of helicons was supervising the hoisting and rigging of two staysails it would give them steerageway but little else until they could replace some of the yards bolitho looked at the forecastle and decking again pointblank range mostly grape by the look of it the lieutenant saw him and touched his hat he said addenbrook sir fifth lieutenant where were you bolitho watched the strain and emotion on the lieutenants grimy features at a guess about eighteen and newly promoted like most of keens probably the first time in battle in his junior rank addenbrook said lower gun deck sir the french laid off and concentrated their fire on us heavy artillery everything he was reliving it the roaring sealed world of the lower gun deck we heard the masts shot away but we kept firing just like wed been trained what he expected of us yes captain inch is a fine man the lieutenant barely heard him they kept coming for us sir until half our crews were laid low they still closed the range and started to use grape he pressed one hand to his forehead i kept thinking in gods name why dont they stop my senior was killed and some of my men were half mad they were beyond reason screaming and cheering loading and firing not like the men i knew at all grape at close range that explained the utter devastation there could have been hardly a gun to return the fire by that time the lieutenant looked down at his stained uniform scarcely able to believe it had happened that he had survived without a scratch we were alone til barracouta joined in sir he looked up his face suddenly bitter we had no chance for just a moment some pride cut through the hurt in his eyes but we didnt strike to the buggers sir there was a splash alongside and bolitho saw carcaud walk away from the gangway wiping his hands on his apron he did not have to guess what he had pitched into the sea was that all it took he beckoned to the gangling surgeons mate how is he carcaud pursed his lips i dont think he knew what had been done sir but later on bolitho nodded and walked slowly towards the entry port or what was left of it helicons first lieutenant appeared on deck his head in a bandage he saw bolitho and hurried towards him bolitho said you have done well mr savill if you need any more men signal the flag to that effect he saw the man sway are you fit to be here the lieutenant tried to grin ill manage sir he had a round dorset accentno wonder inch liked him i shall lighten the ship as soon as i can rig some tackles his eyes sharpened not the guns though well fight this old lady again once we can get her into dock bolitho smiled sadly a sailors faith in his ship and he was probably right you saw the french flagship the leopard i understand aye sir his eyes were far away i took a bang on the skull an was pressed against a ninepounder i reckon that saved me in the next broadside he glanced aft they were all cut down smashed like a bowl of eggs but oh yes sir i saw her right enough he gave a rueful smile pity ive not got that frenchies extra boom i could use it to hoist up some of the shot an stores a man called out and he touched his forehead if youll pardon me sir he hesitated and turned capn inch just stood there an damned th lot of em sir he was a good capn a real gentleman to the people bolitho looked away was i know in the barge he twisted round in the sternsheets to look for his other ships his mind trying to grapple with the mauled squadron as heicons lieutenants were fighting to restore life to their ship if barracouta had not arrived the french would have gone for the other ships he had already heard that barracouta had been hurrying with the news that the enemy was moving out of spanish waters when she had been chased by two french frigates but for her speed and the fact that the two enemy vessels had believed her to be a small twodecker she would never have been able to help once or twice he turned to look astern at heicon scarred and burned with only stumps for masts she made a grim spectacle how many had died one more list of names to be considered jobert would not have wasted so much time if he had known the frigate was that near but he had wanted to destroy heicon utterly to pay him back for destroying his calliope or because she was a prizeship or was it a savage warning of the fate he intended for argonaute if he could not retake her he pictured each of his remaining ships in turn without inch he was left with houston and montresor who had yet to prove their ability in battle then there was rapid and with luck the cutter supreme would rejoin them if the maltese dockyard kept its promise and one frigate it was strange that lapish who had got off to such a bad start had shown both skill and initiative bolitho wished in his heart that he was still captain of a frigate he sighed we must fetch captain inch aboard the flagship as soon as he may be moved allday allday glanced down at bolithos squared shoulders the stains on his arms and legs from his examination of the other ship if you think he can he flinched as bolitho looked up at him those grey eyes were still the same it was hard to accept that one was half blind he tried again you know how it is sir yes bolitho stared at the despatch hoveto above her own reflection but for her steering failing he turned the thought aside it would merely have delayed the inevitable jobert must have imagined that barracouta was one of nelsons ships the vanguard of his blockading squadron off toulon he said but hell not survive a passage to malta allday persisted hell never leave is ship sir bolitho shook his head i think otherwise this time keen was waiting for him his face full of questions how different were argonautes decks bolitho thought order purpose but despair was infectious it would soon spread with helicons hull a constant reminder to them he said captains conference val this afternoon if possible if the wind gets up it might be days before i can speak with them together keen looked across at helicon and said quietly theres the heart of a ship sir bolitho shaded his eyes and saw a thin fragment of sail being hoisted between the fore and mainmast stumps he said inchs heart he pictured joberts squadron in his mind it was not formed for a diversion or merely to seek revenge if the latter offered itself then so much the better but there was far more to it was it to draw nelsons blockade from toulon so that admiral villeneuves main fleet could break out in force with gibraltar under siege from another fever it was unlikely that any english ships would stay there to act as a deterrent jobert might well try for the strait bolitho dismissed the idea at once jobert could have done that already could be in brest by now if he had managed to slip past the blockade there bolitho made his way aft as keen called out to the signals midshipman to pipe his assistants on deck allday watched him and noticed that he was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he did not even falter or hesitate when the deck tilted in the swell bolitho walked through the screens and made his way right aft to stare through the stern windows he should have been exhausted worn down by shock and a sense that he had failed instead his mind seemed to have taken on a new edge sharpened still further whenever he thought of inch lying over there in his stricken ship keen entered and said the signal is bent on sir he sounded strained knowing keen he was probably blaming himself for what had happened if he had not been recalled to maltabolitho faced him dismiss any doubts from your mind val at least by going to malta i discovered something i might never have known otherwise sir keen was astounded by bolithos demeanour hoist the signal and call our gallant captains he waited until keen was almost at the door and val when you next hold her in your arms you will know that fate left you no choice bolitho walked to the windows and out onto the gallery with its two smiling mermaids he heard a shout and guessed that the signal had broken aloft he would speak with his captains repair the damage restore their confidence he saw helicon drift slowly into view but not you dear old friend you have done your share during the day the wind rose only slightly but there were more clouds and perhaps a hint of rain bolitho stood aft by the windows again and watched his captains as they sat in their various attitudes in the great cabin not the wardroom this time he wanted no retreat there was none he had gone through the details of joberts squadron its strength and its possible purpose there is nothing to gain from remaining in the gulf gentlemen i intend to sweep to the southeastrd if jobert has headed west to pass through the strait then we have already lost him if not he looked at their intent faces then we must find him and call him to action there were muffled shouts from the main deck and the cabin quivered as two of helicons thirtytwopounders were lowered on board bolitho said those guns will be conveyed to rapid tomorrow he saw her young commander start up in his chair as if he had been only half listening quarrell stammered too heavy sir i mean bolitho eyed him bleakly you have shipwrights and a carpenter i believe i want you to mount two guns forward as bowchasers by shifting ballast and stores and shoring up the deck you should manage it easily enough i once commanded a sloopofwarshe was not much bigger and had a very heavy bow armament so do it captain montresor said my steering is repaired sir i had no way of knowing he looked bitterly at houston i wanted to fight i didnt expect helicon to stand alone captain houston sat with his arms folded unrepentant he said my ship had fallen too far astern because of the wind and that damned mist i saw despatch was in trouble his thin mouth opened and shut each word rationed i would have been a target and nothing more had i gone to assist helicon anyway i knew the frogs would do for the lot of us piecemeal so i decided to take montresor in tow bolitho nodded so typical of the man he thought hard uncompromising but in this case right his choice had been straightforward in his view at least save a ship or lose the squadron he said jobert has a purpose for everything he does so far he has been one step ahead of us he saw keen watching him grimly he knew that by quitting their station he was taking a huge responsibility a greater risk to himself it was odd but it no longer mattered after the court of inquiry at malta he was a marked man anyway he felt lightheaded it was beyond personal risk and reputation now houston said in his harsh voice we shall have to consider where and when we will replenish water supplies sir bolitho looked at him suddenly aware of the shadow across his left eye it taunted him but for once he was able to ignore it there will be no watering captain houston he glanced at the others for any of us cut the ration halve it if need be but we stay together until this is finished he did not add one way or the other but the thought was obvious on their faces i need all the information we can gather coastal craft must be stopped and searched thoroughly if they are neutral do it just the same if not sink them he felt the hardness creep into his tone like that other time it made him think of herrick the pain in his blue eyes when he had left benbow in his heart bolitho knew herrick had acted only as he saw fit bolitho hated any sort of favouritism and despised those who used it for advancement or personal gain in the navy yet he had done exactly that for keen and because herrick was his friend what would he have done had he been in herricks position and another had asked a favour of him but the thought of what it had cost in lives made him shy away from an answer inch was a broken man if he lived it was unlikely he would ever tread his own deck again he saw some of them glance at him as he unwittingly touched his left eye that thought was always there suppose i lost the sight of my right eye blind as he had been in supreme but forever captain lapish asked will jobert have any more ships at his command sir he even sounded more confident than before bolitho gave a grave smile are there not enough already houston muttered two frigates ysay and weve but one commander quarrell exclaimed my brig is worthy enough bolitho said save your steel for the enemy all of you drill your people until they can point and fire in their sleep make each one aware that the enemy is human not a god we can and will beat him for i believe we are the only bulwark twixt jobert and his objective the deck tilted heavily and a book slithered from the table bolitho said return to your ships if there is rain gather it as part of the rations whenever you need to search or seek out small craft use your boats to full advantage i want our people to be ready to fight and to expect trouble in advance houston commented leopard is a secondrate i believe sir bolitho saw the blunt reminder move round the others like a chill wind through corn he glanced at keen my flagcaptain took on this ship and two frigates at once captain houston battered we may be but you will see that we are both still here quarrell laughed outright and grinned at his friend lapish they had both learned a lot in a short while and they were still too young to nurse fear for long after the captains had been seen over the side keen returned to the cabin and asked do you already know what jobert is about sir when i am certain i shall tell you val until then we must make sure that our ships do not grow slack or careless a lack of vigilance now can mean only defeat the sentry called surgeon sir tuson entered and eyed them curiously you sent for me sir bolitho said make arrangements to ferry captain inch aboard i fear the weather may change tuson nodded he was speaking with me when i was aboard helicon earlier sir he is in great pain but i would prefer him here in my care bolitho said i know that he watched the surgeon leave and said if helicon gets into difficulties en route for malta it were better that inch be with us hed be on deck taking charge otherwise keen smiled like you sir he moved to the chart a needle in a haystack damn jobert he might be anywhere bolitho walked to the table and caught his foot in a ringbolt and almost lost his balance he felt the touch of fear once more he thought of inch returning home what would his pretty hannah think what might belinda think for that matter even if adam had not told her of the full extent of his injury his handwriting in that last letter would make her realize something was wrong the letter he thought of the way his words had poured out it had been as if he had been listening to his own voice it was so unlike him he was almost sorry he had written to her of his innermost hopes and fears of the love which had burned with such passion and which he had imagined was gone forever keen said suddenly it breaks a confidence sir but like you i cannot bear to see allday in the doldrums you know something val keen sat on a chair half of him needed to be on deck but paget could deal with most things now the other half wanted to be here with this one man who had risked so much for his happiness and had shown no regrets for it my coxn told me sir old hogg is a solid fellow and cares for little in this world but himself and i believe for me also allday confides in him occasionally water laced the stern windows and bolitho tried not to think of inch being swayed down into a lively boat for the crossing a sudden shock could kill a man in his condition keen said it seems that young bankart believed allday would soon quit the sea after being wounded so badly at san felipe he had learned of his life in falmouth with you sir of his security there he wanted to share it he had had enough of farm work and a life at sea didnt appear to satisfy him even though he is a volunteer he watched bolithos profile and asked can we be certain that bankart is his son sir bolitho smiled if you had known allday when he first came aboard my ship phalarope that was twenty years ago remember youd not need to ask he is exactly like him in looks anyway keen stood up as the bell chimed out from the forecastle as his captain i shall deal with it sir it might be better if he is discharged when we reach england they stared at each other startled by the word england bolitho looked away it seemed likely they might never see green fields again i shall speak to allday myself val a troubled man is often the first to fall in battle keen raised his head to listen to the sounds on deck he said you brought the squadron together today sir i watched the others and saw the pride coming back to them bolitho shrugged i should have been with them with inch but recriminations will not give him back an arm he heard a sudden wave of cheering and said well go on deck this will be an ordeal for inch keen hurried beside him ill tell mr paget to stop the hands from doing it bolitho shook his head no let them on the quarterdeck bolitho saw big harry rooke the boatswain supervising the tackle on a chair to sway inchs cot over the side across the water the listing helicon was pitching heavily in the swell her gangway lined with tiny faces as they watched the slowmoving boat which approached the flagship with such care bolitho adjusted his swordbelt and tugged his hat down over his forehead another familiar face broken with pain another of the happy few who even if he defied death would never be the same again paget looked at his superiors ready sir bolitho stepped forward man the side if you please he walked to the entry port and leaned out to watch the approaching boat he did not hold on and knew the risk he took for such a small gesture he heard the royal marines guard picking up their dressing from sergeant blackburn the hiss of steel as captain bouteiller drew his spadroon he saw the boatswains mates moistening their silver calls on their tongues while the tackle took the strain and all cheering stopped dead keen looked at bolitho framed against the heavy swell he knew what this moment was costing him but keens voice was steady as he called stand by on deck he saw bolitho turn to look at him their eyes understanding as they had in the cabin prepare to receive helicons captain after the din of calls and commands as the cot was manhandled towards the poop bolitho took inchs hand and said quietly welcome aboard captain inch inch tried to grin but looked very pale and suddenly older he said in a hoarse whisper please let me see my ship they carried him to the gangway and tuson himself cradled inchs shoulders so that he could look at the distant seventyfour with her pathetic scraps of sail inch said slowly ill not see that old lady again tuson wanted to look away surprised that he could still be moved by such men and such moments bolitho watched as the little procession was swallowed up in the poop and then said and well not see his like again either he swung away and added bitterly get the ship under way signal the squadron to take station on the flag as ordered if anything keen thought inchs presence aboard would be a reminder and a warning to them all on the larboard side of argonautes orlop deck in the tiny berth which he shared with mannoch the sailmaker allday moved a flickering lantern closer to his handiwork allday was big and powerfully built and his fists made a cutlass look like a midshipmans dirk but the model which he had half completed was as delicate as it was perfect wood bone even human hairs had been used to fashion it but allday was ever critical of his work he had made models of every ship in which he had served with bolitho and on occasions he had produced more than one he cradled the little ship in one palm and turned it slowly before the lantern it was a seventyfour and he grunted with grudging approval as the ship it represented quivered and murmured around him down on the orlop which never saw the light of day the air was always thick in the small berth it was still heavy from the sailmakers rum he was a marvel at his work and could run up a sail or a suit of clothes with equal skill but he loved his tot and was known by his crew as old grog mannoch allday shifted his buttocks on his hard seachest and thought of bolitho two decks above his head it had been painful to watch him when the bandages had first come off now it was hard to tell the extent of his injury and he rarely mentioned it any more he heard tuson laugh and his assistant carcaud say something in return the sickbay was just a few yards away on the opposite side a place to avoid at all costs they were playing chess by the sound of it inch had been given an empty cabin elsewhere the air down on the orlop could kill a man in his state allday decided he recalled the girl as he had last seen her with her shorn hair and borrowed clothes there had been a nasty moment when they had headed for the falmouth packet at malta one of the guardboats had passed almost directly alongside he had threatened his boats crew with a quilting if one of them had said a word about it some of them had not even noticed one midshipman was much like another in the dark it had made allday think seriously about getting married himself he grinned silently who would want an old bugger like me there was a tap on the narrow door and he looked up surprised to see bankart looking at him yes id like to talk a spell if its all right allday shifted along the chest to make room what about he looked at the youngsters features and remembered his mother a clean fresh girl he had even thought of wedding her at the time there had been so many of them different faces in many ports the landlords daughter of the inn near bolithos home was the only one who still held a firm place in his thoughts he had thought her too young but after what had happened to captain keen well you never know bankart blurted out i dont want bad blood between us he would not look at him like allday he was stubborn and surprised that he had come to this place at all spit it out then allday watched him sternly an no lies bankart doubled his fists you may be me father but allday nodded i know im not used to it sorry son the youth stared at him son he repeated quietly then he said you was right about me i wanted to get ashore to come to where you was he looked at him his eyes bright i wanted a ome a real one he shook his head despairingly no dont stop me or ill never get it out i wanted it cause i was sick of bein chased an cheated id always sort of looked up to you cause of what me mum said an told me bout you i joined up as a volunteer cause it seemed the proper thing to do like you ysee allday nodded the model ship forgotten then mum died best thing for er it was they wore er out the bastards i wanted somethin of me own so i got a mate to write to you we was told you were leavin the sea he looked at the deck it was a ome i wanted moren a father when he looked up again he exclaimed i cant elp bein afraid im not like the others i never seen men killed like that afore allday gripped his wrist easy son the sawbonesll be comin to see whats up he groped behind the chest and brought up a stone bottle and two mugs ave a wet bankart took a quick swallow and almost choked allday said thats the real stuff not the muck that the pusser hands out most o the others are scared too allday let the rum float across his tongue and smiled as he recalled when bolitho had drunk some in his despair and his relief you must learn not to show it he shook his wrist gently that takes real courage believe me matey its different for you i spect bankart took a wary swallow maybe it is our dick has taken good care o me hes a fine man a friend not many can say that an id lay down me life for him make no mistake on it bankart made to get up his hair brushing a massive deckhead beam i just wanted to tell you i allday pulled him down again old still i knew anyway or most of it i was the one who was wrong i knows that now he took another full measure of rum you dont belong in a kings ship it took courage to volunteer i can tell you that they ad to press me he shook with silent laughter until the pain of his wound stopped him no a job ashore with a good ome an ill make proper certain you gets one until then do what i tells you and keep out of trouble see there were more voices and he guessed the sailmaker and one of his cronies were coming aft well talk again an soon right bankart looked at him his eyes shining thanks er allday grinned call me john if its easier but call me coxn when theres others about or ill tan your hide for you an thats no error son bankart hesitated unwilling to break the contact he said quietly ii think i might be killed i wouldnt want to let you down ive seen the man you are eard what they all say about you i never bin proud of anyone afore allday did not even hear the door close he sat staring at the unfinished model at a complete loss the sailmaker banged into the berth with his friend and asked all right swain goodlookin lad that one allday looked down aye hes my son fate bolitho walked up the sloping quarterdeck and allowed the wet wind to drive all tiredness aside it was early morning and around and above him the ships company prepared for another weary day there had been some overnight rain but bolitho walked back and forth too far from any handhold if he should slip on the wet planking it was a struggle but he was slowly regaining his confidence and blamed his earlier despair on selfpity and worse he heard keen speaking with the first lieutenant and knew from the tone in his voice that they were discussing the punishment to be awarded to three seamen during the forenoon it was the same throughout the squadron after helicons departure there had been several outbreaks of disorder threats or actual violence used against petty officers or each other with the usual aftermath of floggings the flagship was no exception even keens humanity had failed to prevent the latest flareup of tempers and the harsh justice which would follow bolitho pictured his ships each living her own life controlled and led by her individual captain an admiral even a junior one was not supposed to concern himself with such abstract matters bolitho thought he also knew that a ship was only as strong as her people when full daylight found them again his ships would be sailing in line abeam argonaute in the centre position barracouta still in her rough disguise was somewhere astern ready to rush down from windward to wherever a signal dictated rapid completely alone was far ahead tacking back and forth in the hope of finding a fishing boat or some trader who might have some valuable information for them they had sighted several such craft but had managed to catch only three one of the ones which had eluded rapids chase until she had been recalled to her station had been a fast schooner it was customary for any merchantman to fly from a manofwar the flag did not matter but out here any stranger might be an enemy worse a spy who would carry news of their strength and movements to jobert it could not last bolitho knew it so probably did his officers he would have to admit failure and send the brig to seek out nelson and tell him what had happened it seemed likely that nelson would scatter bolithos ships amongst his own fleet and wait for the french to fight their way out of toulon jobert would not be considered bolitho guessed that the admiral in malta maybe even herrick imagined that jobert had become like a crude joke or a figment of bolithos imagination it was the fourth day since they had parted company with inchs ship at any other time it would have been good sailing weather with a favourable wind and fair visibility for the masthead lookouts along bolithos line of ships keen crossed the deck and touched his hat any special orders today sir richard his formality was for the benefit of the helmsmen and masters mate nearby he sounded strained or was he critical of his superiors actions and their results bolitho shook his head we will continue the search the french may have left us alone but i doubt it together they watched the ship taking shape around them the sails and rigging picking up the suns colour abeam despatch rolled her bilge into a deep swell so that her shining hull and lower gunports shone like fragments of glass bolitho looked up at the mainmast at the lookouts tiny figure he said change the lookouts every hour val i want no tired eyes today keen glanced at him curiously today sir bolitho shrugged he had not realized what he had said had he meant that he would need to break off the search and admit failure or was that same chilling instinct offering him a warning i feel uneasy val he thought of breakfast and the fact he had been pacing the deck for most of the night to regain his confidence or was it because he had already lost it completely tell me if you sight anything he strode aft to his quarters where ozzard and yovell were waiting for him as usual bolitho sat at the table and watched while ozzard prepared his breakfast and poured some coffee he felt in need of a wash from head to toe and his shirt was crumpled and stale but as he had explained to keen as the water ration was cut and if need be would be cut again it had to be for everyone except for inch that was it was painful to see him sometimes delirious and on other occasions dulled into a state of collapse the amputation was still holding well according to tuson but inch needed to be ashore in a hospital with those who could give him proper care bolitho knew from bitter experience that each shout from the upper deck every change of wind and rudder would stir even a dying sailor with old anxieties especially a captain ozzard said just as you like it sir he laid a pewter plate on the table last of the maltese bread im afraid sir bolitho looked at the thinly sliced pork fried pale brown in biscuit crumbs the bread would be like iron but ozzard had managed to stop it going mouldy anyway the black treacle which bolitho enjoyed would deaden the taste he thought of the breakfasts at falmouth of belinda sitting and watching his pleasure like a schoolboy she had said what would she make of this he wondered and down in the messes it was a hundred times worse he looked at the open skylight as voices drifted aft from the quarterdeck then feet pounded along the passageway and he saw keen coming into the cabin i beg your pardon for disturbing you sir bolitho put down his knife it was not like keen to leave the deck in a crisis rapid is in sight she has news sir bolitho thrust the plate aside and then spread the uninspiring bread with a thick coating of treacle tell me she sighted a ship and boarded it more i cannot say but rapid is certainly making all efforts to close with us bolitho stood up his mind busy make more sail and tell our ships to do the same with a physical effort he sat down again and bit into the treacled bread i want to speak with quarrell as soon as we are hoveto keen hurried away and soon the deck quivered to the thud of bare feet and then the clatter of blocks and rigging but it was halfway through the forenoon watch before rapid was able to beat up to the rest of the squadron the first air of excitement gave way to silent resignation as the gratings were rigged and the hands piped aft to witness punishment two dozen lashes a man while the drums rolled and the spray pattered across the prisoners and onlookers alike paget touched his hat punishment carried out sir keen nodded and watched the hands dismissed the gratings removed for scrubbing while the flogged men were taken below to the sickbay he handed the articles of war to paget and said god damn this waiting when eventually quarrell climbed aboard from his gig he could barely control his excitement and pleasure at dawn rapid had ordered the vessel to heaveto and await a boarding party the lieutenant who had gone across in the boat had been thorough the brigantine was a greek trader and her master had been able to speak english and had been more than willing to cooperate the vessel had been loaded with olive oil and figs but quarrell described her as being so filthy that it was a marvel she obtained any cargoes at all quarrell took a deep breath the master was carrying several bottles of wine and brandy sir my first lieutenant saw them at once he turned and beamed at keen all french sir they glanced at bolitho he said nothing so keen remarked your lieutenant had his wits about him eh bolitho unrolled a chart across the table his mouth suddenly dry continue it was quarrells momentto prod him into haste would only fluster him the young commander said when questioned about the bottles sir the fellow admitted they had been given to him in exchange for oil three days ago he watched bolithos grave features it was rearadmiral joberts squadron sir no doubt about it the greek was able to describe them even the leopard figurehead on the flagship show me bolitho held down the chart with a ruler and dividers he could feel quarrells eagerness sense the pride his discovery had given him quarrell peered at the chart at the marks and lines which showed the squadrons position and progress they were steering due east sir he placed one finger on it that would put them about there keen leaned over the table beside him corsica he gave a sigh i should have guessed quarrell glanced from him to bolitho the greek master said that a french officer came aboard he told him they were going to take on fresh water keen frowned another long passage maybe bolitho stood up his mind working busily fresh water why did the mention of it always provoke such painful memories what have you done about the brigantine quarrell looked blank there was no warmth in bolithos voice ii knew how much you needed information sir so i considered it my duty to you let him go you put no guard aboard well no sir quarrell looked helplessly at keen for support keen said it could be the truth sir bolitho walked aft to the windows and pushed his hand through his hair he felt the deep scar on his temple a ready reminder of that other time when collecting water had seemed such a simple mission quarrell said i could chase after him sir he sounded lost too late bolitho watched some fish jump from argonautes shadow he would give you the slip after nightfall heading for corsica you think to take on water for three sail of the line and the two fifthrates what do you estimate he turned and looked at keen his eye throbbing painfully three four days keen nodded slowly we could still run him to earth sir bolitho sat on the bench seat and clasped his hands together he did not need a chart he could see it clearly in his mind joberts shipsif the wind stayed fair they could be pinned on a lee shore or trapped until they came out to fight keen said so it was neither egypt nor gibraltar after all sir fetch my flaglieutenant ozzard it was strange how he had managed to converse with stayt without touching on the court of inquiry stayt was wary withdrawn to such a point that they barely spoke except on matters of orders and signals when stayt arrived his eyes moved swiftly across the group by the table he asked may i get something sir richard the reports from the flagofficer in malta bring them quarrell said my first lieutenant was satisfied that the greek told him the truth sir bolitho said or maybe what the french wanted him to believe stayt laid down a folder on the table and bolitho strained his eyes to look through it convoy arrival escorts and departure times passengers and equipment to be disembarked or carried elsewhere bolitho pulled one paper towards him the name benbow standing out from the unknown clerks writing ignoring the others he snatched up the brass dividers and moved them quickly across his chart it was all he could do to stop himself from cursing aloud as his good eye watered with the strain he was putting on it three days four at the most it had to be had to be he looked up benbow sailed from malta in company with two homebound ships there is one frigate as additional escort keen exclaimed all that for just two ships and we are expected to manage with bolitho held up his hand i should have seen it val something that inchs first lieutenant said after the battle in his mind he could picture the weary lieutenant with the bandaged head pity ive not got that frenchies extra boom he could almost hear savills voice the man who had seen it yet had not realized what he had discovered bolitho said the ships are carrying a cargo of gold and precious stones a kings or should i say a sultans ransom he wanted to shout at them to bang the table and make them realize the enormity of the discovery and of joberts confidence jobert intends to attack that convoy and lift off the gold at sea corsica val i think not i believe this is what was intended from the start jobert and i got in the way but now that way is clear bolitho looked at quarrell return to your command and await orders quarrell backed away ii am sorry sir richard bolitho eyed him calmly your lieutenant was convinced so why not the rest of us as the door closed keen said we have nothing definite sir stayt added if the french are really in corsican waters and we fail to seek them out or inform lord nelson bolitho looked past him i know gentlemen i shall be held responsible he smiled shortly and this time i shall have no defence once more he crossed to the chart keen was trying to warn and protect him if they carried on as they were nobody would be able to blame him he lowered his head to study the neat calculations but if he went against everything but instinct and a new strange sense of destiny he might still be wrong in my estimation we have two days no more he touched the chart with the points of the dividers allowing for the weather we should make a rendezvous with the convoy about there he turned away so that they should not see his expression while they hunted fruitlessly along the rugged corsican coast the gold would be seized and herrick overwhelmed he would die fighting alongside his men but he would certainly die bolitho raised his voice mr yovell come out you quillpusher and i shall dictate my fighting instructions yovell padded across the cabin smiling happily as if he had just been awarded a title bolitho looked at stayt warn the signals midshipman to be ready he thought of sheaffe and wondered how he got along with his father alone with keen he said its a chance i must take he added with a wry smile it was the wine and the brandy which alerted me i could never imagine jobert giving anything to a poor greek trader unless he wanted us to know about it perhaps this time he has been too clever and overconfident keen doubted if quarrells information was enough to be certain of anything jobert may have laid some more bait but he was wily enough to know how bolitho might react bolithos change of mood this new confidence which left him free to joke with his secretary was unnerving keen said simply then it will be a fight bolitho took his arm the tone of keens voice making the vague strategy into stark brutal reality we shall face it together val he said quietly keen smiled yes together but all he saw was her face and for the first time he was afraid commander adam bolitho pushed the unruly hair from his eyes as he stared up at the men working on the foretopsail yard the sturdy brig firefly was heeling hard over on the larboard tack the sea creaming up to the sealed gunports and cascading along the lee scuppers he wore only his shirt and breeches and his clothes were plastered to his body like a wet skin he would never tire of it he wanted to laugh or sing as the brig his command dipped her bows steeply and threw up a sunburst cloud of spray he waited for the bows to rise again and then moved to the compass box it gave him a marvellous feeling of pride the vessel was heading due east with the balearic islands somewhere below the larboard horizon down again and another great curtain of spray flew above the forecastle where other men worked busily to trim the yards adams first lieutenant a youngster of his own age lurched from the rail and shouted take in another reef sir adam showed his teeth and laughed no its not time yet the lieutenant grimaced then smiled it never was time with his young commander adam moved restlessly about the poop while his firefly lifted and thundered over the tossing water just days ago he had been under the rocks shadow ready to leave the mediterranean and make his way back to an english winter instead he had received orders to return instantly to malta the fever on the rock was over and the despatch which adam had locked in his strongbox was to tell the admiral at malta to prevent a convoy from leaving for england if it had already sailed adam was to place himself under the orders of the convoys senior officer that too made him grin rearadmiral herrick to adam he was more like a fond uncle than a flagofficer it was exciting his own command and the sea to himself the french were out one squadron under rearadmiral jobert had been reported on the move if it had somehow managed to slip past his uncles squadron his ships were needed now at gibraltar to close gates and cut off any attempt by jobert to enter the atlantic a gigantic game of catandmouse adam wiped the spray from his lips a game for admirals and great ships of the line while herehe walked to the taffrail and stared at the frothing wake beneath the counter down there was his own cabin a luxury beyond imagination a place of his own he thought suddenly of the court of inquiry in malta he would learn the result when he reached there captain keen might share the bolitho curse of being hounded out of envy or revenge they had passed the homebound packet lord egmont and adam had wondered about her it would be just like his uncle tothe lookout called sail weather bow morrison his first lieutenant hurried to the ratlines but adam said no ill go as a midshipman he had always enjoyed skylarking with his companions during the dogwatches up and down the masts out and around the futtock shrouds few captains interfered they probably thought it would keep their young gentlemen out of mischief he climbed rapidly up the ratlines the wind ripping at his shirt once he hung out from the shrouds and looked down at the forward part of the vessel as the sea boiled over the catheads and tightly lashed anchors before frothing along the decks and leapfrogging over the black fourpounders he had always wanted a frigate be like his uncle had once been one of the best frigate captains in the fleet but when he looked at his lively firefly he could scarcely bear to think of ever leaving her he found the lookout perched comfortably on the crosstrees his battered face creased with curiosity as he watched his young lord and master swarming up to join him adam pulled a telescope from his belt and tried several times without success to steady it towards the larboard bow the lookout one of the oldest seamen in the ship said hoarsely i think there be two on em sir he barely raised his voice but it carried easily above the roar of wind and bucking canvas many years in all kinds of ships had taught him that adam wrapped his leg around a stay and tried again the mast was shaking so violently it was like a giant whip he thought he gasped there she is its fine eyesight you have marley the seaman grinned he didnt need a telescope but he liked the new commander a bit of a devil with the girls or soon would be he decided an extra lively wave thundered beneath the stem and lifted the hull towards the sky like a surfacing whale and there she was standing before the wind under closereefed topsails her hull still hidden by leaping crests as if she was driving herself under adam wiped the lens with his hand and almost lost his hold as his ship dived once more he waited counting the seconds until the jibboom began to lift again the sails flapping from it like wet banners adam closed the glass with a snap you were right there are two of them he patted the mans thick shoulder ill send you a relief the seaman would have spat had he been able but contented himself with nah sir ill stay theyll be some o lord nelsons ships adam slithered down a backstay all dignity forgotten as morrison hurried to meet him two sail of the line adam dropped his voice same tack as ourselves morrison grinned wed better not draw too close sir or we might be given some more orders adam pushed his fingers through his black hair it felt sticky with salt he knew he should be nervous perhaps even fearful but the same excitement would not leave him and he said you may take in that reef now and do not worry yourself about more orders from on high mr morrison for those two liners are french the men scampered to shorten sail then morrison took a deep breath what do you intend sir adam gestured to the nearest fourpounder even we are no match for them he became serious for a moment we shall follow them and see what they are about morrison had been first lieutenant under the previous captain who had managed to make daily life aboard firefly little better than drudgery commander bolitho was like a breath of clean air he was very capable and nobodys fool he hinted cautiously but your orders sir are to find the convoy or malta whichever comes first his mouth crinkled in a grin again i think these two gentlemen will lead us to one or tother eh morrison hurried away to assist the second lieutenant the old captain had never been like this he glanced aft again and saw adam bolitho beside the helm speaking with the masters mate he acted more like a midshipman than a captain aloud he said hell do me thats for certain but only the wind heard him two hundred miles eastnortheast of his nephews firefly and ignorant of the fact adam had been sent back from gibraltar bolitho gripped the poop rail and watched his ships reeling and buffeted in the same gale the wind which had veered to a strong northwesterly showed no signs of easing and when he steadied his telescope bolitho saw the little brig rapid standing out to windward her hull and lower spars deluged with spray and spindrift it was to be hoped that quarrell had made quite certain that the big thirtytwopounders from helicon were properly mounted and lashed firmly to their tackles a gun breaking loose in a gale could kill and maim like a mad beast it could also wreck the upper deck whilst doing it the sky was clear of all but a few streaky clouds hard blue and with little warmth he saw a party of seamen with a boatswains mate hauling a ragged line through a block and preparing to reeve a new one to replace it they were soaked in spray and the salt would do little to help their thirst too much rum or brandy would do more harm than good bolitho bit his lip and wondered at his earlier confidence after pounding their way farther south with sardinias blurred coastline rarely lost from view the hope of making a rendezvous with herricks convoy seemed like a bad dream even supposing jobert was making for the same objective he stamped on his doubts and turned from the rail to see midshipman sheaffe and his signal party watching him they immediately dropped their eyes or became engrossed elsewhere bolitho allowed his aching mind to explore his calculations yet again the convoy would be very slow and precise in its progress he had done all he could with his small sqaudron spread out as far as possible without losing contact completely thank god for barracouta and rapid he thought despairingly but for themhe heard paget shout at a helmsman and a muttered answer paget would stand no nonsense and he at least showed no signs of doubt he was a good man bolitho thought and as a young lieutenant had fought under duncan at camperdown there were not too many officers in the squadron who had seen a battle like that one keen climbed up from the quarterdeck to join him he had been down on the orlop to visit one of the midshipmen who had broken a leg after being flung bodily from a gangway in the gale keen stared at the forecastle his eyes red with strain and bolitho knew he had barely left the deck since the wind had risen bolitho smiled a strange sight val bright and bitter like a dockside whore keen laughed despite his apprehension he wanted to tell bolitho to break off the hunt it was finished before it had begun even if he had been right about jobert and it seemed less likely with each aching mile they would not find him now keen was sick and tired of it and hated to think what it would do to bolitho when the truth came out everyone said that nelson had survived only on his luck he had been fortunate it was rare bolitho knew keen was watching him and could guess what he was thinking as flagcaptain he wanted to advise him as a friend he knew he could not bolitho looked at the cold sky and thought again of falmouth maybe belinda would have received his letter or have heard the news from someone else he thought too of the girl with the dark misty eyes he smiled brave zenoria he had called her she was the one good thing in all this endurance and failure keen saw the smile and wondered how did he go on like this it was fanatical unswerving but it would not save him at a court martial how was the boy midshipman estridge wasnt it a clean break sir the surgeon was more troubled by some of his other injured hands hes had more cuts and gashes than a small war there was a seaman working beside one of the ninepounders and bolitho had seen him earlier he was stripped to the waist not out of bravado but to try and keep his clothing dry when he had turned bolitho had seen his back scarred from shoulders to waist like the marks of a giant claw it made him think of zenoria and what keen had saved her from but when keen laughed at his earlier remark the seaman had turned and looked up at him bolitho had rarely seen such hatred in a mans glance keen saw it too and said tightly i read the articles of war before a flogging i did not compose the bloody rules bolitho could sense his anger something he had rarely shown even after the court of inquiry he saw extra marines at hatchways their scarlet coats dark with flung spray keen was taking no chances better to prevent trouble than enforce the misery of suppressing it bolitho said i am going below he looked at him squarely if i am wrong he shrugged as if it were of little concern then he added some will be pleased i hope that then they will let my family rest in peace keen watched him stride towards the poop ladder and felt a stab of pity as bolitho caught his arm against the mizzen bitts paget moved quietly beside him may i ask what you think of our chances sir keen glanced at him the first lieutenant the link between captain and ships company quarterdeck and forecastle he replied ask me again when we have run jobert ashore they both turned and paget exclaimed not thunder too keen looked past him bolitho was climbing to the poop again and wearing the old sword with allday a few paces behind him the lookout yelled with disbelief gunfire sir to th southrd bolitho looked at them no not thunder this time keen stared how did he do it moments earlier he must have been accepting failure now he looked strangely calm even his voice was untroubled as he said general signal mr sheaffe make more sail he watched the flags hurriedly bent onto the halliards and sent soaring up to the yards for all his ships to see bolitho wanted to grip his hands together for surely they must be shaking acknowledged sir that was stayt appearing silently like a cat the distant murmur of cannon fire rolled across the water it was a long way off bolitho said well not fight before dawn tomorrow that was a fact which had to be faced when darkness closed in the ships might be scattered by the blustery wind by dawn it could be too late benbow was more than a match for any eager privateers or corsairs from the north african shore but against a whole squadron she would stand no chance he cocked his head to listen as the gunfire came again not many ships perhaps two what could that mean he said general signal prepare for battle the people will sleep at their guns tonight he touched the hilt of the old sword and felt a shiver run through his body he could recall as if it were yesterday the moment when he had been walking with adam to the sallyport on portsmouth point then he had looked back to search for something so perhaps he had known it would be the last time men of war rearadmiral thomas herrick stood by the weather nettings his chin sunk in his neckcloth while he watched benbows seamen hauling on the braces to trim the yards and reset the reefed topsails everything took an eternity it had taken a whole day to make any progress and drained all their skill now at last they were past the southernmost tip of sardinia which lay some fifty miles to starboard on the other beam was africa at about the same distance wallowing downwind of benbow were two heavy merchantmen governor and prince henry herrick could only guess at the value of their cargoes he thought yet again of bolithos face in the stern cabin of this ship the one which had once proudly flown his flag when herrick had been his captain he could not forget the bitterness in bolithos voice the reckless contempt when he had damned the admirals court of inquiry it was a strange coincidence which had decided admiral sir marcus laforey to take passage in benbow he had left his flagcaptain in temporary charge although the way sir marcus ate and drank it seemed unlikely he would ever return to malta he could head captain dewar discussing something with the sailingmaster herrick sighed he would have to make it up with his flagcaptain for dewar was an excellent officer and very conscientious herrick blamed himself for dewars wariness he had been foul company since the inquiry he felt the spray on his face and peered beyond the starboard bow where reeling like a ship in distress his only frigate was tacking yet again to try to stand up to windward she was the philomel of twentysix guns and but for the grave news of the french squadron she would have been completing a much needed refit in the dockyard where benbow had been overhauled herrick gripped his hands behind him and looked along the tilting main deck he thought too of inch another friend one of their closeknit community was he dead he wondered it was unlikely he would have struck to the french he glanced at the sky so clear yet so hostile perhaps by tomorrow the wind would have died downany reduction would be a blessing captain dewar crossed the deck and said shall we lieto tonight sir herrick shook his head he felt the ship lift under him and his sturdy legs bracing to take it unlike bolitho he had never got into the habit of pacing the deck he liked to stand and feel his ship he could think better that way he had long decided no we need more sea room before dark pass the word for lights to be hoisted on the merchantmen we can hold station that way philomel will have to manage on her own dewar gauged the moment as a wildfowler tests the wind before firing a shot dyou think viceadmiral bolitho has met with this this jobert if not im sure hell stand between us and the enemy he thought suddenly of the eight hundred miles which still lay ahead before they could moor beneath the guns of the rock fever or not it would offer a breathing space and perhaps he might obtain another escort but he said if anyone can do it our dick will dewar eyed him curiously but remained silent they were on good terms again he would try again later herrick toyed with the idea of going aft but the thought of laforey with his gout and his steady drinking turned him against it the masthead lookout yelled gunfire to the westrd the sound must have carried more swiftly to his dizzy perch for even as herrick made to speak he heard the distant bang of cannon fire and some intermittent shots from smaller weapons herricks worried mind cleared as if he had ducked his head in ice water clear for action captain dewar that was another thing which herrick did not understand he could never bring himself to use his captains first name yet in other ways he had learned and used so much from bolithos example signal the convoy to close up he swore as the calls shrilled and benbow s six hundred seamen and marines dropped what they were doing and rushed to obey the awakened drums damn the light and the wind everything was against them how many were there he forced himself to show a confidence which had eluded him after the lookouts cry who were they firing at more crashes and bangs rolled across the tossing white horses but the lookout stayed silent they were still a long way off and the sullen explosions were using the stiff wind to carry their message signal philomel to investigate herrick opened and closed his hands behind him the little frigate could always turn and fly with the wind if she got into danger it would have helped so much if he knew her captain his name was saunders that was all he had discovered herrick strode to the opposite side and saw the nearest merchantman setting her topgallants to bear up on her companion god they looked like fat beasts for the slaughter herrick thought glumly he heard the first lieutenants voice urging the hands to extra efforts as they cleared the ship for action each man fully aware that they now had two admirals on board herrick considered his choices turn back for malta even with the wind in their favour it was still another four hundred miles in daylight the french would soon find them so hold the present course there was always a chance that the enemy was being engaged by an unexpected friendly force or that they might manage to lose them during the night he said we will standto throughout the night captain dewar he seemed to see dear dulcie in his thoughts she was always so proud of him he turned towards the western horizon which was already painted in the deeper hues of sunset a nervouslooking lieutenant one of laforeys staff hovered at his elbow and said timidly my admiral has nowhere to go sir now that the ship is cleared for action herrick bit back a rude retort there were too many ears around him he replied calmly i am most sorry but as you see all our people are having the same inconvenience under his breath he muttered bloody fool a shrill voice pealed down from the mainmast crosstrees dewar had sent his signals midshipman aloft with a telescope deck there two sail of the line to westrd sir they wear french colours herrick glanced quickly along the deck before him every gun manned other halfnaked figures waiting to trim or set more sails marines in their scarlet coats and crossbelts ready to fight benbow could and would give good account of herself as she had proved several times even her company was lucky to have so many trained and seasoned seamen she had been too long out of england to have to rely on the press and the sweepings of the assizes two to one were acceptable odds if lady luck had been less kind the enemy might have been amongst them soon after dusk and it would have been impossible to fight and protect the merchantmen at the same time he saw philomels masts strain hard over as she fought across the eye of the wind and then filled her sails on the opposite tack herrick smiled grimly bolitho had always loved frigates he on the other hand preferred something steadier and more powerful under his feet maybe his early experience of a tyrannical captain and a mutinous company had soured him against them in his later years the midshipman called down again small vessel is engaged with them sir his shrill voice cracked in disbelief a brig sir herrick stared up at the topmast whoever commanded that brig was trying to warn him how could he know he rubbed his eyes and saw the second signals midshipman peering up at his friend more like a lover than a wouldbe officer herrick thought he snapped alter course steer souwest by south he waited for the signal to be run up what the devil is captain saunders about a few isolated bangs echoed across the water as philomel gathered the wind and increased speed towards the enemy recall that madman i shall require him right here very soon eventually the midshipman lowered his glass and called philomel does not acknowledge sir god damn it is everyone blind he thought of bolitho as he said it and was ashamed he added alter course anyway captain dewar the slight change of direction laid the two big merchantmen almost in line abeam under benbow s lee it might at least make them feel more confident when the enemys full strength became apparent the nervous lieutenant returned and herrick glared at him well the lieutenant stared round at the gun crews the sanded decks the marines bayoneted muskets sir marcus sends his compliments sir and herrick had an idea tell my servant to give the admiral a bottle of my best port as the lieutenant hurried towards the poop he shouted and another after that he looked at dewar that should keep him quiet damn him the darkness moved across from the opposite horizon like an endless cloak even the wave crests seemed to diminish as men became shadows and the sea lost its menace but the gunfire continued on and off the quick snapping bang of the brigs cannon followed by the angry bellow of heavier artillery captain dewar took a glass of brandy from his coxswain and watched as his admiral did likewise whoever is doing that is a brave man sir herrick felt the brandy sear his saltcracked lips there were a few other brigs reported in this area but in his heart he knew which one had tossed caution aside to warn him he said slowly at first light i intend to engage dewar nodded and wondered why herrick had said it he knew his admiral by now he had never doubted that he would attack bolitho lowered his head and stood between two deckhead beams the orlop deck a place of spiralling lanterns and prancing shadows after the long open gun decks overhead it seemed all but deserted the surgeons mate and his loblolly boys in their long aprons stood around the makeshift tables where tuson would perform his grisly work freshly scrubbed tubs for the wings and limbs of his amputations were a grim reminder of the work which went on here once a battle was joined carcaud was checking over a line of instruments which seemed to blink like lamps as the lanterns swung above them he like most of the men bolitho had seen while he had walked tirelessly through his flagship avoided his glance it was as if they felt unsure of him in their presence instead of standing aloof on the quarterdeck amongst his officers at the door of the sickbay bolitho paused and waited for tuson to look up from his preparations there was a smell of dressings and enforced cleanliness the only other occupant peered at bolitho from a cot midshipman estridge was not entirely saved by his broken leg tuson had had him rolling bandages although he was lying on his back bolitho nodded to him and then said to the surgeon it will be daylight in an hour tuson regarded him bleakly how is the eye sir bolitho shrugged it has been worse he could not account for his strange disregard for danger even death he had been on every deck had made sure that everyone had seen him he had imagined that down here at least a place he had always dreaded he would have felt anxiety if anything he felt only relief it was a level of recklessness he did not remember in the past resigned perhaps so where was the worth in worrying any more tuson looked at the low deckhead it almost brushed his white hair the ship is full of sounds bolitho knew what he meant normally you could recognize the general movement of men of seamanship and the daily routine of eating and working but now with the ship cleared for battle the noises were all overhead concentrated around the guns as they lay behind sealed ports their crews huddled against them trying or pretending to sleep soon those same guns would be like furnace bars and no man would dare to touch them with bare hands the sounds of sea and wind were muted here the sluice of water against the bilge the occasional clatter of a pump as men unfit to fight carried out their regular soundings of the well it was uncanny eerie he thought they must be so close to the enemy and yet with the coming of darkness the distant gunfire had ceased as if they were alone tuson watched him he had already noted that bolitho had changed into a crisp new shirt and neckcloth and his uniform coat bore the glittering epaulettes with the twin silver stars he pondered on it did bolitho not care did he have a death wish or was it that he cared too much so that his own safety had become secondary he was hatless and his black hair shone in the moving beams and only the loose lock of hair which tuson knew better than most hid a terrible scar showed any signs of greyness an odd mixture he would be handed his hat and sword when he returned to the deck tuson had never seen it but the silent ceremony was almost legendary in the squadron perhaps throughout the whole fleet allday with the sword was as well known as a bishop with his mitre tuson said i have had captain inch taken forrard sir the place is less comfortable he glanced briefly through the door at the empty table and the waiting instruments his crew standing or sitting like scavengers but i feel that he will be better placed there a midshipmans white breeches appeared on the companion ladder and after a slight hesitation he said captain keens respects sir richard and bolitho nodded it was little hickling who although quite unsuspecting had helped him to smuggle the girl aboard the packet brig at malta i am ready thank you he looked at tuson a lingering glance in which the surgeon later realized he could see no flaw or injury take care of the people tuson watched him leave and you take care of you he murmured bolitho with hickling panting behind him made his way ladder by ladder to the quarterdeck it was still very dark with just occasional whitecaps beyond the sides to distinguish sea from sky but the stars were fainter and there was an air of morning stale and damp keen waited by the rail the winds eased sir still fresh enough to keep em guessing he sounded relieved that hickling had found him keen had never known bolitho to tour a ship alone before not even with allday as if he needed to feel the mood of each man under his flag allday clipped on his sword and ozzard handed him his hat before scuttling away to the hold where he would remain until the day was won or lost bolitho could distinguish the litter of flags on the deck the occasional movements of the signals midshipman and his assistants stayt was here too and bolitho guessed that he had taken time to clean and load his beautiful pistol just a matter of waiting val he wondered if the other ships were following astern if rapid and barracouta were on station it must have been a long night for most of them bolitho thought he remembered the battle of the saintes when he had commanded his first frigate it had taken an eternity for the two fleets to draw near enough to each other to fight all day or so it had seemed they had watched the tremendous display of the french masts as they had lifted above the horizon like knights on the field of battle it had been awesome and terrible but they had won the day if too late to win a war keen stood beside him silently preparing himself and searching his thoughts for any weakness the sporadic gunfire had been a clear message that the convoy lay somewhere ahead and was under attack once he glanced at bolitho to see if there was any surprise or satisfaction that he had been proved right that he had found the enemy when any honest man would have admitted that he had doubted his wisdom in acting on rapids information but even in the gloom he recognized bolithos quiet determination rather than any hint of relief and they were going to fight it did not sound as if many vessels were involved keen saw the girl again in his mind and wanted to speak her name aloud if only to reassure himself it only took a second for a man to die the cause and the victory did not matter to the one who heard the cannons roar for the last time he pictured inch down on the orlop hearing the din of war unable to help or be with his friends keen had visited him after he had left the quarterdeck to speak with his lieutenants on the gun decks inch was very weak and in great pain from the two amputations to his arm keen felt the sweat cold on his spine he had been wounded and still felt the raw wound on occasions but to lie on a table with his men all around watching and suffering waiting their turn how could anyone stand it the flensing knife and then the agony of the saw choking on the leather strap to stifle the screams he recalled what he had told zenoria it is what i am trained to do the words seemed to mock him now luke fallowfield the sailingmaster banged his red hands together and the sound made several of the men nearby start with alarm we are all on edge keen thought the odds no longer matter it is like a reckoning bolitho looked abeam and saw the first hint of dawn a faint glow on the horizons edge many eyes would be watching it measuring their chances the margin of life and death keen strode to the compass and peered at the flickering light bring her closer to the wind mr fallowfield alter course two points to starboard men moved like eager shadows in the darkness and bolitho thanked god he had keen as his captain if they wandered too far east they would never be able to beat back in time to close with the convoy he bunched his fists and pressed them against his thighs they needed light and yet many were dreading what they might see bolitho touched his left eyelid and wanted to rub it he thought of all tusons arguments and warnings they would count for nothing today the helmsman called sousouwest zur full an bye bolitho heard the maintopsail flap as if with irritation as argonaute nudged still further into the wind her yards braced hard round to hold her on the same tack soon soon he thought momentarily that he had spoken aloud he heard keen telling paget to put more lookouts aloft one to take a telescope when he looked up he thought he could see the white crossbelts of the marines in the maintop a man stretching out in a yawn not tiredness this time he thought it was often the first sign of fear it was strange he thought that he might fall today and falmouth would not hear of it until next year a christmas in the big grey house below pendennis castle singers from the town to wish them well and to amuse little elizabeth he stopped his drifting thoughts and said union flag at the fore if you please he heard the squeal of halliards as his red command flag was hauled down and replaced seconds later by the biggest jack in the ship it was still hidden in darkness but when the sun came up jobert would see it he felt strangely elated with no sense of anxiety at all pagets shadow turned from the quarterdeck rail colours aloft sir richard bolitho nodded paget sounded much as he felt committed a chance to end the waiting deck there sail on the lee bow bolitho said well done val we are in a perfect position a gun echoed across the water just the one and bolitho thought he saw the flash for just a splitsecond another lookout yelled convoy ahead make a general signal bolitho moved restlessly across the deck his fingers to his chin the lookouts cry made him look up again two sail of the line weather bow bolitho said so there we have it val two of the devils he glanced at stayt make to the squadron enemy in sight when he looked across the lee side again he saw the horizon salmonpink like an unending bridge above the braced yards of the foremast the flag flicked out huge and bright and completely isolated from the ship which remained in shadow for a few more moments general chase sir that was stayt bolitho opened his mouth and then shut it again two ships of the line it was not the numbers but the bearing it did not fit the pattern again he felt the touch of warning no signal the squadron to maintain station he did not turn as more gunfire cracked over the array of white horses some of the royal marines in the foretop were staring up at the flag above them and cheering their voices wild above the press of wind and canvas bolitho loosened his sword in its scabbard without even noticing what he had done into battle all the resentment and suffering would be forgotten it was their way another gun banged out but from the squadron astern keen exclaimed hells teeth who is doing that stayt called icarus sir stayt clambered into the shrouds as the first light touched the masts and yards of the two ships which followed in their wake from icarus sir enemy in sight to the noreast keen stared i dont believe it bolitho walked to the rail and grasped it firmly it felt cold and damp not for long inform barracouta and rapid he watched the breathless signals party hoisting more signals and then walked to the shrouds where stayt hung with one arm bent over a ratline while he levelled his telescope three sail of the line sir his lips moved as he read the flags and two other vessels bolitho found that he could accept it even though he could see his squadron caught in the prongs of the converging ships like the neck of a poachers bag the two ships originally sighted must have arrived by sheer coincidence or had been sent from hiding by another commander but jobert was here and the balance had tilted completely five to three and one of them would be joberts powerful threedecker the two lesser vessels as yet unidentified must be the two frigates the odds were formidable and his choice nonexistent he watched the suns rim as it lifted above the sea and painted the sails of friends and enemies alike in pale gold bolitho took a glass and rested it on the hammock nettings waiting for argonaute to dip her flank into a trough he saw the overlapping cluster of the convoy and felt his heart tighten as he recognized benbows familiar hull and raked masts her ports already open her guns still in black shadow a ripple of flashes spat from the two frenchmen and he watched thin waterspouts leap amongst the waves and then be shredded by the keen wind joberts squadron must have sailed down the other coastline of sardinia making all speed while he had dealt with helicon and her wounded now like tracks on a chart they were all met joberts ships on the larboard quarter and not yet visible from the quarterdeck the other two converging to starboard firing towards benbow as they advanced chainshot and langridge to dismast or at least cripple her jobert would finish it more gunfire crashed out and bolitho shifted the glass to stare at a small frigate which had appeared around the two seventyfours she must be herricks other escort perhaps the one which had challenged the enemy and so foiled their surprise attack she was out of control and almost totally dismasted she must have attempted to harry the enemys rear like a terrier going for a bear but had drawn too near to their sternchasers a marine was shouting there be another lads bolitho saw a second set of sails filling and shortening as a brig appeared close to the crippled frigate it was impossible the one thing which unnerved him she was adams brig firefly her tiny fourpounders spitting defiantly at the enemy but unable to draw off their advance benbow was changing tack the sunlight laying bare her ranks of black muzzles as she turned towards the enemy bolitho saw the double line of guns shoot out their vivid orange tongues the smoke billowing inboard as if herricks ship had taken fire bolitho said harshly prepare to engage joberts squadron herrick would have to defend himself the treasureships could wait keen cupped his hands stand by mr paget wear ship and lay her on the larboard tack he hurried to the compass as his men flung themselves on the braces and halliards we will steer noreast mr fallowfield he was round again even as the first signal broke from the yards general form line of battle the deck tilted to the thrust of rudder and braced yards and bolitho watched as first one then the other of joberts ships appeared to glide into view steady she goes sir noreast we have the windgage bolitho thought but not for long it would be every ship for herself more crashes came from the convoy but bolitho ignored them he caught a glimpse of despatch as she floundered round to follow her flagship resetting her topgallants and even her main course to keep on station icarus was hidden astern of her but every captain knew the odds and there were the two frigates waiting to pounce if one of the bigger ships became disabled he said signal barracouta to engage the enemy keen looked at him a muscle in his throat jerking as a full broadside vibrated against the hull like a peal of distant thunder bolitho met his glance lapish must do his best it might baffle the enemy when they saw a twodecker suddenly clap on more sail and dash into the fray if lapish used that surprise he might bring down some spars unless bolitho closed his mind to the appalling risks he was telling lapish to take he heard allday whispering fiercely to bankart and saw the youth shake his head his stubborn determination somehow pathetic as the distant guns roared out once again bankart stood his ground whatever it was costing him he was more terrified of showing fear bolitho raised his telescope and trained it through the black rigging and for a few moments saw familiar faces leap into view before he found the enemy there she was her leaping leopard savage and realistic in the strengthening sunshine the rearadmirals flag streaming out from her mizzen keen crossed to join him his fingers drumming a silent beat on his sword hilt bolitho said we must stop her val he felt him watching him jobert will sacrifice every ship and man he has just to snatch the gold with us helpless to stop him keen nodded his mind still reeling from the change of events to begin with he had been able to ignore the danger in the face of their timely arrival now there seemed no chance even of survival he watched bolithos expression the way he covered his left eye while he rested the glass on a seamans bare shoulder to get a clearer view it seemed to steady him he was able to accept what must happen but firstbolitho lowered the glass load and run out then he looked at stayt hoist the signal for close action he handed the glass to sheaffes small assistant ill not need this again i think he walked away from the others and stared at the blue water and the endless desert of small crests throughout his small squadron it would be the same he thought brave men afraid to die cowards fearful of living they would follow his flag wherever it led he saw their faces montresor houston lapish and young quarrell nursing his two big guns and adam back there in his first command in his twentythird year or perhaps like inch he had already paid for his impudent courage he looked up as the signal for close action broke out and recalled that other time when men and boys like some of these had died to keep it flying he shifted his gaze to the bright flag at the fore and as guns cracked out from the convoy he was surprised to discover that all hate and bitterness were gone they were the luxuries of the living beneath the flag the two converging lines of ships appeared to be closing rapidly although joberts squadron still stood at about three miles range keen watched fixedly and then said hes not reduced sail yet sir bolitho wanted to climb to the poop and see what was happening in the convoy there the firing had become general and the last time he had looked bolitho had seen benbow wreathed in smoke as she engaged the two french seventyfours on either beam at once it was never a comfortable plan it meant dividing the gun crews and left few hands to carry out repairs and remove the wounded the sharper crack of small weapons told him that adams firefly had thrown any caution to the wind as she tacked as close as she dared to the two big frenchmen adam knew benbow wore herricks flag not that he would need any encouragement to fight bolitho thought of keens comment jobert had hoisted no signals either and had obviously drilled his ships for this very moment keen asked without lowering his glass shall i shorten sail sir yes take in the courses otherwise jobert will overreach our line before we can cripple some of his ships paget shouted barracouta has gone for the frigates he sounded excited god shes crossing the stern of one of em lapish had used his disguise well while the two french frigates had held their station one astern of the other he had swept suddenly towards them with all the wind in his favour his starboard battery was blasting into the enemy while he cut so dangerously close across the leaders stern that it looked as if they had collided smoke and flame belched from the frenchman and somebody gave a wild cheer as the maintopmast plummeted over her side the attendant tangle of rigging and snapped spars dragging her over and giving lapishs gun crews the rare chance of a second broadside before barracoutas helm went down and she changed tack towards the french line even some of keens seamen paused as they fisted and kicked the main and forecourses against their yards to stare as their one frigate curtsied round before the second enemy vessel had time to follow her two broadsides had rendered the other ship momentarily helpless and the list of killed and wounded must have struck them hard bolitho made himself watch joberts flagship like her consorts she was painted in black and white stripes her gunports rising up her tumblehome in a checkered pattern keen said he intends to overreach us sir bolitho said nothing leopards jibboom appeared to be pointing directly at their own then keen said theyre shortening now sir he sounded tight with concentration relief too for if joberts ships crossed their line of battle they could smash into the convoy while keen lost vital time trying to head round and engage the reduction of sails might settle their final embrace the range was less than two miles now and seemed to make joberts flagship loom even higher above the choppy wave crests stand by starboard batteries keen drew his sword his eyes slitted in concentration bolitho heard the order being piped to the lower gun deck and imagined the faces he had come to know he said we must try to break the line pass astern of jobert and let montresor and houston tackle the others ship to ship broadside to broadside he saw the stabbing lines of flashes as joberts threedecker fired a slow broadside the sea boiled violently as the heavy balls screeched above him and tore rigging to shreds and punched a dozen holes in the sails men swarmed aloft with the boatswains bellowing voice guiding them to the worst damage less than a mile now more shots crashed overhead and two balls hit the lower hull like battering rams bolitho wiped his eyes as smoke swirled over the quarterdeck in a freak downdraught before being sucked away downwind signal rapid to assist benbow bolitho tried not to consider quarrells chances but it would lend heart to herrickhe bit his lipand adam please god he was still safe paget yelled hes resetting his topsls the bugger bolitho watched as leopards topmen struggled out on their yards while the helm went over and joberts ship changed tack as if to avoid a final encounter as she presented her full broadside she fired it was like one gigantic explosion and bolitho had to seize the rail as many of the balls struck argonautes side or crashed across the forecastle wood fragments whirled in the air and most of the starboard carronades crew were cut to bloody fragments keens sword flashed down fire the gun captains jerked their lanyards and argonaute swayed over to the thrust of her combined broadside the lower battery their main armament reacted badly some of the crews there must have been stunned or unnerved by the weight of the enemys iron some of leopards sails lifted and writhed and her foretopsail was torn apart by the force of the wind through the ragged holes it was not enough to make her even falter despatch was closing with the second frenchman and bolitho could hear icarus firing from extreme range at the rearmost twodecker he hurried to the nettings the crews of the unemployed ninepounders staring at him their eyes wild their naked bodies heaving with exertion as if they had been running bolitho watched his two ships closing with the enemy icarus almost hidden in a rolling fog of gunsmoke he shouted follow jobert he winced as more balls slammed into the hull and a man screamed briefly as he was cut down keen shouted put up your helm close with her man fallowfield glared at him and then gestured to his helmsmen who clustered around the big wheel as if it was a last refuge small flashes lit up leopards fightingtops and several musket balls almost spent slammed harmlessly into the hammocks the royal marines crouched against their frail protection and waited for the command to fire some even glanced at captain bouteiller willing him to give the order keen called set the forecourse the hands had been waiting and bolitho saw the great sail billow from its yard cutting away the vision of the enemy like a huge curtain more shots whimpered across the quarterdeck and poop and allday muttered stay close to me lad theyre out of range but stayt pulled out his pistol and stared at it as if he were seeing it for the first time the air was filled with noise gun captains yelling and gesturing to their crews who wielded their handspikes to heave the smoking barrels round towards the enemy overhead seamen called to one another while severed standing and running rigging flapped out in the wind and defied their grasping fingers occasionally the spread nets would jerk as something broke free and plummeted down from aloft and bolitho knew it was a miracle that more damage had not been done he heard two bangs loud and resonant and knew rapid was using her borrowed thirtytwopounders they would give the french ships something to worry about they might even draw one of them away from herrick who was being raked from two sides at once he saw a frigate falling downwind her foremast trailing over the side antlike figures swarming amongst the wreckage to hack it away a cheer from some of the gun crews stopped abruptly as if to a word of command bolitho gripped his sword and saw barracouta reel over as another burst of crossfire tore into her and brought down more spars and flailing rigging keen murmured bad luck but hes knocked one of them out of the fight he ran to the side as joberts ship fired again some of the balls ripping overhead with just a few feet to spare stayt said abruptly we cant mark him down the words were wrung from his lips as if he were feeling every shot must get closer bolitho shouted captain keen head for the convoy it was suddenly more than clear that jobert intended to take the merchantmen as he had planned and abandon his captains to stop or delay bolithos ships from interfering a great shower of sparks burst from despatchs main deck and timber splashed down alongside for an instant bolitho imagined that a magazine had exploded but it must have been a powder charge which had burst before it could be rammed home as the french ship drifted away from her bolitho saw that she too was badly mauled and despatch was already nudging round her lower battery firing again and again although many of her upper gun crews had been cut down by the explosion icarus too was obeying the signal and appeared to be overlapping her enemy her sails filled with holes and some of her guns unmanned or smashed with her helm over argonautes bowsprit followed joberts ship as if to impale her the arrowhead of sea between them was torn again and again by leaping fins of spray many followed by the terrible thud of iron striking deep into the hull stayt remarked were alone bolitho looked at him stayt sounded so calm almost matter of fact a man without nerves or one resigned to the inevitable larboard battery keens sword caught the sunlight fire there were some wild cheers as the frenchmans sails bucked and split and telltale puffs of smoke along her tall hull told of their success keens regular drills were paying off even now stayt ducked as musket balls scythed over the hammock nettings and two seamen were hurled to the deck one screaming as he clawed at his stomach the dead man was thrown over the side the other dragged to the nearest hatch and eventually down to tuson bolitho shuddered it was happening there now the knife and saw the dreadful agony while some poor wretch was held on the table stayt coughed bolitho looked at him and saw him falling very slowly to his knees a look of intent concentration on his dark features midshipman sheaffe ran to his aid and put an arm round his shoulders bolitho said get him below stayt looked up at him but seemed to have difficulty in focusing his eyes he had one hand to his waist and already his fingers were wet with blood stayt tried to shake his head but the pain made him cry out no he stared at bolitho his eyes desperate hear me bolitho knelt beside him his ears cringing to the crash and roar of cannon fire leopards masts were no longer at a distance they were rising up alongside huge and formidable as the two ships continued to drive together what is it he knew stayt was dying men were falling everywhere one of the helmsmen was dragging himself into the gloom of the poop his efforts mocked by the great pattern of blood he left behind him it was my fatheri wanted to tell he coughed violently and blood ran from his mouth i wrote to him about the girl never thought what he might he rolled up his eyes and gasped oh dear god help me sheaffe said ill carry him sir sheaffes voice seemed to give stayt some impossible strength his eyes turned towards the midshipman and he started to grin it made him look terrible admiral sheaffe it was a friend of my father ysee he turned back to bolitho and shut his eyes tightly as shots scored across the deck killing a seaman who was thrusting his rammer into a gun and taking off the arm of his companion like a dead twig always hated you thought you knew sir all fathers together he tried to speak clearly but there was too much blood he was drowning in it yours mine and this young mid he coughed again and this time the blood did not stop sheaffe lowered him to the deck and when he looked up his face was like stone then he picked up the silvermounted pistol and thrust it into his belt keen hurried across the deck and shouted were all but into her the deck bucked and splinters flew like hornets hurling men aside or leaving them too badly injured to help themselves he saw stayts body and said damn them bolitho walked to the nettings again and using a marines shoulder for support climbed up to look at the other vessel on every hand the battle raged flotsam and broken spars drifted abeam while here and there a lonely corpse floated beneath the thunder of cannon fire like an uncaring swimmer he saw joberts command flag above the smoke the sparkle of musket fire as the sharpshooters sought out targets the shot which had killed stayt had probably been aimed at him he turned his back on the black and white ship and glanced down at the bronzed marine it was sheer madness and he expected to feel the crushing agony between his shoulderblades at any second his epaulettes would make a fine marker but he could feel the same recklessness the need to make these men trust him even though he had led them to disaster he said aim well my lad but save the admiral for me eh he clapped the marine on his rigid shoulder and saw his wildness change to astonishment his face split into a huge grin the marine exclaimed gods teeth sir i got two o the buggers already he was levelling and firing again as bolitho jumped down to the deck the hull shook violently as more shots hammered into it and an eighteenpounder was lifted by an invisible hand and toppled onto some of its crew the barrel must have been as hot as a furnace but the men soon died their screams lost in the bombardment the foretopsail blew in ribbons and without warning the maintopgallant mast staggered and then plunged to the deck like a forest giant bolitho stared through the smoke his eyes stinging and streaming they had to get alongside a sudden gap in the smoke made him realize how close they were to the convoy he saw benbow her flags still flying but her mizzen gone firing without a pause into the ship nearest to her the other one was almost dismasted and he saw the two little brigs firing at her before the smoke swirled down again his foot touched stayts outflung arm and he looked down at him in those few minutes he had learned more about the man than ever before how petty and empty all the jealousy and hate seemed now he looked at keen we have the wind use it his voice hardened ram her then he drew his sword and heard allday pull out his cutlass now hard over keen swung away it was pointless to try to protest or explain joberts company would overwhelm them they would have no chance but they never had from the beginning he shouted man the braces put up your helm mr fallowfield but the masters mate had taken charge fallowfield lay near the wheel where he had died his ear to the deck as if he were listening for something mr paget prepare to ram paget stared up at him and then ran towards the forecastle his hanger already drawn as with ponderous intent argonaute turned towards her enemy her jibboom like a lance her sails so torn and holed that even the jubilant wind a cruel spectator to the fight could barely offer steerageway despatch was alongside another ship her guns still firing even though her muzzles were grinding against those of her enemy jobert had now realized bolithos intention but could do little about it by changing tack directly towards the convoy he had the wind abeam he could neither turn towards argonaute nor could he allow the wind to carry him away without exposing his stern to a murderous broadside oblivious to the din bolitho watched the shrieking balls as joberts guns tried to traverse onto the slowmoving ship with the huge jack at her foremast french sailors were already running along the gangway firing towards argonaute some falling or pitching overboard as they came under fire from bouteillers marksmen a swivel blasted out from somewhere and bolitho saw one of the scarlet coats fall it was lieutenant orde his sword still in his hand as he stared up at the sky keen gripped the rail watching transfixed as the big threedecker once so aloof and distant loomed above them men were firing down and he felt the planks jerk by his feet a heavy ball hit stayts body so that it convulsed as if he were only shamming death the frenchmen were running to the point of impact and the chorus of their cries and curses was like one tremendous voice which even the battle could not quench keen turned as bolitho touched his sleeve are the guns ready keen nodded at this range sir the jibboom thrust slowly through leopards foremast shrouds it looked such a gentle motion but keen knew the whole weight of his command was behind it he waved his sword to the lieutenant at the larboard battery the seconds seemed like hours and keen had time to consider several things at once the great chorus of voices and then in that fragment of time before the triggerlines were jerked taut he heard bolitho say fine words do not a broadside make val then the space between the hulls vanished in a frothing torment of flame and smoke burning wads floated towards the torn sails and the crash of metal against the enemys hull was like a thunderclap the mass of french seamen and marines were gone and leopards side below the gangway was running bright red so that the ship herself seemed to be bleeding to death then like a last convulsion the two vessels ground together the shrouds and spars entangled guns men and wind all suddenly silent as if their world had ended bolitho was almost knocked over by the marines from the poop as they charged towards the forecastle some hatless and wildeyed their bayonets glittering in the smoky sunshine the ships rolled more heavily together and through the dangling creepers of rigging and strips of blackened canvas bolitho saw the stab of musket fire and the gleam of steel as the two sides came together from above the smoke the marksmen kept up their fire and bolitho saw phipps the fifth lieutenant clutch his face as a ball smashed into his forehead he had been one of achates midshipmen in the twinkling of an eye he had become nothing the ships were being carried slowly and heavily downwind and away from the convoy it would give herrick a chance but no more than that unlessbolitho saw several seamen cut down by a blast of swivel the canister shot raking them into bloody ribbons while they screamed and kicked out their lives bolitho shouted take the ship val hold her he saw the shocked understanding on keens face and repeated no matter what then with his sword in his hand he ran along the starboard gangway with allday and bankart behind him he found time to wonder what was keeping bankart from hiding below how long it would be before it all ended as it had for too many already allday rasped god theyre aboard us bolitho saw paget by the foremast and shouted clear the lower battery every man on deck then he found himself by the starboard cathead and already the place was littered with corpses seamen and marines friends and enemies clawed for handholds on the beakhead and slid down stays and torn sails to get at each other bayonets thrust others hacked at the boarders with anything they could find cutlasses and axes one man was even using a rammer like a club until a ball brought him down and he tumbled outboard between the grinding hulls from the quarterdeck keen watched despairingly as more enemy uniforms appeared through the smoke some already on the larboard gangway they would swamp his company he stared round and saw hogg his coxswain fall to the deck one hand reaching for help even as the light died in his eyes they were all dying and for two ships full of bloody gold he yelled open fire with the ninepounders mr valancey mark down their poop it was almost impossible to speak or breathe as the smoke billowed over the decks and men slipped and hacked at each other stamping on the corpses of their companions there was a cracked cheer and keen saw more men swarming up from the lower gun deck chaytor the second lieutenant waving them forward with his hanger the ninepounders lurched inboard on their tackles and blasted grape into the smoke some of which might find a target on the enemys stern and amongst her officers keen saw a seaman running towards him and his startled mind made him realize it was one of the enemy a single seaman suddenly cut off from the rest of the boarders he lunged forward seeing the stranger through a mist of combined pain and fury hogg was dead bolitho would soon be killed or captured as he led his own counterattack the french seaman aimed a pistol but a mocking click from the hammer made him stare wildly before flinging the useless weapon away he raised his heavy cutlass and kept his eyes on keens face he was young and nimblefooted but the madness of battle blinded him to keens skill keen parried the heavy blade the weight and power of the mans thrust carrying his attacker almost past him then keen slashed him across the neck and as he fell shrieking hacked him once again across the face he turned away the anger giving him an unnatural strength he did not even look round as more shots whimpered past him or slammed into the deck then he stared towards the forecastle it was the most terrible scene of all captain inch naked but for his breeches was hurrying to the larboard ladder his raw stump jerking violently as he waved his sword and yelled stand fast helicons the words were torn from him the agony of his wound making it pitiful he shouted again his voice rising above the clash of steel and the screams of the dying to me helicons repel boarders my lads keen wiped his eyes with his sleeve in gods name he thinks hes in his own ship again it could not last the packed stamping figures were being forced back and there were some french boarders already fighting amongst the fallen cordage and bodies on the main deck a midshipman unarmed driven beyond reason ran for a hatchway his ears covered with his hands as he tried to escape keen saw it was hext one of the youngest aboard as he reached the hatch coaming he slipped on some blood and fell sprawling a tall frenchman bounded towards him his cutlass already swinging the boy rolled over and stared at him he did not cover his face or plead he just lay and watched death but inch was there and drove his blade under the seamans ribs swinging him round the mans weight tearing the sword from his grasp the sailor dropped beside midshipman hext his bare feet drumming in agony on the deck keen saw a boarding pike come from the smoke it took inch in the back as he fell to his knees the pike was torn free and then driven into him once more bolitho watched inch fall and then along the length of the deck above the swaying exhausted figures he saw keen looking at him for a moment longer the battle seemed elsewhere they shared the moment all their memories and the brave zenoria the brightness of hope and love the illusion of a precious discovery the voices roared through it and bolitho swung round to face a french lieutenant savagely he slashed the young officers blade aside and then seized his lapel and drove the knuckle bow into his jaw the lieutenant lurched aside and gasped in terror as alldays great cutlass swept across the sunlight like a shadow allday wrenched the blade free and gasped thickly we cant old em bolitho saw his men falling back they were trapped here both gangways had as many frenchmen on them as keens people bolitho shouted hold fast lads a seaman dropped on his knees and tried to fend off another bright blade he screamed as his severed hand fell beside him bolitho lunged over the wounded mans shoulder and felt the frenchman against the sword then reel over as the point grated off his crossbelt and slid into his chest he turned to rally some seamen and marines on the other side and then saw something rising above the great pall of smoke allday croaked bastards are alongside nother of em one of the french seventyfours must have fought free of bolithos ships and was coming to assist his admiral there was a crazed cheer and bolitho saw that the newcomer had lost her mizzen guns bellowed from her side and bolitho felt the jerk of iron transmit itself even to argonautes own deck it was an impossible dream the sternfaced figurehead in breastplate and with outthrust sword admiral benbow cheering and whooping herricks marines and seamen swarmed across in a tide of smokeblackened battered men who had already fought and won their battle to protect the convoy suddenly bolitho was being carried forward on argonautes new strength and almost fell into the swirling water as two seamen hauled him roughly over the forecastle rail and onto the bowsprit caught between benbow s men and keens own company the french were already fighting their way onto one gangway a bridge of escape to their own ship and still held the advantage over those below them bolitho heard bouteiller yell royal marines still he could not see them but pictured the scarlet coats no longer smartly pressed and clean as they responded to their captains command dazed wild even the fury within them was not enough to withstand their familiar discipline they stood or knelt along the opposite gangway their muskets rising as one a marine fell dead from the rank but nobody flinched revenge would come later bouteiller yelled fire the musket balls crashed into the packed mass of boarders and even as the living struggled free from the dead the marines were already charging towards them shouting and screaming like demons as they went in with their bayonets bolitho slipped but held on to the massive bowsprit his feet kicking at the spritsail yard and shrouds while he stared with stunned disbelief at the deck below him leopards forecastle but for the lanyard around his wrist he would have lost his sword for ever there was more firing from that other existence beyond the smoke ships locked together or surging towards the french rearadmirals flag bolitho could not tell a command flag was supposed to lead and direct now it had become a beacon a guide for carnage men fought and struggled all around him it was impossible to grasp direction or time bodies were sometimes pressing against him with brief flashes of recognition as a wild face found his someone even managed to shout tis the admiral lads another yelled you keep with us dick it was wild terrifying and yet the madness was like rich wine bolitho locked hilts with another lieutenant and was astonished that he found it so easy to disarm him with one twist of the wrist which tore the weapon from his hand he would have left it at that as the yelling panting seamen carried him along but a marine paused and glared at the cowering officer all he said was this is for capn inch the thrust carried the lieutenant to the rail the point of the bayonet glinting red through the back of his coat bolitho dashed his wrist across his face it felt like a furnace and he was almost blinded by sweat he saw the gouged planks across the broad sweep of quarterdeck where keens grape had fired so blindly bodies lay scattered near the abandoned wheel others ran to meet the rush of boarders probably unable to accept what had happened a sailor darted under a bayonet and headed for allday he stared at the frenchman and then lifted his cutlass he almost laughed through his despair it was so easy as he raised the blade and tightened his hold on the cutlass he suddenly cried out the pain in his old wound burning through his chest rendering him helpless unable to move bolitho was separated from him by an abandoned gun but hurled himself towards him his sword hitting out but bankart leaped between them armed only with a belaying pin he screamed get back dont you touch him he threw himself protectively against his father sobbing with anger and fear as the frenchman darted forward for the kill bolitho felt the ball fan past his face although his dazed mind did not record the sound of a shot he saw the frenchman slide back and drop to the deck his cutlass clattering beneath the feet of the crowd bolitho saw midshipman sheaffe his face white with strain with stayts pistol still smoking in one hand his puny dirk in the other then he forgot him even the fact that with allday about to be cut down his son had found himself and the courage which he believed would never be his bolitho saw jobert by the poop ladder saw him shouting to his officers although the din the mingled roar of victory and defeat made it impossible to understand lieutenant paget his coat sliced from shoulder to waist and cut about the face by wood splinters waved his bloodied hanger to his men bolitho stared through the smoke now almost blind from it or was it something worse he could not even find the will to care any more paget yelled get him cut the bastard down bolitho found himself lurching through the jubilant seamen some of whom were strangers from herricks ship it had to stop the past could not repair anything nor must it destroy he knocked a marines musket aside with the flat of his sword he heard allday gasping behind him he would die rather than leave him now bolitho shouted strike damn you jobert stared at him his eyes shocked he peered past bolitho and must have sensed that only he was keeping him alive there was a great wave of cheering and someone yelled there goes their flag mates we beat the buggers the voices and faces swirled round while the cornered frenchmen in various parts of their ship began to throw down their weapons but not jobert almost disdainfully he drew his sword and tossed his hat to the deck paget gasped let me take him sir richard bolitho gave him a quick glance paget the man who had faced the odds of camperdown was no longer the calmly efficient first lieutenant he wanted to kill jobert bolitho snapped stand back he raised his sword and felt the raw tension in his wrist and forearm so it was a personal duel after all there was silence now and only the groans and cries of the wounded seemed to intrude even the wind had dropped without anyone noticing it joberts command flag flapped only slightly and in time with the bright union flag on the ship whose jibboom still impaled the shrouds the blades circled one another like wary serpents bolitho watched joberts face as dark as stayts it was all there he had been a prisoner before and his flagship had been taken from him only to rise again and repeat the disgrace the impossible had happened jobert was a professional officer and did not have to look farther than the man who now faced him for the reason a last chance to even the score to give him the seeds of a victory even if he never lived to see it for more than minutes after bolitho had fallen jobert moved around the deck and even the english sailors fell back to give him room paget pleaded desperately can i take him he saw bolithos foot catch on some broken rigging the way he staggered paget whispered fetch captain keen for gods sake the messenger scuttled away but paget knew he would be too late then jobert struck lunged forward again and again his foot stamping hard down as he advanced he turned still farther and made bolitho twist his head as the sunlight lanced down through the ragged sails and blinded him was it imagination or did he see a quick flash of triumph in the french admirals eyes did he know his weakness the blades glanced together and the steel hissed as each fought to retain balance and the strength to hold the other at arms length clashclashclash the blades struck parried and parted midshipman sheaffe stared wildly at allday stop him cant you man allday clutched his shirt against his burning wound and replied get a marksman lively now bolitho stepped carefully over some more rope his arm throbbed with pain and he could barely see joberts intent face why prove anything he is beaten finished it is enough joberts blade moved like lightning and when bolitho swung his own to beat it aside he felt it pass through his coat below his armpit the searing pain as the edge cut across his skin bolitho smashed his hilt down on joberts wrist so that they lurched together chest to chest bolitho could feel the strength going from his arm the biting pain of the cut on his side like a branding iron he could feel the mans breath on his face see the strange darkness in his eyes everything else was lost in mist and even when he heard herricks voice coming through the packed figures around him it was like an intrusion he raised his arm and thrust at joberts chest with all of his remaining strength jobert staggered back against a quarterdeck cannon and then stared with horrified disbelief as the old sword flashed forward and struck him in the heart bolitho almost fell as the sailors surged around him cheering and sobbing like madmen he handed his sword to allday and tried to smile at him to reassure him like those other times herrick pushed his men aside and seized his arm my god richard he might have killed you he studied him anxiously if id been here id have shot him down bolitho touched the hole in his coat and felt the blood wet on his fingers the cheering dazed him but they had every right to give vent to their feelings what did they know or understand of strategy or the need to defend two unknown merchantmen why should they obey when the harvest was so savage so cruel he looked down at jobert and saw a seaman prise the sword from his outflung hand joberts dark eyes were half open as if he were still alive listening and watching his enemies he wanted to die thomas dont you see that he turned and peered across to his own ship and saw keen shading his eyes to look at him bolitho raised his arm in a tired salute he was safe it would have been the final blow had he fallen he felt herricks hand holding his arm as someone brought a dressing to staunch the blood he lost the fight he would not surrender his pride too bolitho made his way through his blackened and bleeding men it did not seem real or possible he looked up at the sky above the masts and lifeless sails he turned and looked at his friend and added quietly in his way jobert was a victor after all allday heard him and then put his arm around his sons shoulders he had not the words not now anyway bankart glanced at his fathers face and smiled pride of friend or enemy did not need any words epilogue it was six months before richard bolitho returned to england the stark memories of that last desperate battle were still clear in his mind although at home they had been overtaken if not completely forgotten amidst other events for bolitho and his little squadron it had been a costly victory in life and in other suffering his ships too had taken great punishment and had been forced into the dockyards at malta and gibraltar the results of their triumph over joberts squadron had been as astonishing as they had been destructive so badly crippled were most of the ships involved in the line of battle that two of the french seventyfours had been able to steal away and avoid capture none of bolithos vessels had been heavy enough or in such good repair that they could capture them an undamaged frigate had also escaped joberts big flagship although seized would be spared the shame of fighting again under her enemys colours a fire had broken out between decks which had killed many of her wounded and it had taken every able hand english and french to save her from complete destruction she would probably end her days as a hulk or stores vessel they had succeeded in capturing all the rest although at one time bolitho had feared that two at least would founder on passage to shelter he often thought of the familiar faces he would never see again most of all captain inch dying on his feet inspired by some last thought that he had had to be with his friends captain montresor who had fallen at the last moment even as the french flagships colours had dipped into the gunsmoke so many more needless to say houston of the icarus had survived unscathed and complaining although his ship had been in the thick of the fighting from the first broadside the two smallest vessels rapid and firefly had come through the onslaught with few casualties although any one of those great french broadsides could have sunk them with the two brigs as her only companions argonaute repaired if not recovered from the battle sailed for england and arrived at plymouth in june again vivid pictures stood out in bolithos thoughts as he relived the moments which followed their arrival the wild excitement the flags and the gun salutes as argonaute finally dropped anchor there had been little wind and their progress upchannel had been slow enough it seemed for the entire population to know of their return he remembered it so well the exhilaration of the cheering people on the waterfront much of which was soon to dissolve into empty sadness when they discovered that their loved ones would never return admiral sheaffe had been there in person bolitho had imagined he would have challenged the man that he in turn might have revealed the jealousy which had made him use keen as an instrument to hurt him instead the admiral had made a great display of greeting his son that was a moment bolitho knew he would never forget the admiral watched by his aides and some personal friends had put his hands on the midshipmans shoulders bolitho had seen the youths face perhaps he had recalled stayts last words or the time when he had been almost left behind when supreme had been in danger and bolitho had waited for him he had said in a steady voice i beg your pardon sir i do not know you then his eyes blind he had hurried away again once ashore when keen had seen the girl running the last few yards along the cobbles her long hair streaming behind her bolitho had felt both happiness and envy oblivious to the onlookers and grinning sailors keen had held her against him his face in her hair barely able to speak then she had looked at bolitho her eyes misty and had said very softly thank you bolitho was not sure what he had expected for belinda to be in plymouth waiting like zenoria to learn the truth to enjoy the reality of their survival the rest of the time it took to complete his affairs in plymouth was blurred he had taken passage in firefly to falmouth one more brig arriving in carrick roads would excite little attention bolitho dreaded another heros welcome the noise the curiosity of those who had not seen the true face of war so on this bright june morning he stood by the bulwark with adam while the brig swung carelessly to her anchor home on either hand the green hillsides and moored vessels the fields of various hues and colours which stretched inland in their own patterns houses and fishermens cottages and the grim grey bulk of pendennis castle which commanded the harbour entrance nothing had changed and yet bolitho had the feeling it would never be the same again time to part again adam was under orders for ireland with fresh despatches and no doubt more to collect if nothing else it would make him an excellent navigator well uncle adam watched him gravely his eyes troubled bolitho saw allday by the rail peering down at the gig alongside allday must have guessed or felt bolithos mood of uncertainty he had sent bankart with ozzard by coach with their chests and bags until the next time allday sensed that he needed to be alone on this particular day bolitho said it will always be like this adam brief farewells even shorter greetings he glanced around the neat deck it was hard to believe that this vessel had been within a stones throw of a powerful seventyfour and had survived rapid too although quarrell had pleaded for the borrowed guns to be removed their recoil had done more damage than the enemy adam said i wish i could step ashore with you uncle bolitho put his arm round his shoulders it will keep i am glad for you he looked up at the impatient masthead pendant your father would have been pleased i know that then he strode to the side where the first lieutenant his arm in a sling stood with the boatswains mates for a last farewell in the gig allday watched bolitho without speaking saw him look astern once and wave back and forth to his nephew the brig was already shortening her cable and once the gig had been hoisted would be on her way allday found that he could watch her like a mere onlooker he thought of his son on his way overland to the bolitho house would he ever return to the sea surprisingly that decision no longer counted my son even thinking the words made him feel happy and grateful he had saved his life would have died for him but for the middys pistol he glanced at bolithos impassive features and knew he was worried about his eyes lady belinda would be up there at the house fretting and waiting for him that might make all the difference tonight allday would slip away to the inn to see if the landlords daughter was still as smart as paint they climbed onto the hot stones and bolitho thanked the boats coxswain and put two guineas in his hard hand the man gaped at him usll drink to e zur they pulled away one of them whistling cheerfully until they reached hearing distance of their ship bolitho walked towards the town where he would take the narrow road to the house he looked up and tried not to blink to lose his balance as he had that day when he had faced jobert for the last time he heard alldays heavy tread behind him it was a strange feeling there were few people about they were either in the fields or away fishing falmouth existed on earth and sea alike he saw a weary woman carrying a huge basket of vegetables as she made her way towards a narrow lane she stopped and straightened her back and saw him she smiled and attempted an awkward curtsy bolitho called a fine morning mrs noonan she watched them until they turned the corner poor woman bolitho thought he recalled seeing her husband die violently aboard his lysander it seemed a thousand years back and yet like yesterday a long shadow crossed the square and bolitho looked up at the tower of the church of king charles the martyr where twice he had been married he wanted to walk past but felt unable to move it was as if he was being held then guided towards those familiar old doors allday followed him with something like relief in his heart he had known this was why bolitho had not taken the coach from plymouth bolitho walked uncertainly into the cool shadows of the church it was empty and yet so full of memories and of hopes he paused and looked at the fine windows beyond the altar and remembered that first time the sunlight streaming through the door he felt his heart pound until he thought he would hear it he must go discover his feelings explain to belinda learn to put right his mistakes instead he walked to the wall where the bolitho tablets stood out from all the others he reached up and touched the one which was slightly apart from the men cheney bolitho he knew allday was in the main aisle watching him wanting to help when there was none to give bolitho moved back very slowly to the altar and stood looking at it for several minutes this was the day of their marriage when they had joined hands here he spoke her name aloud very quietly then he turned on his heel and walked down to where allday waited for him allday asked home now sir richard bolitho hesitated and then looked back at the small tablet aye old friend it will always be that
