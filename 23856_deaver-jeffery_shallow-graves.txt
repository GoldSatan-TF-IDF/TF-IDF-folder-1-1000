jeffery deaver shallow graves the first book in the john pellam series a man should keep his word james stewart as rupert cadell in alfred hitchcocks rope i heard this scary story about you one time marty said and i didnt know whether it was true or not pellam didnt look over he was driving the winnebago chieftain back into town theyd just found an old farmhouse a mile up the road and had offered the astonished owner thirteen hundred dollars to shoot two scenes on his front porch provided he didnt mind if a combine replaced his rusting orange nissan in the driveway for a couple of days for that kind of money the farmer said hed eat the car if that was what they wanted pellam had told him that wouldnt be necessary you used to do stunt work marty asked his voice was high and midwestinflected some stunts yeah just for a year or so about this film you did uh pellam pulled off his black s hugh hefner sunglasses the autumn day had dawned bright as blue ice a half hour ago it had turned dark and now the early afternoon seemed like a winter dusk it was a spielberg film marty said never worked for spielberg marty considered no well i heard it was a spielberg film anyway there was this scene where the guy the star you know was supposed to drive a motorcycle over this bridge and these bombs or something were blowing up behind him and he was driving like a son of a bitch just ahead of these shells only then one hits under him and he goes flying through the air just as the bridge collapses okay and they were supposed to rig a dummy because the stunt supervisor wouldnt let any of his guys do it but you just got on the bike and told the second unit director to roll the cameras and you just like did it uhhuh marty looked at pellam he waited he laughed what do you mean uhhuh did you do it yeah i remember that one marty rolled his eyes and looked out the window at a distant speck of bird he remembers it he looked back at pellam and i heard that the thing was you didnt get blown clear but you had to hang on to this cable while the bridge collapsed uhhuh marty kept waiting it was no fun telling war stories to people who should be telling them to you well thats pretty much what happened werent you scared sure was whyd you do it pellam reached down and picked up a molson bottle wedged between his scuffed brown nokona boots he glanced around the red and yellow autumn countryside for new york state troopers then lifted the bottle and drained it i dont know i did crazy things then stupid of me the unit director fired me but they used the footage had to theyd run out of bridges pellam floored the worn accelerator pedal to take a grade the engine didnt respond well they heard the tapping of whatever taps in an old engine when it struggles to push a heavy camper uphill marty was twentynine skinny and had a small gold hoop in his left ear his face was round and smooth and he had eyelids connected directly to his heart they opened wide whenever his pulse picked up pellam was older he was thin too though more sinewy than skinny and dark complected he had a scrawny saltandpepper beard that hed started last week and he was already tired of the lids over his graygreen eyes never lifted very far both men wore denimblue jeans and jackets marty wore a black tshirt pellam a blue work shirt in clothes like these with his pointytoed boots pellam looked a lot like a cowboy and if anyonea woman anywaywould comment on it hed tell her that he was related to wild bill hickok this was true though it was true in some complicated way hed distorted so often that he couldnt now remember exactly where the gunfighter had figured into his ancestry marty said id like to do stunt work i dont think so pellam told him no itd be fun no itd be painful after a few minutes pellam said so we got a cemetery we got a town square two barns and a farmhouse we got a ton of roads what else do we need marty flipped through a large notebook one big big big field im talking sonuvabitch big a funeral home a victorian house overlooking a yard big enough for a wedding a hardware p store a mess of interiors goddamn i aint gonna get to manhattan for two weeks im tired of cows pellam im so damned tired of cows pellam asked you ever tip cows im from the midwest everybody there tips cows ive never done it id like to though pellam you never tipped a cow nope marty shook his head with what seemed like genuine dismay man it had been three days since theyd pulled off the interstate here in cleary new york the winnebago had clocked two hundred miles roaming through knobby pine hills and tired farms and small simple pastel cubes of houses decorated with pickups in the driveway cars on blocks and stiff laundry pinned and drying on long lines three days driving through mist and fog and yellow storms of september leaves and plenty of outright rain marty looked out the window he didnt speak for five minutes pellam thinking silence is platinum marty said know what this reminds me of the boy had a mind that ranged like a hungry crow pellam couldnt even guess i was an assistant on echoes of war he continued this was a sixtythreemilliondollar vietnam war movie that pellam had no desire to scout for now had no desire to see in the theaters and knew he wouldnt rent when it came to tower video in la marty said for some reason they didnt shoot in asia thats a question no im telling you pellam said it sounded like you were asking me no they decided not to shoot in asia why not its not important they just didnt got it pellam said they shot it in england in cornwall martys head swung sideways the grin spreading into his big oval face pellam liked enthusiasm but enthusiasm went with people that talked a lot you cant have everything man did you know they have palm trees in england i couldnt believe it palm trees anyway the set designer made this totally incredible army base mortar holes and everything and wed get up at five am to shoot and id get this weird feeling i mean i knew i was in england and i knew it was just a movie but all the actors were in costumeuniformssleeping in foxholes and eating rations thats what the director wanted i tell you man standing around i felt totally queasy he considered if this was the right word he decided it was and repeated it queasy thats what i feel like now he fell silent pellam had worked on several war movies but at this moment none of those came to mind what he was thinking of now was rosettes of broken glass on the side window of the camper a day after theyd arrived in the area here winnebago makes strong windows and it had taken a real good throw to get the bottle through the glass the note inside had read goodbye the camperd been subjected to all kinds of creative destruction over the years but nothing so ambiguously disturbing pellam noticed the vandals had had the foresight not to pitch the message through the windshield they wanted to make sure the winnebago would have an unobstructed view when it drove out of town he also noticed the missile had been a bottle not a rock and could as easily have held gasoline as a carefully lettered note thats what john pellam was thinking of now not stunts not war movies not ominous dawns in tropical england getting cold marty said pellam reached for the heater on the dash and turned it up two notches they smelled the wet rubbery scent of the warm air filling the cab on the floor pellams boot crunched several pieces of shattered window glass he kicked them aside goodbye downtown cleary wasnt much two laundromats a chase branch a local bank two bars outfitted by the same prop department a dozen antique stores their windows crammed with tea tables presidential campaign buttons sconces trivets tinware scraps of faded rugs elegant victorian tools there were two real estate brokerage storefronts a music store specializing in marchingband instruments a hardware store the tea shopa little hobbity placedid a bangup business selling muffins laced with fiber and granola and honey an old woodfloored fiveanddime a couple of drugstores one with a lunch counter right out of the fifties so authentic a set designer couldnt have done better several houses had been turned into small businesses crystalmereoriginal jewelry designs by janine scotch imports shetland wool our speciality two teenage boys large with scrubbed faces and pickafight grins stood outside the hardware store under an awning shirts open over their beefy chests acting like the brisk wind was nothing one of them lifted his middle finger to the passing camper assholes marty said the locals were friendlier in mexico where marty and pellam had been last month though that may have had something to do with the exchange rate us currency makes for a great deal of international brotherhood and understanding pellam shrugged martys eyes remained outside the camper looking at the sidewalks he said they dont have many women in this town he was frowning as if he were disappointed he couldnt find any young ladies in store windows wearing sports illustrated swimsuits sent em all to the hills when they heard you were coming pellam looked for a place to park i havent seen a movie theater either you better hope theyve got one of those boy pellam told him youre gonna have more luck with a movie than with women marty ignored this and asked almost reverently man isnt it the best to make love to country girls in strange hotel rooms instead of normal hotel rooms in fact pellam thought that it was good though probably not the best and he didnt call it making love he also didnt get all adolescently lustful like marty pellam had to keep an eye on the boy he tended to lose control and flirt relentlessly with blondes in smalltown cocktail loungeswomen lightyears tougher than the most steelyeyed sleek manhattanite or los angelina they hit the middle of town just as the rain had congregated all it could in the thick clouds overhead and poured down slashing streets and slapping leaves to the ground visibility dropped to zero and the camper swayed like a boat in a squall whoa marty said id say its bout time for us to get drunk pellam pulled into a parking place in the torrent of rain he missed the curb and rode over it with a grind of metal he couldnt remember if there were parking meters in downtown cleary but if so there was one less now the rain fell and fell it pounded like a dozen breakdancers spinning and tramping and moonwalking across the roof of the winnebago it slid in thick sheets down the windshield and windows pellam climbed out of his seat and looked at marty on three oh hell pellam no its wet out there you wanted a drink wait till it pellam opened the door he jumped out three lets up in the eight leaping steps it took them to find refuge they were completely drenched they swung through the door with a hollow ringing of cowbell marty stopped short thiss the diner pellam close the door boy its the diner pellam said too early to drink besides i feel like some cake cake pellam damn marges cafe was all turquoise and plasticky and unhomey the fluorescent was greenthe light that took you right back to every high school corridor youd ever walked down they sat at the counter and pulled napkins out of a metal holder to wipe their faces and arms two scruffy men in their fifties maybe grain elevator operators or farmers stocky with black grit seated in their pores sat hunched over bulletproof white coffee mugs they kept their conversation going not missing a word though their eyes followed pellam and marty like retrievers sighting birds yep had his massey near upside down on the interstate ida paid to see that addled a whole mess of drivers i ever tell you bout the time i took my harvester over the crick marty said hed love a beer and the country girl pretty face huge hips thirtythreeish said shed love to serve him one but too bad they didnt have a license too bad too bad she repeated trying fiercely to think of something to add she decided on what else kin i gitcha she asked the question adoringly marty shot a black glance at pellam then smiled at the girl and settled for a bowl of chili and a coke pellam ordered coffee and a piece of chocolate cake that really homemade he asked youd call a p a home then you bet she added some infatuation to the adoration and said to marty onions yesm nope pellam told her it was a small camper marty sighed she looked at him and he shook his head no she asked pellam you be wanting that a la mode alamo she glanced around with ice cream you know oh no just the cake thats an allright camper you boys got yourself she wasnt moving my daddy had us a travelall one time but he backed it up the wrong waywe was going to lake websterand cracked the yoke pellam said youve got to be careful she never welded proper either there you go after a moment she waddled into action the spherical thighs swung as she stepped to a counter marty was excited that five and dime pellam across the street he was looking out the window i was in there yesterday it is a totally excellent place i mean they sell wigs there a couple rows of them what other store in the world can you walk into pay nineteen ninety nine and walk out with a wig i ask you can you do that on rodeo drive can you do that on michigan avenue you are getting a bit thin on top the rain hit the large plateglass window with a slap and there were several huge claps of thunder as pellam turned toward the noise he saw a woman running into the diner the door flying open the cowbell dinging she pulled off a green cape she was about his age a year or two more maybe wearing a faded purple dress the waist high just under her ample breasts a granny dress he remembered they were called her long hairbrown with a silver sheen to itwas parted in the center she scanned both pellam and marty to pellam she gave what could have been a smile then turned back to the counter wiping the rain from her face pellam and marty turned back to the counter they took the polaroids out of their pockets lined them up on the counter and started talking about camera angles the woman in the granny dress glanced over at them casually then she looked back to the counter girl and ordered herbal tea and a bran muffin she glanced again at the two men then away the waitress set the coffee and coke in front of the men and lifted a piece of frothy cake out of a cellowindow carton she disappeared into the back to collect the chili she delivered the foodadoringly in martys case they ate the grannydress woman ignored themeven when pellam said hollywood twice in one sentence hows the cake marty asked pellam had three bites and couldnt take any more he pushed the plate toward marty who dug into it with a spoon still containing a helping of greasy chili more thunder shaking the windows huge detonations pellam said what else is lefkowitz doing now marty thought that european thing pellam shook his head marty said oh i know the western pellam smiled he stood and walked to the telephone he called to marty look at this he was genuinely surprised still costs a dime to make a phone call the grannydress woman was looking at him now smiling he smiled her way she turned back to her tea pellam punched in the number and was put on hold the first of several times finally the assistant producer came on the line and said johnny my boy where you been pellam knew he was a young man but he couldnt picture him around ha around he said ha so pellam said lazily hows the weather in tinsel town damn hot out here close to a hundred johnny hows it going its going im not kiddin you friend the mans got a righteous hardon for this project and we dont get the locations buttoned up soon all gods chilluns gonna be in serious trouble where the hell are you think ive got just the spot for you oh i love the sound of your voice marry me its perfect talk to me johnny talk to me we got pressure hombre im talking righteous pressure dig pellam wondered where you learned producerspeak maybe it was at ucla he winked at marty then said into the phone lefkowitzs going to go hog wild the dawn shotsll be so beautiful desert for miles around i mean you cannot see a goddamn tree i mean see one unless you look west then youd need a telephoto and desert then theres this little shack you cant shoot inside from the other end of the line the silence of the universes outer reaches then shack pellam continued but dont worry there is a corral oh and i thought you could move some of the interiors out there the scene where you ragging me john pellam sounded hurt ragging you no when i say its perfect its perfect i wouldnt youre ragging me marty shouted tell him about the arroyos oh yeah the arroyos you know the scene where the comanches are sneaking up on the cabin john not funny pellam said what do you mean its not a western what do you mean its not a western there was a pause while pellam pretended to examine the script what do you call arizona in youreinarizona the voice was a tenor car alarm theysentyouthewrongscript pellam said uh he tried but he couldnt keep it in a second longer marty whod heard the assistant producers cry had lowered his head to the counter and was shaking uncontrollably pellam joined him you goddamn son of a bitch pellam the ap muttered pellam rocked against the side of the phone stall immobilized with laughter trying to catch his breath sorry he gasped that is not funny though there was considerable evidence to the contrary pellam finally caught his breath then looked at marty he lost it again quivering with laughter after hed calmed pellam managed to say were in a place called cleary upstate new york it looks good i think itll be perfect weve got out of setups but we did the principalshoot first so its mostly just background and establishing shots weve got left well finish the snaps and get you the report in a couple days he paused for a moment then said ive been looking at the script can i talk you into a few changes no way its carved in stone now the ap was laughing too an indulgent chuckle just to show he was a good sport and now it was time to put the joshing aside and give straight answers you mean it john it looks good its we cant wait any longer the big mans gonna have my balls for breakfast if we dont move fast what were you going to say when just now i interrupted you just its a good town itll work he recited slowly chill out man haw haw pellam said im gonna be serious for a minute were listening dear the script youre not going to like this but ive been doing some doctoring and i dont like i dont dislike i ignore the story needs a little help forget about it leftyll cut your balls off too you even mention it pellam remembered another hollywoodism the thing is its a good property its not a great property but its lefkowitzs property your loss pellam said no my ass okay i tried oh before i go i

thats london time what airfield you know the paratrooper scene john youre a prick anybody ever tell you that he hung up he joined marty and said no sense of humor marty began working on the cake again a half hour later the rain had slowed to a fine mist and the thunderstorm had passed the grannydress woman after a couple soulful glances at pellam was back at the salt minethe way she phrased it to the waitress who was herself hard at work adoring marty lets roll pellam said the men stood byeee she called see you later marty said thanks for the fine service anytime she said when the door closed behind them pellam whispered anytime anyplace any way you want it lover doll pellam its not my fault im a stud she wants you boy she wants you to be the father of her children all twelve of them look at you rosy cheeked cute as a button oh shell be dreaming about you tonight hang it up pellam maybe pellam said seriously you should think about settling down here get yourself a napa franchise wear a cat hat to cover up that thinning hairline of yours join the elks you should talk old man that other lady checking you out in there reminded me a lot of my mother theyre the most experienced they both marty and pellam stopped short twenty feet in front of the camper jesus marty asked wait what is that pellam was surprised the boy couldnt figure it out but then he guessed it was like those optical illusions in science books the ones that some people see right away and others youve got to explain it to them this one seemed pretty clear to pellam on the side of the camper in black spray paint were crude images of the mounds of two graves with crosses stuck in them scrawled beneath them was that word again goodbye oh marty whispered getting it at last damn they walked closer then around the camper expecting some more damage but no there was nonejust the artwork they looked around the street deserted who was it those kids we saw before maybe pellam said they stood for a moment looking at the crude feathery lines of the bad drawings pellam started up main street wherere you going marty asked buy us some turpentine and steel wool cant go driving around looking like an ad for a funeral home pellam said to janine the grannydress woman youd think theyd come up with some more money for that its going to represent something it ought to have a little class he was looking at the tiny overpainted black cannon donated to the town by the veterans of foreign wars it didnt seem capable of lobbing a shell more than ten feet they sat in the town square where hed been sitting marking polaroids when she walked past casually and sat on the bench next to his hed smelled minty teawhat shed been drinking yesterday in marges dinerand when hed looked up shed smiled at him hed scooted over four feet of bumpy wood and theyd struck up a conversation maybe its valuable janine now said looks can be deceiving pellam liked her outfit today better than what shed worn yesterday a long skirt boots a big bulkyknit sweater her hairin the sun you could see some redwas still parted in the middle she was an easy forty looking older straighton though she probably wasnt that happened to a lot of these poor flower children maybe theyre limber and they live a long time but sun and fresh air can do harsh things to your skin wheres your boyish partner with the cute little tush the one whos probably a year or two under my limit he rented a car and went out to the hinterland checking out some parks weve got a lot of scenes left so we split the troops she asked what company you work for called big mountain studios didnt they do night players and ganges oh that was a great film did you go to india for that one pellam shook his head wow do you know william hurt you ever meet him saw him once in a restaurant how about willem dafoe glenn close no and no pellams eyes were scanning the downtown which almost shimmered in the heat it was eleven am the temperature was up by twenty degrees over yesterday indian summer tell me about the film youre working on now we dont like to give too much away she socked him playfully on the arm excuse me i mean excuse me im a spy like im going to sell the story to mgm pellam said its called to sleep in a shallow grave wild love the title whos in it its not cast yet it wasnt for location scouts to give away too much she said come on now i dont believe you she tilted her head coyly and her hair fell straight across her face leaving only her eyes exposedlike a veiled islamic woman give me a clue a few supporting actors you couldnt possibly know he sipped his coffee they always liked details who in hollywood was playing musical beds which actresses had had implants who hit their wives or their husbands who liked boys who had orgies in beverly hills some people even wanted to know about the films themselves he said its about a woman who comes back to her home town for her fathers funeral but she finds out that he might not have been her father after all and maybe he killed the man who was her real father it takes place in the fifties a small town called bolts crossing he stood up she watched him toss the coffee carton into a trash basket painted with tulips and she scolded you drink too much of that caffeine yuck dont you have trouble sleeping which ways the cemetery i want to get some more roids some polaroids follow me they turned east as they walked along the road janine said tell me more about the film thats it for now she gave him a pout with her full lips maybe i wont be your guide if youre not nice to me aw i need a guide i may never get back to civilization without one she grimaced dramatically and waved her arm around downtown bad news charlie this is civilization it dont get no better than this they walked for a half hour and found themselves in the cemetery his reaction to the place was the same as on the day theyd arrived in cleary the day marty had spotted the cemetery from the highway it was perfect for the film tall black trees bordering a small clearing in which battered tombstones tilted at exotic angles no big monuments no mausoleums just hunks of stone spilling right out of the forest pellam pulled the camera out of his pocket took three or four pictures the cemetery was filled with an odd shadowy light which seemed to come from the underbelly of the low wispy clouds the light accentuated contrasts bark was blacker than in bright sun grass and milkweed stalks paler stone more bleached it was white like old bones many of the tombstones were badly eroded pellam and janine wove through the grass toward the woods a rusty barbedwire fence of taut strands separated the cemetery from the underbrush wait what was that pellam stopped suddenly stared into the trees he was sure someone was watching him but as he stepped to one side the voyeur if it was anybody at all vanished janine said all ill say is if it has redford or newman in it and you dont tell me ill never speak to you again it doesnt i saw butch cassidy twelve times i only saw let it be eight were you at woodstock she smiled surprised yeah were you no but i wanted to go tell me about the cemetery whats to tell dead people buried here what sort of dead people rich poor smugglers farmers she couldnt quite get a handle on what he was asking you mean like what does it say about the history of the town pellam was looking at a grave adam gottlieb a sailor on your ocean lord he said man missed the century bummer yeah thats basically it the history of the place the atmosphere she danced over a grave girlish can you imagine what cleary was like a hundred years ago probably only five six hundred people here if that he snapped several polaroids janine took his arm and hooked it through hers he felt the heavy pressure of her breast against his elbow he wondered what her chest looked like was it dotted with freckles pellam really liked freckles they walked for a few minutes he said i dont see any recent tombstones is that bad no im just curious janine said theres a new cemetery outside of town but thats not the answer the answer is that nobody ever dies in cleary theyre dead already she now grew serious and started playing with the top of her tea carton first theres something i have to tell you im sort of married she looked up but were separated we still groove okay my old man and me but its not like on a physical level you know hes living with a bimbo runs a motorcycle repair shop near fishkill her husband split too he comes back now and then but mostly hes split pellam tried to sort it out there were two husbands was that it one of them kept coming back to who janine said just want the facts out you know like in case you heard something well you know how it is she was looking at him he felt the weight of her eyes on him as heavy as her breasts a response was in order sure do he said this seemed to satisfy her she kicked at some leaves pellam hoped she didnt want to go for a leaf fight there was nothing worse than somebody on the threshold of middle age going zany tell me about hollywood the parties are pretty wild huh i dont go to hollywood very often isnt that where the studios at century city wheres that now its office buildings it used to be the twentieth century fox back lot how bout that super they walked back to the town square pellam reloaded his camera he looked up from three different windows faces were staring at him they looked away quickly one woman paraded her sixyearold daughter past the woman pushed the girl forward this is josey she said pellam grinned at the girl and kept walking the word had spread into all the nooks of cleary somebody was going to make a movie david lynch lawrence kasdan tom cruise meryl streep julia roberts had all been sighted it would have a cast of thousands they needed extras they needed stuntmen thered be tickets to hollywood union contracts line up for your fifteen minutes of fame none of the hoverers had actually asked for a part yet but pellam was getting a hell of a lot of silent auditions what does everybody do for entertainment around here he asked when theyre not trying to get a role in a movie we all have great fun robbing tourists blind you sticking around till saturday maybe wait till you see it then its leaf season hundreds of cars everybody gawking at trees like they were mandalas totally far out they spend an incredible amount of money i had a tea shop for a few years before the jewelry thing took off id charge two dollars for a scone a granola muffin was two and a quarter they paid without blinking what do you all do when youre not ripping off the turistas she paused to consider socializing me and my friends usually get together and hang out trivial pursuit or monopoly rent movies a lot there are carnivals parades future farmers of america down home middle america the workersi tend to think of it in terms of class i was a marxist oncethey go in for raising kids kiwanis pancake breakfasts turkey shoots church in any one of a number of interchangeable protestant denominations but were very tolerantboth jewish families in town are well liked they walked for a few minutes more pellam glanced at her she was preoccupied thinking of something that would summarize its a hard place to be single he let that sit for a thick moment then said the films got a dark side to it violence in a small town any of that oh yeah a lot of domestic stuff last year a man took a shotgun and killed his family they found him at home watching wheel of fortune with the bodies all around him then the police found a couple guys from new york city murdered not far from downtown what happened nobodys sure they were just businessmen looked like robbery but who knows then you have your assorted drownings car wrecks hunting accidents a lot of those pellam took more polaroids look they call it main street great yeah they do i never thought about it outa sight he paused looked across the street into the window of the dutchess realty company the morning light fell on the storefront glass and he thought somebody else was staring at him a blond woman but she wasnt like the other supplicants there was something intense and troubling about the way she studied him then he decided he was just being paranoid he looked away then back the blond voyeur was no longer there just like the imagined spy in the forest overlooking the cemetery maybe imagined janine said ive gotta open the store now but you want sometime i can show you the only building that survived the great fire of love to see it you mean that sure do pellam said no well split the worm pellam was walking down a side street in cleary the redcovered script was in his hand he made notations he shot roids no john really i insist he was thinking about the assignment in mexico last month he and marty had found a great jungle outside of puerto vallarta and after the principal photography had started the two men had hung around and drunk mescal with the crew and watched the director waste eighty thousand feet of film shot through a softar filter so the flick would have that smoky soft look of a nike or ibm commercial the story had something to do with forgers and swiss businessmen and skinny darkhaired women who resembled trudie a woman pellam occasionally dated in la damn hed forgotten to call her it had been five days ive gotta call im going to definitely in mexico marty had spent time looking over the director of photographys shoulderthe boy wanted to be a dp himself one day pellam had been on plenty of sets too many hed decided years ago and so he hung out mostly in the one bar in town which was filled not with roustabouts like the crew in the opening scenes of the treasure of the sierra madre but with urban americans on sevennight sixday packages pellam avoided them like the local water and spent his time with a senior gaffer an old bearded guy who had two intense lovesone was antique generators and the other was emaciated brunettes the latter pellam shared with himthe love for not the golds gymd bodies themselves since he was among the caste of mere hirelings oh a pert little assistant from wardrobe or makeup might make herself available to pellam but any woman whose name was on a screen actors guild contract was off limits to the likes of location scouts and electricians in two weeks the men had polished off bottle after bottle of greasy liquor in which agave worms floated like astronauts spacewalking they shared the worms the last one they cut in half with pellams buck knife and dropped into the last shot of the granular smoky drink the gaffer swore it had hallucinogenic effects and muttered some mumbo jumbo as he tossed back the shot pellam told him he was crazy and didnt feel anything but extremely drunk the movie stank but pellamd had a good time for christsake it was mexico how could you lose the final scenes final scenes hell the whole movie involved more explosives and machine guns than acting but pellam was happy to watch the liquor in the bottles sink toward the fat worms and listen to the explosive charges which were so much quieter in real life than in the final cut of a film itself after the sound effects were added whump whump whump after a while things got boring in paradise and pellam who maybe didnt smile a whole lot and whose eyelids didnt grow as wide as martys but who loved pranks came up with some good ones on that mexican trip he got a lot of mileage out of stuffed gila monsters and latex rattlesnakes the best was when he talked a stunt man into hanging from boots bolted to the ceiling of the directors hotel room when the director stoned on some powerful ganja walked into the room the stunt man shouted man youre on the fucking ceiling how do you do that the director stared at him in shock frozen like james arness in the big ice cube in the original version of the thing the stuntman began to pass out both from laughter and blood to the brain pellam recorded it on videotape and planned to send the tape to selected friends as christmas presents pellam got away with a lot location scouting is to the film busines what switzerland is to war whatever cataclysm betrayals and victories occur in boardrooms and on sets and casting couches nobody has much of an opinion about scouts producers are thieves actors are brain damaged cinematographers are artistes the trades are gorillas everybody hates the writers but location scouts theyre cowboys they deliver then theyre gone that or they sat on the sidelines drinking mescal picking up script girls and trying to pick up actresses and then theyre gone nobody thinks twice about them pellam had had other jobs in film and no jobs other than in film but scouting was the only one hed kept at for more than a couple years mexico last month georgia last week now cleary new york with clearcheeked blondebait marty with a busty former hippie with a hundred squares of slick polaroid pictures with a cemetery with some people who werent too happy to have him in town goodbye he paused on a small road that led to what looked like a town park it might have been private property though the lots in cleary were massive he thought about his place on beverly glen whose lot line you could measure in inches and not end up with an unwieldy number pellam stopped and gazed at the property at the huge robinseggblue colonial in the middle of the beautiful yard so it wasnt a park at all it was a residence and it was for sale the sign was stuck in the front yard pellam wondered what it was like to own a house this big in a town this small he counted windows the place must have six or seven bedrooms he didnt know five people hed want sleeping in his house not all at the same time he started across the road what would a house like this cost what was the backyard like he never found out pellam was halfway across the road when a small gray car crested the hill hit a patch of leaves slick as spilled oil and skidded hard he tried to dance out of its path but a part of the carsome piece of resonant sheet metalcaught him square on the thigh john pellam saw a sea of leaves mostly yellow rising to the sky a flare of sunlight on glass a huge oak tree spinning the blue house turning upside down caught in a tornado then someone swung the curb at him and everything disappeared in a burst of dirty light whered you get that scar pellam opened his eyes thinking only that he wanted to throw up he told this to the whitejacketed man standing above him muscular in his forties and as the doctor was telling him that it was normal pellam started to a bedpan appeared just in time and while pellam was busy with it the doctor continued his calm monologue you wake up from a concussion you always see regurgitation i dont mean stunned but actually knocked unconscious yep completely normal reaction he looked like a veterinarian pellam had taken a dog to once a standard poodle he thought but he couldnt remember for sure he liked standard poodles but he didnt think hed ever owned one that bothered him not remembering maybe he had amnesia or brain damage he groaned after the completely normal regurgitation he felt burning stomach muscles and a fiery throat join the agony that swelled inside his skull a balloon that wouldnt stop expanding until the bone cracked and the pressure hissed out like steam from a burst pipe he took a mouthful of water rinsed and spit into the bedpan there was no nurse and the doctor disappeared with the pan he returned with a clean one and set it on the table next to pellam no it wasnt a poodle it was a terrier one of trudies he believed trudie trudie had he called her that should be about it the doctor said and didnt explain any further pellam did a selfexam he wore just his jockey briefs under a blue cloth robe he lifted the sheets and checked body parts in descending order of importance the only sign of damage apart from the bandage on his head was a bruise on his thigh the color and shape of a mutant eggplant i wouldnt drink anything for a while the doctor said pellam said he wouldnt then added i got hit by a car he was disappointed that this was the most significant thing he could think of to say the doctor said uhhuh mostly he seemed curious about the scar it was a foot long a gouge of glossy indented skin across pellams right biceps and chest it was a memento of the time an arms assistant got the charge instructions wrong during a car chase gag and used dynamite instead of smokeless powder in rigging the oldsmobile pellam was driving when the car exploded pellam got an eighteeninch auto part in the chest the medic told him that if itd been going straight it wouldve pinned him to the wall lahk a stuck piyag pellam you a lucky somvabitch used to do stunt work he now said to the doctor oh youre the movie man huh pellam focused on him he really looked like he should be treating fuzzy terriers and poodles and mending tipped cows im the movie man dont do stunts anymore i hope lifes exciting enough i hear you the doctor said how am i the doctor said nothing serious concussion but no cracks you fell goodi guess because youre used to stunts that scrape on your head is wide it can get infected pretty easy so keep an eye on it ill give you some betadine this a hospital the doctor laughed its got me a mini lab a podiatrist an obgyn if thats a hospital this is cleary general can i leave nope youll have to stay here the night youll be pretty dizzy for a while i wouldnt want you to fall ive got plenty of magazines readers digests some national geographics good things like that a bible if youre interested ive got to get a message to somebody theres a phone in the lobby i can make a call for you if you no not a phone call somebodyll be waiting for me back at my camper its parked on main street pellam told him that marty would be returning about six the doctor said ive got a son works at the ih plant hes a manager he can take some time off and leave a note on your camper door be obliged pellam watched the doctor take a small chart from beside the bed and write on it who was it who hit me the doctor kept writing pellam wondered if it was a hit and run wondered who the driver wassome hotshot a kid probably wondered too if it really was an accident thinking of the mural of crosses on the winnebago thinking goodbye maybe he should call the sheriff thatd be the smart thing to the doctor looked up shes outside what shes here shes been waiting to see you who pellam asked did he mean trudie damn i hope i called her the driver the woman who hit you oh pellam said with a lawyer just by herself he said can i see her you want to see her i guess the doctor said then you can see her pellams first reaction was that she was pretty but not sexy pert n perky he thought discouraged not his type at all a girl with a milewide smile she was maybe thirtytwo thirtythree but looked oldersomething about the teased blond hair the heavy pale makeup the fleshy pantyhose made her seem matronly pellam could picture her as a miss america contestant with a baton sending it sailing up into the height of the proscenium her face was blank when she entered the room but as soon as she was over the threshold she grinned shy crevices around her mouth he was expecting goshhowyallfeelin but she didnt sound that way at all welcome to cleary she said in a low sexy voice that almost made him ignore the mask of pancake makeup she walked right up to the bed and stuck her hand out she saw the scar and it threw her the facade cracked for a minute then the downhome smile returned meg torrens john pellam her mouth went tight i dont know what to say pellam knew what to think bummer hed done a fast inventory a cocktail ring that wouldnt quit wedding band a fat rock of an engagement ring pellam said to her not a problem these things happen pellam had a lawyer one time a former flower child whod done a pretty good job for him on a legal matterat a time when he needed a lawyer to do a pretty good job the ponytailed mand been real concerned about what pellam said in public and hed drummed into his clients head that there were a lot of things you shouldnt say to people you might be involved with in court it occurred to him now that he probably shouldnt have said not a problem her eyes were on his scar he said youre not responsible she blinked he touched his arm not for that i mean id show you the bruise thats got your name on it but i dont know you well enough yet she said that one looks pretty bad happened a long time ago i dont think i want to know how i was driving an olds and firing a machine gun out the window somebody shot the car with a rocket i think it was a rocket im not sure it blew up she stared at him waiting for the truth then gave a burst of polite laugh which faded fast a machine gun an uzi i think pellam frowned and thought hard no a mac he nodded again right a mac and a rocket and a terrier that looked a little like a poodle he didnt have amnesia he looked at her what was her name again a mac he repeated she stared a moment more she handed him a white plastic bag with handles on it present she said her cheeks were red and pellam loved that as much as he loved freckles he loved blushing women even more he couldnt remember the last time hed seen a pretty woman blushing in la all women were like trudie genetically incapable of it he opened the bag the present wasnt wrapped but there was a bow on the box a new polaroid camera what happened to the old one he asked it got kind of mashed he laughed you didnt have to the companyll pay for it she smiled cautiously maybe not sure whether he meant her insurance company or his film company what hed meant was his company but then he figured it was all going on her tab anywaycamera the veterinarians bill and a little moolah for pain and suffering the eggplant bruise would look great in court and now thanks to her he had a new toy to immortalize it with he said thanks he fiddled with the square sleek camera not sure what else to say he loaded it then held the camera up suddenly and took a picture of her she blinked and for an instant got a nervous look as if she suspected him of gathering evidence bzzzzt he loved that sound but he just looked at the picture as it developednot quite in focus tilted washed out her lids were half closed he handed the picture to her what pellam shrugged a present you can frame it she looked at the square its awful then she put it into her purse and looked up at the wall at an eye chart that mustve been thirty or forty years old she was squinting slightly and he wondered if she was giving herself an informal exam or whether she was appraising its value picturing it in her tastefully paneled dining room shed share with a husband rich enough to buy her the hope diamonds cousin for her petite finger she asked youre the man making movies nope i just look for locations that the studio decides they dont like just like me she said i show houses to people who dont buy them so not a housewife a businesswoman person watch it pellam middle america aint the same as when you left patronize at your own risk she said what kind of movie is it an artsy movie he said big mountain studios theyre famous sort of famous pellam said how did you know the name you had this permit in the window of your trailer thing your winnebago pellam nodded wondering whenand whyshed checked out the camper when will they start shooting three weeks give or take meg nodded guess youve got lots of people asking about getting a part some sure they think itd be an adventure you want a part id be are you asking me she blinked in surprise he didnt like women who couldnt tell when he was joking everybody wants to be in movies pellam said not looking at her directly but studying her reflection in a round wall mirror everybody wants to be rich everybody wants to be young everybody wants to be thin shemeg he remembered her name mac rocket terrier call trudie meg meg megshe swallowed whatever she was going to say and instead offered ive got a son saying that seemed to make her more comfortable established some boundaries yo men secure the perimeter pellam was getting tired of the visit he had his present she had her son and her husbands massive rings now he wanted her to leave meg said hed love to be in a movie you dont want him to be pellam said in a tone that said he knew i dont know hes really into california we went to universal studios last year he loved it i did too universal studios isnt hollywood except in the most general of senses meg said you have any kids now her eyes did the heartfinger scan nope he said a pause i think itd be tough to have a job like yours and have kids it would true or she said be married also true so youre not divorced meg nodded he wondered if she was storing this information and if so in what kind of file so you just drive around and look for places to shoot movies he thought for a moment and decided that described his life about as succinctly as anybodyd ever done yep a luxuriant silence she handed him a piece of paper thats my insurance agent he put the slip on the bedside table next to the bedpan my husband told me not to say anything to you but i had to come by john cops and insurance companies theyre going to eat up your words like m ms dont say a goddamn syllable to the cannibals got it he told her these things happen i hit a patch of leaves i wasnt expecting to see somebody in the middle of the street he said youve acted havent you she laughed in surprise no i did some modeling just for a year how could you tell he said the way you carry yourself i dont know just an impression he felt she wanted to warm up but was keeping the tone conversational i lived in manhattan for a while i did some fashion work but i was too short to get good assignments i didnt like it anyway she folded her arm across her chest and looked for the door seemed relieved that it was only six feet away why are you asking me these questions i always like to find out from the locals about locations im scouting its locals she tromped hard on the frown but some of it escaped he said i get the feeling youve lived here long enough to give me an idea of what clearys really like meg was grimacing whatever was behind the visitpellam didnt have a clue what that might bewasnt working out on cue she looked at her watch i should go theres someone covering for me at the office when i get out of heretheyre paroling me tomorrowlet me buy you lunch no i not to worry pellam said ill drive uh i dont think thats a very good idea ive got a lot going on im very busy people are busy in cleary okay it was a little over the line with that one hed forgotten you have to be real careful when you hit people in their home towns especially if youre from one thats a thousand times bigger than theirs but come on country folk you gotta have a sense of humor she bristled yes people are busy in cleary theres more to this town than people like youll ever see there perfect pellam announced she frowned keep talking youre giving me a feel for the place thats just what im looking for i should go he said no you shouldnt anyway im not a local ive only lived here for dont tell me let me guess pellam was feeling perverse hell why not shed run him over ten years her eyes flared what makes you think ive lived here that long in for a penny in for a pound the makeup the hair the clothes whats wrong with her voice was high indignant nothing you just asked me never mind meg unfolded her arms and walked to the door pellam asked so when can we get together the word never comes to mind she stepped through the doorway gripping the knob hard then mustve decided she shouldnt be slamming clinic doors and closed it silently a second later it opened and she said to him and for your information ive lived here for five years not ten the door closed again harder this time ah shell be back pellam heard her low heels tapping on the linoleum then the grind of the front door and then nothing shell be back shes on her way now a car started shell be back he heard a car strew gravel as it hit the road then the whine of gears okay maybe not bzzzzt marty stuffed the moist square of the polaroid into his pocket and squinted as he looked at a bald spot on the small mountain across a ravine acid raind eaten away at a lot of the greenery it didnt look good at all by the time martyd gone to college schools were offering degrees in the environment marty could recognize acid rain he took four pictures numbered them and slipped them into his pocket all location scouts he knew used polaroids but marty was an amateur photographer and wouldve preferred to use his old nikkormat mm the variation in the lenseswide angle telephotowould give a better idea of what the scenery and locations looked like through the panaflex movie camera but the studio paid his salary and the studio said roids so roids were what they were going to get marty wanted to be a cinematographer eventually he knew cameras he liked the murmuring gears and heavy oilscented parts that fit together so well he liked the perfectly ground disks of the schneider lenses set into their royalblue velvet carrying cases he liked the portable arriflex mm cameras which cameramen would carry around on sets like rocket launchers he liked the robotic contraption of steadicams he figured a couple more years of location scouting then it would be about time for his break a unit director would call out holy mother the director of photographys on a benderyou kid get behind the panaflex roll roll roll until that happened however being a location scout would do especially being a location scout for john pellam where you tended to get a week of experience in the movie business for every day you worked marty wandered back down the hill toward the rented tempo get the feel marty worked hard at trying to get the feel pellam made him read the scripts over and over scripts are a bitch to read but he kept at it pellam would question him about a story you gotta get the feel for it hed say the feel that was the extra ten percent that pellamfor all his bullshit and firemeifyouwant attitudewas always talking about the ten percent that pellam delivered this was the essential lesson marty had learned from john pellam the day was getting hot the sun was out marty looked at his watch there were still thirteen locations he had to find but sun like this was too good to miss beer break marty went to the trunk of the car and took out a miller he opened it he sat on the rear bumper as he flipped through the script for shallow grave he unbuttoned his shirt and let the sunlight fall on his tanned skinny chest he liked sitting in the sun and drinking beer he liked the country liked the blond dry grass that hissed when he walked through it when he was in california he usually stayed in a condo in van nuys but he preferred to travel because there were no seasons in la he loved fall he wondered if there were more jobs for cinematographers in new york than in la he wondered the bullet hit the back of the car with a huge ringing slap a full second before he heard the rolling boom of the rifle shot marty jumped up eyes wide dropping the script the camera and his beer white malty foam shot out of the gold can christ he whispered as terror and relief oozed through his legs all he could do was stare openmouthed at the hole in the car remembering a newspaper story about a woman who was killed by a gunshot from several miles away a hunting accident christ he thought thatd been four feet to the right the second shot which he never heard wasnt four feet to the right at all it hit the gas tank pretty much dead center you could hear as if on a soundtrack a huge whoosh as the flaming ball spread twenty feet in all directions you could hear martys horrific scream from the tangle of fire and as the ford burned into black metal you could hear the honking of geese and swans fleeing with their imperfect memory of the terrible explosion at first pellam thought the tragedy was his leukemia a tumor hodgkins im sorry sir the x ray showed something else the doctor opened the door slowly pellam looked at the mans face and knew something bad was coming the man sure had the technique down pellam had used it himself when his father had died hed been elected to break the news to a lot of people he let the downcast eyes and endless loop of a sigh explain to them that terrible news was impending before he said a word the telepathic message of tragedy did a lot of the work for him pellam saw this same expression in the eyes of the strong young vet of a doctor pausing in the doorway looking at pellam as if he were gazing at the last few seconds of his patients good health evening pellam said then he saw the deputy a young man similar in build to the doctor babyfaced crewcut and he thoughthis first fleeting thoughtsomeone had stolen the camper but their eyes explained too much and at that moment pellam understood marty the doctor looked at the deputy who nodded he asked an accident the deputy said im sorry sir what happened pellam found himself breathless the air had actually escaped from his lungs the deputy said his car caught fire im sorry to have to tell you he was killed oh god pellam closed his eyes he felt an overwhelming raw sense of loss images of the boy flipped through pellams head like still pictures that was one thing about himself hed always thought odd for someone who worked in film his memories were always static kodacolor snapshots they never moved oh god his voice faded suddenly he thought of all the things hed have to do who should he call what should he say thered be hours of the grim official business that hed have to handle pellam surrogate father to this poor young man what happened a crash the deputy a boy not much older than marty but with that vest of selfassurance most cops seem to wear said truth be told sir appears he was doing some drugs we found pot and some crack cocaine vials he crack marty no no no we found the body next to the gas tank we think some grass caught fire and he tried to put it out before he could she blew up he didnt do crack well sir i should tell you too that we got a call just before it happened couple men said theyd seen him selling some pot to a local boy they no pellam spat out impossible they described the car pretty good sir who was it who reported it an anonymous call there was a foil package with a goodly bit of grass in it and some crack it was in the car the glove compartment it wasnt all burnt up pellam lifted his hands to his face he wondered if he was going to cry hed cried twice in the past ten years once was just after the funeral of a friend the second time was when his ex had left hed been drank on both occasions he was sober now and he didnt think he was going to cry if its any consolation the deputy said the coroner said it was fast he looked at the doctor for confirmation that a fast death was better than a slow one the doctor handed him a paper cup inside were two pills tiny white pills theyll help you sleep pellam shook his head but he didnt hand them back he held the cup in both hands and stared at the two dots of pills studying them carefully noting the way the light muted by the side of the paper cup fell on them how they were perfectly symmetrical how they rested against each othera kind of infinity symbol in three dimensions what pellam couldnt tell them was one of the things he was feeling was fury hed been after marty for months to give up the pot pellam had done his share of controlled substances in his day but had been shocked to find that marty had smuggled a few nickel bags into mexico when pellam had found them hed pulled the boy from bed pinning him to the cold metallic sides of the camper just before dawn demanding to know where the rest of the stash was he owned up and handed it over to pellam who threw it out marty promised hed abstain while they were driving together would the boy have gone back on his word and crack hed never even mentioned that uhm what pellam started to ask the deputy but his thoughts jammed the men looked at him patiently he remembered what should i do the doctor said you dont have to do anything at all but get some rest i still dont want you out of bed till tomorrow but the young deputy held teardropshaped sunglasses with hazecutting yellow lensesright out of a sixties biker movie the sincere wellscrubbed man hooked a thumb into a leather mesh belt and said the coroners doing his report right now weve already called the young mans family and your film studio his family hello mrs jacobs you dont know me but i worked with your son the two of us we got our asses thrown out of a whorehouse in nogales about three weeks ago the deputy continued were making arrangements to ship the body back to los angeles we figured youd want to be traveling with him sir so weve booked you on the same flight the local funeral homes agreed to transport the body to albany airport thatll be american eagle flight day after tomorrow if hes well enough to travel the doctor said your son mr jacobs was smoking a nugget of crack and got blown up of course the deputy said sure the man leaned forward and pellam saw a roll of dense fat encroach over the black belt of his sam browne harness vaselineshined patent leather the deputy said i dont like you know drugs much sir especially if he was into selling them to some of our young people but im truly sorry about your friend what happened wasnt fair all outa proportion you know what i mean the mans battleshipgray eyes were tight with sorrow and pellam thanked him he looked again at the pills the cup wasnt waxed and he found that his sweat had left fingerprints on the sides the doctor said take those now you need rest pellam couldnt speak he nodded well leave you alone you want some company or anything my wife and i live a hundred yards up the road therell be someone here all night a nurse just tell her and shell get me thanks the men left the room pellam set the cup on the tabletop he misjudged the distance and it hit the edge and fell to the floor he heard one or maybe both of the pills rolling somewhere endlessly he didnt even look down he lay back in bed and stared at the ceiling as the dusk turned into night and finally he slept the noise sitting in the winnebago pellam remembered the way the boy would sit sideways in the campers small bunk and swing his adidas back and forth the thudthud pause thudthud a monotonous heartbeat god it was quiet pellam cocked his head and couldnt hear a thing a hum but that was in his head well he heard martys voice and his laugh and the fake heartbeat of his boots but those were in his head too no airplane drone no diesels no children whooping as they played pellam sat in the drivers seat of the camper looking back into the living quarters the pain in his back was less when he sat upright standing was agony unless he leaned for some reason when he moved the pain wasnt as bad as standing still ah marty he stood up the tragedy tired him out more than the injuries did he walked stiffly hed refused the cane the doctor recommended there was a black scab on his head and the bruise now had some green in it while he still had the courage he filled a macys shopping bag with the boys belongings he rested sitting on the bunk in the camper looking at the bag for a few minutes the big brownred logo the white spidery wrinkles pellam stood emptied the bag and packed the contents back into his own leather suitcase which hed bought on rodeo drive eight years before folding the boys shirts and jeans and jockey shorts as careful as if he were doing piece cleaning in a beverly hills laundry then he sat and studied the suitcase for a half hour after hed been released from the clinic a few hours before the first thing hed done was shave hed passed a mirror and his face with the uneven beard laced with gray had shocked him he looked like he was a badly abused then hed called martys father it had not been a good conversation the man a retired studio gaffer blamed pellam he wasnt contemptuous he wasnt snide but throughout the conversation pellam could hear the pedal tone of suspicionas if pellam had supplied the drugs that had killed his son pellam wondered what the man looked like what his house was like what his relationship with marty had been the boy had complained about his parents a lot but most of the examples the boy cited made pellam think and the problem is what exactly marty bitched about the time they took away car privileges for a month after hed passed out drunk in a hojos off the edens expressway and the time they made him go to a counselor when he went through a spell of cutting classes all high school stuffbitching and moaning pellam also asked to speak to martys mother he felt a wave of relief when the boys father said that wouldnt be a good idea then hed hung up and lain back in the camper cot he clicked the heavy brass latches back and forth the suitcase had cost him a thousand dollars pellam felt the bottle of demerol in his pocket took it out and tossed it into one of the kitchen drawers he needed something different he slowly crouched down and reached into a cabinet out came a bottle of mescal a quarter full with a bloated white worm in the bottom pellam poured a double shot and drank the liquid down in two swallows he coughed and felt the crackling wave from his chest up to his face and the nearly instantaneous deflating of the pain he poured one more smaller and again began the slow crouch to replace the bottle he set it in the back of the cabinet but it landed on something and fell forward the loose cork stopper fell out and a quarter cup of liquor spilled out before he could snatch the bottle up again damn he managed to save the worm pellam reached in the back and felt for what the bottle had landed on it was soft and crunched he jerked his hand back thinking rat mouse he looked just a baggie he reached in and pulled it out filled with martys stash he looked at it for a long moment then wrapped it in paper towels which he soaked under the lowpressure water tap and wadded up this he dropped into a brown paper bag crumpled that up and then stepped outside and tossed the whole thing into a refuse basket pellam hefted the suitcase wheezing painfully from the effort and left the camper he walked stiffly through the cold autumn sunlight to the greyhound depot which took up a small portion of a gas station on main street he paid to have the bag shipped to martys parents the clerk stroked the leather thats a fine suitcase yessir pellam said and as it joined other luggage on a baggage cart walked listlessly outside he was reminded of the last time he went hunting with his fatherin his hometown simmons new york probably no more than sixty or seventy miles from where he now stood walking then through the same stubbly grass he now limped over smelling the same scent of damp foliage bathed in the same pale cast of light twentyfive years ago pellam senior had struggled through the fields lifting the long browning shotgun with an effort and missing even the slowest of pheasants two days later the man had collapsed with the first of the heart attacks that would eventually finish him pellam associated the hunting trip with his fathers death that memory came back to him now and would not leave he walked slowly favoring his left foot to ease some of the dull ache in his back shouldve taken the damn cane the doctor had offered him he thought again the top of the park had been roped off by the police a thin yellow tape that said sheriffs department every few inches stretched from one thick rusted pipe to another there was a chain on the ground attached to one pipe they could have used that to bar the entrance but pellam guessed the cops wanted the chance to use all their crimefighting gear he walked around the pipe and started to climb toward the summit of this hill pellam breathing hard against the pain reached the top of the drive and stopped obliterated he walked to the center of the parking areawhat had been grass and gravel was now just a pile of rich dark earth and the surrounding mess made by the dozer whose tread marks hed seen on the way up but hadnt thought anything of obliterated in the exact centerprobably just where martys car had beenthere was no trace of scorch marks no trace of footprints no car treads just a dry foamy powder of dugup dirt like a huge round grave he stayed here for a long time mostly just walking around in slow circles listening to the birds and the whiplashing wind in the leaves there was really nothing to see nothing at all what happened happened the deputy asked they were standing outside the camper parked on main street the beefy deputy looked familiar pellam thought he was maybe the same one whod helped him to the clinic after his accident what was the drivers name may mary no meg that was it meg the law enforcer stood with his arms pushed out from his body by a lot of biceps muscle he noticed the mans had rubberized combat grips he wondered if the gun had ever been fired anywhere but on a range this deputy also had teardropshaped glasses though his had lavendertinted lenses i get to where the accident was pellam explained and the grounds all plowed over lavender oh that what it was they figured it would be you know discouraging for people to see where it happened discouraging how do you mean wasnt my decision i dont really know i just heard what with leaf season here and all it might hurt tourist trade discouraging pellam asked in exasperation the deputy answered in a monotone it was kind of unpleasant a bad fire you know blood we get a lot of hunters too we then why was the tape still up tape the police tape thatd discourage tourists too pretty fast youd think oh the tape youre right sir we forgot about it but thanks for bringing it to our attention youre welcome pellam said what happened to the car car the miniature troops with needles were climbing up and down pellams back working hard he thought about the demerol he thought about tequila with or without worms the pain was bad and he was losing patience fast my friends car the one that burned yessir id like to take a look at it dont think thatd be possible why not not a nick in his deputy soul the man was a real side of beef well sir it just wouldnt i see that explains it the men stood facing each other the deputy scanning the street for crime pellam scanning the mans face if you could just tell me where it might be i really dont know i just know it was hauled away after the investigation you do any forensics i really got it pellam said never mind they both did the street scan this time pellam looked back and asked i dont remember what the company was would you know company where my friend rented the car we dont have any avis or hertz here or nearby it would be more helpful to know where he did rent it rather than where he didnt sillmans garage i think it was up the road a quarter mile thanks the deputy said klemans funeral homes made all the arrangements thank you officer appreciate it not at all sir i was to la once me and the wife went to disneyland you know the real one uhhuh suspect youll be going back for the funeral the mayors got an airline ticket no i wont be going there must have been a flicker somewhere in the brain but theres wasnt one in the eyes no ill be staying around for a while around here thats right oh we expected youd be leaving yeah well i wont be now id like to see the police report and cant do it sir what pellam felt the anger popping like firecrackers thats not public record material public record material thats right sir well im not public i was his friend sorry sir how about the coroners report is that public record material too nosir its not but all it says is he died as a result of injuries caused by a fire of his own making im pretty much quoting officer someone killed my friend there were incidents of vandalism against our camper before he was killed and in cleary thats right pellam said i dont recall you reported them we didnt i didnt think anything of them until this happened yessir let me ask you you drive into any small town the local kids probably go fooling around some with your vehicle dont they pranks thats happened before hasnt it sure but there you go but its never happened the day before one of my friends is murdered murdered nosir the coroner said it was accidental i guess theres not much more you can tell me thats right sir the sunglasses went back on and the big mans eyes turned a delicate shade of purple he said you staying around sir id be a bit careful already these couple accidents maybe youre kind of a bad luck fellow pellam said hed be careful but he was thinking there was a good chance the deputy was right alan lefkowitz sat in his huge completely immaculate office rocking back and forth in a leather desk chair and looked out the windows which were also huge and completely immaculate beneath him the traffic on santa monica boulevard flowed past century city his eyes were on this wide road full of nice cars but his thoughts were solely focused on upstate new york president and principal shareholder of big mountain studios lefkowitz put in at least ten sweaty hours a day working on his film projects a law school graduate a successful former agent he took continuing education classes at ucla and usc in accounting and financeat an age when many of his friends well this was hollywood call them colleagues also producers were delegating the hard work to underlings and spending mucho time engaged in the development work that is thinking in palm springs and drinking at the beverly hills hotel also on the asset side of the balance sheet lefkowitz had integrity hed pretty much resisted hollywoods strongest gravity which pulled producers toward teenage comedies buddy cop movies special effectsfat science fiction and horror films his own orbit wasnt as lofty as his favorite directors bergman fassbinder kurosawa and truffaut but in his heart he wanted to make quality films with film schools pumping out students who learned cinema not no never movies there was no lack of independent directors in the us making wonderful small serious flicks but lefkowitzs particular talent was that he worked within the system his films were mostly financed and wholly distributed by major studios one of which he presently had a fivemovie housekeeping deal with this being one of the better gold rings in contemporary movieland balls a temper and an ability to convince people that he had vision had managed to get him into bed with this huge entertainment conglomerate which was putting up percent of the money for any five pictures he wished to produce good muscle tone a beach permit for his mercedes and a housekeeping deal for five flicks it didnt get much better than this but although he could legitimately be spending this lunch hour reflecting on his good fortune what lefkowitz was in fact obsessing about was new york the empire state while he swung back and forth in a threethousanddollar leather chair the reason for this meditation sat in front of him on his desk which was huge but not at all immaculate a battered redcovered script marred with doodles and numbers and words it was the first flick in the fivemovie deal a dark and lyrical film called to sleep in a shallow grave a picture that had no buddies no car chases no wisecracking teenagers no karate fights and not a single actor magically turned into a dog baby or person of the opposite sex the property had had a strange history the film was in turnaroundanother studio had bought the script and started production a month later though it had been canceled lefkowitz whod lusted to do the film ever since hed read the book it was based on years before immediately snatched up the rights but buying a turnaround property meant paying a premium he had not only to pay for the script itself but he also had to reimburse the first studio for its production expenses so what should have been a small art film became overnight a bigbudget monster then a famous rule in hollywood proved true if anybody wants it everybody wants it last week two other studios started bidding for the film loyalty in hollywood is a moving target and lefkowitzs studio would have sold the property out from underneath him in a minute except that under his contract he had an absolute right to make the movie absolute that is provided the film met a complicated series of production deadlines it now seemed there was a serious possibility that these deadlines might be missed already the company was two weeks behind schedule and lefkowitz knew that the studio lawyers had notified the production execs that if principal photography didnt begin in three weeks all bets were off lefkowitz would be in breach and shallow grave would disappear from his company faster than a gold chain on the streets of new york lefkowitz was reflecting on this when the assistant producer a handsome intense thirtyyearold walked through the door since hed been working for lefkowitz the young man whod been so eager and talked so flippantly about ballbusting when hed accepted the job didnt look so young anymore he definitely wasnt as eager and the only balls he thought about regularly were his own hes calling at three the ap announced lefkowitz examined his oyster perpetual five minutes tell me what happened the assistant producer began marty whos marty jacobs pellams assistant okay he was killed and jesus pellam ended up in the hospital im not sure but the way the sheriff explained it they seem to be separate accidents what happened to marty the car blew up jesus what about his family the sheriff called and he told them i made a call for your office you dont have to do anything but lefkowitz said well send flowers you know that florist the one i mean will do ill write a note too

cleary he called crazy man im talking pms they wont issue permits oh christ in a tree oh christ its like a real small town they found the stuff what stuff aw marty had a little grass on him they said some crack too but i dont think brother lefkowitz whispered he looked out at the huge immaculate highway he closed his eyes why why why he spun around and faced the ap any chance we can buy our way in i tried thousands i practically gave him head and the ap swallowed he called me a ghoul then he called me a prick then he hung up on me its cratered alan the wholes projects cratered lefkowitz felt numb a moment passed finally he asked pellams okay though the phone rang both men looked at their watches it was three the ap said why dont you ask him pellam leaned his head against the glass of the phone booth cleary still had booths with squeaky twopanel doors he looked at two initials carved into the aluminum otherwise there was no graffiti one set of initials looked like jp he listened to the buzz of the phone ringing he felt the vibration of the healing skin under the bandage on his temple alan lefkowitz came on the phone himself something he had never done no secretary no ap just the soft voice of a tanned fit eccentric multimillionaire producer john how are you what happened he sensed some real sympathy fine lefty im okay pellam then told him in general terms about the accidentsmegs running into him martys death lefkowitz said the permits what happened permits what about them pellam was squinting no it wasnt jp written on the phone booth wall it was jd below that in marker tigers theyre number one one thing about the country teenagers were literate in manhattan hed seen a similar sign debbo and ki there the best theyre not issuing permits the mayor or somebody didnt anybody tell you pellam felt the shock he burned with a wave of sudden fever a weeks work wasted martys death wasted i didnt hear did they say why lefkowitz said they found some shit on him i dont know pot or something you guys alan marty wasnt smoking when he died i dont know what happened but it wasnt that i found his stash it hadnt been opened whatever you know i dont have any choice it wasnt martys fault pellam focused outside the glass and found he was staring directly into the window of dutchess county realty the awning was down and the lights inside were on there was nobody in the office well im sorry john but you understand sure then it occurred to pellam that there were two conversations going at once he said actually no alan i dont understand whatre you talking about ive got to let you go alan what are you saying im saying youre fired john what just like that i thought that little incident a few years ago would have taught you a lesson in a low voice pellam said what the hell do you mean by that im back at square one thanks to you and marty im telling you marty was murdered it was a setup lefkowitz seemed distracted get the wagon to the new york office well have your check waiting for you just lefkowitz said sorry john i got no room for mistakes with this project he hung up like that the first thing meg torrens did when she woke up she put her twocarat diamond ring on her index finger then lay back in bed for fifteen minutes and tried to think about nothing it was a form of meditation shed read about somewhere it cleared your mind made you healthier relaxed you made you more creative it didnt always work but even if not the discipline requiredworking with your brain like an unruly puppyseemed helpful marginally helpful mademoiselle helpful better homes gardens helpful beside her keith stirred slightly his breathing was slow she glanced at him closed her eyes thinking about nothing a bird trilled in the distance a truck shifted gears on the grade of lampton road nothing nothing nothing an instant before the alarm rang she sensed it in her mind an electronic bzzzzt meg opened her eyes and just as the seiko went off reached over to tap the off button she patted keith on his solid shoulders he was ten years older than meg and had some serious businessman fat on him but she didnt mind that his legs and butt were thin you could get away with a lot of belly if everything else stayed in line he had a broad handsome face the face of an actor who played kindly merchants and railroad owners his hair was dense and unruly and he forced it into shape with spray and split it with a rulerstraight part meg regularly talked him out of dye she thought saltandpepper was sexy keith reached up and squeezed her hand muttering something she moved closer to him smelling the warm body sleep scent puff out from under the bellows of the sheet and comforter the tipoff was his wristwatch keith groggily pulled the rolex off his wrist and dropped it heavily on the bedside table when he took off the watch she knew what was coming his hands began to wander honey she said something of a protest but let herself be pulled over to him they kissed she pulled off the violet victorias secret teddy hed bought for her several months ago offering the box shyly as if he was worried shed be offended the familiar routine began he kissed her long on her mouth her chin working downward he lingered at her neck taking her slink chain in his mouth he often did this and she wondered if the gold had a taste that he liked then his lips found her collarbone and he moved down toward her breasts and slowly slowly to her contracted nipples when they made love keith was energetic simple effective meg was ready for him although from time to time she let her hands explore herself when she was taking a shower she hadnt done so since the last time theyd made love a week ago so now even though it was morning even though she wanted to bathe first to brush her teeth even though she didnt feel beautiful even though she had to wake sam in the next few minutes to get him moving in time for his schoolbusdespite all that she felt the low kick inside her meg smiled kissed his chest and nipples rolled him over on his back she stroked him then moved down his belly she felt her own passion swell when he began to grow inside her mouth this is what their romantic life had becomeusually mornings usually spontaneous and meg torrens had no real complaints about it true they werent youthfully passionate but who is after ten years of marriage the compensation was that neither of them demanded too much from the other sex was comfortable like browsing through antique stores or trying out new recipes diverting pleasures silent and a little anonymous theyd learned not to intrude on each others fantasies he nearly came and he held her head still then he sat up rolled her over and kissed her breasts again moved down licked her navel he moved further down her trim body after five minutes she shuddered violently under the clever effort of his tongue and fingers she lay gasping and smiling in the near darkness trying to cement the moment keith waited a gallant minute or two before mounting her she held him fiercely and she moaned the way she knew he liked but was too shy to ask her for she bit his ear she dug nails into his back she pressed her face against his soft gray hair through which a residue of sweat was building she curled her legs around him she moaned again then suddenly her eyes snapped open the intrusion was like a slap a spray of cold water no the memory of the sound wouldnt go away bzzzzt she couldnt place it but it intruded unrelentingly it was spoiling the entire moment she hated it no no go away please then she remembered at the same instant keith gripped her furiously and squeezed the air from her lungs she felt the contractions and the fierce tensing of his hips that was the intrusiona sound playing in her mind over and over was the satisfying whir of the film as it shot out of the mans polaroid camera she pictured his narrow face she heard his voice she saw the glossy dark scar a machine gun an oldsmobile youve lived here how long keith rolled off she pressed her legs together tightly and stretched they lay together for five minutes nothing nothing think about nothing then slowly meg sat up a local she thought angrily he thought i was a local whod lived here ten years love you keith said me too she sat for a moment then saw her face in the mirror a confused frightened look in her eyes she smiled at her husband and forced all thoughts of the location scout out of her mind she swung out of bed and walked into the hall the bathroom was carpeted in black shag the shower curtain was black with red roses on it and the walls were pink meg couldnt decide whether the decor was eighteenthcentury country or victorian bordello she shook her head and tossed her light blonde hair with her fingers it stuck out wildly in all directions from yesterdays spray and the electric curlers she set it with it would take half an hour of diligent work to turn herself into a blond bouffanted real estate agent she fixated on the mirror her lips had always bothered her they were nearly flat planes and she used two subtly different shades of lipstick to give them dimension and when she remembered she would keep the bottom lip curled forward slightly this tended to make her look more pouty than sensuous but in her experience men liked pouting women as much as sexy ones out of the shower drying her thin legs and waist meg stepped on the scale automatically though shed never weighed a pound over since a month after sam was born she combed her hair straight pulled on her robe she called down the hall sam lets go honey in the bedroom keith was still in bed he seemed asleep as she passed he groped playfully for her butt she slapped his hand gently then tugged at his arm up up she called the world awaits he groaned meg walked down the stairs she didnt put on her slippers until she stepped into the kitchen she liked the touch of the carpet on her feet in the morning fifteen minutes later rolls were warm coffee was hot meg was sipping from a heavy mug and wondering where they got the crazy names for kids breakfast cereal when sam came thumping down the stairs he was his fathers son in many ways in the morning he was groggy puffy faced his sandy hair going at odd angles but unlike keith a pudgy boy forty years ago a pudgy man now sam was lean and tall and brilliant this gift was from his father if meg had said prayers she would have thanked the generic allpowerful spirit she nearly believed in that sam had received the gene for keiths brains not hers meg torrens with two years community college was going to be the mother of samuel k torrens phd cum laude keith came down the stairs slowly wearing knifecrease gray slacks a white dress shirt a greenandblack striped tie she poured coffee he said thanks darling and started working on a sweetroll they paid the premium for the new york times but keith preferred the cleary leader which if you read it regularly would really scare the hell out of you and make you think that dutchess county was filled with nothing but murderers child molesters and the mournful classmates of teenagers whod driven the family car into trains while tanked up on their fathers vodka today was tuesday publication day and he read the thin paper hungrily boning up on local gossip hey mom sam said sitting forward on his chair making valleys in his cereal what happens when a duck flies upside down meg knew that success as a mother just like success as a politician is largely dependent on cheerful insincerity she turned to him thought a moment then frowned i have no idea what he quacks up he laughed meg did too and wiped a bit of smurf off his cheek keith grunted a laugh and ruffled the boys hair sam dodged away and shook his hair back into place dad keith looked at him for a moment an affectionate gaze then turned back to the paper there was a shyness about keith even with his wife and son and he didnt look up as he said if i dont have to work how about going to the game on saturday it was as though he was afraid theyd turn him down he added theyre playing he looked at meg whore they playing the high school teams standing and upcoming opponents were pretty much common knowledge in cleary meg said no game this weekend remember its the festival if youre taking time off we can all go yeah said sam his voice breaking sounds good meg said maybe i should enter my apple butter keith said slowly well sure you could he and sam looked at each other she said it wasnt that bad it like tasted good mom it really did maybe keith said delicately next time just some food color critics meg turned to the times classified real estate section and added up the commissions she would have made last year if she were selling houses in scarsdale or greenwich instead of cleary at seventhirty the bus arrived and meg pitched sam his prowrestling lunch box he hugged her then disappeared out the front door keith said that guy ever call the insurance company meg asked what guy your accident that guy with the movie company bzzzt oh him id forgotten about him i dont know ill call jim find out keith looked at his watch muttered damn and walked quickly up the stairs he returned ten minutes later hed added spitshined shoes and a navy blazer to his uniform of the day they brushed cheeks and he walked out the screen door she called bye honey keith said something to her and lifted his hand but she missed his words they were obscured by a sound that started running through her head again the whir of the polaroid which this time try though she might she could not force out of her thoughts mr pellam pellam smiled and shook the mans hand glancing around him the scene was something out of a really bad movieone that alan lefkowitz wouldnt have come close to he was in a little closesmelling towngovernment office a lumber yard calendar on the wall a dead plant in a droughtstruck flower pot a few yellowing files a map dated the smell of bitter old coffee papers musty cardboard and at the desk a local pollooking just like oral robertswith a tight grin he no way in the world meant youre the mayor that correct hank moorhouse silver hair babyblue suit shiny pale green shirt and striped brown and yellow tie jowls and chicken skin his eyes were bloodshot mayor and town magistrate first let me say how sorry we are about what happened to your friend is there anything i can do pellam discreetly studied moorhouses sundaygotomeeting outfit id like to see the coroners report on my friends death the deputy and damn if the man wasnt nodding and looking over his desk he pulled a file out from underneath a stack of papers sure thing sir here you go pellam opened it on top of the report were pictures of martys bodytaken at the scene of the fire and during the autopsy it was like a jolt of electricity seeing those photos he closed his eyes for a moment then glanced at moorhouses impassive face and shuffled the glossy pictures to the back he read the short badly typed report the cause of death was shock and loss of blood due to massive burns there was evidence of some alcohol in the blood stream but no drugs how do you figure he was killed doing drugs if the coroner didnt find any in his system moorhouse sniffed a cautious laugh oh well thats easy pretty clear he was killed before he had a chance to smoke anything pellam handed the file back id like to see the police report if its possible sorry thats not public record material moorhouse said nosir thats correct did you consider the possibility he was murdered thats not my job sir the sheriff and the coroner make that determination tomhes the sheriffhes out of town for a day or so and as for the coroner well what does that tell you moorhouse tapped the file county doc seemed to think it was pretty straightforward pellam asked what about the permits moorhouse swivelled back in his green leatherette chair dont need to see me about that town clerk can issue them he can yep deerll cost you twentyfive bears protected geese pellam smiled i understand you decided not to issue obstruction permits to my movie company oh that true why moorhouse pulled an inch of scotch magic tape off a dispenser rolled it up and began chewing it your friend if hed got himself killed in a car crash or racing out into the street to rescue a little girl wed put banners up and welcome your outfit to town but the boy was smoking crack he wasnt smoking crack he never did crack i traveled with him for months well we found crack vialspot there too i doubt it was his somebody walked up and dropped a foilwrapped package full of hash in a burning car if the police found it there then yes thats exactly what happened whatd you be suggesting sir this man like the town deputies was getting some serious mileage out of sir the word seemed to have a different meaning every time he said it he couldnt have had any with him and why would you be so sure i just am yessir well doesnt really matter its in our discretion to issue permits or not we chose not to nothing more needs to be said were a selfsufficient community pellam blinked wondering what on earth that meant im saying we dont need your movie here sir we dont need your hollywood money im not suggesting you do moorhouse held his hands up so thats it theres nothing more to be said i guess not moorhouses wattles stretched as he broke into a shallow smile he opened his desk now weve got a ticket for you ha thatd be an airline ticket not parking oh im not leaving youre not leaving uhhuh i see pellam said real pretty around here the leaves and everything we do get tourists rrom around the world pellam said i can understand why so youre just going to look at some leaves for a while well see without those permits im out of a job so may as well take a bit of a vacation vacation the scotch tape got chewed and the eyebrows moved a fraction of an inch closer thats wonderful im glad our little burg made an impression on you uhm one thing id mention for your benefit youve got that camper of yours which you cant park on the town streets two to six am youll get yourself a ticket you do the grin tightened thats parking not airline ha and ill bet thats enforced pretty well tom and his boys do their best pellam walked to the door he stopped the car car sir damn gotta learn how to say that sir sir sir sir it seemed very zen like a mantra the car marty was in the one that burned you still have it in custody dont you believe its been sold in two days sold for scrap but how selling a cars easy sir i mean therell be lawsuits wont there therell be some kind of investigation the police investigation ended with the coroners report you curious youll have to ask the rental place obliged for your help pellam opened the door he turned back and nodded sir meg torrens listened to the familiar squeak of her chair as she sat back it was the oldest chair in an old office a teachers dark oak chair with an elaborate spring mechanism underneath a carved seat that matched no posterior shed ever seen wex meg said i can promise you they arent going to go with less than r this is cleary p z youre talking about wexell ambler sat across from her and looked unhappily at the survey in front of him the midmorning lull was in full swing at dutchess county realty in residential real estate evenings and saturdays were the hectic times though that was an adjective meg doubted could ever legitimately describe business in cleary no mr pellam you are one hundred percent on point there people arent busy in cleary never have been never will be the small office littered with three desks and unmatched chairs scarred bookcases an eclectic assortment of lamps which were always illuminated because the window awning had been frozen in the down position for a year the room was decorated with one yellowing ficus tree some primitive paintings of houses one brokers daughter had done in grade school and a huge rollup map of cleary and environs which made the town look more impressive than it ever could in person ambler twisted the survey several ways and studied it none of the positions cheered him up wex ambler was a tall mansix four lean in his early fifties he was thin on top with a few renegade tufts of fine hair going in different directions he had a long face and he continually reminded himself to keep his chin high otherwise his neck flesh became a small wattle he played golf he jogged two miles a day and was a member of the town council he believed one of the few things he had in common with most of the rest of the local population that he was the wealthiest man in cleary he owned foxwood the one apartment complex in town and was the most successful real estate developer in this part of the county real estate and death of a rich relative being the only ways people in cleary could come by real money megs cobroker of the day a horsy blond woman named doris was ticking off items on her todo list with a tiny flick of a mechanical pencil ah huh she said with each accomplishment meg fired a look of irritation at the selfcongratulationsdoris missed it completelyand she turned back to ambler theyre not ambler searched for a word progressive meg laughed her expression saying you just figured that out about cleary she knew that ambler had told a number of peoplehis exwife his associates even virtual strangersthat his life goal was not to amass a huge reservoir of money what he loved was the entrepreneurial process itself it didnt matter what he did as long as the challenge was there the process held more intrigue and excitement than the capital gains did still he told her now the difference to me between threequarter acre lots and two acres he looked up calculated is about eight million dollars total for all lots but thats pretax she said seriously frowning she was trying to joke ambler wasnt amused a variancell take forever meg said its the best land north of the city its meg doris interrupted her jotting there thats him didnt squash him so bad looks like she looked up and watched a thin man in jeans walk down main street is that meg asked yup doris said amblers eyes followed him who doris turned to him with an excited face didnt you hear the man from the movie company meg ran into him in her car she smiled at meg and continued to tick away on her list but ambler said i know i heard i heard you went to his hotel room meg blinked doriss head shot up she stopped ticking ambler shook his head i meant his hospital room megs eyes flared i went to see how he was doris said you didnt tell me that meg said did you hear about his partner no doris asked the accident meg continued what accident ambler looked at her i dont know much about it just that he was smoking dope and it blew up killed him my god doris said the fire in the park that was it yeah ambler said nothing he stared out the windows doris said tough luck honey you know mr ambler last week after those boys showed up all meg was talking about was trying to get an audition doris meg barked doris said to ambler meg did some modeling in manhattan you know she was in vogue and self a couple times womans day i think i knew that ambler said doris continued girlishly i know you were trying to get an audition but enough running him overs a hell of a way to do it meg mouthed bitch at doris who blinked and retreated to her ticks amblers eyes left hers and he looked out the window staring across the street meg noticed this she zeroed in on pellam who stood in front of marges opening a styrofoam coffee cup he said whats he doing here meg answered they were looking for places to shoot a movie hes a location scout no i mean why hasnt he left town if his friend died doris said well i talked to danny the guy works afternoons at marges he said he heard from betty in moorhouses office that hes staying for a while he is meg and ambler asked simultaneously thats what betty told danny so theyre going to do a movie after all ambler said doris said dunno meg stared out the window sighting on pellam through the reversed letters she kept her eyes there and said look wex i hear what youre saying but look at some of the features its practically flat youre going to need zero grading and clearing only a quarter of the whole package is trees and theyre shallowroot pine you dont even have to touch that unless you build with leaching fields toward the trees im not saying i dont want those plots im saying i dont want twoacre zoning if i had my way id want half acre she frowned she said why dont you just do fifty by seventyfives burn out the trees and lefrack it put in cinder block there was irritation in her voice they both realized theyd been negotiating while they were looking out the window they simultaneously turned to face each other ambler stood up meg frowned she wondered if shed offended him he said ill have to think about it ive got another developer interested doris said who ralph weinberg oh him ambler said youd rather sell to a to someone like him his moneys as good as anyones ambler was quiet for a moment i cant think about it now im sorry to sleep in a shallow grave big mountain studios fade in exterior day graveyard bolts crossing new york credits roll as we see various angles on the cemetery uneven tombstones of granite chipped and broken thumbed down by the weather the grass is anemic the lighting bland ghostly like the bones buried here pellam tossed back the bourbon and bent over his typewriter he had stopped by the funeral home to pay for shipping martys casket back to la but had found the charges had already been taken care of courtesy of alan lefkowitz hed spent a few silent minutes alone with marty in the back room of the funeral home that had arranged for the shipment a loading dock really hed wanted to say something but could think of absolutely no words he found a bible in a small chapel near the room where the casket rested he looked for three or four minutes to find a passage that he liked nothing applied he put the bible back touched the smooth heavy coffin and returned to the winnebago outside it was a windy night and the camper rocked slightly reminding him of a boat though hed only been on water once or twice in his life subterranean noises rose from his stomach the dinner of ham with fruit sauce hed eaten at the cedar tap wasnt sitting well he returned to his typewriter a small german portable he hammered away the graveyard is on a plateau one hill eases down to the cemetery from the crest of the piney woods on the qther side the land glides down to the river from that point of stability you go into the town itself an old cannon is small and over painted just like the park benches the storefronts are bleached out and full of antiques no one wants hardware that no one needs the town has managed something remarkableabsorbed fatigue and turned it into a fuel that runs a thousand smalltown dreams angle a flagpole rung by its windblown rope like a bell angle a roaring x with exhaust bubbling driven by a young man who grins at a teenage girl hes your perfect citizen of cleary snotty confident comforting as long as you share his race and ancestry we follow the truck to long angle a motorcycle coming toward us a man in his thirties driving slowly theres something ominous about him he the car door outside the winnebago startled him hed seen the lights through the curtain but absorbed in writing hadnt noticed they werent continuing around the curve and disappearing hey pellam you in there i saw the light a womans voice he opened the door hi there he said and let janine in i was just passing by you know she laughed and set a shopping bag on the table she surveyed the rooms reminds me ofknow whatan airplane what was that smell it entered with her he thought of newly mown grass he looked outside then shut the door and locked it this is luxury he said at the studio they call these honey wagons whys that there are several theories he said none of which i really ought to go into look i heard about your friend im so sorry thank you what happened pellam believed that grief like joy was best explained simply car accident thats so sad terrible she looked like she meant it and he wondered if she was going to start crying he really hoped she wouldnt she said what i was saying the other day about cleary you read about car crashes every week in the leader she surveyed him and nodded toward his thigh scary about these smalltown rumorsman they spread fast howre you right muscle wrong leg ill be okay the sorrow in her voice was gone he was grateful that shed expressed it but hadnt overdone the emotion ill give it a massage i studied rolfing maybe later its a bit tender right now she studied the camper carefully her eyes lingered on the one decoration a new york film festival poster of abel ganzs napoleon she kept giving faint little laughs as each new thing she noticed surprised her i heard they arent going to do the movie here true but youre staying true also i got fired no why its hollywood what a downer she didnt look real down though she touched his arm im sorry about the movie but im glad about you he didnt respond she waited a few seconds then let go and looked around again dont you get claustrophobic its not bad im not disturbing you though as she said it she was sitting down in the small dining alcove making herself at home there are times to say yes you are and times to say no when asked that question he said no not at all i brought you some dessert dessert i remember you liked dessert the cake at marges when you picked me up on monday her eyebrows raised with every sentence i remember yeah picked her up terrible cake he added couldve warned you my desserts arent terrible she unloaded the bag carefully wrapped in foil was a small package next came a thermos two mugs a jar of honey tea herbal tea rosehips and lemon grass its very relaxing she opened the foil and brownies ah brownies pellam looked at them closely then he grinned wait are those they arent really are they uhhuh theyre a little bitter but hey sos peyote right theyre worth it though man ill tell you its not as strong as a thai stick but then again you wont wake up with a cough you have a plate he dug into the cabinet plastic shame on you disposable whatd nature ever do to you janine cut the browniesshed also brought a knife he tried one it tasted bitter and left bits of soggy vegetation in his mouth the tea was awful but you needed it to wash the grass down honey she held up a jar no he sipped the weed water he glanced at the bottle of whisky was tempted but he figured that janine might feel that making liquor was an unnatural thing to do to plants really great he said shed already finished her piece of brownie he chewed down the rest of his she looked at what he was typing you mind she pulled it forward and read intently after a few minutes she gave another of her breathy surprised laughs this is fantastic its like poetry is this the way they write scripts its the way i write scripts i didnt know you were a writer i write scripts that nobody reads just like he stopped himself he was going to say the way you sell houses that nobody buys good line wrong woman everybody else in hollywood i hear you but arent you like fired its a crazy business out there he said without explaining further she read a few more portions damn pellam poetry the movies good but it could be a lot better also guild scale for script doctoring is obscenely high know what it reminds me of renoir fellini david lynch pellam asked who kahlil gibran what he tried to smile wasnt he that romance poet pellam hadnt read him but he believed that they used his verses in hallmark cards she looked at him wideeyed i really really mean that well thanks the descriptions are fantastic he explained i think the setting in a film is another lead character setting a scene one place instead of another will produce a totally different movie like casting denzel washington in a lead versus wesley snipes same lines same direction but a different film kahlil gibran you write like this whyre you just a location scout just you know what i mean he did know what she meant i like traveling around i dont like meetings i dont like california i dont own a suit that sounds like youre reciting catechism in nomine zanuck et goldwyn et spiritus warner ha there a message in this movie the advertising department will say its about betrayal and passion mostly its a love story i guess she squinted and licked honey off her reddish finger you guess loves a funny thing to pin down pellam broke off another piece of brownie no buzz no tiny people stuffing cotton in the crevices of his brain he was disappointed she was surveying the inside of the camper again she opened drawers and nodded you dont mind do you fully prepared to keep going he sensed if hed said that he did but then she came to a cabinet and opened it started to pull out a couple of battered scrapbooks he was up fast and lifted them gently and laughing out of her hands oops sorry she said im being nosey huh pellam smiled and put the books away she looked at him for a moment you know i was thinking about this today you seem awfully familiar theres something about you have i read anything about you me janine shook her head maybe she said seriously it was in a former life hed heard this one before sometimes they said you and me i think were soul mates sometimes they just said pointblank can i come with you in the camper sometimes they never said anything but looked at him with hungry hurting eyes that was the hardest pellam said past lives huh maybe you were a pioneer woman and i was a cowboy he told her the wild bill hickok story holy shit thats terrific pellam a gunslinger his namei always have to set this straightwas james butler hickok not william he blinked and looked at the brownie it seemed to be floating in the air he broke off another piece and ate it anyway he was a his mind stopped working for a moment he retrieved the end of his sentence relative i mean an ancestor he added on my mothers side janines eyes danced with enthusiasm she maneuvered her taut hips out of the booth and stood up where was she going there werent many options in the camper she asked he was the one with the wild west show with annie oakley no no nothat was buffalo bill william cody wild bill was a gunfighter fast draw and all that just like in the movies buffalo bill hired him for a while to be in the show but he wasnt a very good entertainer he was good at shooting people that was about it so maybe you knew wild bill in a former life oh but your former lives arent the same as your ancestors but maybe you were a sheriff that wild bill killed and you came back he didnt kill sheriffs he was a scout and a federal marshal okay then an indian warrior he killed or a cattle rustler maybe i was a squaw and weve met a couple of times in the past pellam lost this train of thought completely she had disappeared into the back of the camper he heard her voice muffled this is very comfortable pellam heard the bedside light click on cozy you know i guess he was moving unsteadily toward her he said maybe i was the lover of the wife of the cattle rustler pellam stopped speaking janine was lounging back pellam found he was staring at her breasts she noticed his eyes and he said quickly nice pin you make it he pointed to a round moon face necklace made of sterling silver it had a coy feminine face she leaned forward and held it out to him he tried to focus on it its a bestseller at my store then she frowned whats the matter well here i bring you brownies and tea and you dont even ask me to get comfortable he clicked the bedside light out the moonlight came in through the blinds and the cold illumination was almost as bright as the lamp sorry what can i do to make amends you can start by helping me off with my boots she lifted her leg and he took her calf taut in the tight denim in his left hand and gripped the heel of her boot he looked down they were cowboy boots how many you want billy asked the boy before he could answer bobby said have four whats your name again billy asked ned and sure ill have four the pancake somersaulted through the air like the bone in the movie the bone that became a space station what the pancake became after bobby maneuvered the plasticized grand union paper plate underneath it adjusting for the trajectory was just more of the boys breakfastflapjacks sausage eggs and buttered toast that was you know totally fresh the boy said his eyes whipping up and down replaying the flip billy nodded toward his brother and said nobody flips em like bobby another flip ned a strapping seventeen year old was having five pancakes it turned out not four bobby looked shy and pleased about the good review of his talent he didnt say anything he wiped his hands on his kiwanissupplied apron billy and bobby were twins they were about the same size as the boy a little under six feet and maybe a hundred eighty pounds but less of them was muscle than in the kid they were thirtyfive they wore their dark hair similarly carnaby look with long bangs a fringe came over their ears in a slight curl they shampooed with coal tar soap and always had a medicinal smell about them today they wore brown bobby had on a white shirt because hed volunteered to cook at the kiwanis breakfast billy just hanging around and helping whoever needed help wore a beige shortsleeved shirt printed with designs that looked like chain links whatsa time he asked the boy who looked at a big gleaming watch birthday present billy thought almost eleven near quitting time for us bobby said he scanned the site of the breakfastthe basement of the first presbyterian church of clearyand motioned to a nearby papertableclothcovered card table why dont you sit over there well join you well sure ned said turning his round redscrubbed face to

summer barbecue and though they werent married and had no children the ptas regular potluck suppers nothing beat the combo of food and volunteer work ned was one of those teenagers that could talk easily with adults especially adults like the twins who knew sports and werent too geekish to tell an occasional polack joke or one about girls periods or boobs the boys rambling monologue was up and running by the time billy and bobby focused on it oh man i heard it was like totally awesome sid hes kinduva dweeb but you know he can be okay sometimes he was driving by and seen the cloud cloud

just pancakes and sausages i dont want any eggs coming right up bobby said just as billy started to say the same thing wexell amblers house was on barlow mountain road just south of cleary the yard ran at a shallow incline down to what was called a lake on the local maps though it was really just a pond a hundred years ago samuel bingham the hartford insurance magnate wanted to surprise his wife on her fortieth birthday by giving her something she didnt already own which didnt leave many possibilities but he noticed a lowlying spot on their seventyacre estate and an idea occurred to him he dug out three hundred apple trees and dammed a small stream that ran through the property the result was a shallow weedy tenacre lake now surrounded by houses of the sort ambler owned halfmillion dollar colonials amblers was the oldest built in and contemporaries all twoacreplus lots amblers exwife had landscaped the place it was trim and simple pollendusty hemlocks azaleas rhododendrons boxwood shed given up on tulips and annuals the damn deer can find their own entrees the woman had said shrilly standing now at the edge of this pond ambler whipped his fishing rod back and forth trying to drop the tiny dot of burgundy fly into the yellow plastic hoop floating thirty feet away each time hed flick the willowy rod he came close to his target but there was an uneven breeze and he was having problems compensating although hed hunted all his life and fished frequently with a spinning reel hed only been flyfishing for a year and learning it was hard as hell still he kept at it patient squinting at the hoop which looked white through his yellowlens glasses the footsteps came up slowly behind him the steps were deliberately loud and he decided male someone was walking heavier than necessary to announce himself so he wouldnt startle ambler he glanced over his shoulder at the young man mark howdy wex the man wore blue jeans a plaid jacket a blue down vest engineer boots he was in his late twenties heavy his thin lips curved into a sincere smile his sandcolored moustache was irritatingly meek he had brushcut hair parted in the middle put him in a polyester suit and hed be a model kmart manager he didnt look like what he was a facilitator ambler didnt particularly like the young man on the other hand labor and accounts receivable problems at amblers construction company had nearly vanished since hed hired mark the boy was chewing tobacco and ambler hoped hed spit ugly so he could dress him down for it but he just kept the wad in his mouth like a new york yankee pitcher and looked happily across the lake catching anything just a salutation snappers snakes and algae were the only living creatures in this lake everybody knew that nope ive asked around seems like its right about that guy hes staying around yessir what for asking questions about his friend was killed goddamn you dont have to worry wex any chance at all that somebody saw you no im sure how sure mark was completely patient it was funny how calm and patient truly dangerous people could be no one saw me when i heard the car burned up i thought itd be destroyed i wrapped the stuff in foil it was in the glove compartment that may have helped helped what do you mean i dont mean helped in a good sense i mean that may have kept it from burning up there was hash and some crack vials as if he didnt want to hear the details ambler asked quickly when you called the sheriff theres no way to trace it maybe they could do a voice print tom doesnt have that kind of equipment wex you know that anyway he was out getting his haircut i left the message with gladys she doesnt even know my voice said a couple of us had seen him i shouldnt have told moorhouse to plow the ground over ambler thought of something else what about fingerprints mark didnt say anything just stared at the band of colorful trees across the pond ambler said im sorry im sure you thought of that i just thought pellam would have left its upsetting the fly went wide and caught in some reeds damn ambler said he pulled out his complicated fishing knife with a hook remover and sealer on it he was going to cut his line but then thought maybe a canada goose might get tangled ambler was wearing twohundreddollar ll bean shoes he had no idea where his wading boots were he sighed and started walking into the lake to free the line he felt soft muck under his shoes bubbles of soft air rose around his legs mark said you want me to do that ambler said no he walked unsteadily to the weeds unhooked the fly then returned slowly to the shore i know the kind of man he is who the man from the movie company hes not leaving till he gets some answers ambler sighed you know him i know his kind he said impatiently the young man looked out over the lake squinting at a phalanx of geese coming in for a landing it was a wistful lookas if he wished he were sighting down the barrel of a long tengauge shotgun leading a bird by ten feet you want me to keep an eye on him yes i do a moment passed a swan floated past ambler knew that however beautiful they were they were also mean sons of bitches finally mark said you want me to do anything else ambler glanced at him then dropped to his knees and began to undo the tangled fishing line youre the place rents cars pellam asked the young man the kid wore dungarees and stood under a yellow monte carlo which was head high on a lift the garage had two bays and a small office the whole place stinking of grease and gasoline and burnt coffee pellams eyes watered from fumes yessir he was changing the oil and apart from his fingernails there didnt seem to be a fleck of grime on his body anywhere thats a good trick staying that clean i dont work that hard pellam yawned he was tired winnebago beds are small and janine was a big girl also she was an energetic lover a bit desperate too it unnerved him the way she kept promising him how much she liked sex with him how good he was he didnt believe women were capable of that many orgasms in a twohour period at least not in a winnebago bunk he woke up once in the middle of the night and found her crying hed asked her what the matter was she said angrily he wouldnt understand he sensed he was supposed to pry an explanation out of her but he fell asleep and woke at seven to find her foraging in the small fridge and making a huge omelette she ate out of hunger and he downed from politeness pellam now asked the wellkempt garage man you sillman nosir just work here is all is there a sillman yessir but hes down in florida pellam walked to the front of the bay and looked again for the wreck he wasnt sure he wanted to see it it didnt matter because although he saw a lot of decrepit cars he didnt see any burnt wrecks i understand you rented that car that got burnt up the one the other day oh yeah that was terrible wasnt it you know what happened to the car was here yesterday out back then she got

surprised sir by the way thats a nice camper you got yourself you wanta fill not today he said pellam walked over to the three men playing poker sitting in the back of the hudson inns sourmash and beerscented bar mind if i sit in a little uncomfortable at first this crew then he bought a round of bud in the tall bottles then he bought another and things loosened up fred was the easiest to talk to close to seventy with a red leathery face he hadnt been a farmer which would have been the safest guess but had worked railroads all his life retiring early from amtrak ten years before petein his mid fortiesran an insurance agency from his splitlevel a mile outside of town before the first hand was dealt pete started hanging on everything pellam said agreeing too often nodding broadly hed say wait a lot and have pellam repeat himself to make sure he understood what was said the other of the foursome was nick twentyone and as blasé as anything cleary had ever produced hed roll his eyes saying sheeit and offered a sneer of a smile that pellam came to decide wasnt as mean as it appeared it was just part of the topography of his face pellam pegged him as a searcher a successful high school linebacker going to fat as he cast about for a career fred told the others that pellam was descended from a famous gunfighter wild bill hickok pellam closed his eyes for a moment now where the helld you hear that fred shrugged petes eyes widened another few millimeters and said holy moly nick said bet five janine of course it had to be janine see you pellam said raise five pete said hey i saw that film who was in it jimmy stewart i dont remember he was one of the best shots in the west wild bill he was your classic gunfighter he shot who was it i dont remember maybe billy the kid just it was incredible see your ten he got shot in the back oh hey sorry pellam he looked down blushing at his faux pas christ pete i never knew the man well you know fred said dealer sees your ten shot in the back hey pellan that why youre sitting facing the door he laughed and said no he didnt tell him that the reason hed picked this chair was so that he could look across the street into the window of dutchess realty company where meg torrens sat her white blouse illdefined but evident in the dimness of the office hed decided a real estate broker could give him a good rundown on the cast of characters in clearyand who might not want a movie made here shot in the back man fucking cheap shot said nick and tossed in more chips call you they played for nearly an hour pellam steadily losing fifty bucks most of it to fred pete was still staring at him in an irritatingly eager way when fred said ha pellam youre a poker player you ever get a deadmans hand then turned to nick you know what that is whats that like so awesome it blows everybody away a royal flush thats what wild bill had when he got shot full house of aces and eights you ever get that pellam fred stacked up his ample inventory of battered chips not that i can recall nick got up to hit the john and pellam asked fred and pete got a question say somebody had a wrecked car whered they sell it for scrap around here she run at all fred asked nope just for steel the local men looked at each other pete said couple places id go to stan grodskys yard out on nine fred said hes a polack and hell rob you pete blushed again

over on about three miles north of here pete was thinking furiously oh theres also r w theyre out on nine too thats nine also i mean not ninetytwo fred nodded yeah forgot about them nick returned the table was stacked with bottles a forest of glossy brown the bartender cleared some away and the game resumed pellam watched the cards flying out from under nicks thick hands they played for another twenty minutes then pellam saw motion across the street hard to say vague in the dusk but it might have been a pretty blonde in a white blouse wearing too much pancake makeup and fleshy pantyhose locking up a smalltown real estate office at dusk he looked at the three jacks in his hand and folded he stood up everyone at the table looked at him im beat fred said tough work losing money nick frowned it was too early to leave pellam was breaking gambler protocol suit yourself maybe sit in tomorrow pete said come by sometime anytime id like to get your opinion on what we were talking about before you know pellam had no clue sure thing evening gentlemen by the time he got to the sidewalk meg had finished locking the door and was moving toward her car he felt a presence at his side it startled him someone took his arm janine kissed his neck its cecil b she squeezed his biceps into her breast i just closed up shop and was going to stop by your camper and say hi how are you darling doing good pellam said forcing himself not to look toward megs receding form she squeezed his thigh mindful of the bruise and said you dont look as sore as last night a sly grin i was thinking love you still havent seen my house come by and ill make you dinner ill even cook meat you want how about a rain check ive got to send a package off to my studio ill be working all night ive got an awareness group tomorrow and womens crisis intervention the day after maybe i can oh hell then my old mans coming by hes bringing his new cycle over to show me she stood back and examined his face hey youre not jealous are you not a bit thats a good boy she held his eyes in a vice grip then leaned forward suddenly and kissed his mouth hers was partly open he recoiled for an instant in surprise then returned the kiss janine said then the apple festivals on saturday and im working a booth how would sunday be sure good where was meg hed lost her goddamn whyd she worn a black jacket he couldnt see her he looked back at janine who was saying you better not get cramps anywhere but in your writing hand she punched him playfully on the jaw though bone connected with bone and he blinked she said and you better not stand me up mama doesnt like to be stood up yes dear he smiled and stood hard on the sarcasm not far away megs toyota fired up he heard the bubble of the exhaust and saw the gray car back out of its stall he said well much as i hate it better go do some work sunday then i close the shop at four why dont i come by the camper after well drive home together hows that sounds great he kissed her cheek broke away as he started toward the toyota he saw the little car speed away the brake lights flashed as it made a fast turn and then was gone damn pellam slowed his walk stopped and headed back toward the camper thinking about junkyards he walked to the end of the deserted block and turned the corner onto the side street where the winnebago was parked thinking about getting something to eat thinking about he nearly walked into the car the little gray toyota idling at the curbside when he put his hands on the roof and bent down to the window where she sat holding the wheel in both hands staring straight ahead she said youre alone nope im with you i thought you maybe had a date date werent you walking with she debated and the catty side won ms business he said ah business pellam asked how about a drink he knew she was going to say no but he was curious what form it would take there were a thousand different ways a woman says no to a man and they all have different meaning i cant im going out with the girls tonight bridge how about poker i can get us into a game up the street she laughed a moment passed i wanted to say i was sorry about your friend i heard about the accident thank you i also wanted to apologize he cocked an eyebrow toward her and she added for the other day in the hospital naw i was out of line pellam said i hate hospitals they put me in a bad mood no she studied the tachometer i was rude a hotrod car went past exhaust popping as it slowed for a stop sign then took off again she said theres something else he smiled is there meg swallowed and tried to put up a shield against the flirt its kind of last minute but you interested in coming over for dinner you cook like you drive she blinked and tried to think of a comeback he could see her thoughts racing but she decided not to play the wittiestcomeback game about eight thats extremely fashionably late around these parts in fact its about bedtime ill bring some wine no you dont have to no bother meg gave him directions he memorized them and repeated them out loud he said see you then grinning she gunned the engine he stepped back and she spun the car into the intersection scattering gravel shed kept it in gear the clutch depressed while theyd talked planning a fast getaway meg glanced back and unsmiling waved she drove into the darkness meg torrens mixing fresh dill weed into sour cream heard her husband upstairs moving slowly keith torrens liked to dress for dinner hed be laying out his clothes on the bed hed picked that up from some episode of masterpiece theater almost anybody else in cleary mentioned that they are going to dress for dinner itd make them sound like an idiot or itd be a joke about changing out of sweats but keith was a natural at that kind of formality meg found it charming he was moody some and quiet but he was a scientist he was brilliant his mind was different from everybody elses meg liked smart men she liked formal men she liked successful men and keith was that shed never met anyone so devoted to his own business as her husband hed always wanted one a business of his own keith the dreamer even as head of research and development at sandberg pharmaceutical outside of poughkeepsie not a job to shake a stick at shed reminded him on the dozens of occasions when he wanted impetuously to quit hed obsessed about being an entrepreneur at first he hadnt been sure how to go about it first hed considered a consulting firm but that smacked of laidoff middle management then he considered forhire research laboratory but that was pretty much for losers and academics andmore troublesomeit wouldnt give keith the income he wanted as badly as he wanted his name on a corporate office then one day two years ago he came home and announced he was going to do it do it meg had asked uneasily im quitting weve been through this a dozen times shed reminded dales got cash keiths friend from sandberg and his intended business partner how much cash meg had inquired enough and she knew there was no deterring him so with a mortgage a son destined for mit and a wife who in a good year made twelve thousand in commissions keith took the plunge in a whirlwind of eightyhour weeks keith dale and their lawyer bought their way out of stiff noncompete contracts with sandberg and opened a company it hurt her some that he wouldnt let her in on the deal not that she wanted to have anything to do with the technical part of course setting up the factory the financing hiring employees she knew she wasnt smart in those ways but meg thought she was a pretty good broker and when keith bought property through another realtor it really stung why one night shed even taken a phone message from the bastard a competitor another broker honey shed said thats what i do for a living why didnt you ask me and hed looked at her surprised and then forlorn she could see that he hadnt even thought about using her hed confessed that hed blown it hed apologized looking miserable like a boy whod forgotten mothers day oozing contrition shed smiled and forgiven him brilliant but sometimes he just didnt think that was so peculiar how could that be sam wheeled through the kitchen hey mom you know why the dinosaurs went extinct an asteroid crashed into the earth and this poison gas killed them all he sniffed the dip yuck he vanished did that really happen how could all the animals on an entire planet get killed at once did we have to start over again in evolution maybe civilization would be millions of years more advanced if not for a single asteroid meg filled the dip bowl and set out crackers like flower petals on the plate she finished setting the table and wandered through the downstairs rooms shed decorated the house herself laura ashley wallpapertiny flowers like an airbrushed spray of blue a threeinch border of burgundy paper around the walls below carved molding braided rugs most of the antiques had been bought on a single occasion at an auction in vermont country rustic some of them painted and distressed and a lot of victorian and a whorehouse of a bathroom she kept thinking gotta change that dried flowers wreaths vases and doilies were everywhere on the living room walls were photographs from the s mounted on sepia paper shed bought them in a local antique store for a dollar each and mounted them in old frames she sometimes told visitors they were her ancestors and made up elaborate stories about them meg dimmed the lights in the sconces and stood looking for a moment at the romantic ambience she shook her head she turned the lights back full and trotted up the stairs keith was sitting on the bed putting a shine on his shoes now he examined the loafers like a diamond cutter until she began to undress one glossy shoe dropped in his hand he was grinning hey boy meg said we got a guest in twenty minutes get that thought out of your mind he dropped his shoes stepped into them kissed her chastely left the bedroom meg tossed her clothes onto the hamper slipped into her robe do do a do she stepped into the bathroom dont do a dont in the shower her hair protected under a translucent shower cap printed with somber seagulls a christmas present from sam meg felt the stinging water and wondered about the donts for this evening it became a private joke megs and keiths after shed told him about a movie shed seen in high school hygiene class dont do a dont and do do a do was the theme of the film which warned about sexual risks in such delicate euphemisms that nobody could figure out exactly what the donts were she decided that tonights donts were dont talk about the movie about his friends death about hollywood which made her wonder why shed invited him in the first place when she got out of the shower she heard the comforting sound of her husband flipping through the moebius strip of tv channels downstairs she laid out a black angora sweater with a star in pearls above her left breast and black slacks with a razor crease she sat at her dressing table she spread the heavy foundation powder over her face and began working with blue eyeshadow her hand paused whats so cleary about me five years not ten mr pellam bzzzt meg walked into the bathroom and cleaned off the makeup with ponds from the back of the toilet she pulled a recent vogue magazine and began flipping through it hiya john pellam said in her heart meg knew that every man from hollywood believed fidelity to ones wife was an idea so odd it could be a headline in the national enquirer but pellams weak handshake and chaste cheek kiss told her she may have found an exception his eyes however did a complicated reconnaissance of her face and she almost laughed as he tried to figure out exactly what was different about her she could tell he decided it was the french braid of her hair keith did the same scan and said new sweater darling looks super hed given it to her two christmases ago pellam was wearing black jeans and a gray shirt buttoned at the neck without a tie and a black sports jacket he was smiling steadily looking around the house and talking to keith she heard her husband say you look like youre recovering pretty well from your little runin with my wife excuse the expression ought to be a town ordinance everybody elses got to wear crash helmets when meg drives all right buddy boy she said offering a wry smile you want to talk fenders you want to talk body work keith rolled his eyes said okay sometimes i run into things true you found the place okay she asked pellam perfect directions keith was looking out the door oh a winnebago he stepped out on the porch home sweet home to meg pellam said brought you a present he handed her a small flat bag oh yeah he said he added to it a paperwrapped bottle which turned out to be one of her favorite merlots meg looked at the small bag whats this pellam shrugged she opened it and began to laugh honey she called to keith pellam cracked a grin she held up a bumper sticker so many pedestrians so little time keith laughed hard thats a good one sir thats very good he said come on ill show you around meg glanced up the stairs a small face was looking through the newel posts at the landing sam come on down here her son jumped down the stairs he walked right up to pellam and stuck out his hand how do you do megan felt a burst of pride pellam smiledmaybe at the formality and at the firm shake meg knew that childless men and women tended to think of kids as more or less pets meg had worked hard with her son he was polite and direct meg said meet my son sam sam this is mr pellam keith said come on upstairs sam well postpone your homework long enough so you can show mr pellam your room yeah the boy said in a high voice the male contingent of the dinner party vanished upstairs meg walked into the kitchen and poured glasses of pellams wine for the three of them she sipped hers and stared at the winnebago should she join them or not no something told her to stay here ten minutes later the creak of footsteps had worked their way back to the top of the stairs pellams camper was next on the tour itinerary sam started to burst out the door but keith made sure he was wearing his jacket meg offered wine to the men pellam took his nodded at her with a smile keith glanced at the glass but shook his head ill have some later he was a hard liquor drinker mostly scotch mom i showed mr pellam the computer then my burglar alarm and my metal detector pellam said he made it himself i cant believe it sam said dad helped but not much keith said they all moved toward the door keith said to meg were getting a winnebago tour she said dinners ready honey he said patiently its a winnebago and a glance at sams face told her a cold dinner was worth it as they walked onto the porch sam asked hey mr pellam do you like bombs ive worked on a few huh movies meg laughed sam continued breathlessly enthusiastic sometime maybe i could show you these practice bombs theyre at this junkyard theyre really neat mom wont let me buy one but wow thats so neat can i sit in the drivers seat you can even honk the horn pellam told him cool at the dinner table pellam looked out over the spread of osso bucco mashed sweet potatoes green bean salad broccoli howd she made all this in the two hours since shed intercepted him downtown sam was in bed keith was serving and pellam kept looking around him he felt as if hed never seen a house before keith adjusted his tie and lifted his wine glass to my wonderful wife and her superb dinner the conversation meandered washington politics los angeles smog pellam asked keith what he did i own a little company that makes overthecounter products cough syrup aspirin things like that hes too modest meg said keith keeps tap dancing on bristolmeyers face its an uphill battle but hes getting there slowly its tough for us small boys but i like the challenge thats whats great about growing a business the competition you a corporation uhhuh you have to be with all the personal injury suits now my single biggest overhead expense after salaries is insurance you have a partner silence meg stirred pellam had asked something awkward keith said dale meyerhoff we worked together at a pharmaceutical company near poughkeepsie he died not long ago died oh im sorry car accident meg offered keith said last year it was quite a shock pellam realized that theyd dealt with the loss a long time ago but they were uneasy now for himprobably worried that the reference would remind him of marty he said so you do everything hm keith said i had a lot of learning to do dalemy partnerwas sales and finance me im just a chemist basically a scientist a nerd you know studio i used to work for did a film about a chemist one time really keith smiled usually you just see movies about cops and monsters and private eyes i guess it wasnt really a chemist it was called the surrey alchemist we made it in england it had very limited distribution over here witches and sorcerers alchemists were considered scientists at the time pellam said we did a lot of research turning lead into gold is called base alchemy true alchemists practice sparygia he noticed meg checking out the plates pushing bowls toward pellam when the helpings got too close to empty keith seemed fascinated with the story and wasnt eating sparygia meg asked pellam said it means extracting basic properties from things usually plants what an alchemist does is try to find the essence of something and that essence supposedly had powers beyond just the chemical composition of the material keith said i remember from a scientific history course i took at mit whats the movie about it was based on a real story in the late s in england there was a rich man named james price he was like a lot of the wealthy then you know dabbling at science maybe he was a little more than a dabbler since he got named a fellow of the royal society he was also kind of a crank a little bizarre he set up a lab in his homein surrey out in the country he does all this secret work then calls a meeting of his friends and fellow scientists he brought them into his lab where hed set up a displaythe three basic ingredients of alchemy mercury nitrate and sulfur keith laughed hey you know what those are meg said let him finish pellam said to keith what a formula for a bullet nitrate and sulfur are in gunpowder and fulminate of mercurys in the firing cap pellam laughed wish id known that it wouldve been a nice metaphor for the flick anyway price also had some other ingredientssomething secretin covered boxes he got this crowd together and made a grand entrance he looked awful though sick and pasty exhausted then he mixed a white powder with the three basic ingredients and turned them into an ingot of silver he did the same thing with a red powder and produced gold the metals were tested by a metalsmith and were supposedly genuine then he sold the ingredients on latenight cable tv and made a fortune meg said keith hushed her pellam continued but heres the interesting part price kept up the alchemy and made a huge amount of gold but after a few months his health began to fail finally when the society insisted he do another experiment under observation he agreed three members of the society rode to his laboratory one morning he invited them in set up his chemicals and drank a cup of poison he died right in front of themwithout revealing what the powders were keith tilting back his chair then said what was it a hoax and he had to kill himself we left it up in the air its tough to make movies based on true stories you have to pamper reality meg laughed at this keith suddenly squinted at pellam you seem real familiar pellam said really were you ever famous meg said keith pellam said seriously in my mothers eyes meg laughed keith shook his head itll come to me he squinted again in recognition but apparently the thought vanished he began talking about his company new product lines stories only a businessman would love pellam nodded and ground his teeth together to squash the yawns he was pleased that keith wasnt a movie hound and hadnt asked for one iota of hollywood gossip on the other hand he was a major bore pellam hardly listened to a word he saiduntil he realized keith was talking about someone dubbed miss woodstock who knew the astrological sign as well as a few other intimate facts of every single man in town meg leaned forward and with a coy smile caught pellams eye he knew what she was up to and kept his eyes on keith until she disappeared into the kitchen of dishes the womenfolk gone it was time to talk about serious stuff keith lowered his head and asked have you talked to the insurance agent about the accident not yet meg gave me his name the doctor said hed have a bill ready for me in a couple days he was waiting for the xray labs bill if you have any problems you come to me okay appreciate it how long you think youll be in town dont really know i meg returned coffees almost ready she sat down so tell us you married meg asked hed told her in the clinic maybe the question was for keiths benefit to show that she hadnt known it meant a bit of intimacy existed between them pellams eyes swept over her dress the pin on above her breast she looked a lot younger today the makeup was better maybe she had to wear realtor camouflage when she was selling houses he realized he was staring at her and still hadnt answered the question nope he said was divorced a few years ago thats right youd mentioned that oh a bad memory thats all theres a girl ive been dating off and on nothing too serious her names trudie damn hed forgotten to call he would tomorrow definitely a timer bonged in the kitchen as meg rose pellam glanced at the pin on her dress again thought of janines pin and her breasts shed had a moon meg was wearing a sun dessert meg said walking back in from the kitchen with a tray keith said megs a whiz with desserts she set the tray down brownies pellam said you like brownies she asked cant get enough the beige car pulled off the highway and into an asphalt parking lot which was slowly turning into black gravel sleepy hollow motor lodge here we be billy said the twins got out of the car and bobby snagged a big bag from the backseat heinekens he said proud hed bought imports in gennie ale country they inhaled deeply and bobby said fall i love it billy looked at his watch late bobby walked past him and opened the door inside was an ugly square room too hot too brightly lit billy followed him in toasty billy said he opened a window fucking hot heh neither of them really liked the hotel that much cheap plastic tacky it reminded them of brooklyn where theyd been born or yonkers where theyd lived until their junior years in high school when their father had been laid off from the stella doro bakery and had moved the family up to dutchess county hed bought what he said was an antiques business but which turned out to beto the young twins delighta junkyard theyd finished high school bobby just barely though he was captain of the rifle team billy with a b average when their father died they inherited the familys limegreen splitlevel and the junkyard which they renamed after themselves robert and william theyd promised each other that theyd only marry another set of twinswhich didnt make room for a lot of matrimonial material in dutchess countyso their social life was pretty limited they had a few other business dealings that took them to new york every couple of weeks and they were always glad to hightail it back to their house which happened to be in the first tract of land that wex ambler had ever developed in cleary it was a nice house big and filled with the things they loveddark still life paintings of dead birds and rabbits prints of leaping fish carved wooden statues of horses and bears a franklin mint model car collection the twin leather recliners sears best were aimed right at a huge stereo tv within arms reach of billys chair was a better microwave which was perfect for heating nachos and chili during jeopardy or the tonight show a perfect home for two boys on their own exactly what this dingy hotel was not billy expressed this sentiment as he stepped on a silverfish in the bathroom his brother shrugged we dont have much choice cant do this at home dont mean i have to like it here bobby shrugged in reluctant agreement then sat down on the bed and opened two beers the twins drained them billy turned the tv on grumbling that the remote was broken in five minutes there was a knock on the door billy opened it ned the boy from the pancake breakfast stood there in jeans a tshirt and a varsity football jacket ned hey how you doing come on in hey guys whats up nothing yet bobby laughed beating billy to the punch by a millisecond ned frowned not getting what seemed to be a joke kinda hot in here he said yeah a little funny weather hey totally fine place here totally ned looked around the twins exchanged wry glances as ned studied the brown and orange shag the laminated brown furniture the prints of flowers bolted to the wall looked like he was examining the grand ballroom of a fifth avenue hotel they cracked open more beers and turned on a rerun of the bill cosby show bobby said hes stupid in this one cosby i mean he just mugs for the camera and counts his money i liked him better in i spy that was some real acting i never saw it the boy said on before your time these two cia guys white guy he was robert cummings gulp billy corrected robert gulp right and bill cosby man it was a good program they knew some real shit karate course this shows got lisa bonet bobby pointed out billy called hey ned would you get a hardon kissing lisa bonet i get a hardon looking at lisa bonet hot as hell in here billy said he took off his shirt and wiped sweat from his face with it underneath he wore a sleeveless tshirt hey ned youre one strong dude see if you can turn the heat down the boy pulled off his red and white jacket and dropped it on the bed he wrestled with the radiator knob for five minutes until he was crimsonfaced from the effort damn its frozen aw forget it bobby said well just sweat he unbuttoned his shirt to his navelno tee underneathand flapped it to cool himself the twins dropped into the rooms two chairs ned started to sit on the floor but billy said naw take the place of honor he nodded at the bed and ned flopped onto the spongy mattress bobby handed him another beer they watched tv for a half hour bobby said hey you want to try something ned said i guess i dont know bobby pulled an envelope out of his pocket a small manilla envelope he rattled it surprise whats that the boy asked he opened the envelope and showed the contents to the boy the hells that inside were two dozen bits that looked like rock candy its sweet bobby said billy gently shook the envelope until three or four spilled into the boys hand he lifted them and smelled dont smell like much yep were gonna eat fucking candy sure why not billy and bobby each took one the boy lifted his palm to his lips but they touched his wrist billy on the right bobby on the left uhuh just one at a time huh just one the boy dropped the others back into the envelope then lifted the single crystal to his mouth he ate it slowly it is sweet its he stopped speaking his eyes went wide then suddenly his lids drooped man he whispered this is totally fresh man he brushed at his ears as if they were clogged a dumb grin on his face what the fuck is this his words faded into a giggle man excellent they knew what was happeninghow the soft cotton was expanding into the crevices of his mind the warmth the coming feeling starting at the fingertips and flowing along the skin like a woman laying slowly slowly down on your body dissolving into a warm liquid flowing melting you happy bobby asked the boy giggled man he opened his mouth and inhaled as if he were tasting air billy caught his brothers eye and a slight nod passed between them bobby closed up the envelope and slipped it into the boys jeans pocket where his hand lingered for a long moment the third on his list the r w trading post on route which the pokerplaying boys had been kind enough to suggest to him was the one the time was am and a faded sign promised the place was open pellam parked the camper in the small lot and walked back along the shoulder which was gravelly and strewn with flattened bud cans and cello wrappers from junk food occasional cars and pickups zipped past and he felt the snap of their slipstream the trading post stretched away behind a gray broken stockade fence which was decorated with some of the artifacts that were waiting to be traded a rusted mobil gas sign a blackface jockey hitching post a cracked wagon wheel a whiskey aging barrel an antique wheelbarrow a dozen hubcaps a bent plow a greasy treadle sewing machine mechanism if r w had put the premier items here in the window pellam wasnt too eager to see what lay behind the fence but that didnt interest him anyway what had caught his attention was what rested at the far end of the lot where the chainlink gate opened onto the secrets of the trading post the rental car responsible for martys death there was a small shack in front of the fence it leaned to the left at a serious angle like a dogpatch residence when pellam knocked no one answered he strolled over to the jetsam of the car the wreck was scary the way bad ones always areseeing the best detroit can do no longer glossy and hard but twisted with stretch marks deep in the steel the front half was pretty much intact but in the back the paint was all blistered or missing and it was filled with black melted plastic pellam could see the gas tank had blown up the metal had bent outward like foil inside of the car nothing remained of the seats except springs and one or two black tufts of upholstery sour as burnt hair then he found the holes at first he wasnt surethere were so many perforations in the car parts where the metal had burned clean through dents and triangular wounds where shrapnel from the tank had fired outward but crouching down studying the metal he found two holes that were rounder than the others about a third of an inch in diameter just the size of a or bulletwhich wasnt to say that some hunters or kids hadnt left the holes there after they found the wreck pellam himself had spent a number of lovely clandestine afternoons playing bonnie and clyde with his fathers colt automatic and an abandoned chevy pickup but still help you pellam rose slowly and turned the man was in his thirties rounding in the belly wearing overalls and a cowboy hat he had a moonish face and weird bangs howdy pellam offered to yourself the man said grinning his hands were slick with grease and he wiped them ineffectually with a wad of paper towels this your place yep im the r of r w robert well bobby i go by got a lot of interesting stuff here bobby yep used to be all armynavy but surplus aint what it used to be that a fact pellam said you dont get the deals you used to my daddy owned the place before us hed buy some allright from uncle sam compasses jeep parts tires clothes world war two you know bayonets garands ms originals im talking im talking creosote and oil paper the mans eyes strayed to the wreck i got a better set of wheels youre interested nope just happened to notice it i bought it from a garage over in cleary a hundred bucks therell be something under the hood im thinking i can salvage then sell er to somebody for scrap could clear three hundred but if youre not after a vehicle what would you be looking for just sightseeing youre not from around here bobby said but your you know accent sounds familiar born over in simmons only about fifty miles away got a cousin lives there the man walked back toward the shack you need any help just holler i dont mark prices on nothing too much trouble but you see something you take a liking to well work something out ill listen to any reasonable offer keep that in mind you price stuff too high bobby explained people just arent going to buy it never make money unless you make a sale good philosophy this time it was the sheriff himself pellam hadnt even set foot on the asphalt of main street before the man was next to him he smelled of old spice or some kind of drugstore aftershave unlike the deputies he was tall and thin like a hickory limb he wasnt wearing any coolhand luke law enforcer sunglasses either how you doing today sir sir again he was wearing that smile that indescribable smile the whole constabulary seemed to have like moonies pellam stepped out of the camper and answered not bad how bout yourself getting by hectic this time of year crazy all these people come looking at colored leaves i dont get it myself im thinking maybe we should open a travel agency here take tours of people into manhattan to look at all the concrete and spotlights pellam grinned back names tom sherman they shook hands guess you know me pellam said yessir i do youre back in town now pellam pointed out i heard you were away some personal business how you feeling sir after your little accident stiff is all wanted to let you know we probably wouldnt be inclined to cite mrs torrens for anything unless you were thinking of filing a complaint pellam was shaking his head no shes taken care of the medical bills im not looking to make a profit well i think thats fair sir you dont see much of that i was reading in time about people suing people over all sorts of things this womani saw this on tvsixty minutes maybe i dont recall this woman what she did was she opened this package of cereal and there was a dead mouse inside and she sued the company and got i dont know a half million dollars she didnt eat it or anything she just looked at it she said she had dreams about mice for a year that a crock or what uhhuh say sheriff theres something i wanted to talk to you about whats that i saw the car my friend was in your friend oh rightthe car got itself blowed up there were two bullet holes in it bullet holes not one strand of lean muscle in his cheek changed position i doubt that sir ive hunted since i was twelve pellam said we went over it real careful and we didnt find any sign of nothing atall two pellam said by the gas tank his face still didnt budge oh you mean in the back those the holes in the back about three four feet apart pellam said believe they were the sheriff nodded firemen what when they got there the car was still on fire and the trunk was closed they used this pike i dont exactly know what it is a big rod kind of thing with a hook on it to pop the trunk they do that with a burning car open it up as much as they can they got a lot of good equipment always using the jaws of life to cut people out of wrecks oh whered you happen to run across this car sir saw it out by the highway at the junkyard a mile outside of town the sheriff looked down at his feet shoes expertly polished with more vaseline uh one of the things i was looking for you fori wanted to mention it might not be such a good idea you doing what youre doing here pellam said what would that be you know i get the feeling that you dont like the fact your friend got himself killed doing drugs and youre trying to show something else happened investigation was pretty fast pardon the coroners inquest your investigation all happened pretty fast the impassive sunglassless face nodding slowly maybe youd be used to city police work we dont have a thousand homicides a year in cleary sir we get a crime or an accident and we take care of it quick i appreciate that but i doubt my friend was doing drugs mr pellam we dont have an evidence room like you see on tv you know but we have this file cabinet and sitting inside it right now is a foil package with what must be a couple ounces of hashish now i but let me finish sir i was in nam ive done some smoking in my day and i should add ive got no axe to grind with movie people or with you or your friend we found the dope we found a lighter we found a brush fire you yourself can see where the evidence points ive never heard of a car getting blown up because somebody was smoking nearby well you think about that negro comedian a few years ago set himself on fire marty wouldnt be freebasing coke in a state park at noon a faint smile oh then when would he be pellam leaned forward he spotted a cautious flicker in the sheriffs eyes listen sheriff let me line it up for you and you tell me what you think okay my campers vandalized with threatening messages then my friend dies in a pretty curious way and in fortyeight hours the place where it happened is dug over the car gets sold to a junkyard and the man who rented the car to him goes off to miami clearwater fred sillman goes to clearwater every year i dont honestly give a shit what his leisure schedule is my friend didnt die the way everybody keeps saying he did and if you arent going to find out what happened i am simple as that we did our job sir we found some facts about your friend that werent so nice im sorry about him and im sorry about your job but theres nothing to be gained by you staying in cleary you telling me to leave town of course not youre free to visit to sightsee hell you can even buy yourself a house herei understand you know a local real estate broker pretty goodall im saying is youre not free to be a policeman and if you start troubling people im going to have to get involved your concernsve been noted pellam tried to imitate the smile it didnt work too well he had better luck with have a good day sir wexell ambler was going to visit his lover he walked out of his housesupposedly on his way to a meetingand strode toward his big cadillac parked in the ushaped driveway he was looking forward to sitting with her in the jacuzzi in the glassenclosed deck of his house in nearby claverack new york from which they could watch the catskill mountains in the distancenow a stunning wash of color he could look forward to enjoying fresh coffee and tasting some of her cooking thinking about making slow love in the hot tub or in the large shaker bed hed bought for her because shed mentioned that she liked the simple lines she was a strange woman he often compared the two of them his exwife and his mistress and tried to decide what were the differences and what were the similarities they both were attractive dressed well knew how to carry on a conversation at the country club his wife was more intelligent but she was also less imaginative she had no spark no humor she let him get away with anything his lover challenged him perhaps he now reflected this made him feel younger uncertainty was a quality brought out by one of the first girls hed been in love with hed just gotten into the caddie when his housekeeper ran to the door and signaled to him with a wave its mark she called says its urgent ambler said have him call on the car phone he backed the car out of the driveway and waved to her affectionately once more waiting for the call he was thinking less about what the beefy young man would have to say and more about the woman he was on his way to see ambler was a religious man on the executive committee of the first presbyterian church and although he understood that calvinistic predestination did not absolve him from choosing the right path the moral path nonetheless the religion instilled in him a tendency toward helplessness on those moral questions the answers to which he did not like he tended to throw his hands up and follow his instinct so although he knew what he was doing was immoral he felt an addiction to his mistress and could more or less successfully conclude that he had no control over the matter he packaged the infidelity carefully though for instance he never thought of the word cheating which gave the whole matter a bluecollar taint and he always thought of his paramour as a mistress or lover rather than girlfriend or the woman he was seeing on the side dignity was important to wex ambler he never risked embarrassing his lover just to satisfy his own passion and went to crazy lengths to keep the affair secret the one problem thoughone he hadnt counted onwas that hed fallen completely in love with the woman ambler who was fiftytwo was not so old that he had forgotten love makes people stupidand in his philosophy as well as his profession stupidity was the numberone sin he had guarded against love but unlike religion and unlike money and unlike power love had a mind of its own it had nabbed him but good at his insistence their gettogethers had become more and more frequent and he now felt his center giving falling further toward her he was growing hungrier even desperatewhile she seemed increasingly aloof was there anything more foolish than a middleaged man in love and was there anyone who could care less about that foolishness ambler smelled leaf dust and warm air from the caddies heater and wished he were already at the cabin the phone buzzed the noise always disturbed him it reminded him of the alarm a hospital monitor would make when a patient went into cardiac arrest he snatched up the light receiver yes i talked to tom mark said yes and the guys turning into some kind of private eye ambler concentrated on driving the roads were narrow and wound in tricky meanderings past horse and dairy farms he had a tendency to wander onto the shoulder if he didnt think about his driving he asked mark what do you mean there was a pause and he heard mark spit a young man chewing tobaccoit was stupid maybe he did it to darken his moustache mark continued hes been asking a lot of questions about his friend and the car he was down to r w the junkyard right looking at the wreck of the car ambler felt the car bobble as the right front tire dipped noisily off the asphalt damn he forced the car back onto the road overcompensating it slipped over the broken yellow line before he got it steady again mark asked what should we do i was thinking maybe we could offer him some money you know bribe him to leave then hed think i had something to do with the accident not necessarily when ambler didnt answer mark said but maybe ambler said ive got an idea i dont want to talk about it on the phone come see me now ill be busy for a while ill call you they hung up and it took ambler the rest of the drive to the cabin to shake off his concern at marks news in fact it wasnt until he turned into the leafpacked driveway and saw his lovers car sitting obliquely in the turnaround of the cabin that his spirits lifted he climbed out of the caddie eager and buoyant as a seventeenyearold en route to a homecoming date the cleary volunteer fire department had a long history of proud firefighting and a photo gallery to prove it dozens of faded pictures of handpump horsedrawn wagons even a few of bucket brigades were scattered on the walls of the tiny officeas if the company had had a matthew brady protégé on staff to record every major fire before after and including the big one of the firemen seemed to have been arranged by the photographer and pellam wondered if theyd actually stopped working momentarily smoothed their pushbroom or handlebar mustaches and posed for the leisurely exposures afternoon said the man sitting at the desk rocking back in a metal chair he was in his early thirties wearing a black tshirt over good muscles blue jeans a new york mets cap how you doing not bad silence pellam looked through a glass window at a big yellow seagrave fire truck got some nice equipment there town dont scrimp ill say that you all volunteer huh yep theres pay for one man on duty to take calls twentyfour hours he must get pretty tired the man snagged the joke right away and fired back with but makes a hell of a lot of overtime pellam said im the one with the movie company i know you mind if i ask you a few questions nosir you on duty when that car blew up the one in the park that your friends car pellam said thats right i answered that call yessir all of us did you tell me what happened you mean what caused it whatever you can tell me the man said there was most of it in the coroners report this isnt official or anything like that im just curious he was a good friend yessir i understand the fireman squinted up at the spotless redenameled tin ceiling i recall the back end of the car was burning pretty good when we got there somebodyd driven past and called it in you know who nope i think it was a call from a pay phone anonymous you showed up and then what happened no hydrants course so we had to use the tank on the truck to get things cooled off enough to get close to your friend then half the crew started on the brush fire with extinguishers and shovels that was about it we got the body away from the wreck and finally got the fire out he died right away it was pretty quick the gas tank had blown up yessir you opened the trunk we popped it open thats right how do you do that usually we just pop out the cylinder then reach in and flip the release bar but the steeld been pushed outward so what we did was whack it a couple times with a pike that jarred the bar and popped it open whyd you open the trunk the sheriff wanted us to to see what was inside anyway its standard procedure in case theres cans of gas or oil also your sparell burn for hours you dont douse it good you find anything interesting sir you said the sheriff wanted to look inside i dont know i was at the hood you have one of those pikes handy he wasnt yet uncomfortable under this questioning but he was growing warier theyre mounted on the truck sir were not really supposed to let civilians into the house you know pellam nodded he looked at the truck through a greasy window the pikes looked blunt and heavy it didnt seem theyd leave holes as small as the ones hed seen in the car whatre they made out of steel of course one last question why was the area dozed over sheriff ordered it somebody called him up and told him to i heard i dont know why you dont know who called do you sure dont pellam thanked him then said arent you going to ask me ask you what sir whether were going to be making a movie here the man shrugged dont make a lick of difference to me sir i work in feed and grain not movies at noon meg torrens walked out the door of the dutchess county realty office set the hands of the be back at clock at she looked around the square pellams winnebago camper was parked opposite she looked up and down the street then crossed over and circled the camper taking in the tan and brown paint the battered fenders the mud stains the chips in the windshield what the hell was she doing here going shopping on my lunch hour thats all and when was the last time my dear you bought anything in one of these ripoff antique stores three four years ago wasnt it she imagined herself in one of the campers on location she imagined what it was like to be in a movie the modeling shed done had been pure effortexhausting and shed been treated like a dimwitted cocker spaniel making a movie would have to be different she believed she caressed the metal skin of the camper noticed the faint remains of some graffiti on the side it looked like two crosses meg slung her leather bag over her shoulder and strolled up and down the street looking at sights shed walked past for years and never noticed a cornerstone dated in late september could that have been black thursday a painted wooden barrel on the sidewalk emblazoned with the number in red paint one building was topped with a weathervane in the shape of a whalewhy here a hundred fifty miles from the ocean another was decorated with a beautiful round stainedglass window meg was gazing into the window of steptoe antiques when she heard slow footsteps a voice asked her could use seconds on the brownies meg turned looking blank at first the way shed rehearsed in case this happened she said shouldve eaten them while you had the chance cowboy pellam stepped next to her to look at what she was examining howre the driving lessons coming bout the same as your photo classes meg pointed to a tattered rug hanging on the wall in the window see that price tag looks like it says sixty wrong thats six hundred theyll sell it for that too whats that supposed to be on there a dog meg looked at it closely could be maybe a cat i dont know dinner was nice he said i enjoyed it she lifted an eyebrow i did too shed chosen the pronoun carefully your house is beautiful that was the first dinner id had in a house i mean a real house in over a year no kidding she said though she wasnt surprised sams done nothing but talk about you you better make good on that promise pellam said the practice bombs i havent forgotten they walked past another real estate office pellam looked at some of the listings megs voice dropped a half octave ive got some wonderful properties mr pellam owner financing is available they laughed eyes were on them cars slowed as they passed meg thought go to hell but the defiance was shaky she felt vulnerable like the time she found herself at a florida resort wearing a new bikini that turned out to be more seethrough than she was comfortable with as she did then she now crossed her arms over her chest i guess i better get going she said pellam touched her arm she froze then stepped back casually he said id like to ask you a question in confidence her thoughts raced but she just nodded slowly he asked there any reason why somebody might not want a movie made in cleary we say no to drugs beg pardon theres some talk that there might be bad influences if your company came to town okay granted ive heard that before but let me be a little blunter there any reason why somebody might kill my friend to keep a movie from being made here meg turned to him her mouth open in shock youre serious arent you she turned back to the window that was a stupid thing to say sure youre serious this is off the record sure she said okay marty did have some pot except it was in the camper along with the rolling papers whats that rolling papers cigarette papers oh right so it wasnt in the car with him when it blew up somebody planted those drugs on him she shook her head but noncommittally as if he were a lawyer taking down her reactions then i looked over the car a little while ago you did and i found two bullet holes in it bullet holes i think so near the gas tank i think thats what happened somebody shot the tank it exploded and then they planted the drugs and left before the fire truck got there at first she thought this was impossiblein cleary but then she remembered the darker side of the town the murders of those businessmen the occasional rapes two high school boys had driven into a tree at eighty miles an hourthey were both stoned on heroin of all things he continued i was hoping i could talk to keith maybe theres a test he could do on the metal see if they were bullet holes meg said why dont you talk to tom didnt he investigate then she understood i see you think hes involved in some way do you the sheriff i just want to keep it lowkey nodding she opened her purse and handed him one of keiths business cards well sure give him a call he liked you across the square she saw a couple staring at them the woman leaned toward the man there was an extended whisper going on meg felt the burst of discomfort again life in a small town ive lived here for five years pellam but it feels like ten lunch he asked she hesitated yes no yes no she said uh i dont think so why not dont do a dont she said because this is cleary he nodded and said got it good luck pellam she walked to the coffee shop uhm one thing all im interested in is lunch nothing more or less than that meg lifted her hands and dropped them to her sides with faint slaps you maybe have the most honorable intentions in the world she paused and for a millisecond tried to read his face for his reaction to this she couldnt tell she added but clearys still cleary suppose that doesnt change not in your life or mine she said and walked into the diner the screen door snapped shut with a wooden slam m t pharmaceutical was a onestory cinder block square outside of cleary prefab it was surrounded by a gravel parking lot in which sat thirty or forty carsa lot of old ones torinos and novas as well as newer japanese imports and pellam noticed pickup trucks galoremany of them with back windows smeared from the noses of excited hunting dogs near the main entrance were several marked parking places mr torrens was the first beside it was an empty space with a sign that had been painted over it was probably the spot reserved for keiths late partner this had been la pellam thought cynically that space would have been appropriated five minutes after the funeral it was late afternoon dusky and just as he eased the winnebago into two of the visitors slots a sodium vapor light on a pole in the middle of the parking lot came on he walked past the company sign a swirling design of an m and a t backlit a young receptionist hair shooting up in a frothy tease smiled and shoved the juicy fruit into the corner of her cheek hello darla pellam said reading the name off her goldplate necklace help you sir john pellam to see keith torrens yessir have a seat pellam sat and thumbed through a pristine copy of chemical week in three minutes a grinning keith torrens walked into the reception area john they shook hands good to see you thanks for taking the time come on ill give you the fast tour factories generally depressed pellamthe regimentation the way machines dictated where people stood and what they did reflecting some kind of fear he decided that if it all fell apart hed end up on an assembly line somewhere twisting sheet metal screws into whirlpools for the rest of his life m t though was a surprise it was bright and clean filled with spotless white tile brilliantly lit the workers wore white jackets pants and shoes and transparent bluish hats like shower caps it looked like a kitchen many of the people were bent over conveyor belts checking machinery packing cartons reading computer screens the machinery was stainless steel and white quite an operation keith said im a small guy to compete with the pfizers and bristol meyerssquibbs youve got to be efficient thats the key word light brown cardboard cartons rose to the ceiling on small elevators and moved along a conveyor overhead until they vanished into the shipping department keith was so excited to show off his company that he talked very quickly that speed together with the loud pulse from a dozen different kinds of machines made it impossible for pellam to catch more than a few phrases still he smiled and nodded enthusiastically they finished the tour and ended up outside keiths office its small but were proud of it pellam said ill buy your cough syrup next time i get the flu ill give you enough samples to last for two years he vanished into a corridor five minutes laterthroat lozenges cough syrup nasal spray stuffed in pellams jacket pocketsthey walked into keiths office a large sparse room done in cheap paneling keith seemed like the sort whod sink most of his money into the factory itself pellam shut the door and said softly id like to ask you a favor meg said there was something on your mind id appreciate if youd keep this off the record surely pellam said its about my friend the one who was killed that car accident im not sure it was an accident no i found the wreck and i noticed what looked like two bullet holes in the back the sheriff said they were caused by the fire department but i checked out their equipment and i dont think thats it bullet holes keith was frowning pellam shrugged i was wondering if there was any way somebody could look at a hole and see if it was definitely made by a bullet someone like you keith said possibly what do the holes look like the ones i saw were about a third of an inch so that would mean theyre about thirty caliber keith said deer round so it might be copper jacketed could be sure keith was looking up at the ceiling any chance you could find the bullets in the car lets assume they disappeared got you he nodded knowingly then reflected the car burned right right if keith began slowly they were just lead bullets the odds are that any residue would have been burned away lead oxidizes at a very low temperature copper though thats a different story it has a real high vaporization point and going through sheet steel in a car yeah id guess enough would have come off in the holes to find traces now next question id be happy to i wasnt going to ask you to go to the trouble isnt there something you can show me to look for after about four years of inorganic chemistry sure but why dont we just spend a half hour right now ill take some samples and we can have it back here in the lab in no time well run it through the chromatograph and spectrometer wheres the car out at a small junkyard on route r w yeah thats it keith frowned i thought it wouldve been impounded or something see why im a little curious about whats going on the camper followed by keiths cougar pulled into the r w parking lot much of which was piled high with twisted copper piping the pudgy man pellam had spoken to yesterdaybobby he recalledstood looking at it like a proud father his hands on his ample hips he wore bib overalls and a seersucker hat like a train engineers pellam and keith climbed out walked up to him keith said hey hey mr torrens how you doing not bad hows business lookit this bobby said proudly keith nodded pellam examined the tangle of pipe not bad no shittin he laughed at the obvious statement three men staring down at ten cubic yards of pipe nodding impressed the way men always are at good finds pellam glanced along the front of the fence toward the charred wreck it was lit by bare incandescent bulbs in mechanics handheld light baskets with an odd formality bobby stuck out his hand how you doing sir youre that movie guy right pellam blinked thats right were here about what i was asking you before the car car i was talking to you about that wreck he nodded toward the remains the man frowned dont believe so no pellam glanced at him we were talking about that car down there the wreck the man lifted his hat and greasy bangs dropped onto his forehead dont recall that oh i get it pellam sighed reaching for his pocket he found a bill and was starting to pull it out when the man said bobby what you were talking to my brother bobby im billy oh the w in r w got it keith laughed billy and bobbyre twins billy said but dont let that stop you he accepted the twenty you mind if we take a look at the wreck if youre in the market for a car billy said shrugging i can do bettern that but help yourself he turned back to his precious pipe they walked toward the burntout car pellam whispered to keith twins you do horror films for your company ill bet you could get em pretty cheap they walked around the wreck pellam stopped suddenly its gone keith blinked and leaned forward someone had used an acetylene torch to cut off the trunk and rear portions of the fenders pellam called excuse me billy tore himself away from his pipe yessir he wandered slowly to the wreck pellam said what happened to the metal here the back portions whatsat billy called look here keith said shit its gone billy said i got the gist of that pellam said shit the twin put his hands on his hips and looked around like he was searching for a dropped quarter keith said bobby start to cut her up naw hes not into like heavy work damn now whod come by and steal half a burnt car keith and pellam walked back to their vehicles im sorry wild goose chase keith said its pretty funny though you go out to look at the car and find what looks like evidence next thing you come back and that parts gone yeah funny billy stood in the shack waving goodbye to keith torrens and the movie man he picked up the phone and punched in a number bobby answered on the first ring he must have known it was billy because he just picked up the phone and said so what is it now hey guess who was just here lessee elviss ghost singing love me tender naw billy said but wish it was thatd be a fuck of a lot better for you and me are you all right wexell amblers lover didnt answer him after a moment he gripped her buttocks tighter and dug his nails which were long for a mans into her flesh she whimpered he remembered to relax his grip somewhat does it hurt he asked does it wex oh hurt she whimpered again and pressed her forehead against his pulsing neck when theyd begun seeing each other it had been awkward several problems first neither had ever had an affair before and they didnt know what you did and didnt do surely affairs had special protocolshow do you make dates do you even call them dates do you shop at different grocery stores to avoid chance meetings when youre with your spouse or is it better to see each other casually like that and avoid arousing suspicion second there was a funny type of jealousy at work he accepted that his lover was married but he was occasionally stung by the thought that shed learned a certain techniquea touch or kissfrom her husband third neither of them was twentyfive any longer ambler had worked in the building trades when he was young and still hunted and fishedthe history of physical effort had helped slow the inevitable effects of gravity and sedentary life but there was no denying that muscle was giving way to fat that erections that used to last an hour began to fade after fifteen minutes and that hed be no good for twentyfour hours after he came his hair was thin though in some slight compensation not too gray and hed developed a jowl that he kept poking at as hed pass the large oval mirror in his dining room until his wife commented on it and he immediately stopped the habit oddly though his lover who was more than ten years younger than he was had been even more selfconscious than ambler her body could easily pass for a thirtyyearolds yet she always shut the lights out and drew the shades before she undressed but despite these worries they had quickly fallen into a comfortable pattern and they soon found themselves making good sweaty love for the first time in years today in the dark tangywoodscented bedroom ambler pinned her to the stark oak bed and pressed into herhard hard almost cruelly he wasnt sure why he knew he had a reputation for being a cruel man in business and at other times but he would never think of being cruel to anyone he loved but as he felt himself coming closer to the moment he wanted to hurt his mistress he wanted her to admit she was in pain but that she didnt want him to stop does it hurt love yeah she whispered her mouth saying the hot word against his skin a centimeter from his ear she gasped twice then whispered something he couldnt hear then she said dont stop no dont stop i like it the words were lyrical grunts he smelled the aroma of her perfume and sweat you like it dont stop to hurt oh wex afterwards they lay together unlike when ambler had made love with his wife he and his lover often began to talk immediately right after they had caught their breath today though he kissed her forehead whispered darling and then they lay with their own thoughts for five minutes half dozing hes still here i heard ambler said casually who that man from the movie company i heard what do you suppose he wants taking time off after his accident i suppose ambler asked they arent going to make the movie here after all why dont you like him why do you say i dont like him but ambler didnt say that he said look what happened with the drugs and everything wasnt his fault movie people are just like everybody else she countered youre glad hes staying arent you wex whats this all about drugs and she said you take it on your shoulders to be the moral protector of the town and you scare all these people into thinking that the big bad world is going to gobble them up alive that made him nervous he considered no there was no way she could know about what mark had done she wouldnt be here if she suspected that he said you give me more credit than i deserve you bully people as if i could bully the whole town of cleary after a moment he said did you talk to him about a job no would you i considered it i thought he scoffed you thought youd be lana turner im wasted here my life is wasted i should you should what he asked edging back toward desperation nothing youre lifes not wasted at all i feel like im just drifting how can you say that youve made my life something wonderful the lines fell like a lead sinker she squeezed his shoulder but he was glad for the darkness his face burned with embarrassment he asked have you ever thought about moving a pause ive thought about it youd just leave without talking to me about it dont put words in my mouth i didnt say that ive got a lot of possibilities some of them involve me some of them dont i see wex there was a bony edge to her voice ambler didnt believe hed heard this sound before he wondered if they were going to have their first serious argument that would be very badin light of what he was planning to tell her she continued dont disrupt things between us i mean is something wrong no nothings wrong what do you mean this was sounding like the conversations he used to have with his wife before he fell out of love with her he backed off you just seem i dont know she said we were just having a discussion dont take it personally youre the one who seems to be picking a fight i am not after a moment he felt her stiffen and draw away from him only millimetersbut it was enough so that he refused to do what he instinctively wanted to and touch her leg in a chaste way seeking forgiveness for his vague crimes the day wasnt going as hed planned not at all he wished they hadnt made love it tilted the balance of power against him men and women never changes he felt a shudder of pain and anger course through him there was silence for a long moment he debated then wiped his sweating palm on the sheet can i ask you something she didnt answer ambler said weve been seeing each other now for what six months she said a neutral about that i was thinking im not good at this the same way he hadnt been very good at asking her out the first time he recalled she softened he knew that she had a weakness for chivalrous struggling men what are you trying to say wex at least the terrible edge was gone from her voice his mind went blank then he blurted i think we should get married he wanted to be light about it he wanted to joke like middleaged couples on sitcoms snappy comebacks rejoinders mugging for the camera he couldnt think of a single thing else to say and from her utter silence as if shed even stopped breathing it couldnt have been that shed never considered this before could it was he so far off base that hed completely misjudged his heart pounded he actually heard it her hand touched his arm we said wed never think about it that was before he looked futilely for some appropriate milestone in their relationshipthe twentyfifth time theyd had sex the twelfth candlelit dinner together the sixtieth time theyd laughed at a private joke she sat up and reached for the night table the light snapped on it was a low bulb which shed asked him to put in the lamp he knew she hated bright lights meg torrens pulled the comforter around her shoulders and said oh wex and in his name spoken through a loving gentle smile he heard the word no as clearly as if shed shouted it to sleep in a shallow grave big mountain studios ext road to bolts crossing near forestday ecu janices face it is not aged so much as weathered you can see in it the hampered beauty of a woman at forty an earth mother she was at woodstock she cried at woodstock and got stoned there the long hair falls across her face subdividing it into patches of ruddy skin she brushes it aside the wind pushes it back medium angle shep hes leaning against his motorcycle the lights should be gelled magenta to put an aura on the chrome harmonizing with the sunset thats approaching behind them hes torn hes told her hes leaving and he wants to go but also wants desperately to find something about her that will keep him from leaving is it pity or is it something more genuine more mutual he doesnt know pellam sat in his hot camperthough he was really in bolts crossing not cleary new york which was where he needed to be at the moment in bolts crossing there was no stinking hulk of a car punctuated with scorched tufts of upholstery shooting outward like patches of hair in bolts crossing the only people lying still in funeral parlors werent dead at all and in four scenes would be prowling around in flashbacks lusting and ornery and laughing in bolts crossing people like marty never died cut to medium angles crosscutting between janice and shep janice i took a chance you might be here shep avoiding her eyes brakes gave me some trouble thought i should fix them before i left janice i was thinking about what you said last night about me shep i was mad i janice you were right i keep looking for answers in the past if im not careful there wont be any future left pellam pulled the sheet out of the typewriter with a satisfying buzz of the platen he wrote insert a across the top and slipped it into the script which hed unfastened it was now just a stack of a hundred fifty sheets of wrinkled paper filled with his handwriting and interleaved with inserts like this one he put his hand on it then picked it up and riffled the pages feeling the thin breeze on his jaw he walked to the front of the camper and sat in the drivers seat looking out the grimy windshield now he wasnt seeing the cinematographers stunning dusk in bolts crossing but the winding country road that led into cleary the winnebagos engine turned right over he drove downtown parked and stepped out into the brilliant sun blinking his way along main street he found a stationery store that did photocopying he gave them the script and asked for a copy the polite acned teenage boy behind the counter told him the job would take about twenty minutes pellam offered to pay now but the boy said no sir no hurry want to make sure you like the job pellam hesitated then said sure remembering that he wasnt in los angeles or new york and that there was no reason to be suspicious of politeness he wandered out into the street blazing with its raw sunlight to get a cup of coffee he saw marges across the street but thinking of the day he and marty had gone there decided against it also he preferred to go someplace where he wasnt so well known he didnt want to be adored by the help he didnt want to talk about marty about parts in movies about hollywood he walked into a drugstore with its snaking turquoise lunch counter and chromeandred vinyl stools hey mr pellam from one of the clerksa middleaged man pellam had never seen so much for anonymity and for hostility too whatever the official opinion about drugs and movies the halfdozen people in the place all glanced at him with meaningful eyeinvolved smiles that said im not asking but if you want to haul me off to hollywood and put me in a sitcom episode of your choice go right ahead he nodded walked to the pay phone and tried to make a credit card call his company card number had been canceled he sighed and billed it to his personal card after five minutes the assistant producer came on the line the boy was in high spirits yo hombre you better hope lefty dont have a homing device set up cause he do theres a scoutseeking missile aimed for your crotch this minute he hasnt unfired me huh whoa boy you came real close to cratering that movie but i think its going to fly he bent over for one of the money cows and i guess it worked out okay shysters said martys accident was a force majeure so hes got another couple of weeks you got a

that halfassed script get it to bob and dont let lefty see my changes john bye no before he sat down at the lunch counter pellam noticed a rack of sunglasses his had met the same fate as his polaroid thanks to meg torrenss little toyota he decided to buy another pair he noticed some mirrored teardrop shapes he tried them on checked them out in the mirror he smiled perfect yep cool hand luke the middleaged man behind the counter said theyre you howd i look like a smalltown sheriff yessir you could man a speed trap any day with those take em pellam said you want the fake leather case thats okay he sat at the counter the clerk didnt seem much interested in a hollywood career and just talked to pellam about traveling of which hed done a great deal he told pellam how he and his wife had taken this years vacation in peru and chile the air is the thing you dont think about the altitude you know you walk a couple blockswell they dont really have blocks but you know what i meanand youve gotta lie down and take a nap its exhausting i mean i thought i was in good shape i can chop a couple cord of wood and no problem but i was beat and there are all these little old women steaming along like its nothing to them and trying to sell you pottery and these blankets and jewelry they see money and they run right at you they sprint in air like that its all what youre used to the man summarized everythings relative suppose so pellam said and listened to the history of machu picchu pellam checked his watch said ive got to pick up something we did the orinoco too but i didnt see one crocodile he grimaced lifes full of disappointments pellam stood and put his deputy glasses on no disappointment at all sally and mere going back in october well find one i promise you that pellam wished him luck pellam parked the camper in the driveway of the torrens house the word homestead came to mind meg stepped out onto the porch then smiled and jumped down the few steps to the walk that led to the driveway wiping her hands on a scallopy apron and looking just like a housewife out of a s sitcom a housewife however in a tight blue silk blouse the top two or was it three buttons undone eyes up boy my god shes got a freckled chest pellam just loved freckles on women what brings you here pellam came to borrow something she blinked to joke or not to joke butter churn naw bear grease for your muzzleloader she asked gotcha he smiled indulgently as a matter of fact pellam said youre talking to one of the only people in the state of new york thats fired a sharps and she didnt miss a beat a sharps forget about it boy thats a dropblock breechloader not a muzzleloader got me she laughed hard at his jolted expression girls usually melt at gun talk huh he said nobody in the goddamn world except me and bornagain gun nuts know about sharps anymore i never fired one but my daddy had one he collected guns ive got myself a springfield breechloader in the den no he laughed a fortyfive seventy she nodded carbine with a saddle ring and everything damn what a woman you ever fire it what goods a gun unless you fire it but try getting the black powder smell out of your silk undies not a problem i have sam and i take it out to the range sometime hard to find ammo of course thats what i wanted to borrow ammunition your son the bomb expedition she nodded yep it okay meg said you ever known any parent to mind when somebody says hell take your child off your hands for a few hours she called sam then turned back to pellam oh before i forget the apple festival is saturday afternoon you interested in seeing it i guess youll be there its a family thing what was that supposed to mean youll be there its a family thing he waited a second for more messages when he got none he said sure look forward to it sam appeared hey mr pellam we gonna look at bombs you bet sam all right can we go in the camper thats the only wheels i got can i mom sure just be back by six for dinner mr pellam these are the greatest they got red ones and green ones and they got mortar shells that dad says they dont have powder in them anymore and hand grenades do not under any circumstances buy him anything pellam laughed yes maam they got into the camper hey sam you know one thingd be fun what mr pellam why dont you bring your metal detector along my metal detector i have this collection pellam said and whenever im in a new town i like to add to it i collect dinosaurs and baseball cards and prowrestling cards of course sam jumped down out of the winnebago and ran into the house energy where do they get it he was back in two minutes you need batteries nope theyre recharged i used nicads what do you collect mr pellam coins he said bullet casings sam said wow as it turned out pellam liked the bombs as much as sam did this particular junkyard was a lot classier than r w he remembered it from the poker boys list it sold mostly what the name promised army surplus which seemed to be in pretty good supply despite what bobby or billy had said vehicle parts cartridge boxes portable latrines tools tents flashlights all solid olivedrab functional a lot of things that you couldnt use for much other than paperweights bombsights and old altimeters and doughboy helmets that wouldnt even make good planters but the bombs yeah they were great all different colors different shapes some pointed like rockets some rounded like oldtime airplane bombs jesus they were huge pellam cautiously tapped one hollow sam said theyre just practice bombs you dont have to worry i wasnt worried pellam said quickly you looked like you were afraid it was going to go off ha ha sam showed him mortar shells concussion grenades and bayonets meanlooking things with deep blood grooves up the side most of them were still wrapped in sticky creosote despite what meg had told him he wanted to buy the kid a bomb they were only fifty bucks then he admitted he really wanted one for himself one of the deep blue ones he wanted to mount it on the front of the winnebago nowhat he really wanted was to buy one and mail it cod to alan lefkowitz co big mountain studios santa monica boulevard century city california then sam decided it was time to look for bullet casings they climbed back into the camper and drove ten minutes out of town parked and started hiking they walked through the woods following what was a pretty clearly marked trail the boy had a box over his shoulder and carried a short metal rod with a disk attached he had a headset around his neck they were by themselves the day was very quiet sam kept looking up at pellam as if he expected him to say something brilliant you think youre going to find bullets here you never know like from hunters right you hunt mr pellam yep havent for a while my father and i used to go out all the time wheres he live pellam glanced at him he died few years ago like grandpa wold thats your mothers name wold unhuh shes got a gun my mom grandpa gave it to her its an old one mom and me shoot it sometimes down by the river wow it makes this totally loud noise really loud and it knocked me over nearly he set down the metal detector and illustrated shooting the gun and falling backwards he lay on the ground still pellam looked down at him alarmed hey you okay are you all right sure he jumped up my dad doesnt hunt much we go fishing sometimes whatd you hunt pheasant duck geese sam asked you like football i used to play yeah i knew it where pro ill bet he laughed loud pro im about a hundred pounds light for that naw just in high school quarterback right receiver i figured it was better to get jumped by one or two big guys instead of four or five whats it like to score a td running over the line i like the way you know how they run over the line and then drop the ball like its nothing to them thats so neat whats it like i didnt score that many i wasnt that good sure you were the boy countered ill bet you saved the team when was that a couple years ago more like twenty sam rolled his eyes holy cow youre older than my mom you dont look old pellam laughed hed forgotten how completely kids nuked your careful adult delusions hey mr pellam can we like practice passing sometime my mom tries but shes a girl and all you know maybe you and me could practice you could give me some tips my dad well hes busy a lot of the time all he cares about is his job pellam knew enough not to get into that one he said well see my momd like it if you stayed around for a while she likes you i can tell or into that one either they came to a ridge that overlooked the parking lot where marty had died the lot was about two hundred yards away there was only one other high point that pellam could see that had a view of the lot and that one was five hundred yards not an impossible shot with a good scope but this would be the more likely spot for a sniper also this faced the rear of the parking lot and if marty had parked head in would offer the cars gas tank as a target still itd be a bitch of a shot in any kind of breeze and on a warm dayas that day had beenheat waves from the valley beneath would have blurred the line of sight okay sam go to work find me what you can the boy wandered back and forth for ten minutes retrieving two mashed coors cans and a quarter its yours son suddenly he shrieked and ran up to pellam with a long rifle cartridge in his hand nope too small im looking for centerfire you know the difference no sir firing pin hits a on the rim of the shell so theyre called rimfire bigger calibers hit the percussion cap in the center theyre called centerfire wow thats neat come here ill show you sam frowned then his eyes went wide as pellam opened his jacket and pulled a gun from his waistband it was an colt steel with dark rosewood grips wow the boy whispered pellam kept the gun pointed at the ground always pretend a gun is loaded even if you know it isnt and always pretend that it could go off at any minute so you never point it at anything unless youre prepared to shoot it got it i got it thats a cowboy gun its a colt peacemaker a he opened the thumb cover and with the ejector rod eased the shell out he held the end up for the boy to see there thats the cap in the center the pin on the hammer hits the cap and that sets off the powder the oldtime guns like this use black powder like the one your mothers got newer guns use smokeless can you take me shooting mr pellam please lets talk to your parents about it maybe shoot something will you not now sam its not a toy he put the gun back in his waistband lets find me my cartridges with even more enthusiasm the boy swept the detector over the ground pellam wasnt paying much attention to him he was looking at the dark patch of plowedover earth in the distance the parking lot where martyd died a horrible death he didnt notice the boy stoop down and pick up something then come racing over to him look what i found mr pellam look sam dropped the two cartridges into his hand they were caliber though the length was odd stubbier than a or bigger than a garand they couldnt have been from a carbine like an m because a shortbarreled rifle wouldnt have been accurate enough for a shot of this range good job sam he patted the beaming boy on his shoulders just what im looking for he dropped the cartridges into his pocket you show me your collection some day mr pellam you bet sam time to get home aw together they walked down the mountain swapping fishing stories that night sam upstairs and keith still at the company meg torrens ate a turkey sandwich with cold cranberry sauce and drank a glass of white wine reading the headlines and the first paragraphs of all the stories in the new york times she heard the clicks and tiny pops of the hundredyearold house the muffled roar of the furnace coming onsomething reassuring about the way its simple brain kicked the machinery on and coursed hot water through the pipes it would shut off and thered be moments of complete muffled silence she finished the arts section dropped the paper and walked upstairs to sams room hi mommy she walked to his computer tell me again you dial then what do you say meg looked at the computer aw mom sam said he was tired it was nearly nine its a modem nobody says anything you just get a tone that means youre online show me in the master bedroom the clock radio played a sad country western tune an old patsy cline song sam bent over the keyboard and typed rapidly meg and keith spent thirty dollars a month for access to a current events database which sam had learned contained a sports submenu theyd ended up with huge overages one month when hed printed out the starting lineups of every baseball team since he picked up the phone dialed his mouth twisted with exasperation though meg knew he was tickled to show off this esoteric knowledge a squeal came from the phone he held it toward her like a ray gun zap zap zap and pressed a button on a small box the computer screen came to life youre online mom what do you want to look up a name i want to look up a mans name she typed in some characters the response come back in five seconds meg scrolled through the text how do i print it you either do a screen dump or download the whole file where did they learn this stuff just tell me what to push here sam happily hit a button and the raspy matrix printer began its satisfying sound reminded her of the polaroid bzzzt the sound lasted for some time there was a lot to print apples a thousand apples a hundred thousand a million pellamd never seen so many apples in his life and in so many forms apple pies fritters turnovers apple butter jelly pickled apples and candied apples you could dunk for them you could buy them fresh by the bushels buy them dried and painted and glued together into wreaths and wall hangings shaped like geese and pigs there were girls dressed up like apples all the boys seemed to have round rouge cheeks a woman tried to sell him a chance to win a dutch apple pie by tossing a ring onto a board with apples nailed onto it i dont really care for apples he told her the football field was filled with more than a thousand people milling through the booths playing the games and examining the junk for salesweaters wooden trinket boxes clocks made from driftwood ceramic macrame janine had a jewelry booth pellam had homed in on it right away waited until she was busy making a sale and did the obligatory appearance all she had time to say was dinner tomorrow remember he nodded at four dont you forget lover boy she winked and blew him a kiss pellam estimated half the crowd was tourists half was locals no one older than seventeen seemed exactly sure why they were there the tourists were catching the tail of some indigenous upstate experiencethe country the countryand holding on for a while buying vases jewelry decorations food to take back to their manhattan apartments the cleary moms and dads were gossiping and doing some serious eating the kids of course were the only ones really enjoying themselves because for them it was nothing more than tons of apples and who needed more than that on a nice fall day no more roids hed left the camera in the camper now he was just another tourist scoping out the leaves the booths the scenery the toyota showed up five minutes later racing through the parking lot and skidding to a stop on the crumbling asphalt meg saw him right away and waved keith wasnt with her but sam was the boy waved energetically he wondered if sam had said anything about pellams tendency to collect lethal weapons like the other night at dinner she looked ten years younger than the upstate matron whod visited him in the clinic her hair wasnt teased and stiff but was tied back in a ponytail she wore tight jeans and a dark paisley highnecked blouse under a suede jacket a silver antique pin was at her throat the boy stayed close hi mr pellam howdy sam hello meg said to pellam he nodded in reply they were suddenly enveloped in a large crowd of izodshirted manhattanites the men with curly dark hair the women in black stretch pants everybody had great forearms and calves courtesy of the new york health and racquet club the gang passed and they found themselves alone you made it meg said wouldnt miss this for the world here meg called a present she pitched him an apple he caught it lefthanded i hate apples he said sam grinned so do i cleary still a small town pellam smiled she frowned he asked wont they talk we walk around like this they circled on the fringes of the festival let em meg said im feeling rebellious today phooey sam was running sorties to the booths but always circling back to study pellam with casual awe then hed be off again hooking up with some buddies from school conspiring looking amazed and devious and overjoyedand always on the move energetic arent they pellam watched an impromptu race meg said theres nothing like children for perspective what they teach you about yourself is the best somebody said that the most honest and the most deceitful the crudest and the kindest of all people are children she laughed of course thats only half true when youre talking about your own kids you think about it there are very few good movies about children pellam said sentiment mostly or revisionismdirectors trying to patch up their own childhood on celluloid or trying to put adult values on kids shoulders cheap shots you ask me id like to see a movie about the ambivalence of being a child that would be a good project why dont you suggest it to your studio former studio he thought and didnt answer meg jogged away quickly to keep sam from climbing a fence pellam found himself in front of a turkey shoot booth where you could win stuffed birds chocolate turkeys and a fifteenpound frozen one by plinking tiny sponge rubber duckspainted to look like turkeyswith a battered sears pump action pellam called sam over to him what do you want son one of those little stuffed turkeys or a candy one sam looked shyly at his mother who said tell mr pellam what youd like she looked up grinning this ive got to see i guess chocolate okay his eyes on pellam meg said if he can win it you can eat it but maybe not all at once pellam said it looks pretty big the booth attendant took a dollar from pellam who asked how many to win one of those chocolate turkeys the bigger one the man loaded the skinny gun six hits out of ten okay pellam leaned forward resting on the chesthigh bench and fired four shots slowly they all missed kicking up dust in the sandbag bullet trap sam laughed meg did too pellam slowly stood up straight think ive got the feel he quickly lifted the stock to his cheek six shotsfast short cracks as fast as he could work the slide six ducks flew off the board holy shit the booth man whispered then he blushed oh beg your pardon mrs torrens pellam handed the gun back and sam took the candy staring at him eyes wide wow what do you say sam holy the boy began slowly meg warned sam cow wow thanks mr pellam that was like totally fresh i mean totally meg said sam sam said mom thinks i dont speak english i know fresh pellam said he looked at the candy i hope that it is too sam peeled back the foil and bit off the birds head wow he said through a mouthful of chocolate and walked away looking back every fourth or fifth step another story was about to circulate they wandered on she said i thought all you knew was muzzleloaders i drive the la freeway you gotta know how to shoot whered you learn my father he said whered you grow up she asked simmons she turned to him no not just across the river she nodded west the very same its a lot like cleary little poorer little scruffier pellam said and we dont get the tourists for the leaves its mostly pine they walked in silence for a moment kicking through the tall grass at the edge of the football field keith couldnt make it hell be coming by later hes at his company it was good of him to help me the other day he said somebodyd stolen what you were looking for yep we got outflanked they walked for a few minutes then as if pellam had asked about her husband meg said keiths changed when his partner died it affected him he got an edge to him really i didnt sense anything like that i wasnt sure hed help you he doesnt like things that are out of his own you know orbit im glad he did they were being examineddozens of heads turned conspicuously away while eyes followed them after five minutes of looking at booths he said why did you leave manhattan keith got a job with a drug company up here i wasnt getting modeling work and just couldnt break into acting i had a baby i always wanted a house and you like cleary she gave a nervous laugh and looked away its tough for me to give you an answer and it wont matter if i live here for another twentyfive years ill never know the place well enough to talk about it these places towns like this theyre born into you the roots go way back you come any other way youre just a houseguest you may be the life of the party you may even get yourself elected to the town council but places like cleary dont become part of you its in the genes or it isnt its not in mine applause not far away a new miss apple had been crowned pellam saw a couple of kids gravitating toward him and meg word was out that the location scout could shoot out a sponge ducks eye at fifty feet the boys kept their distance as meg and pellam circled the field the ripe rich scent of decomposing grass came to them your hair looks nice that way her fingers reached toward her ponytail then she stopped the acknowledgment and lowered her hand her eyes fled from his and she concentrated on something on the horizon they walked to the festivals zooa sad collection of cows goats geese ducks and a ponybefore she said is that why you and your wife broke up uh whys that sorry i was just thinking about you traveling around there were a lot of reasons sure the job had a lot to do with it you were away from home six months eight months i didnt travel as much then id love to travel she said maybe do some acting not be a star necessarily character acting maybe id even like your job even your job just a location scout i dont think you would she said well i love my house i wouldnt give that up but seeing all those new placesits like going on vacation but having a purpose i think thatd be wonderful women said that my house never our house he remembered his wife saying just those words of course in the end that was how it worked out it did become her house selffulfilling prophecy he guessed i guess what id want is sam to come with me for maybe a week or two at a time after a moment she said keith too of course she looked at him but he gave no reaction to the lapse if a lapse it had been pellam steered away from the domestic situation he said i cant really tell you why i like it the thing about scouting is its not the work itselffinding a spot thatll work for the film i mean thats fine thats what they pay me for but i like the being on the road he waved his arm simmons is what less than a hundred miles from here i grew up with colored leaves and victorian houses but i was real glad to get that call and hit the road scout for towns like this he waved to sam it seemed his fan club had grown to a half dozen one march he continued id been sitting home for a month i got a call from a producer who wanted me to scout for a labour union film i got in the camper and headed right out to the steel mills in gary indiana ugly cold gray walking through slush that place was as close to hell as any id ever been but i was so glad to get that call she wrinkled her nose id only go to fun places rio san francisco hawaii he laughed you wouldnt get many jobs no but id have a hell of a good time on the ones i got they have beer around here probably but dont you want some cider they make it fresh no i want a beer i hate apples remember then i guess an apple festival doesnt have a lot for you i wouldnt say that meg ignored the flirt and they steered toward the food concession as his mother and mr pellam were walking through the farmyard zoo sam ran off toward a bow and arrow shoot he thought about returning to the rifle shoot and winning something for mr pellam but he remembered seeing the bow and arrow gamewhere you shot at paper targets of deer one of the prizes was a small plastic football and because mr pellam had played in school thats what sam decided he was going to win he gave the man a dollar for ten arrows and the hawker gave him a smaller bow a straight pull not one of the pulleyed hunting bows sam took it and notched an arrow the way hed done at camp he went into position and pulled the string back his muscles were quivering and his fingers let go quickly before hed sighted properly he hit the deer in the rump hey the voice called laughing got him in the ass sam turned it was one of the boys from high school a senior he thought he believed his name was ned he was smiling but sam followed the grade schoolers general rule that every high school boy was a potential terrorist theyd take your lunch away from you tie your keds together and swing them like gauchos bolos over electric wires swear and spit on you use you for a sparring partner sam swallowed and ignored him he concentrated fiercely on the target the way his mother had taught him when he shotnot paying attention to the bow or arrow but to where the arrow should strike he drew the bowstring back and fought the agony in his thin arms as he stared at his target finally he released the arrow thwack a heart shot fucking good the boy was saying shaking his head sam looked at him cautiously ned wasnt being sarcastic thanks two more heart shots a gut shot and then his strength started to go the next four hit the bale of hay but missed the deer the last shot was another gut shot okay you won yourself anything from the bottom shelf son what do you want sam hesitated the kid was going to take his football away from him hed just grab it and run he muttered one of those footballs okay there you go sam took the green plastic ball he started to walk away quickly but the boy was making no moves toward him he just said that was some good shooting i wish i could shoot like that sam laughed involuntarily here was a kid who was like seventeen telling sam he couldnt shoot bow and arrow as good as him totally weird its not hard youve just gotta you know practice whats your name sam im ned he stuck his hand out no high school kid ever shook hands with grade school kids sam reached out tentatively and shook hey you wanta see something ned asked like what sam didnt feel uncomfortable anymore the boy could have grabbed the football and pushed him down any time but no he was just smiling and seemed to want to talk something neat i guess sam said glancing toward where his mother and mr pellam were walking slowly the same way his mother and father walked the boy walked off into a thick woods off the side of the football field whats here sam asked youll see about thirty feet inside the woods was a small clearing the boy sat down he patted the ground next to him sam sat lets see the ball sam handed it to him thats all right he tossed it in his hand feels good im going to give it to mr pellam hes the man with the movie company yeah i heard about that totally excellent making a film here the boy handed the ball back to him here you go there was silence for a moment ned said i like it here its kind of secret sam looked around and thought it looked like a clearing in a forest yeah its okay you got ten bucks ned whispered naw said sam who did in fact have eleven dollars and some change in his jeans pocket how much you got a couple dollars i dont know why you wanta buy some candy candy ten bucks for candy its special candy youll like it i thought i saw you had ten bucks when you paid the guy at the arrow shoot sam looked away from the older boy and squeezed the football well that like wasnt mine it was my moms ned nodded ill give you a sample then see if you dont want to buy one he opened a yellow envelope and shook a dozen cubes of crystal candy into his hand he held his palm out to sam who looked at the tiny bits cautiously ned laughed at his wariness and put a candy in his own mouth come on dont be a wuss i dont really ned frowned youre not a pussy are you sam suddenly grabbed most of the candies and slipped them into his mouth chewing them down no ned shouted in horror you stupid shit you werent supposed to eat em all theyre ten dollars each i didnt mean sam backed away in fear his mouth was filled with a powerful numbing sweetness i didnt know you didnttellme he suddenly felt warm and giddy and dizzy in his mouth was a funny aftertaste reminded him of the chewable vitamins he took in the morning ned stepped close to him reaching for sams collar the young boy cowered away feeling the heat and the dizziness flow over his body sam it was his mothers voice and from not very far away then he was being lifted up ned had him by the shirt you dumb little prick you tell anybody about this ill find you ill come get you and ill beat the living shit out of you you got that sam thought he should be afraid but he felt so good he laughed you hear me laughing again he felt himself falling into the leaves which seemed suddenly like the ground in the candyland game he played with his babysitter until he outgrew it cotton candy grass marshmallow rocks candyland hey just like the candy hed eaten he thought that thought made him laugh too he felt like laughing forever he felt so good strange thumping noises he looked up ned was running running fast deep into the forest sam thought he saw the boy turn into a tree he stared at the spot for a long time he tried to stand laughing fireworks black sparklers cascades and roman candles pouring their fire all over him a huge roaring hum in his ears warmth and humming music sam his mothers voice was both magnified a thousand times and very distant like she was trapped in an airlock on the starship enterprise then the fun started to leave he felt he was going to sleep only it was a funny kind of sleep like the way he felt when hed had his tonsils out and woke up in terrible pain and so thirsty he thought hed die hed been lonely when he awoke in the hospital and he cried for what seemed like forever until he saw his mother asleep across the room thats who he wanted now mommy he called sam managed to struggle to his feet he walked forward a few steps mommy help me a mans voice called sam mr pellams and that reminded him of the football he turned back into the black explosions the heat the cracking fireworks the hum and stumbled into the clearing where he bent down to pick up the football he was certain he had it but as he reached forward his hand came up with nothing more than leaves he fell to the ground then he saw nothing more a huge wave of black filled his vision but he kept patting the ground around him for the football he had to find it hed won it for mr pellam her face scared him it wasnt just that shed been crying which changed the density and texture of her skin and gave her the contours of a battered wife it was more the fluttering of the irises of her eyes unable to alight what pellam saw in meg torrenss face was panic he just stood there beside her not knowing what to say or whether he should touch her in a brotherly way thinking he should be taking charge but with no idea of what needed to be done meg sat with her legs spread outward boot tips pointed at an oblique angle her body forward elbows resting on her thighs her hands washing each other absently in invisible water occasionally shed glance up and pellam would smile in a way that screenwriters would describe as sympathetically concerned theyd waited for twenty minutes keith arrived and as soon as he did pellam felt himself relax he realized hed been standing hunched forward jaw tight he watched the couple embrace keith nodded to him what the hell happened husband asked wife meg brushed aside her hair which had come undone from the ponytail and was strewn across her face we found him she said and started sobbing again pellam said sam passed out and we couldnt revive him the doctors been in there since we got here he hasnt said anything oh keith he was so pale it was terrible with an anger they knew was not directed toward them keith asked what happened did he fall is it a seizure meg wiped her face we just found him keith it was so horrible he was just lying there it was like he didnt have any muscles i tried to wake him up he wouldnt wake up she looked at pellam with her trapped animal eyes staring at him but undoubtedly seeing the horrific image of her sons pale skin against the autumn leaves he wouldnt wake up keith looked like he wanted to hurt someone it didnt seem to matter to him whether thisd been caused by another human being or an animal or some haywire connections in the boys bloodstream he wanted revenge meg pressed her cheek against her husbands chest and didnt say anything slowly she calmed the doctor who resembled a vet the one whod tended pellam appeared and walked slowly down the corridor the man had such an expressive face that no words were necessary there was no doubt about the boys condition pellam remembered the way the man looked at him when hed entered the room to tell him about martys death this was no tragedy the doctors round jowly face zeroed in on megs eyes and he said hell be okay meg began crying again quieter but more desperately can i see him sure meg in just a second keiths anger vanished at once as if he were afraid prolonged hate might reverse the results what happened to him was it a seizure keith i need to ask this does sam have any history of drug use drug use the laugh was explosive meg let go of her husband and turned to face the doctor hes ten years old how could he drug use keith repeated as if he hadnt heard correctly what did she began the doctor said he overdosed on drugs with a blustery edge in her voice meg said no not sam oh give me a fucking break keith growled are you nuts the doctor continued its true keith it looks like it was an opiate of some kind probably heroin keith exploded are you saying he was shooting up thats the craziest fucking thing meg touched her husbands arm he calmed im sorry but you made a mistake im as disturbed about this as you are the doctor lifted a small plastic envelope out of his pocket inside were tiny fragments of crystals these were in his mouth its extremely soluble which means he ingested much more than this all three stared at the bag its a dextrose basesugarbut its mixed with something else i dont know what exactly a synthetic heroin of some kind stronger than percodan ive never seen anything like it somebody put heroin in candy and gave it to my son keith whispered he looked at meg and said almost accusingly who was he with did you see anybody werent you watching him pellam bristled felt defensive for meg we were both with the boy hed run off every once in a while but we for gods sake keith we were at the apple festival i wasnt letting him wander around in the south bronx he blinked im sorry i just she took his hand the doctor said ive called tom i had to whatever this is its a controlled substance and ive got to report it fucking right youre going to report it keith growled but i dont want a story in the leader i dont want it to sound like he was doing drugs i wont say anything to the paper but thiss serious keith i dont knowtom may want to bring somebody from albany in in a faint voice meg said please let me see my son come on the doctor said he glanced at pellam then down at the leg where the bruise resided how you doing sir he asked pleasantly but without particular interest fine the doctor put his arm around meg and led her down the corridor keith said excuse me to pellam and followed pellam sat down in an aluminumandorangenaugahyde chair and looked at a monthold people magazine without reading a single word or seeing a single picture an hour later sam walked unsteadily out of the room meg had her arm around him and keith was trying to sound cheerful while he recited phrases like youre doing great skipper and youre a tougher man than i sam would blink and look at his father as if he were speaking a foreign language hi mr pellam sam said his face brightened a little but there was hardly any color in it how you feeling son i got sick youll be fine in the morning i dont feel too good well get better soon weve got to practice our football remember yeah meg sam and pellam stood together silently while keith paid the bill with a check and took a prescription and instruction sheet from the doctor the door opened and the sheriff walked into the clinic meg i just heard tom she said nodding toward him the sheriff looked stonily at pellam for a long moment then glanced down at sam how you doing young man pretty okay sir attaboy the doctor joined them along with keith meg told the sheriff about finding her son in the woods and the doctor explained about the drugs what is it you know im sending the sample to a lab in poughkeepsie ill get you a copy of it i think its a heroin derivative the sheriff winced yeah guess ill have to go to the nybi second time weve had an overdose the doctor pointed out that boy last year tom nodded he was in high school theyre getting younger the sheriff looked down at sam then said to keith you mind if i talk to him just for a minute meg asked her son you mind honey uhuh maybe just you me and the boy tom asked her pellam and keith took their cues and stepped outside the sheriff crouched next to a jaundiced potted bamboo palm vainly reaching for a tiny greasy window in the front door the only source of natural light in the waiting room meg was struggling to stay calm struggling to concentrate all she wanted to do was throw her arms around the boy the sheriff looked into the boys eyes what happened sam you remember i found this envelope and there was some candy inside i ate it you ate it a bunch of it i guess i shouldntve moms pretty mad at me meg said no im not honey tom said shes just worried about you thats all so you dont know where the envelope came from no sir youre sure nobody gave it to you no sir i mean yeah im sure nobody gave it to me you just found it uhhuh you know what happened to the envelope no im going to ask you a question sammie and i want you to answer it truthfully sure you know mr pellam sure did he give you the candy meg stiffened when she heard this this hadnt even occurred to her she started to speak but the sheriff waved her quiet you mean that he won what he won a chocolate turkey and gave it to me when was that just before i got sick it was a game meg said a booth at the fair the sheriff ignored her did he give you the candy in the envelope sam shook his head no sir you found it right sam swallowed yeah it was just lying there i found it okay sammie you go home now and get some rest so he gave the boy some candy the sheriff said meg frowned repeated from the turkey shoot booth chocolate not that crap look sam claims he found the envelope but hes lying i can see all right not lying exactly hes confused you know kids meg come on what im saying is i know somebody gave him those pills and he knows who it is meg asked you think it was pellam kind of a coincidence wouldnt you say his friends doing drugs and gets himself killed then your son overdoses he asked was sam alone with pellam today she didnt answer at first no any other time they may have been together alone she swallowed and shook her head i want to be with my son sure meg outside pellam watched the two of them push out the door and head toward keiths car meg hugged sam lets get you home into bed i dont feel good pellam stepped forward crouched down and took the boy by the shoulders when youre better young man you and ire going to meg took her sons hand firmly in hers and practically pushed the boy into the cougar pellam stared at her she wouldnt look back meg didnt say anything as she walked to her car and started it keith got in the cougar put sams seat belt on him both cars pulled out of the parking lot keiths red mercury and megs gray toyota she didnt even look at him pellam stared after the import for several minutes finally there was nothing left to see but a residue of haze above the asphalt in the cars wake it was only then that he realized that while he was looking at the spot where megs car had disappeared the sheriff sitting in his glossy pristine squad car had been staring at him he walked over to the man i drove here in megs car from the fairgrounds my campers back there you give me a lift sorry sir im heading the opposite direction sure pellam said watching his blackandwhite pull dramatically out of the parking lot slinging gravel behind it thanks anyway sir bobby sat inside the cabin at the junkyard and read a national geographic he looked at the stain in the margin and wondered what it was grape jelly maybe blood beef juice r w was fat with national geographics stacks and stacks of them going moldy yellow and green his brother didnt understand why bobby continued to buy the old ones something about that magazine people thought you shouldnt throw them out like doing that was somehow unpatriotic so what they did was bundle them up and take them to antique stores or tag sales or junkyards like r w and sell them all organized by year or decade didnt matter if they made money on them the point was a part of america got preserved and besides where else but in articles about africa or the amazon could a twelveyearold boy get a look at tits and not run the chance of getting whipped today bobby was reading about portland which seemed like a great place to live he closed the magazine and tossed it against the wall of the shack true they were starting to smell hed have to get out the lysol spray he heard the car door slam bobby knew right away even before the door to the shack opened that there was trouble this was something about twins at least something about billy and him a telepathy thing so now when his brother opened the door and walked through it bobby was staring right into his eyes frowning with an expression that matched billys almost identically he said so so our ass is in deep shit billy muttered what torrenss kid got some of the pills almost odd fuck that little blond kid bobby glanced in a perfunctory way toward the backroom of the shack where several cartons of their special candy were stacked howd he get it then he knew the message from his brother coming through loud and clear he nodded grimly the pretty boy ned the other day your playmate bobby said our playmate just cause i saw him first dont go blaming me whyd he give them away whyd you give him so many in the first place damn ill ream that boys ass bobby gave a splinter of a smile you already done that but his brother wasnt in any mood to joke this isnt funny bobby was nodding slowly the torrens kid he muttered they know it was us they did dont you think wedve heard by now what if ned said something to the kid about where he got it could be a problemo billy said absently too bad the kid didnt take em all and just you know die wouldve been better so theyve got some of the stuff i mean yeah billy explained ouch its at the clinic theyre going to be shipping it somewhere to find out what it is fuck bobby said thats bad man thats bad whatre we gonna do and billy looked at his brother as if hed just asked the most dumbass question in the world well if you think real hard maybe a couple thingsll come to mind he didnt have to wait very long before they did hello the voice of wex amblers housekeeper answering the phone meg didnt know the woman shed seen her several times since she and ambler had begun their affaironce coming out of the brick and whitetrim first presbyterian church on maple street but meg hadnt actually heard her voice before this moment she sounded older than ambler is mr ambler there please meg who had never typed a letter for anyone other than herself or keith in her life tried to sound like a kelly girl just a minute please who shall i says calling this shed thought about dutchess county realty one minute hello wex a moment later she was listening to her lover say with a tortured formality yes meg how are you i wasnt expecting to hear from you there was a pause at the end of his sentences she knew that ambler liked phrases of affection and it would be natural for him to add a darling or dear under the circumstances of course hed have to watch himself carefully to avoid these ambler had reluctantly agreed to megs demand that not a single soul in town know about their affair meg asked is it safe to talk then she regretted the idiocy of the question ambler ignored it what can i do for you there was an accident somebody gave sam some drugs there was a pause is he all right hell be okay but i cant make it today of course i understand what kind of drugs heroin it looked like are you sure his voice sounded flatlined as if he hadnt even heard her thats what the doctor said where did he get it meg hesitated i have no idea he claims he found it will he be okay the doctor said he would he spoke again slowly im sorry i wish i could have been there she said yes that would have been good static growing on the line she guessed he was on a cordless phone and had moved into a den or outside he spoke more freely when can i see you i then he stopped talking andhis housekeeper undoubtedly approachingsaid those prices are a little high i want to talk to you she said therere some things we should talk about she was thankful ambler wasnt alone and wasnt free to ask the questions that she didnt want to answer right now certainly not over the phone she heard the frustration in his voice i understand its a mutual situation day after tomorrow probably have you thought any more about my proposition of the other day i dont want to talk about that now im sorry its just ill look forward to seeing you day after tomorrow meg found she was answering as if keith were in the room which he was not those would be acceptable terms she hung up how you feeling skipper keith asked his son pretty good dad but sams voice was weak and he was huddled in his bathrobe and blanket on his bed heartbreaking the way he was lying so small and fragile the computers fan whirred softly the screen was blank except for the c prompt waiting for instructions keith thought about shutting it off but didnt he figured sam had left it on for whatever comfort the sound of the machinery might provide keith sat on the edge of the bed and tucked the blankets around the boy hows the stomach i liked the ice cream it didnt make me feel icky keith nodded and remembered to look the boy in the eyes meg had once told him that he looked away from people too much hed explained to her that his mind wandered he couldnt help it shed told him that was no excuse when you had children you had to give them a hundred and fifty percent of yourself there was a lot he wanted to say about how he knew he wasnt as attentive as he ought to be how he didnt like sports the way most of sams friends fathers did how he kept putting off vacations about how if he hadnt been working today this probably wouldnt have happened but he thought that talk like that now would just upset the boy make him think that the incident with the drugs was worse than it was he told himself that he simply would make it up to the boy not after the expansion at the factory was completed not after the first of the year not after the coldseason rush but soon very soon im sorry about what happened daddy we dont blame you sam i was like pretty stupid sam keith leaned forward it is very very important that you tell me where you got those pills the candy right the candy i know you didnt just find it tears had started and the little boy was shaking keith put his hand on sams shoulder and squeezed it dont worry i wont let anything else happen to you he said hed beat me up i wont let anyone beat you up i promise you tell me a kid from the high school who i dont know his last name his first names ned i think hes a senior what does he look like he was like sort of tall like a football player oh daddy sam bolted forward into keiths arms they hugged for a few minutes keith stood up you want me to leave the light on uhhuh is it okay keith mussed sams hair ill be up later and look in on you okay goodnight son the fire at the clinic wasnt too bad nowhere near the excitement of the great fire of only one of clearys trucks was needed and the men got the blaze under control with fire extinguishers which was a big letdown because of all the hours theyd spent at hose drill brush fires and burning toastersthat was all they ever got and at the clinic they didnt even get to use an axe like a lot of buildings in cleary the clinic was left open even when the allnight nurse went out for coffee oras in this caseto buy batteries for her walkman most of the carnage was confined to the office a lot of patient records were destroyed as was all the outgoing mail and a number of envelopes bound for the testing lab in albany the gushing water had caused the most damage the first chief a lean chiseledfaced man who ran an insurance agency in town and took both jobs equally seriously went through the office slowly he didnt really need to though it didnt take any length of time or great forensic skill to make the discovery he put his find into a hefty trash bag the cleary fire department wasnt entrusted with evidence bags and then went to his car to call the sheriff on his cb he had trouble getting through and went back inside to call him on the phone which was partly melted but still working as he stood at the charred desk and waited for tom to come on the line he stared at what hed found for some reason the fire had not completely consumed the incendiary device he knew from the label that the bottle at one time had held taylor new york state sparkling wine and from the smell that it had more recently held gasoline he knew too from research and continuing educationnever having encountered a fire bomb before that cloth was standard procedure for fuses but this one was different he held it up close the fire chief was pretty much a humorless man but as the sheriff came on the line with a lo the chief was laughing thinking they must be dealing with some pretty literate arsonists who elsed use pages from a national geographic to light a molotov cocktail mark said mayor hank moorhouse after hearing him out its no crime for the man to wander around and take pictures if it werent for assholes taking pictures of the leaves wed be a much poorer town you know that it was suppertime succulent smellsroasts and fatty potatoesfloated through the moorhouses victorian home the sound of utensils and muffled voices came from another part of the house the heavyset and damnscary young man moving a pile of chewing tobacco around inside his cheek said this guy is dangerous you heard about meg torrenss kid he got his hands on some dope no i didnt hear about that sam moorhouses eyes flicked down to the blond moustache then up again the word is he got it from pellam a couple guys saw em together mark moved the chaw around his mouth moorhouses nostrils dilated at the smell of dinner he wanted this over with and fast but mark worked for wexell ambler and ambler held the first and second mortgages on moorhouses sixbedroom colonial and was an assemblyman on the town council he said that somvabitch he tore off a piece of scotch tape wadded it up and started chewing hed tried to stop the habit but thought now bettern tobacco theres more mark dropped a packet of white powder down onto the desk whats that what do you think it is moorhouse stared at the package as if it were from the melted core at chernobyl i saw him drop it mark said pellam moorhouse leaned forward carefully he didnt want to touch the plastic we dont get much of this stuff around here christ i worry about my boys he nodded toward the dining room drinking beer they tell me theyve never tried pot and i believe em but this what exactly is it mark cocaine huh speed i think and its illegal mark scoffed illegal a class a controlled substance what do you suppose its worth whats the what do they say on the news whats the street value youre asking me mark said his voice high with surprise what difference does it make cant arrest someone just cause you saw him drop it though when moorhouse thought about this he wasnt so sure maybe you could he wondered where you could look that up cleary had a town attorney mark smiled amiably and leaned toward moorhouse in a way that he thought of as doing what he did best then well have to think a little harder moorhouses eyes kept circling in on the packet like a mosquito over flesh i dont know the brown envelope hit the desk with a slap moorhouse jumped hesitated a moment then picked it up he glanced up at mark who said theres three thousand dollars in there moorhouse thumbed through the bills take your word for it whered it come from lets say a bunch of folk took up a collection we dont think this guy should be here any longer movie aint gonna be made here no reason for him to hang around so whats this for moorhouse asked before he realized he shouldnt be asking a magistrates fee you could call it his eyes darted from the money to the white packet he slipped the envelope in his desk and poked the powder soft as baby talcum with the end of his cross pen he had three shots of wild turkeytrying to convince himself that he was celebratingand lay back in the camper listening to willy nelson sing crazy pellam had this theory that made for a very optimistic life you kept considering the worst that could happen to you and then when it didnt whatever did happen wasnt so bad who couldnt be cheerful with that kind of philosophy so close to drunk pellam told himself that the worst had happened a hed gotten fired from a job he needed and b that was the one job in the worldoutside of being independently wealthythat he was temperamentally suited for c the rumor would already be burning up sunset boulevard that he was personally responsible for cratering a damn fine movie d he still hadnt found the man whod killed his friend and e the woman he was spending a lot of time thinking about was mad at him for some reason he couldnt for the life of him figure out this would be meg not janine or oh trudie too late to call her today he would tomorrow he heard the car pull up he hoped it would be meg though he knew it wasnt itd be janine pellam knew what had happened the old man was balling his current old lady under a daglo hendrix poster and somebody got stood up come on janine please baby free love give peace a chance up against the wall pellam was whisky giddy almost happy the worst had happened he was immune and here was a big horsy warm woman to bed down with the worst he swung open the door had already happened the dirt and stones caught him square in the face before he got his hands halfway up to cover his eyes he went blind he inhaled a good bit of cleary debris and started choking there were two of them and one was big a bear he grabbed pellams shirt and pulled him easily out of the camper he stumbled and off balance went down on his knees got dragged a few feet his eyes were burning he was coughing loud and spitting out the bitter dirt come on asshole stand up a brisk voice whispered arms slid under his chest the bear tugged him up pellam uncoiled his legs the top of his head collided with jaw shit motherfucker cut my tongue shit shit shit pellam kicked out at the other a smaller guy who easily sidestepped the boot what hed donethe lunging upwas just a reaction but he knew it was a mistake guys like this local tough guys you dont play with you just stay as clear away as you can rolling and dodging until you get a good crack you dont sting them you hit them hard once or twice really hard try to break their head make them think youre going to kill them theyll leave cussing you out and making it sound like youre not worth the trouble what happened was theyd come to have fun and pellam had just pissed them off now they were mad the bear punched him hard on the first offered targethis shoulder which didnt hurt much but then he got him in a full nelson pressed pellams chin down to his chest pellam was tallerso the bear couldnt lift him off the ground but the huge man kept him immobile the other one came in for some low gut swings right into the muscles which knocked his wind out and sent blasts of nausea up through his chest the bear said to no one my tongue bleeding shit i think it is goddamn that hurts pellam opened his eyes but couldnt see a thing through the mud and tears he gasped what do you want you want money the bear bent his head down further and the words got lost in a gurgle no what they want is to beat the living crap out of me the smaller one came in close aiming for pellams face but couldnt get his fist in because the bears fat elbows were in the way hey turn him loose for a second which is when pellam gasped shuddered and went completely limp shit what happened the bear relaxed his grip is he dead fuck whatd you do whatd i do i didnt do nothing i just pellam broke free felt his shirt rip down the back as the bear grabbed for it and swung a feint with his left fist at the smaller assailant who dodged to the side right into pellams sweeping right fist the snap of the mans nose cartilage was real satisfying the howl that accompanied it was even more delightful pellam turned to meet the bear but the big man was already on top of him he picked pellam up right off the ground so you want to play rough huh he asked i dont want to do anything i want the bear slammed him into the side of the camper something snapped but it sounded more like metal than bone pellam fell to the ground gasping then got to his knees the bear was battering him wildly connecting often enough so pellam couldnt stand the pain swirled through his body finally he gave up he lay still exhausted gasping enough okay in the distance was a siren lets get out of here the bear said oh god this hurts his partner offered he broke my nose he broke my fucking nose the bear whispered shut up will you pellam trying to breathe started to crawl under the camper he felt the big hands reach down and grab him by the ankle they pulled him back then reached into his pocket not his wallet pocket which he wouldve expected but his front shirt pocket why there it was empty the siren wailed closer pellam heard lets get the fuck outa here move it my nose man you didnt move it asshole he heard doors slam and the throaty crisp sound of a motor firing up a squeal of tires pellam spit blood and tried to catch his breath fucking odd he supposed it wasnt a robberythey left his wallet and watch ignored everything in the camper and only went through one pocket if theyd been here to deliver a getoutoftown message theyd had plenty of time to deliver it but hadnt he coughed and made it halfway to a sitting position lay back down the cop car skidded to a stop on the other side of the camper the siren shut off and he saw the strobe of colored lights on the trees his hand strayed to the pocket the bear had rummaged through he felt the present oh christ no he pulled out the little glassine envelope coke or speed a gram easy oh lord felony possession pellam stared at the packet through muddy eyes he heard their voices okay lets find him search everything around the clearing pellam started coughing again deeply as the cops rounded the camper he recognized the two deputies even though neither was wearing their trademark sunglasses well sir the deputy said looks like you had some more of that bad luck after all no dont go after the thugs stand there and bust my chops why dont you you all right sir the other one asked he helped pellam to his feet he was coughing choking water please some water sure no problem the first deputy stepped into the camper and came back with a cup of water pellam took it and swallowed the whole thing down breathing desperately his chest heaving like a nearly drowned man on land once again can you stand up sir pellam was frowning watching the other deputy going over the clearing with his flashlight inch by inch yeah i can good the deputy smiled because youre under arrest he glanced at his friend read him his rights and search him and you didnt find anything moorhouse asked the sheriff the mayor squinted against the brilliant sunlight streaming into his office early on sunday morning nothing my deputies searched like you told us but they didnt find anything youre sure no drugs all these movie people do drugs all the time moorhouse said which tom knew because he and the wife read people but he also knew theyd searched like a son of a bitch and found zip he was out when they found him nosir but he was down lying under the camper he couldnt have thrown anything far enough sos wed miss it we combed the ground and i mean combed moorhouse warily asked any idea who he was mixing it up with nope you want i can ask around moorhouse shook his head no pellam probably started the fight he motioned with his head toward the sheriffs department with its small lockup cant blame some local kid for getting tough with an asshole from the coast thinks he owns the place any evidence of the you know the gas bomb in the clinic nope had tove been him though youd think the sheriff said but uncertainly he kept looking at moorhouse curiously playing with the big hammer of his chromeplated the mayor grimaced now i got an envelope of lsd or pvc or whatever the hell it is out loose somewhere in town where was it what if some kid gets a hold of it christ what about pellam he asked the sheriff he okay seems to be brought him in last night blood all over him he went into the john at the station and puked his guts out i thought maybe we oughta get him to the hospital but the hospital that he tried to fucking burn down uh tom said noncommittally he seems okay now we better have a little talk with him moorhouse said bring him in handcuffed standing in front of this

upended from a night on a stiff pillow to be honest with you sir we arent inclined to keep you around here for any length of time ourselves sir sir sir the sheriff rocked on his thick heels a board creaked the light was painful as a dull razor pellams eyes were watering he waited moorhouse was trying to tell him something something he was supposed to be picking up on something that was not quite right for the town magistrate to be askingeven this town magistrate pellam sniffed and blinked the tears you got a cold sir that truckload of dirt i was mentioning ah moorhouse looked at the sheriff tom why dont you leave us be for a minute sure mayor the lean man pivoted on his heels and walked out of the room in as near to a march as a man could get without sousa playing in the background pellam your presence heres been whats the word disruptive no more disruptive than two assholes driving around town beating up people whore minding their own business ha there you go moorhouse shook his head did you know that the clinic near to burned down last night pellam blinked trying to make the connection how this figured in his case he asked what exactly you know what was destroyed in the fire oh interesting he said those drugs the torrens boy had yes sir moorhouse raising an eyebrow oh come on you charging me with arson too youve got no probable cause for that moorhouses other eyebrow joined the first and they seemed to be asking how come youre so familiar with words like probable cause how come sir mr pellam youre the kind of outside influence isnt good for our community outside influence might be just the ticket pellam said you being the inside influence moorhouse smiling sucked air in through his white teeth i may have to add contempt to your growing list of infractions you

clientsi want a trial tomorrow im calling my lawyer in manhattan and getting him up here today with a habeas corpus writ and you fuck around anymore with me and ill sue your ass for abuse of judicial

of two threehundred thousand moorhouse kept the false smile his face reddened and he faked a cough to swallow his eyes strayed to the phone pellam could see he was furious somebodyd put him in this tough position my my you are a touchy one ill tell you what you just leave our town and ill drop all the charges pellam said softly whats bail the smile twisted and became lopsided bail is set at five thousand dollars the door behind pellam squealed open a broad trapezoid of light fell into the room he hardly heard it he snapped how much where am i going to get that kind of money on sunday a womans voice said from me a checkll be okay wont it hank he frowned morning meg whatre you doing here she walked up to the desk a check she was already writing it out you dont have to pellam began she glanced at his face which mustve been in worse shape than hed thought since her eyes flashed wide for a second moorhouse was peeling a piece of tape off the dispenser and rolling it up he chewed on it absently meg this isnt a good idea she finished writing out the check pellam said to her how did you know she ignored him meg moorhouse tried again it really isnt a good idea meg dropped the check onto his desk a receipt id like a receipt he couldnt find one and had to write one out by hand on a yellow pad meg pushed through the door pellam frowning looked after her moorhouse spit the tape out of his mouth and said trial is set for monday morning i know a local lawyer you want pellam pushed his fists out toward the mans chest what i want is the cuffs off theyre a little disruptive pellam sat in the passenger seat as meg pushed the little car up through the gears and shot out of town he casually slipped the seatbelt and shoulder harness on he noticed the knob on the manual transmission gearshift was twisted and worn from heavy use the gear position symbol upside down as if to show him why she downshifted on a gentle curve and brought the speed back up to about seventy it was a forty zone over the roar of the engine he said thanks i meg shook her head he didnt know what she meant that she didnt want him to talk or that she couldnt hear him the tach was almost redlined pellam looked around the streets were empty the parking lot next to a church was full of small trucks and cars it was classic american religiona sweeping white steeple and red brick symmetrical unchallenging simple he wondered what denomination it was then decided it didnt really matter religion in cleary would be pretty much the same whatever church you happened to be in wheres sam sunday school wheres keith some errand then he was going to the factory oh they drove in silence to the house to her house in her car with her flinty eyes and taut mouth when they got there she left fourfoot skid marks in the gravel and climbed out slamming the thin door with a crash she walked up on the porch leaving pellam in the passenger seat she disappeared inside he sat she reappeared a minute later and said you coming inside or not well i guess i he said to her receding back the house was quiet a funny thing an old house like thishuge and warm with a woodysmelling heat coming up from parquet floorsbeing quiet a house that ought to have a dozen kids running around in it raising all kinds of hell adults doing their weekend tasks but it was still completely still he followed her into the kitchen she was setting up a mr coffee she put rolls in the oven he crossed his arms she didnt say anything he leaned against the counter he unfolded his arms and sat down he said i she slammed the coffee can down spun to face him ive only got one question you got me out of jail to ask me a question did sam get that shit from you he didnt answer she looked at him pellam stood up if you think that then im just going to walk back to your lockup thanks meg walked over to him and stood inches away i want you to say it i want you to tell me i didnt give him any drugs she turned away he said i thought you knew me i thought we knew each other better than that then she was digging in her purse pulling out sheets of paper he squinted his right eye blurred a renegade bit of dirt from the night before shifted he wiped tears then he was focusing on the sheets of paper the kind with the holes in the side shed printed something out of a computer pellam frowned and leaned forward so that was it he cleared his throat even here cleary new york population even here pellam said softly so you know meg pushed the printouts toward him they were dirty and well read honing in on his eyes she said i thought id heard your name when i was a model in new york i got interested in movies i used to buy some of the film magazines the highbrow ones i knew your name was familiar he lifted several of the articles glancing at newspaper headlines he could recite in his sleep pellams time out of mindla film critics top pick for independents new director pellam captures cannes sundance new york film festival must pellams sandras apartment then the others with words that often did come to him in his sleep film director indicted in drug death of star pellam trial revelation drugs flowed on set director associate indicted in stars od death death movie central standard time shelved as backers drop out he dropped them on the table he stood up better be going meg stepped between him and the door took his arm and held it hard no please i dont want you to go i was so scared about sam i was so hurt i didnt think they came from you but i couldnt help but think about these she touched the articles hesitantly she let go of his arm and pellam walked to the back window pulled aside the curtain he said i never sold anything the man who died was my friend tommy bernstein meg said he was a wonderful actor i saw a couple of the movies he was in they werent yours i dont think he never worked for me not until that last movie central standard time we were just friends best friends i guess youd say he laughed god that sounds strange adults saying theyre best friends he laughed hollowly well we werent very adult what happened i was directing indiesyou know independent films jarmusch seidelman that sort of thing i met tommy the first week he got to hollywood youre righthe was good but he got famous real fast too fasthe never grew a thick skin he got shook too easily and the only way he could work was high we wrote central standard togetherwe went out to the desert a couple times and spent the whole day writing just the two of us he was going to star his first serious film but the only way he could work was on coke he wanted a lot and i gave him a lot and more he did too much he had a heart attack and died he was thirtyone pellam looked at the refrigerator a construction paper airplane was stuck to the door with magnets printed on it love you mom it was so strange at first nothing happened nothing at all it was like the whole incident vanished i even got up and went to work trying to find a new star looking at rough cuts seeing what we could salvage then everything fell apart me included i couldnt work i just didnt care the financing backed out and i didnt have a completion bondstar insurance so i lost my savings and my house the equipment i did a year for manslaughter my assistant got suspended but it wasnt your fault yes it was i kept supplying him it was in the films budget under miscellaneous castrelated expenses was that when your wife left you he smiled no it was a little after meg said that was six years ago pellam you mean nobody would let you work i dont mean this bluntly but it wasnt the end of the world well its funny what qualifies for the end of the world a year in the qthats san quentin thats one way to define it believe me thats definitely a way to define the end of the world im sorry john she touched his arm this was a different touch softer closer his laugh was bitter hell there were publicists in lad shake my hand and say fucking great promotion ideayou kill the star isnt a newspaper in the country wont do a story about you he paused listening to the mumble of the coffee machine sure i probably could have gotten it together after i got out id lost a lot of contacts but that wasnt the problem the problem was i just didnt care i had no desire to direct any more so i got a job scouting locations i dont know what to say he walked away from her its temporary thingsll get better youve got to watch that she said what saying thatthings are only temporary your life could be over before you know it she said this knowingly i like scouting pellam said you dont think your campers just a place youre hiding out we all have places we hide out mine just happens to have wheels exactly what are you doing here pellam we arent going to get ourselves a movie here in cleary you arent real interested in colored leaves what do you want pellam reached into his sock and pulled out the clear packet of drugs that the bear had planted on him last night meg glanced at it several times her eyes flipping back and forth between the powder and his face whats that a gift to me i think from the same place sam got that stuff he took he explained to her about the attack the night before one of them planted it on me no why so moorhouse could throw the book at me and have more leverage to get me out of town he saw her shocked look oh the mayors not behind it someone else is who whoever didnt want the movie made here he looked at her whoevers behind those drugs that sam got whoever killed marty thats what im doing here thats why im not leaving until i find out who it is in cleary she shook her head this is the town where every other car has a red ribbon on the rearview mirror pellam shook his head frowning mothers against drunk driving meg said the grocery bags at the grand union say say no to drugs pellam opened the packet sniffed it she said why didnt they find it i swallowed it then i got it back last night after they searched me by a wellknown biological process theres no need to go into on this fine morning jesus pellam what if itd broken open you couldve died i couldnt really take a felony possession count he nodded at the printouts why didnt you just flush it sometimes they test the water in jails she smiled i cant exactly see tom testing the john water for drugs pellam laughed who knows what kind of kits he got mail order from small town cop monthly hes just dying to use he stepped to the sink opened the packet and let the contents disappear into the garbage disposal under the smiling observation of a cutout wooden goose wearing a bonnet i know peopled cry real tears see me do this pellam dried his hands then walked up to a tall breakfront he didnt know anything about antiques he stood awkwardly in front of the elaborate piece this is really something the breakfast rolls came out and she set them in front of him he ate two right away they had a strongly yeasty flavor homemade they sipped coffee in an awkward silence for a few minutes he was on his third roll the best compliment there is she said and ate one herself i never gain weight oh im not being vain its just a fact pellam walked into the hall looking at the wallpaper the furniture houses he knew what tommy bernstein would have said about his little place on beverly glen north of sunset boulevard shit you got a fallee house man you be in trouble houses on the top of the canyons were faller houses at the bottom fallee you gonna get squashed in the quake hed have said sell that sucker now he said to meg ill bet you have nice holidays here holidays meg paused i guess so quiet just the three of us and friends sometimes a house like this needs big families it was different when i was growing up family all over the place her voice faded then she said i have a confession okay the accident when i ran into you im familiar it wasnt an accident oh i didnt want to hit you but i wanted to meet you i saw you walk up the sidewalk and i drove up there on purpose i was going to skid the car or something pretend to drive off the road so i could meet you she was playing with her cocktail ring five thousand dollars of pressurized carbon spun obsessively on a beautiful thin finger he asked why i thought maybe i could get a part in the movie thats why you came to see me in the hospital no he was standing right next to her she turned their eyes met outside miles away the cracks of shotguns rolled into silence she said well maybe he leaned down and kissed her just like that no she said but that was the only resistance she offered her arms were around him kissing back and pulling him against her then she stepped back no she said and this time she was speaking to herself and unlike him she decided to obey the command she walked back to the kitchen stood at the window wiped the sink absently pellam had long ago given up apologizing for impulse he followed her picked up his cup poured more coffee the thing is meg didnt look at him stared out the window im having an affair he set the cup down good job pellam you can pick em like nobody else fall for a woman whos got two men in her life while youre being chased around the ginkgo trees by a druggedout flower child and you with an unblushing railthin hollywood businesswoman you never call waiting at home for you he saw she was organizing her thoughts confession time things to get off her beautiful freckled chest he sat down again this might take some time he knew that straying spouses and bad moviemakers share the same obsessive flaw excessive explanation who is he a man here in town doesnt word get around weve been excruciatingly careful see keiths a wonderful person hes joe solid he loves sam hes never so much as raised his voice to me he dotes he provides but do i feel magic no but should you feel magic i heard this line once a relationships like a fire you got a few months of flame a year of embers then the rest smoke its comfortable theres a lot to be said for comfort but i want more pellam or i thought i wanted more this thing with sam the drugs it scared me bad it shook me up i didnt get an hours sleep last night hes okay isnt he oh yeah hell be fine it just made me feel so vulnerable here i was looking for some she glanced at him for some flame and it almost seemed that sam getting sick was revenge for that you love him this other guy a beat of a pause i thought i did but i dont think so you love keith i know i love sam and my house i think i love keith im tired of having an affair i shouldnt be saying this to you should i her eyes were wide and she seemed very young pellam smiled say whatever you want i like listening keiths so smart he doesnt its not like he makes me feel stupid not intentionally i mean but i feel stupid why do you say that im just not well intelligent what does that mean pellam asked that you cant do calculus in your head or recite the periodic table of the elements keith tries to tell me about his business i dont follow what hes saying i try but meg hes a chemist why should you understand chemistry well politics too and i dont read a lot i try but its just beyond me youre talking in generalities whats beyond you there was a pop and a flash of light behind them meg jumped then laughed a bulb in one of the kitchens wall sconces had burned out meg pulled the shade off blew on the bulb to cool it and unscrewed it when i was a girl i was afraid of the light isnt that odd most kids are afraid of the dark but i hated the light there was no door to my room and the light from the living room that whiteblue light from bare bulbs would glare and keep me up even when i was older when my mother put a sheet up for a door that didnt keep the light out you know why i hated it it was that when they fought my parents voices seemed to come from that light id hide under the blankets mother thought i was afraid of ghosts or something i was afraid of the light thats what i feel like now light is so hard to escape from meg changed the bulb i feel youre some kind of darkness she laughed im sure this is coming out all wrong for a time after he started scouting pellam had wondered why this always happened why people talked to him as much as they did bared their hidden secrets and passions priests didnt hear the kinds of things pellam heard then he realized it wasnt so much that he was a good listener it was that he was safe they could spill their guts and hed be gone in a week or two their secrets with him i knew you didnt have anything to do with sam she said i really did the words were halting women are usually better apologists than men but meg wasnt whatre you going to do he asked im going to stop seeing him my lover is that what you want to do its what i have to do she looked at her watch pellam can i ask a favor he didnt think it was going to involve freckles on her chest or anywhere else hed given up on that he said sure keiths going to be working all day but samll be home in a while could you stay around here did you have any plans nothing to speak of would you we could all have sunday dinner maybe you could do some shooting with sam hes got a and a little shotgun we gave him last year pellam said id love to really really then she was smiling like a sassy schoolgirl she looked at her watch weve got an hour before i pick him up theres something we could do togetherjust you and me where was this leading she took his hand and pulled him toward the door wherere we going he asked raking leaves are you serious she pulled him outside sure come on its fun i havent raked leaves for twenty years they dont have leaves in la and even if they did i wouldnt rake them he resisted at first but here she was a beautiful woman with whom hed shared secrets and so he said i guess he paused on the back porch looked out on what mustve been four or five acres of colored leaves she tossed him a rake he studied it for a moment then said i dont know how it works the glint of light caught the deputys eye he pulled the plymouth squad car off the road and eased it into the latemorning shade of a sugar maple scarred from past years syrup spigots he climbed out of the car pulled his lavendertinted sunglasses on and began walking through the tall grass and forsythia whips hed lived in and around cleary all his life and knew the customs and routineswhere people tended to be and when you could expect to see them there and when you couldnt and one place you didnt expect to see a car parked was in this field on sunday morning he climbed over what was left of a low stone fence and walked through a row of more maples to a narrow dirt road that led into some woods and just stopped about halfway through the car was parked exactly in the center of this road the deputy paused twenty yards away and looked at it a cheap nissan white new york plates and a cleary tigers bumper sticker the reason he stopped wasnt because he was noting all these details he stopped because he didnt want to see what was in the car figuring hed deduced what had happened two high schoolers had spent their last hours on earth making out only to doze off and die thanks to a bum exhaust pipe that was the only possible reason anyone would park on this road on saturday night and the only reason anyone would still be here now he took a breath to calm his stuttering heart and walked forward he found out that he was wrong there was another reason a car was parked in the middle of this deserted road because the driver had been murdered the boy had been shot three times in the chest with a smallcaliber gun his face was serene and there was hardly any blood on the body which meant hed died quickly the boys face was pressed against the passenger window away from the deputy and his hand gripped the door handle there was no lividitysinking of the blood to the lower extremities of the body this meant that hed died recently damn his heart sank the deputy walked around to the other side of the car and looked at the face he recognized ned harper a high school boy a football player and he believed a oneeightydivision wrestler hed remembered that hed seen neds father driving the nissan around town he wondered why the parents hadnt phoned him in missing maybe when your son was an eighteenyearold football player you assumed hed be out late and didnt start to worry for a day or two the deputys daughter was two years old and he worried about her constantly he didnt think thered ever come a time when he didnt whod do something like this maybe the boyd picked up a hitchhiker maybe an escaped prisoner from singsing down in ossining but then why would he leave the car maybe it was an accident hed been hunting with a friend the gun went off and the other boy panicked but no the deputy realized that couldnt be it not with three separate wounds he walked in a slow circle looking for obvious clues but he knew the sheriff would take charge of that and call the county in too then he realized he was just stalling not wanting to make the call to report it the sun shot off the slanted window a dove called from deep in the moist forest the deputy walked slowly back to the car praying he wouldnt be the one elected to tell the boys parents at fourthirty pellam remembered janine oh hell sam looked up probably thinking that hed pointed the muzzle of the singleshot breakaction shotgun the wrong way or hadnt remembered one of the firearm safety rules pellam had told him for the past couple hours theyd been plinking away with shotguns occasionally pellam would throw a can or two into the air and sam sweating with the effort would calculate the lead pellam noticed the determination on the boys face once he overheard sam mutter something as he fired ned was what it sounded like pellam had asked him what hed said but he just shook his head and said can you throw another one please got to call it quits son pellam now said ive got an errand back in town inside the kitchen sam said mom you shouldve seen me i did i was watching out the window howd i do mr pellam did good really good pellam said youve got to clean your weapon sam but ive got to run to town well do it when i get back he looked at meg and there must have been something in his words orgoddamn it was he blushing he looked at her coy smile and said you mind dropping me in town and ill bring the camper back hey sam said his high voice cracking into an even higher register can i come meg smiled sweetly oh and can i come too probably better if you didnt she let him swing for a minute then said maybe youve got some other friends in town some people i dont know shouldnt take more than fifteen minutes meg smiled innocently fifteen thats pretty fast he gave her an exasperated glance the phone rang meg kept her eyes on pellam as she made a slow turn and walked to it hi hon aw no come on what problems hi daddy sam shrieked jumping for the phone i shot a hundred cans meg winced and waved him down im making a roast you cant make it she sighed okay all right well save some for you love you bye daddy to pellam she said hes in a bind at the plant hes got to work most of the night sunday can you believe it he said hell be back at eleven so we eat a trois sam said whats that mom sounds yucky it means therell be three of us for dinner oh i thought it was this weird food you were going to make to pellam he said mom makes this totally strange stuff sometimes all slippery sam and these gross colors young man thats enough and her apple butter he headed for the porch it starts out brownish then it gets kind of green sam meg began goodnaturedly pellam asked meg so how bout that ride lets go pellam called to sam dont clean that gun till i get back young man yessir and then it goes all grayish yuck meg dropped him a block away from the camper she turned to him but before she could say anything he preempted her you dont talk about flower children i wont talk about apple butter she laughed hard see you soon this was a moment when he mightve kissed her but instead he just climbed stiffly out of the tiny carhis wounds still hurtand walked quickly to the camper inside a light was on he opened the door inside janine sat motionless looking down she turned to him bastard im sorry i ran into some trouble last night and bastard what she was talking about though wasnt his being late but the screenplay of to sleep in a shallow grave the binder was open and shed read most of it he closed the door this character youve added thats me isnt it he sat down slowly some of its based on you some it isnt what i feel about you its not the way i see you its fiction a story nothing more than that mostly my imagination she lowered her head and read youre living a dream that the past cant justify its the remoteness of the past that makes it such a safe place for you to live the age of aquarius was a long long time ago janice christ pellam you could at least have done a better job changing my name i didnt you she threw the notebook against the wall the binding snapped the pages cascaded to the floor youre the one living in a dream not me you come into peoples livesnobody invited you to clearyyou come into town with the big fantasy promising to put people into a movie promising to take people away from here i never said that she was crying again her hair was pasted to her cheeks she pulled it angrily away you didnt have to say it what the hell did you expect people to think here you come with your van and your camera studying the town talking to people getting to know everyone getting to know some of them very well you dont understand the power youve got you dont understand how desperate people are desperate to get out of places like cleary and what do they do they spill their guts to you and you betray them why in the name of what what word is sacred to you pellam art in the name of art film money how do you justify taking peoples lives and making a movie out of them he stood up and reached out for her she shook his arms away you just cant drop into someones life take what you want then leave im sorry she stood up walked to the door then stopped waiting for something neither of them knew what should come next i thought janines voice faded and she stepped outside closing the metal door softly behind her pellam sighed he picked up the screenplay binder then bent to the floor and gathered the pages one by one driving down main street pellam passed a grocery store and parked bought a bottle of chardonnay and walked back outside he looked up and down the street for janine no sign of her and what would he tell her if he saw her there was no answer for that he looked up the street at an approaching car an american gt of some kind maybe ten years old its rear end jacked high it came bubbling down the street the driver parked in front of the cedar tap and gunned the engine into a sexy growl before he shut it off he got out and walked into the bar pellam walked over to the car looked inside he returned to the winnebago fired it up and drove slowly out of town he rolled both windows down and felt the cool air fill the cockpit he is driving fast in a fast car a porsche a hun car because in la you must have a german car its not as easy as that though you also have to ignore the fact that a german car is the kind to have and it must seem as if youre the first person on the west coast to think about owning one pellams is black he drives it hard with the passion of someone who loves speed though not necessarily the machinery that allows the car to drive fast whenever anybody says shit the germans make good cars he always looks surprised as if theyd just caught on to his secret they are going into the desert tommy bernstein and him thomaso pellam shouts over the huge slipstream youre going to lose your hat and the man does reaching up too late to keep the stiff threehundreddollar curly brimmed cowboy hat from sailing into the hundredmileanhour slipstream shit pellam turn around pellam only whoops loudly and speeds up tommy doesnt seem to mind somehow it would be wrong to stop the little black car there is an urgency a sense of mission tommy shouts something about the hat and illegal aliens pellam nods the sun is a plate of hot pressure above them the wind which makes their ears ache is hot los angeles is behind them ahead is nothing but desert john give me some tommy shouts he repeats this twice before pellam hears and four times before he chooses to answer please a moaning wail a sound that the wind takes and instantly makes vanish pellam tosses the salt shaker underhand the wind plays hell with the trajectory but tommy catches it in desperate fumbling grabs not funny improves your reflexes tommy was trying to snort too fast i cant pellam hits the clutch and brake the car skids and fishtails when they slow to sixty tommy can snort the coke he gives the high sign pellam accelerates and refuses the offered shaker pellam feels philosophical he shouts you think the deserts minimal right bullshit it isnt its goddamn complex complex like a you know a crystal like the way colors spread under a microscope remember those science films in high school yeah tommy shouts about gonads and seeds and ovum he is grinning like the dirty little boy he likes to portray though he is clearly considering pellams comment in fact he is considering it desperately pellam wishes he hadnt spoken tommy suffers from terminally ill confidence the actor had received one la film critics award and one from cannes when hed been courted and seduced by a big studio lot producer the money was incredible the movies worse than awful his most recent a critic wrote could be stuffed and served at a thanksgiving dinner for the population of the country tommy was trying to think of ways to redeem himself dont be desperate pellam had told him this city dont love desperate men but tommy snatched up even that advice like a life preserver pellam drives in silence a half hour later he notices a small road leading off the highway toward a huge rock eased out of the brush and dirty sand he makes a fast turn and the car skids to a stop out of sight of the road they climb out stretch pee against rocks tommy asks you bring the geiger counter what do we need that for the fucking army they test atom bombs here thats new mexico fucking no tommy says cruise missiles blasting sheep to hell and gone im scared he looks around cautiously pellam says therere no sheep here what im saying theyre dead got blasted into lambchops were in danger our kidsll glow in the dark lets go to work hombre from the car they take two heavy garbage cans that ring with glass falling against itself pellam drags them toward the rock there isnt much shade though there will be in an hour or two tommy now pissed about his hat rubs suntan lotion on his face and thinning scalp then pulls a large cooler from the car this he plants in the sand near the big rise of rock he returns and struggles to get two lawnchairs out of what pretends to be a backseat german cars shit tommy says he drives a chevy impala pellam takes empty beer bottles out of the green bags and sets them carefully on a ridge of dirt and sand about thirty feet away from where tommy plants the lawnchairs he surveys his handiwork then opens a pineappleprinted beach umbrella and sticks it into the ground between the chairs pellam finishes setting out the bottles he calls how many pages tommy flips through a plasticbound manuscript one seventeen need one more tommy pulls another bottle from the cooler pops the lid with a church key and drinks it down he tosses it to pellam who plants it at the end of the row one hundred seventeen bottles they sit in the chairs facing the bottles tommy takes another snort from the shaker he says can i have the python please from a large battered attache case pellam takes two pistols he keeps the ruger for himself and hands tommy the colt he places yellowandgreen boxes of shells between them two copies of the script appear on the title page central standard time by john pellam and tommy bernstein they begin reading aloud and rewriting the script they correct each other changing dialogue argue pellam is quieter and grimmer tommy is boisterous hell shout then stand and stalk around sit again when they finish eleven pagesthe end of the first scenethey stuff cotton into their ears load the pistols and with fifteen shots between them take turns disintegrating the first eleven bottles one for each page the rules of their game tommy says spinning the cylinder of his gun you remember that scene what was it from some old jungle movie stewart grangers aiming at deborah kerrs head shes scared doesnt know whats going on then blam he wastes a boa constrictor right behind her i always wanted to play that scene why dont you go sit over next to the rocks pellam they got snakes in the rocks yeah hell with snakes pellam says pulling a beer from the cooler i always wanted to shoot me an actor they work until eleven that night and blow the last three bottles apart in the headlight of the tiny german car surrounded by the sound of its bubbling exhaust they are shivering and it takes ten rounds each to hit the last glistening bottle this fucking movies going to make us pellam tommy shouts were going right to the top and he empties the gun at the night sky the house was completely quiet meg had a little time until pellam would be back she took her coffee and walked up the stairs she paused then sat on the landing for a long time looking into the hall and those portions of the den and living room she could see the parquet floor the furniture the house seemed different a strangers home she didnt recognize it there was nothing unpleasant about the sensation it was one of those moments when you focus on a familiar objecta doorknob a chair your own little fingerand it seems absurd and alien to you this was her house the house shed always loved hers and keiths and sams only something was different meg went into the bedroom got dressed she tied her hair in a pony tail her hands paused holding the ribbon above her neck the doorbell rang she bounded down the stairs like sam on christmas morning she swung the heavy door open shed already prepared a wry comment for pellam about janine and was ready to deliver it but she blinked in surprise wexell ambler stood there looking shy leaning against the jamb i was driving past saw your car was in the drive the cougar was gone i couldnt wait till tomorrow meg instinctively looked back into the house to make certain they were alone then she looked behind ambler is it mr pellam mommy sam called she wondered if ambler could hear what the boy had asked didnt seem he had no honey ill be outside for a minute she shouted her hand still on the doorknob meg said to ambler keiths at work i want to talk to you i have to talk to you im expecting some company ambler had no reaction to this she was trying to decide whether to tell him who the company was if he asked he didnt he said it wont take long though he said it slowly the words full of meaning as if he wanted their conversation to last for the entire evening she looked behind her again up the stairs toward sams room then stepped outside and closed the door behind her it didnt latch he kissed her on the cheek and she kissed him back though hed have to be drunk or crazy not to sense the hesitancy i had to see you is everything okay he looked at her in surprise okay sure i should be asking how sam is you never called to tell me if hes all right hes fine hell be fine hes a wonderful boy ambler said they walked to the end of the porch and stood at the railing looking out across the moist lawn glistening in slight radiance from the houselights what is it wex about what i asked about marrying me she turned to him he was such a tough man a dangerous man too she supposed that bodyguard thug of his mark for instance also the way he liked her to be helpless almost cowering when they made love meg torrens believed sex was a window to your soul shed never actually said no to him before and she wondered if there was a risk to her if she did she felt a chill colder than the air what should she say she suddenly remembered a line from one of pellams movies a character has to make a decision about turning a friend over to the police he says to his wife the most important decisions are always made by our hearts she let her heart answer now wex she looked away fixing her eyes on a fingernail clipping of a moon over a dark wad of trees i cant see you anymore she wondered if it would be a total surprise if hed nod slowly and walk away if hed fly into a rage she honestly didnt know he didnt answer for a moment and she heard his breathing remembered the deep sound from the times theyd lain together tension filled her body turned her to stone were you going to come to the place yesterday and tell me that he asked or were you just going to let me figure it out on my own she hesitated and for the first time in their relationship lied to him no i was going to come meg glanced toward the house and the driveway and then took his arm he was shaking anger sorrow the cold will he hurt me she continued im sorry wex i loved every minute we spent together but she was parsing carefully but she found she had no idea of what words she could attach to her thoughts to express them right but its just time for it to be over with how can you say that he spat out its what i feel what happened she couldnt look into his eyes no its run its course i was searching for something i youre going back to keith i dont know youre in love with that man pellam right the hesitation must have seemed huge to him though for meg it lasted only a second no im not ambler stepped away from her its him isnt it no i knew it he said bitterly i knew from the minute you heard there was going to be a movie in town you were going after him what did you want for him to sweep you away to be a star wex come on dont you remember we were lying in bed shhh she raised her palm to silence him and it was the first day they came into town in that damn camper of theirs and all you talked about was making a movie how much you wanted to act maybe i did i want to be successful at something why is that so hard for you to understand meg you cant just go start a hollywood career you i dont want to talk about this did he fuck you his voice was loud be quiet she whirled to face him you cant come to my house and talk to me that way he grabbed her arm she winced then he calmed reached forward and touched her face her eyes focused behind him where a fast burst of light from the opening door would warn that sam was on his way outside i love you meg you dont know how much i want to be with you im going to be with you wex its never been right not here cleary isnt the kind of place for this sort of thing i see how wrong it was you make it sound cheap it wasnt that his whisper was harsh i didnt mean it that way i dont regret anything i just he stared down at her for a moment then released her suddenly ambler turned and walked down the steps meg felt the vacuum of his leaving there was too much unresolved wex ambler had been her only lover was this how affairs always ended punctuated more with question marks and ellipses than exclamation points she leaned against the banister and watched himwithout a glance toward herget into his cadillac he drove slowly away she saw the flash of his brake lights as he paused at the roadpaused just long enough to let the winnebago turn up her driveway then ambler hit the accelerator hard and vanished into the night theyre waiting for me to say grace he decided meg and sam were looking at him expectation in their faces pellam cleared his throat in front of him on the sundayset table was a veal roast that would have fed enough men to rake up all six acres of leaves on the torrens estate in half an hour a huge bowl of beans and one of salad another plate was loaded with potato pancakes he and meg were drinking the white wine sam had a glass of milk thats what theyre waiting for grace what do i do now theyd settled in their chairs candles were lit and their eyes turned toward him then as the seconds rolled past slowly they looked at each other pellam unrolled his sleeves and buttoned his cuffs to buy time meg said well last time i did this must be twenty years ago i dont remember it too well she was frowning twenty years well i dont say grace in the camper and meg was laughing her wine glass in her hand rocking spilling the blond liquid over her fingers pellam no were just waiting for you to carve the roast oh he covered his face with his hands and laughed sam said i can say grace mr pellam here goes over the lips and past the gums look out stomach here it comes amen pellam picked up the knife and serving fork and went to work the first couple pieces crumbled can i at least pray for help in carving it was an hour into the meal when the eeriness settled on him a feeling he couldnt pin down it happened when he was laughing at one of sams jokes one that pellam himself had told to death thirty years before and he glanced up at meg their eyes met and for one moment a pivotal moment there was no movie no studio no camper no keith just a universe centered around the three of them and the instant he thought how comfortable and natural it seemed the moment ended and he became anxious pellam surveyed his massive wedge of blueberry pie meg said to his protesting palm pellam youre too skinny he ate two pieces when theyd finished dessert pellam helped meg clear the table sam asked mr pellam tomorrow can you teach me to shoot your gun what guns that meg asked pellam told her about the colt meg said im not real crazy about pistols but she looked at her son you listen to everything mr pellam tells you as if that needed to be said totally excellent the little boy squealed meg said next youll be teaching him poker pellam laughed the two of them sat in the living room for a while sipping coffee the unidentified feeling ebbing and flowing within pellam he couldnt tell whether he wanted to stay wanted to leave one thing he knew for surehe definitely wanted to leave before keith came home the phone rang meg went to answer it and returned a moment later she didnt say who the caller was but now she too seemed uneasy what the hellre you doing here he thought to himself shes married shes got a lover you dont need those kinds of troubles he rose i better go you sure no but he said better still have a few things to do sunday night he nodded then asked got a favor sure you have a bottle of whiskey i can borrow borrow no now you mention it make that have afterdinner drink little more complicated than that sure she smiled in curiosity and dug down under a cabinet and emerged with a halffull bottle of wild turkey thats the cheapest youve got pellam picked up the bottle fraid so say whatre you going to do teach my little boy to shoot gamble and drink pellam hefted the bottle hugged her thanks again maam you make a mean meal see you tomorrow ah its the gunslingers grandson said fred who squinted his red retirees face and studied pellams

reynolds aint available gimme a call in the backroom pellam found nick sitting at a table with another man skinny long hair a couple years his juniormaybe eighteen nick had a bowl of soup in front of him he hunched over it putting slippery noodles into his mouth hi nick pellam pulled up a chair nick waved then returned to the soup it looked like campbells what else at the cedar tap nick said this

he said did that myself too pellam whistled you sure know your hardware how bout it nick shrugged lets go rebo stood up but pellam shook his head just gotta be the two of us insurance problems you understand rebo nodded and dropped back into his seat as if duane allman himself had told him to sit outside they walked to the car and pellam looked around the streets of cleary were deserted he said oh let me get something he disappeared into the camper for a minute and came out with the bottle of wild turkey he handed it to nick the boy looked at it but shook his head maybe afterwards man not a good idea if im going to be doing highspeed work they walked to nicks black pontiac highspeed work like he did it everyday pellam unscrewed the lid of the bottle nick watched him frowning you dont drink and drive pellam asked thats funny you were the other night i could smell it on top of your aftershave thats what i recognized brut right the eyes were fishy and the grin came back the fuckre you saying pellam nodded toward the car heard your car this afternoon thought it sounded familiar then checked it out and smelled that same drugstore aftershave inside didnt your mother raise you with any class huh hows your friend with the broken nose i hope hes in a lot of pain you fucking crazy hed turned solemn as a mortician i know youre going to tell me it was nothing personal what wasnt personal but the eyes disclosed all the facts nick paused then said you got me good he touched his jaw i wont be eating solid food for a week my tongues sore as a whores tit why didnt you tell moorhouse what good would itve done hed let you go right yeah so he was in on it right in on what paying you to beat the crap out of me and plant the drugs i dont know what the colt appeared in a flash pointed straight into the boys belly shit he whispered oh god mister who paid you pellam paused suddenly he was curious how much was it a hundred bucks thats all thats crap no man no its totally true i swear pellam felt insulted you shouldve charged more now tell me who we didnt have nothing against you we heard who pellam whispered viciously and cocked the colt praying that his thumb wouldnt slip off the hammer the gun was loaded with grain caliber bullets the boy was fat but he wouldnt even slow up a slug that size both hands in front of him palms out okay fine listen im going asked you a question pellam growled to tell you just put that who mr ambler wexell ambler well was a guy works for himnames mark but i dont know his last name i swear i dont this guy mark talked to mayor moorhouse and they wanted me and my friend to rough you up a bit wheres he live the ambler pellam touched nicks chest with the colt a good way to get directions fast nick became a regular triple a guidebook barlow mountain road just off route nine north past the shell station go two hundred yards past then make a left really mister i didnt have nothing against you well whats he got against me i dont know swear to god please mister point that someplace else pellam aimed at the ground before he eased the hammer to halfcock then slowly spun the cylinder to put an empty chamber beneath the hammer which he then lowered all the way he held the gun in his right hand while he handed the whiskey bottle to nick with his left take a drink nicks voice shook as he said i dont want to take a drink we both want you to pellam pointed the colt at him again oh shit come on drink it down nick took a swallow come on a couple more drink like a man you hit like a girl at least drink like a man

in the car drive out toward the highway to the forest preserve ill be right behind you dont try to get away ill be aiming for the tires but i might hit your gas tank you asshole the boy muttered as he got into the car the big pontiac engine exploded to life and nick pumped the accelerator they pulled out of downtown the camper right behind the gt it turned out even better than pellamd thought it would be theyd gotten two miles out of town to the stoplight when nick did just what pellam knew he was going to do looked for cross traffic slipped the clutch and shot through the red light running up through the gears with his fancy shifter sounding like a buzzsaw the boy was probably in fourth when the state trooper pellam had seen on his way into town hidden in the bushes a speed trap started to pull out nick came within two or three inches of taking the front end of the troopers chevy with him pellam drove slowly past the scene of the arrest nick handcuffed the trooper writing down breathalyzer results he drove past the sign that said welcome to cleary and continued into the blackness good night officer good night sir pellam turned the camper off barlow mountain road and eased along an overgrown side road up the hill that he supposed was barlow mountain he nosed the winnebago forward into a clump of hemlocks then killed the engine he pulled the colt out from under the seat and slipped it into his waistband then stepped outside his boots made gritting taps as he walked along the asphalt toward the warm yellow house lights that glowed in the fog a quarter mile away a hundred yards from the house he made his way off the road into brush and sparse woods he smelled wet pine and ripe leaves a hit of skunk he saw the glistening lights reflecting on a lake to his right a late lone cicada made its deceptively cheerful sound and somewhere a dog barked he moved slowly toward the house stepping around branches the house was a rambling old monster easily two hundred years old a drab ugly brown plymouth rock chic he heard water lapping and saw the lake clearly it came right to the edge of the property the dog barked again the sound rolling across the lake there was no other noise or motion not even wind the house was still and the lights were dim pellam wondered if theyd been left on while the residents were out to discourage the potential intruders that pellam now understood ambler would have good reason to worry aboutthe state police for instance he thought of the drugs that had been planted on martyand on himand the odd heroin sam had taken he recalled that meg or someone told him about other overdoses and murders in the area ambler was probably responsible for it all he knelt in the grass and felt the cold dew through his denim after five minutes during which he saw no motion he ran in a crouch to the separate garage a twostory saltbox and looked in the window only one car inside a cadillac and there was an oil stain on the concrete about ten feet to the left of the caddie which told him that ambler had two cars a family out to dinner on sunday night probably but even when he walked to the house pellam stayed in the shadows and edged up to the firstfloor windows slowly he bobbed his head up and looked in one quickly seeing small rooms decorated with rough painted furniture wreaths of dried flowers primitive colonial paintings of spooky children and blackclad wiveseverything stiff and spindly and uncomfortable he saw no movement at all the windows he noticed were mostly unlocked the third room was the one he wanted it was dark paneled and inside were two large gun cabinets glass faced set against the wall several trophies were mounted near the low ceilinga couple of antelope and a goodpointed buck but they were on one wall only as if the hunter had gotten tired of displaying his kills pellam squinting saw a number of rifles in the cases several looked like they were caliber and at least two of them had telescopic sights pellam lifted his hands up to the window and tested it unlocked he stood completely still for a moment his face millimeters away from the smooth expensive paint job then he eased up the window which moved slowly he opened it about two feet a hard climb though he thoughtconsidering his bruised thigh his damaged joints it was then that he glanced inside and noticed something odd whats wrong with this picture the second gun cabinet the third space from the left empty thinking if a man was as organized as ambler seemed to be and he didnt have enough guns to fill a cabinet hed probably keep the ones he did have centered in the rack which meant dont move the man said the jump was involuntary though the cold touch of the shotgun barrel at his head brought the movement under control real fast the voice was that of a middleaged man he asked you have a gun yes hand it to me if he was impressed with the colt the man didnt say so he slipped it into his pocket and leaving the remington overunder at pellams neck like a nesting kitten said lets go inside pellam moved back and forth slowly in the bentwood rocker hed been politely invited toward by the blunt gauge trap gun pellam hated shotguns shotguns were really loud the manhe was wex ambler according to his muttered introductionstudied pellam carefully pellam gazed back it was an odd contrasthateful dark eyes and an ll bean sunday gardeners outfit complete with bright green izod shirt what were you doing ambler asked thinking of shooting a movie here i was you know i could shoot you now blow your head clean off and all the sheriffd do is tell me how sorry he was i lost a window and bloodied my floor pellam saw the stillness in amblers eyes and knew this was a man who could easily kill he said i wanted to see if you were really the man who was trying to send me to attica for ten years ambler said i didnt want you to go to prison i wanted you to leave town get the hell out and not come back you couldve asked you were asked several times goodbye amblers eyes flashed you people we have a decent town and you think you can come here from hollywood and make your movies but youre laughing at us behind our backs youre laughing i hate you people pellam was laughing bullshit i came to town to rent a few houses and stores for a couple of weeks thats all we wanted my friend gets killed and i get beat up and somebody plants drugs on me ambler shook his head whipping pellams words off like they were gnats pellams eyes measured distances noticing that the shotguns safety was on that amblers finger was outside the trigger guard that the muzzle was aimed sixty or seventy degrees away from him noticing a carving set on the counter antler handled a burnished wellhoned blade on the knife even the serving fork looked vicious sin city ambler said pellam rocked forward his legs tensed thinking he could probably make it he wondered what it was like to stab someone its just a business pellam said ambler didnt hear him people here go to church they have children they teach them christian values they work hard they pellam thought make millions selling smack dont need your kind of influence outside influence so it was a script moorhouse and ambler and the sheriff all had the same script and the lines were terrible theyd all be in on it of course this man with a milliondollar house was probably the ringleader hed arranged to bring the drugs in from someplace out of the country then hed distribute them in small towns like this an untapped market moorhouse tom the sheriff and the pastelsunglassed deputies were his enforcers ambler was lecturing sin providence promises unkept the words didnt quite harmonize with the fact the man had killed marty or was seeding godfearing dutchess county with exotic drugs but pellam recalled a former acquaintancee block west wing san quentin californiawho went to church every day ambler kept talking like a crazy person on the street furious flecks of spittle in the corner of his mouth the muzzle of the gun rose and fell like surf but pellam wasnt paying much attention to amblers mania or the moral purity of dutchess county he was thinking about the carving knife his feet rested themselves under the sensually curved chair pressing the balls of his feet against the tile the knife the knife the knife he felt the tension like blued spring steel building in his calves the knife he kept his eyes calm staring right into amblers that was the giveaway in a fight you could always tell when a man was about to swing or go for a weaponhis eyes hed learned that from another acquaintance d block north wing pellam looked at ambler and kept his eyes very still he rocked forward the chair swung back and then forward his weight moved with it the knife on your mark goddamn shotguns were loud get set blood on the tiles no sir thered be blood on the ceiling the walls the fancy granite countertop go amblers harsh voice asked what did you tell her pellam froze stopped rocking who amblers feverish eyes danced out the window for a moment as a car drove past it continued on pellam rocked back his quaking legs relaxed shotguns didnt so much shoot you as obliterate you ambler continued that youd make her a star what are you talking about ambler said she told you shed been a model didnt she and you promised to get her jobs promised to take her out to california leave this backwater little town leave your son and then you seduced her didnt you you promised her a job and you fucked her i dont shes just fodder for you isnt she i dont know who youre talking about his first thought was janine but then he asked cautiously meg ambler nodded him hes the one meg come on this guy ambler muttered sarcastically oh shed be in good hands with you jesus you gave sam that fucking heroin or whatever it was and practically killed him the surprise in pellams eyes must have seemed genuine ambler stopped talking i didnt give sam that stuff ambler frowned finally he said you seduced her didnt you nothing happened between us we talked we had dinner ambler looked at him for a moment a lovers examination of a possible rival how they hang on every flutter of eyelash every syllable pellam said shes a captivating person ambler said too good for you thats probably true ambler said i love her thats why you did it pellam asked why you had me set up because you thought i was taking her away from you yes and here you come to threaten me to tell me to stop seeing her pellam said i didnt even know you were seeing her then whatre you doing here tonight pellam looked at amblers face carefully judging tommy bernstein had said there were times when a man has to make a leap he meant it philosophically muttering something about a leap of faith though when he said it he was drunk and poised to leap off the second story of his beverly hills house into the swimming pool that liberace had supposedly done something scandalous in pellam said im going to show you something what im going to reach into my pocket okay i just want to show you something pellams hand disappeared into his pocket and it returned with the two shell casings what are those these were the shells from the shots that killed my partner whoever did that is the same person whos been selling the drugs that sam got i assumed it was the same person who had me beat up and you thought it was me amblers face was horrified pellam slowly rocked forward off the balls of his feet hed forgotten about the knife ambler said im a christian pellam laughed well you vandalized our camper right you planted the drugs in the car and you called the sheriff and said marty was selling stuff right ambler didnt answer for a moment the day you and your friend came to town i was with meg she was so excited ive never seen her that way she was obsessed with the idea of being in a movie thats all she talked about if you made a movie here i was afraid id lose her shed try to get a part shed go off to hollywood i did have somebody plant something in the car and then yes he called the police but i didnt have marty killed id never do that you were the one who ordered the parking lot plowed over when the accident happenedwhen the car blew upi was terrified that id be accused of it i told moorhouse to have it dozed to hide any evidence and sillman the rental place i had my man talk to sillman we arranged to offer martys family some money a lot of money it looked like an insurance settlement and you had those two locals pay me a visit beat me up ambler nodded i wanted you gone so badly all she did was talk about you talk about movies i was losing her i was desperate he looked down at his hands studied his long fingers ambler broke open the shotgun and put it on the counter he picked up the bullet casings winchesters but theres something different about them magnums pellam said i dont have a gun thatll take these he looked up you want to check pellam glanced at the shotgun which ambler could still grab close and loudly obliterate pellam with before he was halfway to the knife he said i believe you ambler handed the cartridges back thosere unusual rounds used for real long distance shooting what kind of weapon would that be ambler asked you can get a beretta boltaction chambered for them sigsauer has a magnum and beretta you say pellam said you know somebody whos got one i do but i dont think who you dont know them a couple brothers something flashed through pellams mind pellam said they wouldnt be twins by any chance yeah as a matter of fact they are you arent gonna like it the deputy said to the sheriff i dont like a lot of whats been happening around here lately tom said they were in the police station sunday night though one thing about cleary the sabbath wasnt any quieter than any other day the only difference now was that all three of them were workingtwo in the office and the other deputy in the fieldand they were expecting a visit from a detective and another deputy from the county sheriffs office who were going to be assisting in the investigation of neds murder i was talking to people who had seen him in the past twentyfour hours whod seen ned i mean the sheriff knew this since hed sent the deputy to do just that and a coupla folks saw him with sam torrens at the festival so tom was exhausted a blownup car drugs arson fights and now a high school boy murdered life in smalltown america crap it was just before the kid got sick kid which kid explain it to me will you the deputy said im saying that it looks like ned was the one who gave the drugs to sam torrens that heroin shit oh the sheriff closed his eyes and rubbed them with his knuckles what arent i going to like you said before i wasnt going to like something the deputy continued keith torrens got his boy a for christmas last year i seen him buying shells when i dont mean recent i just mean i know hes got a in the house and had some shells come on randy everybody in towns got a they practically come with the house when you buy one im just saying and we dont know for certain it was a killed ned couldve been a or a maybe but youd think theredve been more damage we dont know the deputy nodded finally he said closest thing to justifiable ive ever seen the sheriff wondered where the hell that was coming from the deputy had worked on exactly one murder in his four years on the force and that had been when barnie slaters wife used a deer slug in his sleep to keep him from taking the lamp cord to her anymore she had fresh coffee for the deputies when theyd arrived the sheriff said justifiables the prosecutors decision not ours after a moment tom asked when was the time of death about ten this morning church time meg was here bailing out that movie guynow thats a fact i dont want to think too much on what about keith he do church i dont know the deputy answered we can call theyre in first presbyterian whos that the minister jim gitting good man gives a good sermon tom didnt care whether he was the devils own brother call him find out if torrens was there today the deputy picked up the phone reverend gitting please hey reverend how you doing look im real sorry to be tom took the phone from his hand reverend this is the sheriff was keith torrens in church this morning uhm no sheriff the voice was whiny didnt sound like hed give a good sermon at all can i ask why just looking into some things he usually attend services hardly ever he was working this morninglike usual wait you said he wasnt there howd you know where he was he wasnt in church he just dropped off sam for sunday school is this about that thing with sam this morning it wasnt a big thing just gave the teachers a little fright is all what thing with sam well the boy disappearing is that what youre calling about what happened the boys had a study group outside the weather was so nice about a half hour later the teachers noticed sam was gone we called meg but she wasnt home bailing out that asshole from the movie company and we called keith at his office right he was about to leave but then sam came back he was upset about something but wouldnt say what mrs ernhelt had a talk with him about going away without saying anything and he seemed okay it really wasnt anything what time was this reverend i dont know for sure about nine fortyfive or ten brother all right sir thank you can you tell me what this is all about nothing important night the deputy finally said what hed apparently been eager to say for some time tom if somebody gave my kid drugs like that ida done something to him too maybe not killed him but ida done something you cant hardly blame keith the minister called keith when sam disappeared he was in his office before the deputy could nod in relief tom said but his boy wasnt accounted for sam come on youre not thinking but the mans voice faded trash the mystery of what lay behind the stockade fence at r w was solved not surplus not salvage forget about antiques not even good junk robert and william owned a trashyard and nothing but pellam had circled far around the back of r w and was slowly moving through the woods unlike the pristine woods surrounding amblers house the air here was raw pungent ripe he smelled garbage and methane which filled his throat and made him gag several times he had to swallow down nausea under the dim moonlight halved by mist he felt he was plodding through a dead animals viscera the ground under his boots was slick and pasty he came to the foothills of the junkyard a doorless refrigerator on its side then ten yards further along amputated pieces of laminated furniture plush toys books tangles of wire hunks of iron losing shape to oxidation twenty yards more and he came to the boundary of r w hed brought a small bolt cutter and though he saw now at one time there had been a cheap chain link enclosing a portion of the yard it had long ago sagged or been pulled down by vandals or gravity pellam stuffed the cutter into his back pocket and hopped over an indented portion of the fence he paused and listened for dogs nothing no voices either just the sour smell and a tangle of vague moonlight reflecting off a thousand varied surfaces pellam walked forward slowly toward the shack that must have been the office of the place looking for footholds through the maze of scabby broken trash pellam pressed his back against the shack he looked quickly in the window then ducked below the sill empty he looked again a filthy place fast food cartons empty beer cans more magazines he expected penthouses but all he could see were national geographics cosmopolitans and readers digests moldy and stained clothes books dishes newspapers slips of paper boxes he also saw two leather guncases in the corner he looked around then tried the window it was locked pellam took the bolt cutter and whacked out a pane of glass reached up and undid the latch he lifted the window and after a struggle to boost himself up the pain shooting from his thigh to his ribs to his jaw he halffell and halfclimbed over the windowsill he listened for a moment and heard nothing but the rustle of a car moving by he walked quickly to the corner and hefted one of the gun cases inside was a colt ar the civilian version of the army ml the other case held the magnum beretta a simplelooking gun a boltaction walnut stock dark blued metal a black shoulder guard a highriding telescopic sight there were no iron sights it was a snipers gun the shells sam had found fit it perfectly cinderellas slipper was it proof enough pellam didnt know his only bout with the law had been on the other side and from there it looked pretty damn easy to get yourself arrested and convicted pellam replaced the gun then began looking through desk drawers the closet the battered olivedrab rucksacks stacked on the back wall which is where they had the drugs hidden thousands of little tubes like the kind crack came in mustve been five six thousand of them and inside each one was a little crystal like the doctor had showed them the crystals someone had given sam a little piece of rock candy that solved the probable cause problem if the gun didnt do it then this ought to a car went by it seemed to slow and he quickly shoved the bags back into place drew his pistol then after a moment when the car was past pellam knelt and opened the rucksack again nekkid bobby said his brother nodded they were in the cleary inn eating prime rib it was a pretty ritzy place for dutchess county not as damn countryish as most places the inn was filled with chrome and mirrors and plastic all shoved together and cemented down with plenty of money the twins sat at a table with red linen tablecloths in their laps were thick napkins that left whitecaps of lint on their matching dark slacks they may have owned a junkyard but these boys loved to eat and didnt mind pampering themselves a goodly part of the money they madefrom the drugs of course since theyd had a loss on the junkyard every year theyd operated ita goodly part of that income went into their mouths disposable income we own a junkyardall our incomes disposable ha ha ha tonight their fingernails were perfectly clean and under the aroma of coal tar shampoo they smelled sweet as the perfume aisle of a cvs pharmacy bobby said so there i was nekkid as a jaybird he paused wondering what a jaybird was exactly and the shades were up she couldntve been more than fifteen feet away in the backyard fifteen feet in a white bra like torpedo tits thiss a dumb shit story no no no bobby said it gets better billy said it aint got good yet how can it get better bobby paused to eat his yorkshire pudding which was new on the menu hed never had it before well pudding it wasnt it was like a pancake that got out of hand bobby thought he could show the cook here a thing or two about making pancakes billy ate some more caesar salad bobby continued then she kind of waves only it was she didnt want to come right out and wave you know that kind of wave billy chewed and the next thing im turning around to face her full and she was looking at my dingdong smiling billy said you talk more about that thang than you use it i sure did use it that night bobby said then after another triangle of yorkshire pudding disappeared into his mouth how long is he going to be there he didnt explain that he was talking about pellam being at the torrens place theyd seen the camper on their way to the inn but billy knew thats what his brother was talking about i dont know how would i know bobby said so were just going to do it itll look kind of obvious wont it first his friend in the car then him uhm billy muttered and didnt say anything more not because he was chewing salad but because he was thinking bobby looked at a twelvepoint mounted above a smokyglass fireplace it was weird to have a trophy in a restaurant that looked like it ought to be on fort hamilton parkway in brooklyn or someplace in paramus new jersey he studied the animals dead eyes and slick fur and he began salivating imagining that he could smell fresh morning air and feel november stub grass under his boots the heft of a good rifle in his hands he said i cant picture that you know traveling around the country id get kind of you know disoriented billy said billy often supplied the words that bobby couldnt think of yeah id like to travel though theres a lot of the world to see i just mean i wouldnt want to travel all the time uhn youre not talking a lot tonight he tapped a crispy part of the pudding with his fork the thing that was odd was that you were supposed to put gravy on it bobby thought they ought to give you log cabin and was close to asking for some pancake pudding with gravy on it brits were fucking crazy billy said theres one thing that still bothers me the torrens kid what about him ned gave him the candy right so they mustve spent some time together whats a like logical question for the kid to ask bobby couldnt figure it out tell me hes going to ask where ned got the stuff and ned iswasjust dumb enough to tell him the kids nine or ten whats he going to know sometimes billy said you just dont think that was not exactly true bobby thought a lot it was just that usually his thoughts werent helpful they didnt go anywhere so he was happy to mix up batter and flip flapjacks like bones that sailed through the air in space movies and drill a deers shoulder from three hundred yards with a shot aimed through his zeisdaiwar scope and keep the roadsides of dutchess county free from any trash that had the slightest use and a lot of things that didnt beyond that okay he left a lot of the thinking to billy who couldnt shoot and who couldnt cook and who fuck him didnt like national geographic billy said he could know a lot just cause hes a kid doesnt mean hes stupid bobby wondering if hed been insulted so what are you saying but billy answered by asking what do you think of the missus torrens meg torrens had to be i dunno bobby said you going to eat your pudding huh your pudding i thought it was like a potato or something yeah im gonna eat it billy added whatcha think about her i dunno shes no hausfrau hausfrau whats that like a nazi bobby pronounced it natsee you think she has big tits billy mused i dunno whatre you billy asked what do you think about torrens i mean really think think about him bobby often repeated his brothers questions in a tone that made it sound like it was a dumb thing to askusually so he could buy time to figure out an answer billy continued you think hes smart smart enough billy looked at his brother then laughed what does that mean smart enough thats like saying his dick is long enough okay bobby said hes smart enough not to put his dick where it dont belong which it sounds to me is what youre considering doing there dude hows that for thinking how much you think torrenss worth how much you think he makes man youre asking for compared to what lets say we for instance make fucking trouble billy ate his pudding every last bit bobby watched this with disappointment he thought that thirteen ninety five which bought you a goodsized slab of wet red prime rib ought to buy you a little more in the brit pudding department they got themselves a real nice house billy said continuing this line of thought that bobby didnt quite get but knew he didnt like its okay billy stared at his brother as if hed just turned down playoff tickets bobby said okay its fucking wonderful happy lets just billy began i think youre nuts is what i think consider a possibility she was wondering where pellam was what he was up to taking the whiskey disappearing mysteriously like that meg torrens felt a brief splinter of jealousy wondering if hed gone off to see janine then she forced that thought away said to herself you got yourself a pretty full plate at the moment babe still that damn sound again from the day theyd met in pellams hospital room the polaroid bzzzt for your information ive lived here five years she thought about him kissing her about how she wanted to kiss him back enough she tucked sam into bed and went down to the kitchen poured herself another glass of wine and was returning to the living room turning the lights down shed had them up high while pellam was here despite her hatred of bright lights didnt know why shed done that okay yes she did less romantic less of a message she a knock on the door she hoped it was pellam but was afraid ambler had returned she recalled that he must have seen pellam leave and wondered if ambler had parked up the road and been spying on them waiting for him to leave to return and try his proposalyet again how could such a strong man be so desperate im just not in the mood for this but when she opened the door she found the sheriff standing on the front porch tom evening meg she felt a jolt is keith okay oh im not here about him pellam not him either mind if i come in he was grave but then he was always grave she nodded him in setting the wine on a nearby breakfront he walked inside pulling off his hat the instant his boot touched the threshold coffee or anything he shook his head sat down on the couch what is it just wanted to ask you a thingr two about sam you know he left sunday school for a while this morning what was this i didnt know that was a crime she said stiffly meg i think we both know it isnt and i think you know theres more to me asking than that which is what did you know about sam would you tell me please she opted for the truth but it was a close election yes keith told me they tried to call me here but i was out they called him at the factory sam came back after a few minutes after fortyfive minutes what is this all about tom and you talked to sam about it of course the sheriff said nothing more and meg felt compelled to continue he was upset about what happened with those pills he said he didnt feel well it was a nice day he went for a walk she was rambling and stopped i want to know what youre asking tom nodded meg not long after he left the church ned harper was killed it was a mile awaythats a bit of a hike but he couldve made it in the time he was gone ned what does sam have to do with ned we think ned was the one gave him those pills and we think sam mightve killed him no she said firmly we dont know for sure but itd make sense for ned tove threatened the boy you saw how scared he was and itd make sense for sam to want to get even sam wouldnt hurt anybody ned was killed with a smallcaliber might be a we havent got the slugs yet randy gottschalk my deputy he was telling me that keith got sam a last christmas her eyes strayed to the denwhere the small winchester usually resided her heart jumped when she noticed it was gone but then she remembered that sam and pellam had been shooting that afternoon had they been using the or the little shotgun maybe they were on the back porch awaiting cleaning or the basement the only gun in the cabinet was the antique springfieldthe only surviving bequest from her parents other than the intense dislike of bright lights tom youve known sam since he was bom you think hes capable of killing somebody i dont no but im not the only one going to be asking weve already had moren our share of trouble in clearythose deaths last year a couple of other overdoses the state policere going to be handling this one and theyre going to want to talk to sam and check out his gun run some ballistics what thatll prove is that hes not the one but even as she said these words a terrible doubt was forming no her son was incapable of killing anyone yet she remembered his face todaywhen he was shooting with pellam it looked so determined so adult scary at times can i talk to him hes asleep tom smiled looked past her doesnt seem to be sam was standing in the hallway in his pajamas staring at the sheriff uneasily i heard a noise i got scared hi sam how you doing hi sheriff you feeling better yessir i am you mustve heard me sorry i woke you up i wasnt asleep i heard you come in this was a different noise outside my window meg was looking at his round sleepy face she thought no hed never kill anyone yet his eyes seemed so cold he seemed so different she struggled to smile honey its probably that owl remember wasnt the owl meg was thinking where is that but no he couldnt have done it tom stood how bout i take a look i guess sam said tom meg began in a whisper the sheriff said okay meg tell you what ill come by tomorrow you and keithll be here and you can have a lawyer too you want okay she nodded tom put his hand on the boys shoulder and they started up the stairs now lets check out that noise ill be there in a minute to tuck you in meg called where was that gun she had to find it she was halfway to the back porch when the gunshot from upstairs shook the house a scream burst from her lips she ran to the stairs and leapt out of the way just as tom stumbled down them a terrible wound in his chest i he glanced at her with unfocused eyes crawled toward the front door he got three or four feet then dropped to the floor lay still blood soaked the carpet jesus sam she started up the stairs again for a terrible moment she believed that her son had done it allkilled ned and then lured the sheriff up to the second floor to kill him and felt too that it was all her faultfor her infidelity for her not being grateful for the wonderful life keith had given her but then the boy appeared on the stairs running in panic tears streaming down his face there was a man he hurt sheriff tom he shot him where is he i dont know he was at the window im scared then she heard the noise coming from the basement the sound reminded her of the time shed pulled apart an old lettuce crate for the wood using a claw hammer to pry the nails the loud squeal from the rusty friction then a snap and the tinkle of glass on stone the basement window mommy its him hes there hes in the shhh meg ran to the basement door she locked a small brass latch and grabbed the telephone the line was dead she tapped the button silence she glanced at tom but the pistol was no longer in his holster he must have dropped it somewhere or the intruder had stolen it sam where are those guns you and mr pellam were shooting i dont sam its okay honey its going to be fine where are the guns he gasped in fear i put them in the basement we were going to clean them he said he didnt want me to by myself all right baby she led him to the firstfloor guest room which was windowless she put him inside you lock the door when i close it and dont open it for anybody but daddy or me im scared hugging him hard so hard it seemed that shed never be able to let go youll be all right i promise she closed the door and heard it lock meg sprinted into the den tore open the gun cabinet door the carbine smelling of oil and sulfur was in her hand the hundredyearold springfield breechloader not muzzleloader oh pellam where are you the saddle ring jingled as she blew dust off the brown metal barrel she found a dozen of the long heavy shells put one in the chamber and the rest in her sweater pocket she closed the breech with a snap and ran into the hall on the first floor she checked the front and back doors they were locked the windows on the ground floor she usually kept them locked but had she aired the house recently she couldnt remember and she wasnt going to check now she paused heard delicate scraping sounds metal and wood being adjusted she walked to the kitchen slow determined okay asshole she thought with both hands pulled the hammer to halfcock footsteps were coming up the stairs meg clicked out the kitchen light she took a deep breath reached forward undid the latch and swung the door open wide she stepped back so fast she almost tripped the man was threequarters up the stairs she couldnt see his face he stopped there was a laugh of surprise he held a flashlight in his hand his high playful voicevaguely familiarsaid meter reader meg said ive got a gun one more step and youre dead the light beam started to sweep toward her shine that light in my eyes and youre dead risky place this house what do you want she tried to keep her voice from quivering just passing go looking for my two hundred but seriously folks tell you what just let me wander out and i wont report you i want you to lie facedown on the floor he laughed uh nothing personal but its not real clean and there might be spiders i dont like spiders now with one thumb she managed to put the gun on full cock the click reverberated through the kitchen he took a step down the stairs he was debating then he said dont think so thanks for the offer but i believe what ill do is leave keep the jewelry the silver wasnt my pattern anyway hey just want to say she held the gun up to her shoulder started to squeeze the trigger he took another two slow steps into the darkness dinner smells great lady sorry i couldnt stay maybe some other time now do it her finger was frozen on the trigger shoot shoot shoot the man disappeared shit she slammed the door slipped the latch and heard him running through the basement she sprinted to the front of the house she peered out through the lace curtains beside the door she couldnt see anyone hell hell hell where is he whered he go pellam she thought please come home keith she started toward sams room which is when the other man stepped into the hall from the living room and got his arm around her chest saying in the same sort of sick voice that his partner had been speaking in whoa my big gun for a little girl my god she recognized him it was one of the twins the ones who owned that disgusting junkyard outside of town billy or bobby had his hand over her face and groping for the stock of the gun trying to pull it out of her strong desperate grip she felt painful pressure on her breast as he fondled her with his other hand hmmmm he said with approval she smelled his cheap musky aftershave and coal tar he was very strong but so was she neither could wrest the gun from the others grip so she pointed the gun into the kitchen and pulled the trigger the explosion filled the hall with sulfurstinking smoke the sanyo microwave blew into a dozen pieces the recoil slammed meg backwards into the twin through the ringing in her ears she heard him inhale in surprise with a resounding crack his head hit the front doorknob ow damn shit that hurts he let go and grabbed his head with both of his hands meg dropped to her knees tore open the breech of the gun the spent cartridge hot and smokey popped out and she reloaded the rifle the twin blinked squeezing the back of his head spun around undoing latches and locks on the front door blood stained the white enamel door and spattered the carpet chain off one latch deadbolt meg slammed the breech closed the door swung open cocking the gun fucking cannon he called to his brother who mustve been outside shes got a fucking cannon then a scream behind her mommy sam had left the guest room and was running down the corridor toward her meg turned toward him no sam no she spun back but it was too late the twin jumped toward her meg couldnt get the gun on fullcock in time and she swung it like a club he caught it easily and jabbed his fist into her jaw mommy sam cried again as she dropped to her knees the brother stepped forward and furious hit her again harder a burst of electric pain just under her ears her vision went black and grainy around the edges she slid down against the cornflowerblue wall tried to get up billy ripped the gun from her hands her head sagged against the wall sam reached her put his arms around her head he screamed go away go away you the twin opened the door and shouted yo bobby its under control come on in bobby walked inside sniffed the air stinks brimstone lookit that thing he nodded at the springfield in admiration then he saw the sheriffs body you have to do that he seen me coming through the window billy said massaging his head where hed struck it on the doorknob the fuck you think i shouldve done said howdydo bobby closed the door looked over at sam hey young fella dont worry youll be okay his brother muttered son of a bitch im bleeding he looked with satisfaction at meg whose head lolled back and forth against the wallpaper her face was white he asked wheres keith meg didnt answer he slapped her hard still silence she was only half conscious no the boy cried wheres your father he hesitated then said hes at the office but hes coming home any minute and hes going to kill you any minute billy repeated looking at his brother but bobby was looking over at the little boy how bout you and me go watch tv or something in the living room there while we wait for him no you dont want me to hit your mommy again do you sam didnt say anything just shook his head wiped tears bobby smiled come on lets you and me go in there billy said we dont have time for that now feeling good that hed thought of something his brother hadnt bobby said we gotta wait anyway dont we may as well enjoy ourselves the roadside signs gave him messages the scientist within keith torrens would see a yellow warning sign with a curve and a side road painted on it and hed think of a sigma bond and his mind would shift into thoughts about electron sharing and the unequal charge distribution in a chloridebromine molecule or hed see a yield sign and think delta and bang there it would be in his thoughts the gibbs freeenergy exchange formula wandering his mind going down those odd paths just like it did when he was a pudgy kid with a slide rule the magic moments happened then too didnt they another signthis one on an old abandoned white castle hamburger stand castle he saw the faded paint of the parapets as he sped past castle medieval castles alchemists he thought about the location scout pellam he was tired it was nearly eleven and hed put in a full fourteen hours at the plant another sunday gone pushing the cougar along the deserted dark road listening to the damn frontend squeak a scientist im a scientist and i cant fix a noisy hunk of metal but none of that mattered the fatigue the squeak the headache he didnt care what was there to bitch about hed buy a new goddamn cougar a cadillac a mercedes he was riding on a magic moment the answer had come all at once at two that afternoon in a crisp unfolding of thoughts that he fought to put into numbers greek letters and scientific symbols he had run from the factory into his office closing the door shutting off the telephone and wrote furiouslyfrantic terrified that hed miss something keith had felt the shock of fear rise up to his scalp like the first and only time he took speedin college struggling to get his masters degree project in on time that warm clarity everything focused sweeping forward a magic moment that the problem solveda new stabilizer for one of his companys cough syrupswasnt exactly earthshattering or in proportion to his euphoria didnt occur to him and if it had the excitement wouldnt be the least dampened the magic worked hed packed a problem into his brain let it bake and out came a solution he was high he was alive those moments validated everythingall the business bullshit he put up with all the long hours the risks the ulcers he was sure he was developing all the time away from meg and sam all of that was paid for in one moment a magic moment thinking about meg and he regretted for the tenth time that day as every day that she couldnt really be a part of what hed done his business shed benefit of course shed be a millionaire too but she couldnt be a partner that was keith torrenss greatest regret castles medieval alchemists alchemy turning gold into brighter gold rings of gold wedding rings meg he remembered a line from some countrywestern stationone that she listened to all the time if we tell a lie while were lying together then thats nothing more than a port in bad weather he wondered again whether she was seeing anyone he didnt think so but keith torrens whod never cheated on his wife believed that while men and women both had an equal capacity for deception women were better equipped to cover their tracks keith empirical rational cartesiana scientist had decided this was because as mothers with broods to attend to and possessing less physical strength than men they had honed their skills in guile for protection a tertiary basic nitrogen so hed found no circumstantial evidence nothing in her eyes no amex receipts he could imagine what bastards those little blue tissue clues must be couldnt recall any times she was supposed to be at home when she wasnt though how would he know he was at the plant twelve hours a day sam had never referred to an uncle whod come to help mommy with the yard the gutters the shopping a quaternary carbon who could be more devoted than he was a better father he never took long business trips like some of the men who worked for the big companies by the hudson he didnt uproot meg and sam and drag them around the country he wasnt like the fellow hed met at the golf course one sunday a friend of a friend who worked for ibm ive been moved down in westchester four houses in six years an ethylene chain and a ketone put them in the oven and let them bake bang a magic moment and out comes something new no she was faithful though questions of fidelity were the type you ask yourself in a certain wayfast distractedso as to avoid the possibility of a real answer a scientist is not equipped to ask questions like that scientists arent happy until they find the truth and he wasnt sure he wanted the truth keith torrens drove toward his home hed make it up to her make up for what he wasnt sure how he didnt know pellam pulled the camper into the driveway he saw the beige car parked in the road just past the drive and thought oh hell no he recognized the car knew who the visitors were thinking about big mountain studios promise to put mobile phones in all the campers none of lefkowitzs minions had ever gotten around to it and here the nearest house was several miles up the road no time to get there no time for anything he doused the lights parked on the grass opened the camper door and climbed out no one inside seemed to have noticed him everything seemed slowed up the way they shoot karate fights in those charmingly bad hong kong karate flicks or the way sam peckinpah shot his violent scenes pellam stepped out of the camper breathing deeply he started toward the house avoiding the gravel at least he had surprise on his side man no question it was fall that smell of the airs dry coldness the sweet scent of oak or cherry fires pellam was thinking how seasonless the big cities are new york la and it was odd how returning to the country during a blatant time of yearthe first deep snow the week of the most colorful leavesis more than anything a return to youth painful nostalgia a rearrangement of priorities and possibilities blatant seasons pellam figured that was a pretty good observation and he wondered if hed live long enough to use it in a film the sky was almost completely clear now swept clean by the cold front he glanced up seeing the stars in the black vacuum that domed over him from one horizon of trees to another a perfect fall night in cleary new york home of the perfect cemetery thats how theyd ended up in cleary in the first place looking for the ideal anumberone cemetery a perfect fall night as he moved over the lawn he saw shadows inside the flicker of a tv screen keiths car was gone so the twins were in there alone with meg and sam he hurried toward the house he slipped the gun in his waistband there was an open window to the right of the door opening into a dark room he could go up a rose trellis and through the window come around from behind two of them both armed probably at least he had surprise on his a car pulled into the driveway catching pellam in its beams it gave a long blare on the horn from the house fifty feet away security lights clicked on blinding him whats going on keith called from the driveway hed parked and gotten out of the car pellam called stay there stay back he turned back to the house the front door opened and one of the twins stepped out holding a pistol at pellams chest so much pellam thought for surprise pellam supposed that hed known all along it would come to this he walked to the right out of the glare onto the driveway gravel scrunching beneath the worn sole of his nokonas he stopped and felt an odd sensationgrowing into the drive like roots going down solid as the granite slabs the gravel used to be hey mister hey mr torrens what the hell quiet pellam ordered keith the man froze this was definitely the ending of a filmnot like one of his though in which viewers felt all that tension then nothing happening the principals moving vaguely off into the credits boy he took flak for those endings resolve it john resolve it how the world hates the truth of ambiguity but here it was pretty damn clear to him a man slouching out onto the porch holding in his hand an automatic pistol meg said she didnt like handguns theyre mankilling guns shed have been thinking no other purpose for them the man slouching you interrupted me the twin said was just about to sit down and watch some tv with a little friend in there and wheres the other one pellam wondered his brother behind him behind me inside with sam wheres meg pellam asked whatcha doin here mister which onere you bobby hey dont you move there mr torrens you do ill have to kill you too pellam asked you the one who did it did what killed my friend spose you know if i tell you ill have to make sure that fact doesnt go any further thats pretty much on the agenda anyway isnt it pellam asked heh i just want to know if it was you killed marty was a hell of a shot i do say so myself not smirking just mentioning the fact whatcha got there bobby asked in your belt itd be a colt peacemaker no kidding smokeless powder reproduction nope its the real thing no kidding fortyfour fortyfive heh wheres your brother maybe hes behind you so youll die first pellam said heh please keith was begging wheres my son they both ignored him there was no motion pellam stood on the wet gravel his feet in scuffed black boots slightly apart there was no noise there was nothing else in the world except a man standing in front of him with a gun in his hand a tall victorian house with a woman and boy inside her husband nearby under a canopy of a dry clear fall night pellam had shot ducks and geese and a number of gila monsters and rattlesnakes and hundreds of heineken bottles hed never shot a man the security lights poured into his eyes making bobby a silhouette pellam recalled that on various target ranges hed shot as many silhouette targets as gila monsters and rattlesnakes combined no face no motion no sound in the stillness in this dense peace a thought came to him something he remembered from researching a script about the indians of the great plains the sioux he believed waking up on a beautiful day they wouldnt think how good it was to be alive what theyd say was its a good day to die good pellam good thought well wild bill himself hadnt lived to see forty then finally motion intruded on the scene it was a clichéone that pellam if he were directing a western wouldnt have allowed the writer to use he pulled his blue jean jacket open slightly wider to fully expose the grip of his pistol the way bobby saw it bobby who had shot a manseveral of them in factbut only in the backs of their heads after being paid ten thousand dollars each to do it these were good odds pellam had glare in his eyes and he had a singleaction gun so hed have to draw and cock it before he could shoot it was a sixshot gun and it would take probably three minutes to reload if he had extra ammo on him which he probably didnt also he figured pellam hadnt shot anybody in the back of the head or anyplace else for any money bobby on the other hand was already holding a cocked browning automatic with twelve rounds in it which all you had to do was aim and pull the trigger the light was behind him he could reload the browning in two seconds torrens was in the yard true but he wasnt going to do diddly except stand there like a scared rabbit he hoped billy was watching him he never missed a chance to impress his smarter brother what hed do is let the guy go for the gun then shoot him in his leg watch him fall then let him crawl a little shoot again maybe hed aim for pellams boots they were a good contrast black on the white gravel but so were the mans eyes which glinted two reflections from the yellow porch light and his white shirt under the dark jacket but then he decided there was something about the way the man had opened his jacket that made bobby uneasy dont play games do pellam do torrens go back to the boy or the mother or both go for a chest shot without really deciding or thinking bobby dropped into a crouch he swept the gun upward in an arc keeping his arm straight the way he knew to do and practiced every week none of this twohand combat shooting that nobody who knows guns really ever does squinting but leaving both eyes open as the blade sight rose right toward the white slash of pellams shirt he started to pull the trigger thunk a shovel bobby thought goddamn who did that somebodyd snuck up and hit him in the chest with a shovel or damn it hurt he coughed or maybe it was an ax handle bobby dropped his unfired gun he looked down whered it go he looked behind him there was nobody he looked at his chest again and saw the blood oh that hurts he was getting dizzy then he saw pellam holding the colt at his hip surrounded by a cloud of smoke bobby reached for his gun he fell to the porch he looked for the shovel he asked who he died pellam spun around looked behind him into the fields to the side of the house no billy he whispered to keith get down dont move and started forward but he didnt get very far the door crashed open and billy staggering out dropped to his knees over bobby shrieking he lifted his own gun and fired sloppily at pellam ragged blue flashes appeared in the mans hand the huge crack of the shots filling the night a bullet popped the sound barrier inches from his left ear with the noise of a huge snapping finger all pellam had time for was one shot from his hip he felt the kick smelled the sulfur from the black powder he saw the slug dig out a chunk of the porch billy fired fast and pellam dove to the ground he hit hard landed on his right elbow there was a loud snap followed by breathtaking pain his vision went black and dusty from the dislocation he rolled onto his back his shoulder joint popped back into alignment he fainted for a second sweat shot from his forehead and he felt nausea in a bristling wave he lifted the colt it fell from his hand his right arm was useless bobby oh bobby billy was moaning more shots from the automatic bullets dug into the camper and the ground near him six shots seven eight sonabitchsonabitch son of a bitch pellam lifted the colt again but it was a replaythe gun did a double gainer to the ground christ how many shots in that clip ten eleven twelve click click click empty he was out thank you pellam raised his head and watched billy reload pellam felt the cold wet touch of the gravel smelled the sour earthyoily scent of the stone he saw billy coming closer he lowered his head and heard the crunch of the gravel under the mans loafers pellam grabbed for the colt he hit the butt with his fingers and knocked it out of reach he heard the mans breathing pellam looked up opened his eyes he saw the bore of the gun in the mans hand six feet away billy stopped a good day to die billy stopped he looked behind him as if hed heard something then he was flying through the air sailing the way stunt men did off springboards mounted on either side of black powder charges in the war movies billy sprawled on top of pellam knocking the wind out of him with a high lovemaking grunt the twin rolled over uttered bobby then studied the gravel an inch away from his face son of a bitch he closed his eyes son of a bitch he shuddered once and was still pellam pushed himself up fainted for a few seconds he came to then sat up again in front of him on the porch meg was crying clutching the smoking springfield she dug frantically into her pocketsfor more ammunition he guessed meg he called its okay theyre gone theyre both gone but she paid no attention dropped to her knees and slid a new shell into the gun cocked it with both hands she stood once more wiped tears and scanned the yard like a sentry then returned to the house calling to her son you all right keith asked pellam nodded gasping at the pain and keith continued into the house following meg pellam made sure that billy was dead then staggered inside he found them in the living room keiths arm around meg standing over tom the sheriff he was dead meg looked toward the front door at pellam with eyes wide in terror keith was on his knees hugging sam who glanced at pellam but said nothing he was crying did they hurt you keith asked the boy shook his head meg crying too gasped he was going to he took him in there she nodded toward the living room but then they heard the horn and he went outside to see who it was oh honey keith stood and meg lowered her head to keiths shoulder what happened keith muttered honey your phone in the car weve got to call the police my phone in the car they cut the line here the phone doesnt work i left it at the factory he said he seemed numb unable to say any more than a few words at a time then drive to the burkes use theirs what happened i dont he looked around the house i dont understand it was so terrible why was tom here keith asked meg glanced at sam and whispered something to her husband he frowned she nodded then one of them shot tom they got in somehow i dont know why i have no idea why keith said nothing for a moment just stared at the sheriffs body he glanced at sam im going to take you up to bed your mother and i have to talk keith meg started after him but pellam wincing at the pain in his shoulder stepped forward touched her arm meg wait father and son disappeared up the stairs she turned youre hurt sit down meg hesitated i have to talk to you i have to tell you why i came back tonight she was staring at tom keith has to call he has to go to the burkes meg listen to me tonight i went to see your friend she stiffened and her attention on the body in her living room vanished my friend she asked ambler she considered this then asked how did you know he was my friend we had a talk pellam paused looking at the stairs but keith was still with sam he added he likes you he likes you a lot she wasnt sure what to do with this information she found an afghan placed it over the sheriffs head and chest pellam wanted to put his arm around her but he would probably have fainted any motion was pure pain in his shoulder why did you go to see him meg asked i thought he mightve been the one who had marty killed what pellam shook his head he didnt but he did plant the drugs and he had me beat up wex wouldnt do but her voice faded and she obviously concluded that yeah he could very easily do that the reason he did it was that he was afraid i was going to take you away with me he did she looked troubled but he wondered if he wasnt seeing a little pride in her face too there probably isnt a woman in the world who isnt thrilled by a man who goes to those kind of lengths to keep her for himself we decided it was probably the twins who were behind the shooting i went to their junkyard that shack of theirs i found the gun they killed marty with some other things too i found footsteps nearby keith walked slowly down the stairs he caught pellams eyes and paused then continued sams okay i gave him something hes sleeping meg ignored him said to pellam why are you telling me this but keith preempted her hed overheard pellam and he asked what else did you find in the shack pellam said to meg i found some of that stuff the drugs sam got so theyre the ones she blurted theyre the ones behind it but why would they come here because sam was a witness they werent after sam keith had stopped walking he sat down pellam said to him they had five or six thousand vials there all packaged and ready to go so keith tell me were they distributing or were they skimming from you keiths eyes swam around the room both apparently meg stared at her husband what do you mean your partners came here to kill you pellam said and your family partners meg gasped pellam said to keith would they have enough information to make the drugs themselves could they do it without your factory keith didnt say anything both apparently keith looked at the wall beyond which two of his employees lay i paid them enough theres never enough howd you find out pellam said in one of the bags in their shack were notes from you some of your letterhead some cash he nodded i came here to tell meg she turned to pellam wanted to say something it seemed but couldnt keith said they were just punks but they had contacts in new york new jersey brooklyn i needed them pellam asked what is it exactly the drug keith explained its an oral synthetic narcotic to her husband meg whispered no this isnt happening keith took a breath and pellam could see he was running through the inventory of lies he might choose from a boy in front of a broken window he looked at both pellam and meg and said its not what you think no no no she shook her head meg its just a product i product meg said this shit is poison and you call it a product you dont understand meg he snapped its not like that what is it like then its a fantastic discovery it took me two years to perfect it discovery pellam said wryly state of the art normally heroin you have to shoot up to get the best rush this stuff all you do is chew it keith said what i developed was a new vasodilator its brilliant the narcotic goes into the blood cells under the tongue in milliseconds pellam continued a new yuppie drug of choice no need to shoot up no needles no aids risk keith said i was going to license it i mean i am going to license it for legitimate medical purposes we just needed a little more capital we were going to distribute samples to medical research companiesyou dont need fda approval for that but dale started selling underground to get some cash flow by the time i found out we were in too deep liar no meg really she stepped toward him tell me how my poor baby got in too deep you and dale had cash from day one you bought out your contract oh you had somebody bankrolling you and knew exactly who you were going to sell this shit to from the day you opened your factory stop it tell me how someone put a gun to your head and forced you to she stopped speaking frowned wait more horror in her eyes and what happened to him to dale he keith looked away they killed him those twins why was he getting too greedy it all got out of hand keith said furiously it wasnt my fault she was continuing and those other men the ones from new york and the boy who overdosed last year and ned this morning they killed him too and tom thought sam had done it oh jesus christ and marty pellam said it took keith a moment to realize who marty was he said that was an accident i swear to god bobby and billy were trying to scare the two of you out of here thats all we didnt want strangers in town we couldnt risk any publicity pellam said accident you killed your partner and who knows who elseand you expect me to believe that you just wanted to scare marty meg incredulous shaking her head slowly her pony tail lolling and you almost killed our son i told them nodding in the direction of the front yard never to sell to anybody around here but they didnt listen to me it wasnt my fault i not your fault you made it and now youre selling it how do you mean its not your fault explain that to me keith keith couldnt hold her eyes any longer and looked down she simply shook her head her rage was too great pellam could see that hed fallen into a particular personaone that must have suckered meg all along keith the boy with the thick hair the round face imploring needing love the pudgy boy we have nothing to talk about nothing at all please let me explain she turned to look at him as he slouched in the doorway pressing against the jamb with his shoulder as if he needed the house itself to hold him upright meg said youve lied to me all along i didnt want to tell you for your own protection meg said bitterly how did you figure that if anything were to happen i didnt want you to be involved she laughed in astonishment how wouldnt i be involved my husbands making drugs how wouldnt sam and i be sucked right into the middle of it i mean look what happened the other day with sam he couldve died that wont happen again she was crying now oh god keith you sound like youre not going to stop toms dead therere two bodies in my front yard its over with were calling the police no meg what ive come up with its magic his eyes gleamed nobodys

as everybody else my mind doesnt walk it runs i was born that way im not like you or him he glanced at pellam or anybody but we loved each other meg cried what does that have to do with anything dont sound so selfrighteous i did it for you and for sam why do you think you were always harping about a nice house having money your fucking jewelry how was i supposed to do that on a chemists salary he pointed to her ring you think i could afford that if i was still at sandberg are you seriously trying to blame me you should blame whatevers in you that makes you think youve got a different set of rules than everybody else and what were just supposed to forget everything thats happened well im not forgetting sam and i are leaving youre going with him keith glanced at pellam his voice was filled with disbelief im just leaving thats the only explanation i owe you sam and i were both leaving you cant just desert me desert you meg laughed the tension in the room was like energy itself im not going to let that happen keiths voice jarred in the room a sound to match the glare of light youre my wife youre staying with me in six months ill have the patent and ill stop selling on the street well get a license from pfizer or merck well tell the state police the twins tried to break in and rape you tom was here about sam and they killed him we can say no more her eyes closed and her head moved back and forth slowly no more she stood up were not staying here tonight meg no he wasnt a boy any longer he was mean dark brooding their words swirled around pellam as they talked husband and wife he heard what they said and he observed their expressions but it was from a distance here you come with your van and your camera studying the town talking to people getting to know everyone getting to know some of them very well you dont understand the power youve got but no he thought i have no power nothing he could say or do could teach them about happiness and lift them out of the ruts theyd fallen into he made movies he helped people escape from their lives sure but only for two hours and only in that one special place a darkened movie theater im leaving now keith focused on pellam said to him you mention this to anyone i guess you can figure out whatll happen to them he nodded toward meg what are you saying keith she asked pellam said hes saying that if i go to the police even if he beats the murder charges therell be a rico case against him the us attorneyll close up the factory and take the house and your savings keith nodded thatll be on your conscience pellam laughed said nothing he looked at meg you want a ride someplace family or friends nearby keith said shes not coming with you thats not your decision meg said to pellam let me get sam keith said meg youre my wife you stop it she screamed keith the boy keith the man stopped speaking you dont own me im leaving pellam sensed it then in an intuitive flash he knew a combination of things told himthe peripheral sight of keith reaching for his waistband his gasping breath the click of spring metal the sound of a gun cockingbobbys of course which pellam had forgotten about left lying under the twins body on the front porch keith had retrieved it on his way inside the house the click that was almost hidden by a rising shout a single word one wordhis own namefilling the night as keith shoved the gun toward him and wailed in primitive rage pellam no keith meg cried pellams left hand shot forward in a futile automatic gesture to ward off the scalding bullet a ringing explosion the muzzle blast struck him in the face and hand meg screamed john they froze like children playing the game of statue three of them there was an endless moment of silence the sweet piquancy of smoke filling the room the gun fell from keiths hand to the floor and with a wail of anguish he dropped to his knees pellam waiting for the pain the blackness the crawl of blood stood completely still nothing he was unhurt the man had missed from fifteen feet away keith had missed he whispered to meg its all right im okay she was shaking her head whatm i going to do about this what pellam asked meg didnt answer her head was lowered in concentration frowning as she studied the diamonds on her finger look at this ring look at it what a mess meg held up her hand covered with the blood that spread from the front of her blouse can you help me ill never get it clean her smile faded her eyes fluttered closed can you help me she whispered as she spiraled slowly to the floor can you trudie tanned and darkhaired and modelthin the best calves of any women hed ever known but alas no freckles anywhere on her body drove east on santa monica moving slowly in the morning traffic toward the expressway john pellam sat on the passenger side of her white mercedes sl he sat silently with his suitcase purchased on main street cleary not rodeo drive on his lap trudie was animated she was preoccupied with a teleplay lorimar was kicking around she had a fiftytwo percent interest in the property he thought thats what shed told him the radio was loud and she nodded in time to the beat smiling broadly though pellam knew that what she hummed was the tune of business not a top hit pellam thought she was a wonderful woman hed enjoyed going out with her hed enjoyed staying with her lying in a huge bed sipping sweet liquor drinks on a cement patio high above a junglish canyon trudie had a faller house they passed the park in beverly hills where one morningmust have been five amhed found tommy bernstein in a tuxedo passed out pellam himself had been wasted tommy had said to him fuck its the us cavalry get me home am i in bed i dont think so no i dont get me home after much time and effort pellam had at tommys funeral the minister had been a hired gun which wasnt too surprising since tommy hadnt been inside a church in thirty years the somber man said a lot of innocuous things genericbrand sentiments not to put that down of course pellam thought the doughy old guy with the stiff white collar had done a good job under the circumstances the lively spirit that thomas had the spirit that touched us all with the love for the characters he played well tommyd have said barf on that and howled but that was hardly the ministers fault the funeral had been near the intersection they were passing through just then avenue of the stars i talked to that exec producer trudie liked that shortening words and slinging them around exec photog res as in make a res at a restaurant yeah he asked brightly he was like beside himself yeah pellam couldnt remember exactly which exec she was talking about or why he was or should be beside himself they drove in silence through that brilliant light california light that seems to bring out some essential radiation from the grass and trees it gets right in your face like a beautiful obnoxious teenage girl from behind his sunglasses pellam watched the scenery and the carsa thousand german cars it seemedmoving opposite toward hollywood wont be back for a while huh probably not trudie didnt answer just squeezed his knee she turned the radio up they were in beverly hills sentiment didnt exist so she said you sure you want to do this yep he said and didnt add anything else ten silent minutes later she dropped him at the airport he didnt want or expect her to get out they kissed like siblings and the only clues to the deepest moments of their onagain offagain year together was a shallow shaking of her head and the sad mystified smile she lapsed into from time to time call me sometime she said pellam promised that he would he handed his suitcase to the curbside checkin attendant and when he turned back trudie was gone john pellam sat on a hundredyearold gravestone looking out over this upstate new york valley filled with trees gone to vibrant yellow red the sun had just disappeared under a row of clouds and the beautiful scenery had taken on an ominous nature adding to which was the young man moving stealthily toward pellam he was dressed in a dark shirt and jeans when he was twenty feet away the man paused and closed his eyes as if finding strength from somewhere then drew a black pistol from his back pocket he started forward once more pellam rose from the cold stone and squinted at the furtive approach suddenly motion on the ground nearby the man reared back in surprise and stumbled over a low tombstone jesus christ he called dropping the pistol what came a booming voice from a loudspeaker it attacked me the man called standing up and brushing grass from his slacks the electronic voice of god yelled cut it cut what the hell happened the field filled with people the crew walked around from behind the panaflex camera makeup went to work on the actors face he called a squirrel he attacked me a stuntman grabbed his jacket and leapt into the graveyard crying toro toro hilarious the director called sarcastically through the loudspeaker pellam walked away from the gravestone and sat down in an old greenplaid lawn chair next to his winnebago he said you cold you want to go inside meg squeezed his hand and said no i wouldnt miss this for anything i want a continuous shot the director sighed and walked back to the camera somebody from wardrobe was rolling up the actors cuffs so they wouldnt get dark from the moisture on the grass the continuity girl began making notes of his position when the wild animal had attacked and the location of all the cameras and backgrounds whats the take thatll be eight someone called jesus and well lose the light in ten minutes whats the weather supposed to be tomorrow rain jesus pellam and meg watched the crew in the field he said thats the movies for you do it over and over then you wait for a while and do it again but sam at least was enjoying himself even if he would have preferred a space wars flick or something with machinegunning robots over some stupid love story called to sleep in a shallow grave mostly it was the huge complicated camera that he loved wow hed say to pellam its like a spaceship and pellam got the okay from the director of photography to put him in the operators seat for a few minutes alan lefkowitz ducked out of his honey wagon and trooped toward the director he was wearing his play clothes his onset clotheschinos and a redandwhite striped shirt pellam told meg thats what the refs would wear if hollywood had its own hockey team the producer said hey johnny to pellam he lifted his hand which held an invisible glass of a very expensive singlemalt scotch and raised his eyebrows pellam said cant ive got plans around here lefkowitz joked gazing longingly at megs jeansclad butt and began waving papers at the director again so pellam said whats happening in cleary she laughed and didnt answer lets go for a walk thatd be okay theyve got the telephoto on we walk that way toward the forest we wont be in view you feeling okay hell yes she took the cane and got up without his help they walked past the crowd of locals which had grown by the dozens with each day of shooting smalltown life had skidded to a stop for the duration of the principal photography the spectators were enthralled with everythingeven the squirrel attackand they stood silent and frozen as if their fidgeting motion might knock the magic camera to the ground meg and pellam walked a short distance down the road meg glancing back every few minutes to keep sam in view she said the doctor told me if id see a physical therapist and get some exercise the limp would go away in a month and i see all these young professional gals on tv running and doing aerobics and lifting weights it all looks so silly ill wait till it goes away by itself hows the brokerage business sold a house last week got a couple of maybebutletmeaskmywife nobody said its easy hows he doing pellams head swivelled back toward sam we keep talking about it i dont want to but i think its for the best thats what the therapist says get it out get everything out maybe its best for me too samll say tell me again about daddy and we have our talk and he understands or he says he does i dont of course what do you hear from him keith trials next month pellam nodded theyre going after your house its a possibility my lawyer says theres a chance well lose it but that also means theres a chance we wont he felt her eyes turn toward him a pause then she said im seeing my friend again ambler he was real good after i got hurt he seems like a nice guy for a neobircher rampant capitalist bigot i didnt really want to at first i mean you dont have to explain pellam said she looked at the horizon i know i dont she smiled pellam you think her voice faded he had a great deal and concluded that the answer was pretty clear and they both knew it he didnt answer or look at her and she didnt repeat the question they came to a signon the edge of the road facing away from the shooting welcome to simmons in the beautiful catskills population what was it when you grew up here meg asked the population i mean oh i dont remember i think maybe the same as cleary how come theyre shooting here its a dirty little town thats what i needed for the story they liked your screenplay after all huh most of it of course the directors ignoring my camera directions why dont you tell him writers dont tell directors where to put the camera except euphemistically and only after they get paid why didnt you set the movie in cleary weve got a better cemetery here he nodded back toward the actor for the shooting scene and the funeral later when janice confronts shep better cemetery than clearys im insulted pellam looked at her hair now cut short revealing a good dusting of freckles on the back of her neck the countrygirl jeans a blue saks work shirt brown suede boots tonight he said lets have dinner at the inn okay just the two of us she wont mind meg nodded up the road toward pellams childhood home three miles away meaning pellams mother shes seen more of me in the past week than she has in the past five years shell be glad to get rid of me she doesnt cotton to men who drink whiskey well loan her sam for the evening a film crew assistant a young woman in jeans and a brusheddenim jacket a fringe of curly hair crowning her forehead patrolled the road like an israeli soldier a huge walkietalkie bounced on her hip he asked meg when are you going back to cleary tomorrow we can only stay the night i dont want to keep sam away from home too long its better i think meg was looking down at the long grass in the coming dusk the day was taking on a sepia atmosphere very still quiet he motioned her to follow and walked slowly into the graveyard he pointed to a grave ten years old meg looked at it your fathers name was benjamin after benjamin franklin he said meg said im surprised he didnt name you william william after wild bill your ancestor pellam gave an exaggerated sigh his name was james not william james butler hickok oh right you told me they heard the assistant director call through the bullhorn quiet everybody quiet down pellam and meg paused and watched the scene begin again the actor stalking slowly through the tombstones ready to murder meg said so youre a writer now nope still unemployed lefkowitzs gotta give me a writers credit but thats only because of the guild im just here in case they need to doctor it im still canned im guilty of the worst crime in hollywood aggravating a producers ulcer so write more scripts pellam laughed and looked at his watch when the mood takes me ive got a freelance scouting job in utah they heard the rise and fall of the actors voices then the directors staticky shout in the bullhorn cut cut somebody you yes you get that effing squirrel out of here i dont believe it i do not believe it they returned to the camper and sat down in the lawn chairsslowly meg because of the gunshot pellam because of the popped shoulder any chance youd get back east lots of movies to be made meg said if you do why dont you come upstate for a visit samd like it pellam stretched his legs out in front of him the sharp tips of his stained nokonas pointed up toward the gray sky suppose its a possibility he said and they watched the crew fan out into the cemetery to adjust the grass pluck up leaves fix makeup straighten cuffs chase a squirrel toward the trees everyone serious everyone rushed trying to get one more take in the can before the november darkness fell
