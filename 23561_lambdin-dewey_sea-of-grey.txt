dewey lambdin sea of grey lewrie in memory of genoa who passed over last memorial day weekend dont worry hon good cats go to heaven if they didnt whats the point of people getting there sleep safe and say hello to sister foozle til we all meet again and to the two new bubbas who turned up like the shepherd in terry kays to dance with the white dog on the counter of the vets office like serendipity mostly whitefurred playful mischievous clever impish and talkative mosby and forrest you boys get outta the dish cabinet right now hear prologue troubles hurt the most when they prove selfinflicted sophocles chapter one supping with his father was not exactly alan lewries idea for how he had intended to complete his personal celebrations after a day of honour and fame but after the disastrous shambles in hyde park he found himself at rather greater than loose ends with his only ally in the world that cynical corinthian that shameless old rakehell and charter member of the infamous hellfire club to wit majorgeneral sir hugo st george willoughby knight of the garter with his sardonic acidic jollity with his perpetual leer for all things feminine but he was paying so given sir hugos sportin nature it was no wonder that they had ended the evening at the cocoa tree one of the fastest gambling establishments in london ostensibly a proprietary coffeehouse where men of the tory persuasion were wont to gather it set a magnificent table and was all the go with those wealthy enough or foolish enough to riffle the cards in the long rooms or lay side wagers even to take an insurance policy on someone elses life ie to wager just when a certain cove would croak least it ain t a cock and hen club lewrie thought most pleasantly stuffed and whiffled by then im in enough trouble for a time it had seemed as if one of those shadier establishments might feature in the afternoon and nights activities as he and his father had made the rounds first had come a gentlemanly tavern near sir hugos old haunts in st jamess square for a few badly needed stiff ones followed by a saunter east to the theatre district for a lively farce which was followed by a patriotic display in honour of admiral duncan and the battle of camperdownwith offers of gallons of free drink from fellow theatre patrons near their box and sir hugo gallantly stroking the mustachios he did not have reducing the slaver lewrie thought it as he boldly gazed down the bodices of the promising young ladies or leered at the eager young orangesellers followed by a traipse through covent gardens vast and crowded arcade where anything or anyone could be had at a decent price if one but haggled a bit where smuggled french champagne had been prominently featured lewrie was pretty sure thence here to the cocoa tree and a lashing or two more of wine accompanying supper along with the odd revivor brandy now the port squinting only just a tad to maintain focus lewrie studied the many ladies present strolling and flouncing past the communal table at which he and his father had shared supper with a pack of strangers a lively pack of roisterers in the main but new to both of them the cocoa tree maintained a certain air of proper decorum just as the resort at bath did only true ladies welcome in society with a requisite purseful of chink and the itch to risk it were allowed quite unlike his dissolute youth in the prenavy days when he and his usual mob of bucksofthefirsthead had frequented places like the spread eagle in the strand the highflyer at the old turf coffeehouse or the free and easy where after the theatre or long before the fast the poor and the criminal could commingle drink and chorus with the prettier doxies of whatever class or station and arrange what sport they wished upstairs at a nearby bagnio or bythehour rooming house oh how hed crowed back then all cockawhoop in harmony with the hens spending money like a drunken sailor which he squiffily realised he was both in the nautical and the drunken sense just a bloody nuisance his father sir hugo was saying in aspersion as he wiped his mouth with a napkin as his plate of pudding was whisked away by a tableservant women should not gamble anymore than they should attempt to smoke or curse to which their companions attable grunted their amiable and dismissive agreements had i the tin id found a manonly club gentlemen somewhat like the cocoa tree whites almacks or boodles with the ladies allowed in to dine and be decorative surely but shoo them out by midnight make a male sanctuary before they overrun all our masculine institutions by the battalions dash it all a place where men may rest twixt entertainments perhaps with lodgings where a feller may let down his hair and put up his feet hear hear one of their fellow diners cheered gentlemen of standing and quality only allowed he posed drawing agreement from several others who had been seated by twos or singletons at their long table hitormiss an intown retreat for serving officers say another opined reasonably priced of course so we wont have to hunt high and low for lodgings each time we come up to london like a regimental mess a wardroom or the gentleman in army uniform a captain of foot proposed he was well turned out but half his worth was surely on his back lewrie thought not in his purse or with his banker what say you captain lewrie the army man asked him an intriguing idea most lewrie answered which was about all he could manage as a belch arose redolent of baked sole roast beef pigeon pie and wine a refuge from domesticity he glumly supposed to which sentiment all eight men present voiced an earnest ever and amen with a hearty rumbling cheer though his father peered over at him with a chary cuttyeyed look of pending disapproval sir hugo had warned him that should he turn maudlin and weepy hed deny knowing him and leave him to stew in his own misery quite intriguin captain browne sir hugo mused louder than necessary perhaps to draw attention from his son to himself after a stern silent warning which came off as most of sir hugos facial expressions as a nettled falcons leer before prosing on the best part of a coffeehouse in the mornings with rafts of daily papers good conversation good wine cellar with decent sets of rooms to let for membersonly when down from the country members of parliament for serving officers as you suggest captain browne an establishment that offers only the freshest victuals so that no one dies for tryin the fare at a twopenny ordinary haw exactly general willoughby another of their fellow diners opined in a plumby voice with annual dues and daily charges just high enough to dissuade the lower orders but within the reach of purses of most gentlemen with requirements mark you sirs for good character and decorous gentlemanly behaviour the very idea of a reference from ones vicar as part of ones bona fides set them back in a stunned silence for a moment the fellow was soberdressed spare and gauntlookin was he a dissenter one of those killjoys well thatd let me out and father too lewrie told himself within the club of course sirs the fellow amended quickly seeing the response hed drawn mean tsay run riot on your own but damme if ill tolerate hoorawin drunks who drop their shoes and giggle past my bedtime schoolboy antics sons down from university with all their silly carryingson well that was alright then one of their fellow diners looked ready to call for quill ink and paper to begin setting down the bylaws instanter grandly liveried waiters set out fresh glasses dishes of grapes and berries plates of sliced cheeses with both sweet and salted biscuits before them along with baskets of assorted nuts with shell bowls and nutcrackers sir hugo sternly proposed a toast to the king safe to do with the water glasses removed so toasting hanoverian george iii could not be rendered into one for the exiled stuart claimant the king over the water by a sly pass of ones port glass gentlemen allow me to propose our second captain browne said as he got to his feet in honour of our dining companion who fought at camperdown and won us the marvellous victory all england celebrates tonight to the royal navy and camperdown navy and camperdown they concisely echoed on their feet lewrie too rose though a naval officer never stood to toast the king if he valued his scalp low deck beams made their own tradition which sentiment was quickly followed by a toast to admiral duncan now made baron duncan of lundie and viscount duncan of camperdown then followed by a toast to lewrie himself as a representative of the fleet that had won the victory through which he modestly sat forming turns of phrase in his head for the expected gallant response gentlemen my thanks to you for the honour though i must confess that my part in the battle was not that significant he answered in kind though the gold camperdown medal bestowed upon him by the king that afternoon tinkled against the matching battle of cape st vincent medal pshaw sir hugo objected you took one of their frigates their boisterous toasting and cheering had drawn enough notice from the elegant crowd in the dining rooms but his father said it loud enough to turn it into an attentiongetting boast on the spawn of his loins allow me to answer with a threefold proposal alan said as he got to his feet a trifle unsteadily making a supportive triangle from the fingers of his right hand for a moment before taking up a refilled glass of port to hold before him and peer into its semiopaque redness as if for inspiration first for my ship the proteus frigate the finest soundest fifth rate that ever swam secondly to her crew the bravest tars ever plied rammer rope or cutlass from highest to lowest they produced victory evry man jack and lastly to our recent foes the dutch they fought us englishfashion hulltohull yardarmtoyardarm and held stout to the last past the time when their hopes were gone gentlemen i give you hms proteus her crew and a worthy foe proteus tarssailorsyer crew the dutchfoes others babbled mangling his toast lewrie feared it would be too much for them but to blazes with that he thought they were lusty and loud and that was what countedloud enough to raise huzzahs from the onlookers too whod been drawn by the noise at their table tryin tprove yer sobriety his father teasingly said as he seated himself again showin how you can still form compound sentences this late wanted it out and done before i went under the table lewrie told him else wed all be halfseasover before we got round to the toasts to the ladies quite a few of the onlookers were fashionably dressed ladies in company of male companions or two women out together despite the rigid rules of london society dashing unconventional morts who ogled him as openly as hed ogle them given the chance a mixture of hero worship sympathy for his noblywounded wing that broken left arm still hung in a neat slingone or two licking their lips and halflidding eyes here captain lewrie the elegantly dressed man mr lumsden whom theyd discovered was a city banker demanded the papers dont tell us half of how twas done do give us your account of it tell us the whole tale aye and leave nought out another pressed well lewrie said unwillingly forced to his feet again by their enthusiasm and the chance to preen for an audience i will need the biscuits nuts and such if you really insist a row of salted biscuits quickly formed the dutch coast while walnuts became ships of the line and smaller hickories became frigates and sloops of war lewrie looked at his creation trying to picture a birds view from the confused smoke and hazeriddled scene hed had from his quarterdeck wondering where or how to start to explain it at all how does one reorganise chaos when we sighted them the wind was out of the nornorwest and fairly strong he said arrowing a hand slantwise at the long line of dutch ships im told they had been sailing easterly making for calais and the channel but came about when our scouting frigates got hullup on em running the abstemious gentleman pronounced or luring us into shoal water where their shallowdraught ships could fight sir lewrie corrected him the coast was only five miles or so to loord and it shoals quickly like tilting this table just a bit at low tide a man could wade out half a mile and be only up to his chest by then last cast of the log showed ten fathom only sixty feet of water well need a translator for all the nautical jargon one of the diners hooted the dutch had sixteen ships of the line well lighter than ours really and not all of em built as warships converted dutch east indiamen trapped in home ports lewrie went on admiral duncan had eight ships in his division with his flagship venerable in the very lead here he said pointing to the easternmost gaggle and viceadmiral onslows division with monarch in the lead were quite a bit west of duncans strung out all higgledypiggledly dye see in no proper order since some of the older ships were poor sailers even off the wind round eleven of the morning admiral duncan even had to haul up to windward and beat back towards onslows group so we could go in as a fleet not a complete shambles venerable ardent and triumph had led two rd rate s with a twodecker a following wedge was made up of a lone gunner bedford flanked by a pair of s lancaster and capt william breadfruit blighs hms director a third trio in loose order was even further astern belliqueiux a gunner supported by two old twodeck gun th rate ships adamant and his viceadmiral onslows group to the west had his flagship monarch in the lead with powerful and monmouth echeloned off to her right and stern another pair of s with a aft of them sailed a brace of rd rate s russel and montagu trailing them was another pair the gunned veteran and the gun frigate beaulieu well there should have been a third gun rd rate with them hms agincourt but she was far astern and damn her capt williamson for hanging back the entire three hours of the battle not the strongest fleet gentlemen lewrie said after naming them the rest we frigates and gunboats were in the centre rose active and martin were lineahead together a pair of twelvegunned sloops with a sixteengunner near their larboard side were diligent and king george hired cutters with six and twelve guns speculator astern of them was a hired lugger with only eight guns the circe frigate was here east of the sloops and cutters and my own ship was here a bit east of circe and nigh level with captain blighs ship director well perhaps a tad ahead of her nearer the bedford he said shifting a hickory nut forward a halfinch we were about four miles to windward of em when duncan gave a signal to bear down and engage em we repeated the signal then bore off easterly with a touch of southing to pin the dutch against their own coast as it trends northerly translator an idle stroller who had come to observe over the others shoulders cried this way lewrie grinned employing a nutcracker for use as a windpointer with the wind large on our larboard quarters admiral duncan hoisted orders as we neared them first to pass through their line and engage from leeward meaning to break their line apart with a pair of hammerblows gainst their centre and rear it was cloudy and hazy so how many ships got that signal i cant say after that he flew close action i really do think did he have to go aground and fight them on dry land hed have done so admiral duncan is a terror sirs a right terror duncan that giant with the full unruly mane of snowwhite hair on his head that tall athletic form that towered over sixfeetfour of the massive calves that made the ladies swoon when he donned silk stockings as hardy and strong as a scots ghillie who had coursed the highlands like an elkhound since childhood twas said of him that during the recent naval mutiny at the nore and his own harbour of great yarmouth duncan had seized one of the ringleaders by the scruff of the neck held him out arm horizontal dangling a fullgrown man over the side of his flagship til the canting bastard squealed for mercy lewrie related a man of great anger too whod prefer the ancient punishment for blasphemy of searing the malefactors tongue with a hot iron was he able to get away with it a man who wore an odd double ring on his left hand encircling little finger and ring finger so he still had use of that hand hed broken it and turned those fingers numb by smashing the skull of a rioter in a street melee in edinborough in the churl had insulted the king raising duncan s old testament wrath sirs admiral duncan would fight you for a rowboat lewrie proudly boasted happy to have been even for a short time a part of the mans fleet though how long that would last was open to question he took time to fret after his row with his wife in hyde park with both lord spencer and mr nepean watching the proper place for frigates is not in the line sirs lewrie continued striking a lighthearted air but out in clear air where one repeats signals for other ships to see or stands by to assist any disabled ships of the line had i not made an error wed have been merely awed witnesses but wed gotten too far ahead and circe was crowding us sailing on starboard tack cross our stern and all of the cutters and such crowded us as well did the admiral wish us to break the dutch line and fight on their landward side we should have broken through with him but for the wind that had blown all the powder smoke alee of us towards the shore i should have borne away and stayed up to windward but that became impossible i could not cut through the liners without disrupting what order they had either so there was nothing for it but to come about on a beam wind and sail on a reach by then however round half past noon admiral onslow was engaged over here cuttin through the dutch line and slicing off the last three ships so i rather um stumbled my way to glory if glory it was gentlemen he allowed with a wry expression aye come over all modestlike he thought more becoming to a tale than boasting but he chid himself once more i was a damned fool and the afteraction report hed written admiralty had been one of his rather more creative endeavours to disguise idiocy his usual custom since boyhood sir hugo supplied though he wore a proud grin lewrie reshuffled the order of the walnuts and such recalling the smoke and haze the low scudding clouds of a raw grey day turned in an instant to a peasoup fog a reeking hammered echoing mist as proteus had reached west towards onslow just out of effective range of the dutch liners in the middle before putting about to sail back east towards duncan who by then at a quarter til one was also firing as fast as his gunners could load and run out now the dutch were sailing in two columns lewrie explained indicating the hickories and filberts nearer the row of biscuits in their lee were some eighteengunned brigs or sloops at least three twentyfourgun ships or brigs and four frigates of varying metal not all were true warships thank god again converted and armed merchantmen penned up in port thanks to our blockade and our cruising frigates hunting prizes but once we broke their line those escort ships opened fire though they were there to serve the same duties as ours signals and salvage and well sirs once one fires on a larger ship one turns into fair game duncan s venerable had smashed her way through astern of their gun rd rate statengeneraal opening the way for triumph and ardent and threatening the dutch admiral de wynters flagship vrijheid it was a wide most tempting gap and beyond it lewrie could see the lee line of sloops brigs and frigates now and then turning up windward gunsmoke towering and blooming like cloudheads from a summer thunderstorm vision reduced to masttips the quickblossoming buds of cannonshots the staccato stutter of guns by decks by broadsides making even more smoke and confusion til the whole sky was blotted to grey gloom the sea turned dull leaden for lack of reflecting sunlight the dutch ships their own ships so wreathed with sour sulfurous mist that they became spectres he caught himself frowning in a silent fell musing absently massaging the dull ache of his wounded arm not for show this time nor for approbation from his audience as he playacted the pensive hero for their admiration or applause from dour remembrance as he recalled that hideously glorious scene afresh the scents and sounds the rocking of his quarterdeck as proteus swashed her way down the line toward that gap they paid for their mistake sirs indeed he told them chapter two are they daft lieutenant langlie the first officer commented as he lowered his telescope after watching the nearest brace of dutch sloops open fire on venerable and triumph perhaps more desperate than daft mister langlie lewrie said as he stepped back towards the wheel and compass binnacle if theyve waited so long for the winds to shift so they can come out maybe cooperate in some french intrigue based in the channel ports well this fat dutch mynheer de wynter cant run back into harbour without being seen doing something they watched as hms triumph yawed to show more of her starboard beam opening the limited arcs of her guns as she intersected the enemys line with a titanic roar she opened with a full broadside the first and the most carefully aimed and laid in any battle at the next dutch ship astern of the one already pummeled by venerable that was a deathblow of pounder and upper gundeck pounder iron shot that tore giant gouges and eruptions of sidetimbers that harvested upper yards and masts in an eyeblink they could hear horrid thuds or howls of rivened wood as scantlings and beams shattered do we sail on like this well mask her guns lewrie decided aloud to his quarterdeck officers lets bear up to windward three points or so mister langlie and pass upwind of her aye sir deck there a lookout high aloft on the mainmast shouted down to them two dutch brigs alee four points off tstarboard bows that gap was filling with a rolling wall of spent powder smoke but even from the deck they could espy the spectral shapes of two light dutch warships hesitantly hovering under reduced sail and firing at venerable venerable already busy with her larboard guns replied to that harassing longrange fire with a starboard broadside the dutch brig was swatted away much like a pesky midge great chunks of timber were blown from her sides and bulwarks while a sudden hurricane erupted round her hull and waterline like massive breakers crashing on a rocky shoreline and just how does one say oops in dutch lewrie chortled in glee as his crew cheered the sight of an enemy halfsmashed to matchwood in a twinkling venerable then swung back to larboard abandoning the equally hurt statengeneraal to turn her lefthand artillery against the starboard side of the prominently flagbedecked dutch admirals ship deck there a lookout stationed atop the mizzenmast called ware astern an larboard our liners lewrie turned and frowned for there were bedford and director not a quartermile off with about a cables worth between them as they surged forward to the battle line in the middle distance beyond was their consort lancaster they werent steering directly for that gap but seemed to want to sidle eastward along the dutch line to the windward side of ardent venerable and triumph avast mister langlie lewrie said with a scowl hold this course instead were blocked he peered aloft yes they still had engage to leeward and close action signals flying so why the devil aint they doin it he groused to himself did proteus stand on much longer though shed run afoul of venerables group as well she couldnt stand sharp to windward for fear of masking the bedford groups guns if not come nigh to a collision with one of them the wind he shifted his gaze to the commissioning pendant at the mainmast truck as in all seafights where heavy guns barked and boomed the wind was getting flattened the long pendant was curling and flagging limply not enough wind to work ahead of bedford s trio nor was there enough wind to tack and pass astern of them either it would force them to fetch proteus to cocked up motionless to the wind with her fragile stern bared to the foe who had already proven to be eager to violate the old customs against firing at escorting frigates nothing for it but to haul our wind mister langlie lewrie announced with a sour note to his voice let us wear ship over to starboard tack swing round in a circle then harden up and beat past our ships to windward of em where we should have been hmmm his darkly handsome first lieutenant mused unconsciously scratching at the side of his curly locks to leeward of our ships and their line for a bit sir intrestin if i may say so naturally lt langlie could not say are you barking mad or show any hint of disagreement with a captain that was insubordination it could also be taken for an inkling of fear and cowardice we run into anything we cant handle we duck right back out lewrie assured him praps even snuggle up to one of our liners and ask her tshoo the big bad bullies away aye haul our wind mister langlie five points alee and prepare to wear ship aye aye sir langlie echoed lifting his brass speaking trumpet to shout orders to the bracetenders and landsmen a frenetic minute or two later proteus was off the wind taking it large on her starboard quarters her yards still groaning her sails still clattering and slatting as they refilled mister wyman lewrie called from the quarterdeck nettings as he looked down into the ships waist searching for his second officer in charge of the main battery of guns do you ready both batteries just in case lt wyman was an angelic but eager young fellow prone to a flushed gingery complexion when excited as he most certainly was at that moment lewrie could almost imagine he heard wymans wideeyed gulp and his customary my goodness gracious i wish us to be the biter today sir not the bit aye aye sir wyman piped back springing to redirect his guncaptains and quartergunners his powder monkeys and excess crewmen on the runout train and breeching tackles over to larboard then to run in the pounders remove their tompions and load with powder and shot then open the gunports and run them out inbattery just in case proteus sloughed her way further alee toward the gap the only clear and unimpeded water open to her into that sour towering pall of gunsmoke coastal haze and low cloud scud with her bowsprit and jibboom forecastle and chase guns then her foremast becoming indistinct by sound lewrie tried to plot the dangers astern now where venerable ardent and triumph were hammering away being answered with dutch broadsides to the west where viceadmiral onslow was breaking through the rear of the dutch line and a general cannonading roared nothin much in between though lewrie thought yet deck there a lookout howled ship o the line starboard and abeam dutch flag on er fore jack bear away mister langlie make her head soueast and run both sheets aft off the wind lewrie quickly snapped boom boom two quick cannon barks from that ships focsle chaseguns and six or nine pound roundshot went sizzling and moaning overhead and astern as their blooms of powder smoke blossomed the dutch warship seemed to melt away to grow fuzzier and less distinct in the fog a moment later it was as if she had never been gaps not as wide as i hoped lewrie confessed in a soft voice as if loath to speak too loudly and be rediscovered with a broadside next time mister langlie a cast of the lead they were now running full off the wind with the shifting and curling mists traveling with them for proteus could sail no faster than the wind could blow soueast toward a coast that ran noreast shallow and filled with shoals and bars eight fathom eight fathom with this line thats only thirty feet of water under our keel lewrie thought in a quandary we draw about eighteen feet aft put about soon two points aweather mister langlie lewrie ordered well start circlin back anew hopefully well clear of that deck there two brigs two points off tlarboard bows ready the larboard battery lewrie shouted hop to it sirs mister wyman ready quarterdeck carronades as well spectral greyongrey forms emerged turning hardedged gaining colour a twomasted brig o war was cocked up to weather motionless with her stern towards proteus a perfectly helpless target for her guns with none but sternchasers able to fire back her fragile stern timbers transom and galleries so easily shattered turning her inner decks and gundeck into bowling alleys for hurtling shot itd be a brutal buggering a rape and quick wholesale murder stand by on the uproll lt wyman yelled brandishing his sword eager to slice it down to release hell avast mister wyman lewrie countermanded hold your fire dutch officers were at the brigs taffrail shouting and waving frantically a white waistcoat was wigwagged in sign of surrender or an urgent truce for there was a second brig o war a bit beyond the first down by the head and canted far to larboard sinking from the swatting that venerable had given her earlier her yards and masts hung in shambles of torn rigging and sails canted forward and nearly horizontal as she heeled over dozens of men thrashed and yelled in the water between the two brigs some swimming to the overcrowded boats the first brig had lowered dozens more sailors clustered at her larboard bulwarks now almost awash tossing over hatchgratings anything that would buoy them up whilst some tried to manhandle their own damaged boats off the crossdeck boat tier beams and into the water before she went under the near dutch brig o war fired one forward gun to leeward in a plea for gentlemanly conduct and mercy mister wyman one starboard gun to fire to leeward aye sir god but it wouldve been beautiful lewrie sadly thought as proteus ghosted past the brigs stern at close range one broadside up her stern and she d have sunk before her sister but as a pounder from the forecastle fired lewrie only lifted his cocked hat to doff it in salute and the dutch captain and his officers solemnly doffed their foreandaft bicorne hats high over their heads in reply a point more to starboard mister langlie keep us circlin aye aye sir poor devils commissioner proby at chatham told me that the dutch require all their sailors to learn to swim lewrie offhandedly informed him and if they drown they roll them over a keg laid on its side until the victim coughs and spews up what hes swallowed or inhaled so they stand a decent chance if they got off that other brig unwounded i see sir langlie replied damn odd though sir never seen the like not in a fullblown battle that is captain what the bloody bicorne hats lewrie shrugged it off youre right ive never seen the like either they may be all the go but youll never see a british officer in one too damn frenchified proteus sailed on bearing away and the two dutch brigs o war were enveloped in the gloom and smoke once more a quick peek into the compass bowl showed lewrie that their frigate was now headed just a bit west of south away from that treacherous coast almost abeam what wind there was and still turning up to weather the hull beginning to heel the sluice of water round her gurgling and sighing more urgently it was a hopeful sound nine fathom nine fathom tthis line that news was hopeful too as was the dimly perceptible thinning of the haze smoke and mist the sky ahead and northrd brighter as if within moments they could sail out into sunshine and safety deck there threemaster one point off tstarboard bows i think shes a frigate dutch flags bearin easterly dammit lewrie spat peering intently into the smoke to spot what the lookout could see from aloft this is worse than tryin to cross the strand in a thick thames fog coaches to right and left there sir mr langlie all but yelped pointing as if a stage curtain had been raised a dutch frigate appeared just off their starboard bows crossing their course almost at right angles her quarterdeck staff almost leaping with surprise as they also pointed and jabbered now silhouetted against the mists ready starboard battery mister wyman helm hard alee helmsmen lay her full and by brace in mister langlie well shoot her up the arse stead of that poor brig stand by to fire as you bear mister devereux his elegant and aristocratic officer of marines stepped forward lay waste her quarterdeck your best marksmen in the tops and along the starboard gangway lewrie insisted his words tumbling out in a rush urgent from the closeness and quickness of the situation i want grenadoes too lashings of em aye sir two bags full lt blase devereux answered saluting but with a tongueincheek joy marksmen he bawled turning away long musketshot lewrie speculated as the dutch frigate sailed on eastwards opening the range her brailedup main course lashing as it was freed and hauled down to increase her speed bout a third of a cable as our bows come abeam her transom as you bear lt wyman was screeching sword aloft again on the uproll fire first a pounder chasegun shrill and sharp then one of the pounder carronades a smasher that lewrie had shifted forward to the forecastle shortly after taking command for proteus had the fullness of form under her bows to bear the weight the first of the starboard pounders the longbarreled blomefield pattern guns erupted followed by a slow blasting as each of the remaining twelve guns along the starboard side came level lastly the quarterdeck pounders and the pair of pounder carronades mounted there also belched and roared muskets aloft and along the bulwarks spat and crackled as well uuppp yours lewrie shouted in mad joy to see his round shot strike one at a time with the deadly metronomic pace of a good gun salute quartergalleries the sash windows of the dutch captains greatcabins the small ports of the officers gunroom immediately below the taffrail and the lanthorns and posts her transom wood along with her thick rudder post and rudder were smashed in pieces of her doublewheel and compass binnacle went flying her mizenmast shuddered and jerked her lower spanker boom sagged broken in three pieces and guns runout on her larboard side facing the unseen british battle line jerked tilted and slewed in their ports as they were struck and shifted by the howling weight of metal bowling down inside her at more than feet per second too far for grenadoes sir sorry lt devereux said with a sorrowful expression still we gave them a good peppering shes turning up sir the sailing master mr winwood noted cant see just how with her rudder and helm shot up so thorough to unmask her larboard battery the one that was manned lewrie realised at once mister langlie ready to tack well fall below her on larboard tack and use our readyloaded larboard guns to serve her another stern rake give her the windgauge sir mister winwood queried if admiral duncan can fight from loord then so can we sir he replied her starboard ports are closed she aint ready and with any luck at all theyve got the wind up quickaround lads hurry ease helm ease off jib sheets haul weather mizen to windward tend lee mizen sheet langlie was babbling too urgently ordering what was usually a staid rite let go foresheets check the lee forebrace check the fore topbowline rise tacks and sheets be ready mister wyman as you bear lewrie urged he went to the nettings overlooking the waist to watch as each guncaptain put a fist in the air to indicate readiness the triggerlines to the flintlock strikers taut in their other hands yards blocks and parrels crying proteus came up to the eye of the wind hesitated for a dreadful second as if shed miss stays and become a motionless victim then slowly swung farther to starboard with a breeze beginning to tickle her sails now mainsl haul yes by god lewrie exulted now rapt with battlefever his usual state with all thought of stoicism and the sangfroid of a true english captain quite flown his head as you bearfire lt wyman shouted slashing down his sword in a glittering arc as they crossed the dutch frigates stern once more this time at an acute angle lefttoright timber shattered side planking was ripped away and flung as if a tornado had struck her her mizen groaned and shook once more yards turning and spiralling as the lower mast was shot through below decks and shedding sailors and dutch marines from the fighting top in a tangle of rigging and upper spars releasing aft tension to her mainmast that groaned and canted forward too at an angle yes but closer this time at half a hundred yards and they could hear the screams and howls as their roundshot tore down the gundeck open from endtoend hear the thuds and crashes of shot tearing away carline posts and turning stout timbers to clouds of splinters that flew about madly swiftly ripping into flesh breaking bone as merciless as col shrapnels caseshot shells that exploded in clouds of musket balls her rudder and her transom post with the pintles and gudgeons that held it in place were turned to kindling and without a rudder and with the loss of her balancing mizen sails to counter the pressure on her foresails the dutch frigate sagged offwind falling off to parallel proteus as she sailed past damme one of the helmsmen gasped as the enemys gunports on her starboard side opened hinging upward as here and there the dark snouts of readied guns jerked into view it would not be a complete or ordered broadside but at this close range it would be a blow to the bowels flat on the deck lewrie shouted to his crew though standing with his hands behind his back planting his feet to receive the blow with courage even if his innards had just turned to gurgly water bbboom the dutch broadside stuttered perhaps with only ten of her guns lewrie had time to count gunports now that she was abeam them ten out of fourteen he thought with a wince as the thundrous roar surrounded him making his heart flutter with its nearness shes a thirtysix but thank god those aint eighteenpounders proteus sounded as if she was screaming with those hideous parrot squawks as roundshot tore clean through her sides rwwwarrwwk then thud and crash she jumped and trembled juddering enough to toss him inches off the deck then rise to meet him as he dropped with his knees flexed hot gusts of wind pummeled at him as he opened one eye to see if he and his ship were still in one piece or among the living shot his bolt lewrie thought hot anger flushing him that hed been fooled into reach of the dutch gunners now its our turn everyone up man your guns load load load he shouted the dutch had fired low english fashion twixt wind and water instead of emulating the longrange firing of their allies the french who preferred firing high to dismast and cripple enemy ships so they could be outmanoeuvred and taken or fled if things went against them he darent even look over the side to see damage done to his beautiful new frigate how shattered she might be below someone would come run tell him he was mortalcertain the dutch frigate was close sagging down against proteus and proteus was slowing with the light gunshot wind stolen from her by the sails and rigging of the dutch up to windward of her damme for goin under too he chastised himself now we re to be hull to hull with no chance of slippin off they would fight like lineofbattle ships instead of dancing weaving and sparring locked yardarmtoyardarm guns blasting with the muzzles almost touching the enemy taking fire in like manner load and fire pointblank mister devereux captain sir think its close enough for grenadoes now do you i do indeed sir devereux replied with a slight grin drawing his smallsword and shouting at his marines aloft to light fuses to get their light swivel guns firing like oneinch bored shotguns filled with langridge or bags of pistol balls sir pardon my suggesting it but were i you captain id pace about dont give their marksmen a chance at you if it gets thick mister devereux ill lurk behind you with that handsome red coat of yours im sure youre the finer target wyman got his guns going again firing at will as fast as the bores could be swabbed out reloaded and run out thirteen guns first then only twelve as one was upended then eleven the dutch must have loaded and prepared that one good broadside though and hadnt crew enough still on their feet to serve their pieces quite so quickly the dutch response was eight guns then seven then six it was deafening howling chaos loud enough to make sailors and marines bleed from their ears and noses between the titanic blasts from heavy guns the barks of swivels the crack of muskets and pistols and the dull bangs from flung grenadoes created a continual drumming ball spanged and caromed from gun barrels thonked into timbers and tore out gouts of dust splinters and lead splatters proteuss quarterdeck was quickly quilled with tornup slivers of holystoned wood making it hard to walk the surgeons mates mr hodson and the laconic french йmigrй mr maurice durant made continual trips up from below with the narrow ropestrapped carrying boards borne by their loblollymen to haul shaken and wounded men below the dead were piled about the bases of the masts yah pistols sah his coxswain andrews said fetching him a brace of doublebarreled mantons i thought ya might like havin yer ferguson rifle too lewrie stuck the pistols in his waistbelt slung the cartouche box over his shoulder and accepted a horn of priming powder quickly loading the deadlyaccurate breechloader rifled musket shooting back he decided beat pacing about like a fart in a trance all hollow he took aim at an officer in a bicorne hat swung slowly to follow him as he paced about bellowing and waving a sword and got you he exulted after the muzzlesmoke cleared seeing his foeman fall into the arms of a pair of dutch mates then drop below the bulwarks and disappear one turn of the screwbreech lever below the trigger and lock assembly lower the barrel rip a cartouche open with his teeth shove it ballend forward into the barrel then screw in the opposite direction to close the breech frizzen at halfcock the pan open for a touch of priming powder snap the frizzen shut draw the lock to full cock and search for another target a thickset gunners mate or something like that up on the gangway and urging his crews to load a careful aim a pent breath got you he crowed again sir their fires slacking langlie pointed out coming over to his side were shooting her to pieces they dont have smashers and were turnin her into a sieve theyre gatherin amidships with pikes and pistols i think theyre about to board us by then lewrie was halfdeaf and it took concentration to heed langlies words mostly by lipreading but the only cannon fire he could hear was now under his own feet he lowered his gaze to see the damage done to the dutch frigates hull and it did indeed resemble a sieve or colanderone could not find a stretch of her scantling more than ten feet long without a ragged starshaped hole punched in it he saw sailors and marines gathering cutlasses waving surviving officers mates or midshipmen shoving them into order mister wyman last rounds then take up arms lewrie called down to the gundeck boarders mister devereux your marines down from the tops and ready to re something went bangsplangfwee off a quarterdeck pounder a blink before lewrie felt as if someone had just hit his left arm with a waggontongue he was spun about in a halfcircle leftward to trip over his own feet and tumble to the deck goddammit he meant to shout but it came out rather weakly even to his ears cause im gundeaf he had to wonder suddenly he was shivering cold with only the cattlebrand heat in his arm to warm him he looked up at langlie and devereux as if from the bottom of a well with the sides blotting out most of the sky and bboarders he insisted the ringing in his ears smothering his own words surgeons mate someone was keening never fear sir well take her for you someone very like langlie whispered leaning down over his face as he was jostled by many hands soaring aloft like a freed soul with something hard and narrow under him as he was quickly bound with ropes like some damned soul for spitting and roasting on the devils rфtisserie proteuses away boarders away boarders no repel boarders not he was sure hed said it but no one paid him any mind but for mr durant who was making clucking noises and shaking his head sadly daylight was gone he was plunged into reeking foetid darkness feetfirst into the fug of unwashed bodies bilges and stinks below into glimlit hades to the cockpit on the orlop where the wailing and shrieking of the eternally damned soared and chorused in an atonal agony those saved above shouted hosannas of blissful and eternal joy though they were making a rather noisy tinkery metallic and feu de joie music along with their paeans it must come off at once mr thomas shirley the twentyish surgeon lowed like a cow spouting some dry esoteric doglatin non non ze humerus is broken not shattered msieur durant or somebody froggish anyway insisted see ze axillary responds when i stick is palm and ow bloody ze blood loss suggest ze axillary artery is non torn aussi cut eez coat and shirt off sil vous plaоt gently ze ball pass through complete you see msieur capitaine drink zees an think ze pleasant thought followed by more ahumms and latin gibberish a large pewter cup of rum was shoved under lewries nose and he drank it down just before a leather gag was put between his teeth to bite on when the pain got severe which it did they probed retracting wool coat and silk shirt shards taking out slivers of bone and tiny splashes of lead durant insisting that a watered tincture of brandy be splashed around inside the wound over the instruments before they squeezed twisted and pried at his arm to see how it lined up before getting shot and reset it a simple fracture after all sir sonofagoddamnbitchlllbloodykillyourmiserablefrogass you are welcome msieur capitaine next he was bound in linen with lots of batting also soaked in the french йmigrйs watered brandy that stung like blazes over the bandages two wooden belaying pins were bound taut with twine some spare number eight sailcloth the lightest aboard was fashioned into a neat sling and he was stowed forrud on a strawfilled mattress armed with another hefty measure of rum then ignored we took her sir we took her langlie was crowing about a quarterhour later coming to his side with flecks of blood hopefully someone elses on his coat facings his cheek and shirt oh twas a hard fight but we took her you were right to call for boarders captain lewrie had they formed and attempted to board us well but we beat them to it and broke their spirit into the bargain lewrie could but gawp at him a trifle drunkenly by then and wonder what the blazes this idiot was babbling about very good sir just get me out of this cesspit and back to my roomin house fore the wife finds me hey sir lt langlie gawped in puzzlement oh never mind im too sleepy tcare and that sirs is how i conquered a dutch frigate captain alan lewrie rn concluded with a blithe laugh stood up shirtless strapped to a carryin board by the windward mizen shrouds with a cup of rum in my hands towin out our prize speaking of allow me to propose another toast to lieutenant anthony langlie my able first officer and the true hero of the piece he placed the batavian navy orangespruit a thirtysix gun fifth rate frigate on a platter for me and served her up well done his fellow diners gave out a loud prolonged cheer along with the curious onlookers who had gathered to peer over their shoulders as the tale was told and they clapped and laughed as well handsome women in the height of fashion that season fanned and flushed or made as if theyd swoon they raised a rousing for hes a jolly good fellow to which lewrie nodded and smiled raising his port glass in answering salute and acknowledgement of course it made a good tale a gun taking a gun what the public expected their navy to accomplish of course he did not tell them of his mistakes of stumbling about in the smoke damn near lost of his sin of overconfidence of yielding the windgauge to the dutch so stupidly being drawn like a lamb to the slaughter into the mouths of the guns of a doughty wily and desperate enemy captain who had taken much the same precautions as he to be the biter and not the bit that day no this crowd wouldnt appreciate unvarnished truth nor would they tolerate another toast this to the dead the maimed and gutted to those men now minus limbs or sight and doomed to a lifetime of poverty ashore with but a pittance of a pension to atone for a toobrief moment of glory nineteen killed listed with the simple dd in ships books for discharged dead and interred at sea out of sight and mind and twentynine wounded too with fourteen of those merely discharged landed ashore at sheerness and lumbered off to a naval hospital never to return to duty should they survive the ministrations for the dutch it had been a slaughterpit as well over sixty dead and over an hundred cruelly wounded that was the sort of harvest that england s public liked the greater the number of enemy slain the higher cost in british lives well the greater the honour losing captains had been knighted for bravery after such fights since theyd run up a high butchers bill of their own people before striking perhaps he should tell them the cost he speculated they might get a vicarious thrill from so much distant blood all due to his work his cockiness his famed luck and his tradition of victory while they cheered and clapped his beloved proteus languished in a sheerness graving dock her guns and stores warehoused ashore as the shipwrights repaired her many hurts she was as nearly shattered as the captured orangespruit damn em all he thought no matter what face i put on it twas a costly damn victory something i could never say even to caroline in strictest privacy my father well he knows of it hes a military man i spilled my secret to him but caroline he almost felt like breaking down and blubbing in public after all and fearing that dame fortune had decided to turn on him and feed him to her wolves a flutter of the cards captain lewrie mr lumsden asked ah no lewrie soberly replied i feel as if ive stretched my luck far enough lately havent heard from the prizecourt yet our reckoning i should think his father quickly suggested as he spotted his sons wavering we should be gettin home son gettin some part of a good nights rest do you gentlemen excuse us i keep at williss rooms when in town do call upon me and we could pursue the matter of a gentlemans club further perhaps discover some backers who might also find the notion intriguing they said their goodnights gathered their hats and cloaks from the tiler then stood chilled at the kerb outside whilst a young daisy kicker servant of the cocoa tree whistled them up a hired carriage to bear them home chapter three it was fashionably well past midnight before they entered the lodging house with but a yawning servant to unlock the door for them and offer candles so they could light their way abovestairs williss was otherwise dark and broodingly silent the cheery fires in the common and public rooms banked the equally cheery bar now shuttered sir hugo assured his son that failing the publicans commerce he had a bottle of good frog brandy in his room lewrie by then was exhausted and not much in need of a drink hed had halfenough for a lifetime thankee very much the spirits willin but the bodys weak he thought in awe of the other diners capacity of his fathers ability to put it away with nary even a slurred word navys ruined me damn em he decided as he fumbled out his key peering about owlishly lewrie hesitated before the door to his set of rooms key finally in hand wondering should he knock or scratch first with a sorry curse softly muttered he rued again fleeing the park with his father of coming back so late and so in the barrel and bedraggled instead of rushing back to williss after merely an hours pause to argue things out with caroline and defend himself once shed cooled down devil with it he grumbled inserting the large key well he tried to but there was but one wee candle in the passageway the key was perversely upsidedown then backwards and the slot though large seemed to be queerly mobile at last he managed to unlock the door and enter the rooms glad to see a fire in the hearth low and orange flickering scant light off the brass reflector plate only a single candle guttered on the tiny winetable near the settee upon which a form huddled bless me the form groaned sitting up halfscaring lewrie out of a years growth oh tis you sir his manservant aspinall said rubbing sleep from his eyes like a toddler meant tsit up an wait for ya capum lewrie but no matter me lad no matter lewrie replied waving overly wide and unsteady on his pins the wifes asleep i trust erm uhh no sir aspinall said with a wince shes gone sir her and the children all packed up an took the coach back to anglesgreen lord hours ago sir not long after she come back by herself long fore dark for certain aspinall had tricked himself out in snowy white slop trousers a clean new shirt a red neckerchief and a short sailors jacket with a set of shiny brass buttons he sloughed off a dark blue grogram greatcoat under which he had been napping and felt about with his toes for his new shinyblacked shoes those with the real silver buckles that lewrie had bought for him after coming ashore ah lewrie replied after a long deep sigh i see can i get ya anything sir didnt know as how youd dine so i sent down for some no thankee aspinall lewrie said removing his cocked hat and boatcloak which aspinall rushed to gather in still some cold roast pork an bread sir make a good snack theres some wine and i dined not so long ago no lewrie replied trying not to snap at his manservant it wasnt his bloody fault though from the halfempty carafe of wine the skimpiness of the remaining slices of pork and the halfloaf aspinall had dined well he thought and why not stuck in the middle of a domestic battleroyal not knowing the details and loath to step out to visit his ailing mother here in london to go much beyond the public rooms belowstairs til his master returned lewrie could picture poor aspinall standing well out of the way wringing his hands unsure whether he should help them pack or scurry off and hide til the thunder had subsided go get some rest aspinall turn in i can mangage i might even discover my own bed if my lucks in lewrie throatily said ill build up the fire sir an heat a warmin pan wont be a tick aspinall uneasily offered overly anxious to please simply plain anxious lewrie could imagine what shall become of us as sophie had fretted earlier today was it yesterday by now well then lewrie demurred tearing at his neckstock and collapsing upright on the settee uhm missus lewrie left that note sir how could he have missed it leant against the carafe of wine was that a notsosubtle slur about his beastly nature aspinall became even more cringingly unobtrusive as lewrie took up the note broke the seal and unfolded it for being penned in the heat of the moment lewrie decided it was as forebodingly chilly as a hunk of arctic ice though claiming shed never suspected a blessed thing at the time carolines worst suspicions had been confirmed in the blink of an eye the gist of that accusing anonymous letter she had gotten enumerating her husbands sins was proved true back in their rooms after the row shed dredged confirmation from poor sophie de maubeuge their ward yes hed had a mistress in the mediterranean phoebe aretino kept at gibraltar til his return in kept as well on her home island of corsica the dread secret that sophie had held all these years spilled at last phoebe aretino a conniving mercenary corsican whore hed met at toulon the damning letter had described her lewries longterm mistress so any dalliance could not be excused as a lone moment of weakness and even much worse than any passing idea caroline had had about theoni connor whose appearance in the park had set all this off though confirmed in carolines mind was his adultery with theoni now for the anonymous letter had spelled it all out for her both the first back in the spring and the latest how he had cossetted theoni connor perhaps the first night hed taken her aboard hms jester after rescuing her from serbian pirates in the adriatic how hed schemed and finagled to have her and her actual son michael sail to lisbon as his guests in his greatcabins how hed paid court to her in that port before shed taken the packet to liverpool and the inlaws of her late husband god above but caroline had an inkling of an attractive busty italian courtesan in genoa and in leghorn and shed be shootin lava bout thatun lewrie told himself with a sick and swoony feeling of doom as he dashed a hand cross his brows theonis more blessed in that department too and carolines morepetite damme dont she know men dont marry teats they just want tsup on em a tad now and then though how in blazes anyone much less the anonymous scribbler knew that much was beyond him phoebe for certain theoni well maybe but claudia mastandrea too no who couldve known that much and who could despise him enough to write his wife and tell all he had suspected commander william fillebrowne who had openly boasted of taking phoebes saddle after she and lewrie had thrown in the towel with each other hed been in venice in their squadron in the adriatic when theoni connor turned up but claudia was long before his time an actual official mission handed him by that old foreign office spook zachariah twigg damn his blood that was supposed to be very secret hed also suspected lucy beauman his first and frustratingly unrequited lust way back in the earlyearlies of now lady lucy shockley shed been in venice too also taken with that fillebrowne his lover in point of fact behind her decent huge and filthy rich husbands back not six months after they were wed the filthy baggage lucy and fillebrowne together for mutual revenge hed spurned her offer of a tumble or an affair should handsome fillebrowne go stale or fail to clear all his jumps perhaps at the same time for all he knew or cared so rich spoiled and pampered lucy was not a woman to cross and fillebrowne his old schoolmates from his short term at harrowlord peter rushton and clotworthy chute ever the captain sharp without a pence to his own namehad been in venice too and clotworthy had diddled fillebrowne over some ancient roman bronze statues recently dug in the balkans about as old as the halfloaf of bread standing by the wine carafe the one letter his fatherd seen had been written on fine paper and done in an elegant copperplate hand hed said oh but it was a bootless enterprise to speculate whod ruined him the thing was done and the fat was truly in the fire caroline had borrowed sixty pounds from his sea chest she wrote to sustain their farm til his solicitor mr matthew mountjoy could make new arrangements for her and the childrens upkeep which she firmly intended to extract from him no matter their estrangement income from their acre rented farm should be hers alone she wrote since hed never been a bit of help in that regard and had never done a thing to learn it during his idle years ashore on halfpay between the wars he had to admit that that accusation was true lewrie had been a cityraised london lad only going down to the country on spring or summer jaunts as a weekend house guest and knew nothing of crops or livestock didnt know one flower from another and could really only identify oak trees well he knew good horseflesh if he saw it and he could ride well but hells bells was there any true english gentleman who couldnt hed eat his cocked hat caroline then demanded that half his inheritance from his grandmother lewries plate and paraphernalia be turned over to her that he could live on his damned navy pay and the ј per annum that granny lewrie had granted him long ago as an annual living once she had rediscovered his existence during the revolution sewallis and hugh must be schooled she continued their daughter charlotte would soon require schooling and finishing in the arts music dance and deportment necessary to a young lady tobe of her due station then dotted when finally espoused the children she accused were already inured to his yearslong absences on the kings business so they would treat his estrangement as just another extremely long active commission and be the better fort damme shes dotted all her is crossed all her ts lewrie sadly marvelled minds her ps and qs pints an quarts pencen shillings worsen a publican pick yer pockets for the reckonin fore he tosses ye in the gutter her note was except for the occasional spiteful slur of course remarkably icy as if shed written a dry commercial contract to a complete stranger warmin pans in yer bed sir and yer covers turned down his servant announced padding stockingfooted back into the sitting room night aspinall lewrie said slumped in defeat aye sir aspinall said with a jerky bow then departed for a bed of his own in what amounted to a large closet though the childrens beds in a proper separate room were empty and bettermade of a sudden the carafe of wine was more than tempting lewrie poured himself a goodly measure a brimming glass oof he was forced to exclaim spilling a few drops on his new snowwhite kerseymere breeches as his ramcat toulon jumped up into his lap hallo toulon least you aint abandoned me pusslin the black and white torn now grown to nigh a stoneandahalf in weight and as firmly muscled as a wellfed basset houndlike petting a log with legsmade mouthshut trills and grunts in welcome as he kneaded lewries lap rubbed his head against his chest and slung his bulk against him his thick whitetipped ebony tail a brush that lazily twirled and tickled under alans nose lewrie managed one sip then set aside his glass to pet him and stroke him else hed be a pluperfect pest for a full halfhour aye i know big baby been gone too damn long left you behind did she been just you and aspinall hours and hours well im back now just you an me yyess an by god aint it just he sadly told himself me and a damn cat the rest o my days if caroline dont come round somehow and how his wife could ever reconcile herself with such a faithless hound as he he couldnt quite fathom yet anyway she wasnt the sort to pine away shed proved that by running their farm as well as any man during his other commissions rearing the children becoming such an astute woman of commerce never given to the vapours just coping deuced well with her stillroom jams and jellies the domestics they employed neighbours skinflint horsecopers homemade vinegars wines and spring ales her sewing knitting and economies she didnt need him he realised with a start of revelation he was a sometime amusement like a visiting troupe of jugglers and acrobats caroline was complete unto herself and had been for years what ties of affection and custom there had been were now severed caroline had kith and kin the house the village and the church and the long predictable roll of the seasons in peaceful and settled country life home and hearth whilst he had the sea and murff toulon muttered in his lap strewing hair over the new breeches that he had bought for the celebration ball that they should have attended this evening done up in their best finery dancing with the great and neargreat in glittering triumph and praise toulon turned about in his own length and slunk inside the sling that bound lewries left arm stretching out once inside feeling like a hairy pounder shot with but his whiskers nose and slitted eyes showing after hed turned about once more he gave out a long happy yawn stretched out his front paws and legs to dangle either side of his masters wrist and began to purr rattling like signal halliards and light blocks might clatter in a stiff breeze lewrie was too tired to think anymore too drunk and too numb for selfpity or a good cleansing admission of guilt he was certain thosed come though as he picked up his abandoned wineglass and took a melancholy sip now that he was alone and still and it was goin so bloody good this mornin he mourned as he recalled how promising the day had started outtil that encounter in hyde park chapter four well that came off well lewrie thought for a hopeful moment as theoni bade them all a gracious goodby took her sons and her maidservant and newfangled wheeled perambulator off down the pale gravelled path polite and innocent as anything whew he had turned back to face his wife after perhaps allowing his gaze to linger just a blink too long on the departing mrs connor kawhap carolines stinging blow made his jaw feel as if it was broken oow hed yelped in sudden pain and astonishment face reddening what the bloody you beast caroline fumed her upraised handjust used to slap him halfway into next weeknow fisted as if shed contemplated boxing his ear or making his nose spout claret her parasol a flimsy thing good only for languid strolls was held low and furled in her left hand its pointy brass ferrule winking in the wan sunshine putting lewrie in mind of a swordpoint what was that for hed demanded though he knew damn well youfaithless lying bastard shed accused caroline dearest hed assayed hoping to cozen her from her pet youre sadly mistook its not oww the fragile parasol had swept up high on her right then slashed downwards and leftwards catching him on the scalp proving harder than advertised and sending his ornate new cocked hat flying over the dun december grass hed lifted his wounded left arm in its sling to ward her off too late making him grunt with sudden pain christ shed hit a wounded man he gawped as hed skittered to the rear in retreat mean tsay me and a wounded bloody hero and this was the gentle wife and mother whod spank the unruly child then go off and weep into her aprons the most kindly and bastard caroline had insisted moving that parasol into her right hand taking a swordsmans lunge at his offending groin making him squeak in alarm and retreat a step or two more with a pang of chagrin he had realized that hed fired a hulling shot into himself caroline might have been chary and less than sincere with cordiality when presented with the sight of the handsome widow theoni kavares connor and her youngest drooling git in the perambulator impossible to avoid on the parks pathway since theonis party and their skirts took up so much of it impossible to snub her when here came the bold captain whod saved her in the adriatic here came his father general sir hugo whod called upon her before glorious in his best uniform glittering with gold lace and chain gimp caroline hadnt voiced the slightest cattiness when shown the pudgy little bastard who unfortunately was enough grown a crawler for the uncanny resemblance to her loyal husband to begin to be evident no the vertical furrow in her brows that sprouted when she was wroth with him hadnt sprouted til theoni was leaving she hadnt accused him of that yet and then hed blurted out that she was mistaken before she said a blessed thing only confirming her deepest suspicion idiot he had chid himself but if the mort had thonour me for her salvation why not call him james alan connor stead o alan james for all the damn world twonder at no time for rational thought or inventive lying though for his wife had begun to slash rightandleft like a trained cavalry trooper forcing him to retreat and duck that gaily coloured parasol him of all people the very picture of a british seadog two medals jouncing on his chest sporting an honourable wound taken in arduous service for king and country the tasselled epaulet of a postcaptain of less than three years seniority on his right shoulder retreating from a woman just about ready to cut and run thered been a clutch of fashionable onlookers tittering and hooting caroline encouragement guffawing at him royal navy officers midshipmen and tars watching too ashore to share the day of celebration gawkin at me hed quailed but what could he have done in those circumstances draw his sword in defence slug her senseless caroline for gods sake hed pled instead ive not done anything honest tonguelash me in private if you like but liar caroline shrilled loud enough to startle even the fat park pigeons to flight slashing at him some more liar liar liar she had howled pleasant familiar features pinched pale but oddly dryeyed lewrie had taken ominous note that had been the very worst sign had she wept tears of rage sadness or betrayal he might have held out hope madam hed huffed dredging up what shreds were left of his courage and his husbandly dignity and authoritysafely beyond her reach it must here be notedthis is nought for the mobs amusement your uncalled for rage is unseemly and common thatd stopped her in her tracks caroline had always put the greatest stock in their public image her determination to appear as good as anyone of the squirearchy no matter she and her kin had turned up as poor as church mice after fleeing the lower cape fear settlements of the north carolina colony after the revolution living on charity grudgingly given by her miserly uncle phineas chiswickthin as that was and just you wait til i get you home hadnt she regularly frozen the children stockstill arrested in midstride with thatun caroline had hitched a deep breath and had at last relented lowering her weapon from high third to rest the point on the ground giving lewrie space in which to look towards his family to see how the dispute was going down with them his eldest son sewallis a lankylean eleven looked as pale as death hands pawed at midchest ever the miniature parson the one to shy like a whipped puppy at every start and alarum his second hugh the fearless had gawped wideeyed glancing from mother to father halfhidden and clinging to their ward sophie vicomtesse de maubeuge and her skirts daughter charlotte now a brisk toddler and carolines duplicate had glared at him as fiercely as his wife face screwed up in tears but mortalcertain it was his a mans fault sophie who moments before had been lavishing in the grins and tipped hats the admiring glances of single young gentlemen now hid her face behind an ivoryandlace fan that vibrated against her lips in rapid little wingbeats standing close to his father sir hugo as she always did eyes full of more sadness than shock and his father the fashionable old stick looked as if he had bitten into a tart lemon een so there was the tiniest glint of told you so in his eyes so much for sympathy from him lewrie had sadly sighed oh it aint fair none of em meant a fig tme not now when ive gotten a touch o real fame damn you alan damn you caroline had spat voice lower at last all the years you were at sea me thinking so trustingly and now shed hiccoughed on the edge of breakingmellowing at last no for shed hitched a breath one hand on a hip one hand on the handle of her parasol as if it was a walking stick youre right sir shed snapped the cynicism dripping this is not a public affair nor shall it be a private one twixt us either i know you now for a lying cheating dissembling adulterous hound sir and i tell you now that i have no more desire to speak with you nor see your earnest fools face nor even hear your name ever again shed been choking but shed managed to say all that caroline lewrie had attempted to say opening his arms to her and taking a tentative step forward back devil shed cried bringing her parasol up to guard and freezing him in place she was too bloody good with it as good as a french grenadier with a bayonettipped musket you will consider yourself dead to me sir to us for so i and we consider you uhm caroline mdear surely his father had at last attempted to placate but shed whipped about to glare him to silence and aimed her parasol at his crutch too blood does tell does it not sir hugo shed purred all scornful which threat and cutting comment forced a quick retreat on that worthys part sir hugos drinkwizened phyz suffused as red as his tunic as he coughed courtly into his fist come children sophie we are going back to our lodgings now caroline had ordered but mummy hugh had objected whilst sewallis dithered as was his timid wont and charlotte had glared daggers at father and her brother both madame i sophie had squeaked lowering her fan turning to sir hugo whom she adored as her racy standin grandpиre oh what shall become of us if go along and obey your mistress sophie theres a good girl sir hugo had said worst comes tworst well arrange something is that not so alan hey hed contributed in his usually sharp manner gawd sir hugo had muttered under his breath despairing i am so sorry msieur alain i sophie had whispered patting his good shoulder with a lacegloved hand looking scared enough to blab what she knew of phoebe aretino at long last did his wife browbeat her long enough all the years since the dying baron charles auguste de crillart had forced him to swear to see his family cared for after their escape from toulon as the city fell not knowing that his brother and mother had died in the same fight thatd killed him that sophie his younger cousin was all that was left since sophie had become their ward he had feared what she might reveal about his nubile young concubine yet all that time he was safe as houses on that scoretil now a vicomtesse or not sophie would have nowhere to go and with all of her familys wealth and lands lostalong with their heads to the guillotinewould be as skint as a day labourer without the lewrie roof over her head she was young pretty vivacious missish and coy caroline might even suspect that he and she i will write somehow sophie promised before turning away joining caroline who had taken hold of charlotte s hand and laid one on hughs shoulders to steer him sewallis would always be dutifully obedient caroline marched away head held high nostrils pinched and eyes afire for anyone who might gainsay her briskly and huffily his sons did turn and look back now and then whilst being frogmarched with sophie half trotting to catch up one hand holding up her skirts the other plying a handkerchief to her nose or eyes and the elegant egret feathers of her saucy bonnet adance what shall become of us indeed sir hugo had intoned or of poor sophie should caroline turn on her christ on a crutch but im fucked lewrie

for you sparin her the terrors o childbed fever damn lewrie inwardly groaned seeing a glum future ahead women simply wont see things in their proper perspective the old fellow grumbled peevishly still a few months absence might mellow her once she thinks on her new situation do you really believe that lewrie had said with a scowl realising that his wife was not the sort to knuckle under merely for the sake of her financial security nor her childrens sake either no but you were castin for straws gawd they never meant a thing to me lewrie had carped a night or two o comfort and pleasure thats all

henpeck bugger off father and son chorused the very day of glory lewrie had groused as theyd begun a slow walk down the gravelled pathway a prize frigate sure tbe bought in a kings ransom for her as my share real financial security at last stead o dribs and drabs from corrupt overseas prize courts paid out years in arrears whatll this cost me all mostlike with kiddies to rear sophie to dowry charlotte itd like to made him weep the onlookers had departed bored with a lame show his good name might survive the confrontation lewrie had grown up not far from the park in st jamess square hed learned well the cynical lesson of society with all its charade and humbuggery the world accepted what a man showed believed an outward public face did one saunter away from such a shaming languid and unaffected shrug it off as a minor domestic annoyance even jape about it well people would even admire his blithe personal what men thoughtand when you got down to the nub it was what men thought that mattered not womenwould depend on his playacting now did he blub and boohoo act cuttyeyed and overcome hed become known as a sentimental cully one unable to rule his own house or wife who confessed his affairs and that would invite sneers and guffawings no no matter how he felt hed have to play up bold the merry rogue rakehell and dammeboy uncontrite and only a tad abashed cynical as society was how eager other men enjoyed to see another in their situation escape with a smile upon his lips and by association be successful at their own failings lewrie was mortalcertain that did he stay in london long enough thered be moren a few whod dine him out on his disaster hmmm disaster lewrie had thought catastrophe wonder why i dont hurt bad as yer s posed to coim a callous bastard no that cant

strut grin put me a bounce on making easterly they came to the end of the footpath where it crossed a carriageway where lewrie had frozen in midstep stumbling against his fathers arm as he suddenly realised that dame fortune that fickle whorewasnt done with him god almighty lewrie had gasped what the devils come over ye his father had griped them in the coach yonder dont look at em damn your eyes lewrie had warned which made sir hugo peer and glower as if ready to yank the coach door open drag em out and challenge them to a duel instanter the truculent old bastard lewrie had tried to see how the clouds were shaping count leaves on trees take up the hobby of birdwatching anything looking anywhere but at the coach as two pinched highnosed toplofty men had glared back before the coachee whipped up and rattled them away what his father had demanded petulant who were they one was george john the earl spencer lewrie had informed him with a woozy sense of impending doom beyond what caroline had instilled first lord of the admiralty tother was mister evan nepean the first secretary them who tell me where tgo and what tdo my damned employers ah sir hugo had answered snapping his

while up the street each girl you meet with looks so sly will cry my eyye oh isnt he a darelin the bowld soldier boy it had worked lewrie had to admit theyd gathered prancing children as a marching band might the sight of a trim and elegant old general with the pace and spine of a younger man with a brave captain by his side voices raised in praise of glory and women even soberlookin too people clapped their approval as they paraded off for a public house and bedamnedfor the nonceto dame fortune chapter five williss rooms had seen its share of wastrels and rollickers in its time while their common rooms began serving hearty breakfasts for the industrious sort round am the kitchen staff also was ready for those idle layabouts who rose much later or sent down for chocolate rusks or toast too headed from a night of amusements to even leave their bedsteads sitting upon plumped pillows swinging to sit on the side of the mattress for a proffered chamber pot and one breath of fresh air once the bed curtains had been pulled back was about all they could manage lewrie unfortunately felt about as headed as any man born even after rising at a lordly am dousing and scrubbing with a tin of hot water and receiving a fresh shave from aspinall whilst he had himself a wee nap three gulped cups of coffee had only made him bilious and gassy with a tearing need to pump his bilges much like a dairy cow on hard ground at least thrice breakfast sir dont blieve id manage solids this morning aspinall alan replied with some asperity but thankee his father sir hugo came bustling into the set of rooms done up in his regimentals less his tunic and draped in a tan nankeen and flowersprigged embroidered dressing gown face freshshaved and ruddy eyes bright and clear tail up and bursting with bonhomie bloody awful mornin sir hugo rather loudly informed him it is rain rain rain urchins and mendicantsll drown in this just you wait an see hush lewrie begged squinting oneeyed at that fell apparition wondering why turning his head resulted in thick swoony feelings dear lord still foxed are ye out o practice i expect takes work dye know years o conditionin his father said with a faint sneer at lewries lack of training as he swept back his gown plucked a chair from the small card table and plunked himself down damn near by the numbers like a military drill with all the requisite squarebashing thumps and thuds of the steelbacked redcoat christ lewrie grumbled ready to cover his ears amateur sir hugo scoffed with a twinkle ah he cried as his swarthy oneeyed sikh manservant trilochan singh entered the pockmarked bazaaribadmash with the swagger of a raja was the terror of half the goosegirls in anglesgreen all surrey too for all alan knew namastй namastй good morning leerie sahib singh barked at stiff attention with a stamp of his boots damn near saluting in guardmount fashion bloody hell lewrie groaned chalй jao mulaayam chalй jao mulaayam go away softly ah ye do

bahut achchaa weeby sahib ek dum bahut achchaaek dum very good at once stampcrash aboutturn crashcrashcrash quick march crashstamp salute baroom slam door lewrie put his head in his hands and laid his forehead on that small table feeling that whimpering in pain might not go amiss here for christs sake sir hugo growled producing a flask of brandy and pouring never heard o hair o the dog that bit ye decent french guzzle too thank god for smugglers thisll put the spring back in your step and clear the cobwebs aye good lad lewrie made bbrring noises grimaces and gags but the brandy seemed liable to stay down and his vision did slightly clear caroline scarpered i take it sir hugo asked gazing about the set of rooms noting the lack of children noise clutter and luggage aye mores the pity soon as they got back from the park lewrie mournfully informed him giving him a precis of her letter too well damme his father harumphed thought she had more sense than that not that she didnt shew it anent your finances at least theres no mention of divorcement now were it i who got such a note id heave a great sigh cry thank god for gettin off so cheap then dance off tme busness wont break you after all and theres a sum of prize money still owin thats yours alone damn was lewries sour comment to that shes my wife not a deal gone wrong theyre my children not oh why bother trying to explain such to you aye i forgot im a callous ol bastard sir hugo replied as casually as if hed been told he had grey eyes ah breakfast trilochan singh entered astern the housemaid who bore a large tray full of covered dishes looking like to pinch or goose her once the tray was safe boilinghot tea was quickly poured with cream in a small silver plate ewer and a footed silver bowl of brown west indies turbinado sugar prepared from the loaf aspinall attempted to assist but was outbustled by the maid and singh as they removed the lids to reveal both fried and scrambled eggs buttered hot rusks and a choice of sizzlycrisp bacon or sliced roast beef lewrie stared at the repast pondering and massaging his belly cautiously inhaling the savoury odours and steams watching as his father turned a brace of fried eggs into a soupy mess with knife and fork spooned up some jam to slather on half a rusk then dredged it in the eggs and took a bite only enemies of the borgias died of eatin his father said chewing and sighing most ecstatically trust me the greasier the better in your condition lewrie tentatively allowed his plate to be laden hot tea with cream and sugar well hmm well well more cobwebs cleared a taste of bacon a forkful of eggs which needed pepper and a lot of salt he discovered the roast beef was a tad dry and crusty perhaps leftovers of last nights fare in the common rooms but my my was that mango chutney in the jar with which to liven it up yum oh even better for here came a dab of fried diced potatoes his favourite tatty hash the rusks were crunchy but softened with good butter and the jam was a tangysweet lime marmalade and good god was he out of tea so soon lazarus come forth sir hugo said with a snicker mmmmf something like that lewrie confessed swallowing there was a knock at the door which aspinall answered coming to the table a moment later theres a note come for ya sir he announced setting it beside lewries plate sealed and folded shut with no return addresslocal a sudden pall fell over the table well his father pressed at last as alan studiously ignored it it cant be from caroline surely she aint that prolific lewrie opened it wishing he had tongs sure itd scald ah lewrie commented after reading the salutation with the sangfroid he rarely displayed aboard ship of a sort it regards caroline he lied mainwell he thought as he refolded it and stuck it in his waistcoat pocket from my solicitor mountjoy she must have sent him a note before coachin back to anglesgreen he asks me to come round actually hed meant to call upon mr matthew mountjoy that day to make an equitable arrangementor one that wouldnt break him i see his father replied going back to his breakfast but with a leery cast to his eyes too blasйbland for comfort not a total lie lewrie consoled himself but damme do i dare all i can do with theoni is accept her sorrow that she caused a mess in the park yesterday be a damn fool tgo but gawd what if she finally cries belly plea to a court and takes what ive left to keep up her our son no surely not not theoni shes rich as croesus in her own right the currant trade an all hmmm still and he thought it deuced odd that far from having his breakfast turn to lead in his stomach from even more to worry about he was digesting rather well thankee very much catastrophe can be stood he decided chapter six south montagu mews was a very fashionable street noreast of oxford street and its confluence with park lane and hyde park within nonstrenuous walking distance really though not quite as costly an address as the more stately montagu square it was better than passingfair as a place to hang ones hat much like the navy london houses were under the rates for tax purposes a house that took up square feet of footing no matter how tall was a first rateand mistress theoni connors was done herself proud lewrie muttered to himself as he climbed down from the back of the onehorse hack that was little better than a twowheeled country dogcart with a canvas covering and paid his cabman a sullen rain still fell but nowhere near the mornings deluge so clad in a snugly impervious boatcloak and a cocked hat that had already seen its share of heavy weather he could take time to assay the street and the house before him it was a homey redbrown brick set off with the white cornices and stone bands so popular in the s and s with an elevated doorway at the lefthand side redone palladian and trimmed with railings in ornate wrought iron filigree two wide windows filled the righthand side above there was the ostentation of a wrought iron balcony across the whole of the first upper floor it was a fourstorey house with three windows set in each level even with a typical two rooms per floor it was a lot of house up and down the street lewrie could see a mix of old brick and the more fashionable italianate facades that people insisted on putting on lately he ascended the steps up from the sidewalk to the door and lifted the knockera grinning venetian lions head shockingly similar to the one on his own door back in anglesgreen for a second he felt his resolve melt feeling in his bones that seeing theoni in person was a really bad idea but she had asked to see him for him to call and they did have a child in commonpurportedly chiding himself for a coward he began to rap the knocker a cherubic older fellow in a suit of plain dark grey ditto opened the door and beamed at him with the smile of a wellfed prelate in a rich parish sir he asked captain lewrie come to call i believe your mistress expects me lewrie replied a bit more tentatively than he liked come into the front parlour sir captain lewrie and ill inform mistress connor of your arrival the old fellow bade bowing as he stepped aside to wave him in just this way sir i do believe you are expected though there was no reply to mistresss note he seemed to scold obviously the old catchfart knew more of his employers business than was good for him though theoni could only have hired him in the last year he accepted lewries hat and boat cloak but only took them as far as the mirrored coatstand easily fetched if she shooed him off or had no time for him the parlour was impressive pale green walls were nicely set off with stark gleaming white wood trim pastoral artwork was hung along with giltframed mirrors the massive fireplace was smokeythreaded white marble and the furnishings were upholstered in pale yellow or in floralpatterned ecru atop gleaming wood floors carpeted here and there with turkey rugs there were rather good books in the cases and might even have been read once though lewrie suspected theyd been picked up at a secondhand auction by the lot displayed mostly for the ornate gilt bindingsthe way most new homeowners who aspired to society did lots of brass and silver plate objects out for show alan captain lewrie theoni called spinning him about mmistress connor he barely had the wit to say though in his heart as deeply in trouble as he was thinking yum she wore one of those frenchified concoctions in an unwidowly azure with white trim a high waist sash and no underpinnings so the gown hung straight clinging as she walked toward him with her hands out in greeting puffed upper sleeves very tight lower sleeves down to her wrists and a very low neckline her russetchestnut hair was long and loose but gathered with matching ribbons so exoticlooking with wide high cheeks in a fairly lean face a squareish jaw that tapered to a pert chin a wide and generous mouth graced by such full plump lips eyes so amberbrown and slanted almondshaped those gently bobbing poonts their hands met below waistlevel decorously keeping them apart for the servants eyes at least though there was a glimmer of joy in her eyes she gave his hands a shake then frowned sorry i forgot your noble wound she said ruefully not the first youve borne she commented releasing his left hand captain lewrie was my rescuer in the adriatic mobley he took a wound fighting for my life there as well yes madam the old servant replied bobbing blinking and nigh fawning admiring the two medals twinkling on lewries chest well have coffee mobley right away madam she led him to a settee each taking one end with a space apart again decorously there followed some idle chitchat til the coffee arrived delivered by an older maidservant that should do for now theoni said yes maam the maid replied bobbing a curtsy and departing man and wife theoni announced after she had gone hey lewrie could but gawp gawd whatd she mean by mobley and his wife the maid theoni explained i took them both on together she also cooks i try to run a small staff now that the french have occupied the ionian islands the currant business is disrupted you see they now hold poor zante and the english house my parents get a letter out now and then they say things are bad though the french buy currants as well even if they are tyrants and tyrants never pay well not like the days before so right shes out for blood and money lewrie thought steeling himself for a touch on his savings you are not in uhm financial distress are you he asked thinking he was getting to the point oh no alan theoni chuckled with a generous grin what my inlaws sell is dearer than before and you english must have jams and preserves for your puddings and duffs i merely take sensible precautions against wasteful expenses an annual trip to bristol so michael knows his late fathers kin but i do not aspire to a country house or acres and i do not quite follow london style i stay in town the whole year round reassurin for your servants then lewrie said feeling as if he would exhale with a loud whoosh if allowed no one laid off at the end of the season when most folks head for the country and they end up broke and homeless til the quality come back yes it makes for a certain loyalty theoni supposed as she poured coffee for them should i have sent for tea instead i prefer coffee strong and dark the turkish way all those tyrants were ever good for but lewrie sugared his and sipped it was ambrosia strong dark and heady indeed quite unlike most of the coffee served in london the turkish way is perfect thankee he agreed most happily now she intoned setting down her cup leaning back all prim and folding her hands in her lap the reason i asked you to call i am so very sorry for what you suffered in the park yesterday at your hour of honour and triumph after all alan believe me it was never my intention to what we had it was always my hope that it would remain only between us have lewrie added turning glum though able to look her in the eyes and was puzzled to see her almost stiffen in response those eyes of hers glittering too brightly with the ghost of a grin upon her lips father says he has my eyes mean tsay yes he does theoni cheerfully confessed more than your eyes barely a year old now and i swear that he already has your boldness i know the world would say that i should feel shame but i do not i never will she vowed slipping a tad closer to him on the settee her voice gentle and cooey loving your wife did she know or suspected lewrie said with a sigh outlining the anonymous letter and its results despite his fathers assurances back in the summer that hed seen alan connor and saw no resemblance how there were too many other affairs hinted at theoni nodded patiently and sagely through it all sipping coffee and pouring warmups but with her gaze demurely averted disappointed cause shes findin out im a total rakehell he asked himself as he took note of her seeming discomfort christ does she harbour some notion id leave caroline for her since we have that child together or so caroline has left me in essence he confessed at last feeling alien inhuman in that he could say it without screaming out loud in anguish no divorce but alan you poor man i never meant to cause you such a pain she vowed shifting even closer and opening her arms into which he rather gladly sank didnt quite plan on it myself he countered trying for the light note and almost making it though a tad shakily oh hell i must say though she mused as she stroked his hair leant quite close almost cheek to cheek the look she gave me just as we were introduced filled me with dread if only we had taken another pathway in the park begun our walk earlier or had to happen sooner or later i spose lewrie graveled i expect did her curiosity get the better of her shed have called on you on her own just what you need a plague of lewries fronting you in the streets my father my bloody inlaws well alan theoni all but cooed some lewries are more welcome than others i was quite surprised by your fathers arrival a very droll old gentleman he behaved himself then lewrie just had to ask he knew his father too well to trust him around any available and handsome lass quite well theoni chuckled again though he does have the jaunty is that the right word the jaunty leer in his eye aye jaunty lewrie said with a wry smile tis the tamest way for what he had in his eye to be said in polite company imagine my surprise when he did call theoni said sitting up and reaching for her cup once more mobley announced a general lewrie and i thought he had gotten it wrong that it was you he told me about that letter he apologised for intruding for probing about at your wifes request barging in upon a total stranger whatd you tell him then the truth she said baldfaced though elderly he is far too cynical to accept lies he winced at that screwed up his face but he nodded as if he understood she heaved a wry little laugh a hitching of her shoulders i expect that he left more than a few offspring in his path in his younger days she commented me included im the only one he owned up to and took as his own not as a willoughby though trust me tis a long sad story and there was a pot of money involved he is wealthy now theoni suddenly asked aye he is lewrie answered suddenly on his guard suddenly feeling a sinking in his innards of jealousy he wondered some then the world is no longer at risk theoni said laughing at that news wellfed sharks do not bite usually he might even turn mellow into a safe supper guest who doesnt have to sing lewrie burst into a sideaching peal of laughter oh god my father safe he hooted hed steal the coins from his own eyes on his deathbed and pinch the chambermaid with the winding sheet then i see where you got your spirit theoni tittered aye blood will tell they say lewrie replied sobering recalling just where and how that adage had most recently been used so what will you do now theoni enquired god knows lewrie said with a frown slouching back into the settee saw my solicitor made some arrangements safeguarded some funds and such most like its back down to sheerness for me to put proteus back in the water and toddle off to sea what im good at where i dont get in much trouble mostly but that was where you got in trouble with me alan theoni pointed out with a becoming smirk at sea aye it was he agreed enfired by the look in her eyes as if she wouldnt mind a tad more trouble should he dare risk it all of a sudden the tension between them became as palpable and as visible as st elmos fire surging in the topmasts of a stormcast ship i uh he croaked groping for lucidity id best how to say this she puzzled aloud frowning though i wish you no pain in your life alan and i certainly do not wish to complicate things even worse than they are i will never regret being your lover even for such a short but blissful time i will never regret having your son i feel blessed he will be the part of you that i will have always all the part of you that i expected to have in this life knowing that your wife but now theoni i lewrie croaked again sure now that coming was a bad idea that yawning before him was a gaping abyss that could sear his soul in hellfire should he abandon all his vows his i told your father the truth when he came as i said theoni continued sliding close once more and gazing at him with such an open and frank expression i told him that i loved you alan that when i married my late husband it was arranged for the business after a time i came to love him i was comfortable and content and i had michael but thats why i asked you to come call upon me today to tell you that whatever happens i am sorry for causing any rift i did not pray that you and your wife would part and that i do regret now that i know it but i want you to know that whatever happens should you feel free should you truly be free she went on stumbling a bit waving a hand in haste her words tumbling together that i will always be here for you not just as a dear friend alan but as someone who really loves you who would be yours completely but for fortune theoni he said with a dry gulp oh i know she almost whimpered getting to her feet to dash away and hide her face with her long chestnut hair as if ashamed of his seeming rejection i only make it worse but if i wait to tell you in a letter and you a thousand miles away at sea youd never see me as she turned to face him though with eyes downcast at the floor arms crossed tight below her bodice her eyes were wet with tears if you ever come to me no matter what your english society has to say about it about us she vowed chin up of a sudden proudly and almost defiantly forlorn i will deny you nothing whatever we may make of stolen time together open time together it makes no difference i know im not english the sort one can take into the public i know its brazen and sinful of me but i cannot help that alan i love you so much i have no shame she vowed her face screwing up hed risen drawn by her retreat he stood nonplussed short of enfolding her in comfort or lust or whatever it was that he felt at that moment theoni i had no idea i he stammered now he knew that he really should go instanter but he couldnt of course she raised one hand to dab at her eyes and that tore it lewrie stepped forward and embraced her as best he could and her arms went about his neck her tears and muffled sobs trickled on his neck and their loins pressed together so fiercely almost grinding there there there there he whispered stroking her back i never knew theoni i knew it was special it felt so righteous if one can use that word so holy but i never thought leave leave leave and never a backward glance he thought in agony he a man for once you did care for me alan theoni asked hot breath searing him really cared not just for a little while well o course i did but we both knew the circumstances of our lives we took solace and pleasure theoni added with a hiccoughy chuckle and an easing of her fierce grip to something more fond aye that too lashings of pleasure he admitted recalling all too well those stolen hours in his greatcabins in that lodging shed taken in lisbon before her packet ship had departed i dont know whats to happen though theoni and i cant just walk away from caroline so easily mean tsay i cant cause you pain hanging by your thumbs with false hopes and i wont make you go through that i wont there he thought despite himself that felt rightrighteous i know that alan i trust you she declared but even if your wife and you reconcile i would still long to be near you as we are now as we were then she added suggestively i must go he stated far too late i know she acquiesced easing her grip on him yet loath to release him completely we must wait and see what happens after all that has passed between us though i wanted you to know how i feel oh that you were a bachelor when you fought the serb pirates for me saved a lot o woe all round alan sadly chuckled forehead to forehead and equally loath to let go of her flesh enraptured by a heady aroma of clean hair rosemary and thyme commingled with a newer scent of light rosewater they lifted their chins at the same time their noses bumpedher artfully wee and sculptured nosethen their lips searching hungrily writhing her breath already hot and musky with arousal i must go he repeated after a long few moments of bliss i know that too dearest alan she whispered back so fondly toying with the back of his neck with her nails sending chills down his spine straight to his groin it is too soon too shocking atop the other shock you have taken too early but before your ship puts back to sea if you want me i will come to you i promise and i will ask you for no promise in return no matter how things stand i truly do love you so i could not do otherwise now go be a hero she turned playful after a moment of shuddery truth as if to shoo him away with a spank on the hindquarters theoni no matter how things fall out thankee he said i have your darling namesake son she replied it is me who should be thankful she gave him one last parting kiss in gratitude now go before i become so tempted that she pushed now shoving him towards the hallway be england s hero alan you are already mine write me for i will surely write you and oh please go before ill write he promised her fetching his own hat and cloak ill come to sheerness she suddenly proposed sheernasty youll hate it dreadfulboresome hole he japed with you it will be paradise she swore with a smile egads whatd i just promise he asked himself once by the kerb does caroline despise me now why make it worse but she cant loathe me more in for the penny in for the pound oh god book one longa exilias et vastum maris acquor arandum long exile is thy lot a vast stretch of sea thou must plow aeneid book ii publius vergilius maro virgil chapter seven cold cold cold faint skifts of snow littered the cobbles of the street before the tavern and posting house lay between the stones to make a stark chequerboard and skittered as dry as sand when a gust of icy wind stirred it was false dawn the iffy time that outlined roofs and chimneypots with faint light whilst the bulk of the street still lay in darkness here and there pinpricked by only a few faint lanthorns by the entrances to homes or commercial establishments and upon the quays where false dawn drew blackoncharcoal traceries of rigging and masts aboard the ships that lay alongside tiny glimlike lights glowed at taffrails and entryports on those docked vessels a few more ghosted across the harbour waters as guard boats rowed about to prevent desertion or smuggling hired boats and ships boats stroked or sailed to and fro even at that ungodly hour bearing officers ashore or taking officers or mates from a night of shore comforts perhaps even pleasure in sheerness barely visible against the darkness and a fine seahaze off the north sea fishermen were setting out no matter the cold or the risk to dredge rake or net a meagre days profit some sailed a very good omen with tiny masthead lanthorns aglow that created eerie tan blots of lit shivering canvaswhile the boats were invisibly darkas if a plague of weary jack olanterns were on the prowl there was a decent slant of wind out of the nornoreast for once not enough to dissipate the cold sea mists nor enough to toss the many ships anchored in the little nore or great nore but itd do for lewries purposes and after the night before lewrie heaved a troubled but mostly contented sigh recalling there had been a fine sunset rare for winter as red as any one could wish that had lingered for an hour or more much like a summer sunset red skies at night sailors delight and wasnt it just lewrie told himself the glass barometer filled with coloured water by the door of his posting house had shown little rising in the narrow upper neck a sign of higher pressure that had happily coincided with that sunset and now a shift of wind as well hms proteus would not fight closehauled to make her offing then jog downcoast to the downs or goodwin sands to reanchor and wait for a good downchannel slant but could head out boldly round dover and bowl along like a cambridge coach perhaps as far as portsmouth before the wind turned foul as it always would in winter foul and perilous the costly travelling clock on the mantel chimed five times in civilian manner as faroff ships bells struck two bells of the predawn watch a cacophanous tinkling disagreement twixt lieutenants or mates timepieces and sandglasses that put him in mind of the myriad of windchimes he had heard in canton between the wars the night before gawd a final round of shopping for lastminute cabin stores such as quills ink and paper a new book or two a chest of dried meats and hardskinned sausages for toulons sustenance theyd supped at a new and rather fine public house that featured large boiled lobsters aswim in drawn butter some ham boiled carrots and winter potatoes a green salad a roast quail each completed by cherry trifle then as old samuel pepys had so often writ in his diary and so to bed most daringly nude for a few moments in the chilly room no matter the big fireplace the warming pans and enfolding bedstead curtains the thick downfilled quilts and extra blankets bliss strenuous bliss unconscious of doing so he had drawn out his pocket watch and opened it to compare its reckoning against her mantel clock and those ships bells with a firmlipped sigh and a slight nod he shut it up with a definite clack of finality i must go lewrie softly pronounced i know theoni kavares connor sadly replied barely mouthing her words her eyes already moistly aglitter i promised not to go on so but two years or more so far away she reached across the remains of their breakfast table to twine her fingers in his slim graceful but incredibly strong and urgent its what sailors do he told her were not known for bein a dependable lot he strove to be winsome and devilicare as well as noncommittal noncommittal won with winsome a distant second absence makes the heart grow fonder theoni asked citing an old adage striving for a cheery note herself forcing a smile early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy wealthy and wise lewrie countered tongueincheek quoting a revolutionary theoni attempted to tease the american rebel benjamin franklin poor richards almanack i believe knew id heard it somewhere lewrie chuckled as he rose with her hand still in hisleading and prompting his departure theoni sprang to her feet and rushed to embrace him pressing her soft sleek body tight to his in a twinkling still toastwarm from the bed and their last eye opener bout still redolent of perfume musk and sex youre certainly healthy dear alan she snickered against his cheek as he stroked her back so pliable and tender beneath the flimsy and revealing morning gown she wore despite the chill last night it was heavenly theoni sighed in recalled bliss dont know much about the wealthy or the wise though he pointed out his voice deep and gravelly nobody with a lick o sense would get out o bed so early nor sail off to the west indies if nor take such a hellish risk as this he chid himself and not for the first time since the week before when theoni had breezed into sheerness and announced her presence madness sheer madness she rose on tiptoe to kiss him as if to stifle any objections he might have voiced her slim arms a vise about his neck her breasts heavy and hot against his shirt and waistcoat but you must she said more soberly after a long moment i will write you ill write daily long reams of letters what you call sea letters as shall i he found himself promising in return such vows were easy at predawn partings though fulfilling them was a different story depending on the excuses of stern duty once back aboard his ship with its ocean of minutiae oh i can hardly bear it she whimpered going helpless and slack against him forcing him to hold her tighter so few days weve had hours really but rather nice hours lewrie muttered in her hair and when you return there must be many many more she vowed with some heat nothing will keep us apart then it would be unjust if no matter how things fall out ill i know theoni lewrie cooed back both hands now sliding up and down her slim back from her hips and wee bottom to breastlevel to hoist and fondle there came a rap upon the door damn theoni fussed stepping back and quickly gathering her dressing gown over her bedgown and morning wrap and scowling crosspatch for a second before vigourously brushing her hair into order enter ere fer yer traps sir the manservant chearly said bustling in with a boy servant in his wake sailin tday are we capum aye lewrie replied hands guiltily behind his back quarterdeck fashion as if to say i never touched her honest just th one wee chest an these two soft bags sir aye thats the lot lewrie answered a fine mornin tset sail capum sir clear skies an fair winds the manservant nattered on does yer gig come tfetch ya or should i whistle ya up a boat yer honour a hired boat would suit thankee lewrie told him ill be down directly tsettle the reckoning and righteeho then sir missuz lewrie the servant said as he doffed his battered tricorne to them and departed with the luggage ouch lewrie thought with a wince salt in the wound why dont ye ye clueless bastard when he turned redfaced to theoni though he noted that she was amused smiling to herself in the mantel mirror as she fiddled with the long reddishchestnut curls at either side of her neck he slung his hanger through the swordfrog on his belt and took up his boat cloak to swirl about his shoulders gathering his cocked hat and a pair of wool mittens the ones that caroline had knitted for him his mouth made a tiny tic of ruefulness there think ill pass muster he asked once his hat was firmly clapped upon his head always dear alan theoni assured him smiling even wider as she came to his side once more flinging her warmth against him kissing atiptoe the handsomest most fetching bravest and cleverest hungriest sea officer in all creation she even managed to giggle between compliments and teasing coy kisses all my love goes with you theoni whispered at last going all earnest staring him directly in the eyes crikey what else can ye say tthat he asked himself its jive thousand miles or so two years at least well hmm and all of mine remains with you my dear he declared though quickly burying his face in her lush hair and the hollow of her neck to nuzzle savour and groan a semblance of agreement it aint a total lie he qualified to his conscience had i not wed so young not met caroline before her theonid be no matter her suspicion that he was lying like a rug that made her seem to purr with contentment to cuddle close and sigh happily i am yours completely alan theoni softly swore forever now go she suddenly ordered playing at pushing him away go beat the entire french navy win the war all by yourself then return to me soon ill work on that lewrie said with an honest laugh letting her go as she played up brave for him even essaying a playful pat on her rump a love swat no his hand lingered so soft and wee ill watch from the window blow me a last kiss give me one last smile and wave she demanded dear god it simply wouldnt do to saunter off with a last kiss no matter it was all a sham he swept her into his arms once more to devour her mouth with his to slither his hands beneath her gowns for her warm flesh now thats a proper sailors goodbye he cried breaking away and all but sweeping his boat cloak round his body like an actor making a grand exit stage left goodbye theoni anything i can fetch you from the west indies you she quickly announced smiling and chuckling even if she was again at the edge of hot tears as hungry for me as when you left me oh perhaps a coconut or two well goodbye my dearest alan safe voyages adieu he declaimed by the door ready to sweep out after his congй hat on his chest and the other hand on the doorknob it need not be said that captain alan lewrie rn knew a good moment for escape when he saw one ive already paid the inn their weeks reckoning she said err uhmm well then he flummoxed thankee for all youve done for me encore adieu ma chйrie amour bonjour mon amour mon vie he tromped down to the public rooms made a production of shivering at the cold of studying the barometer and japing with the two servants as he stepped outside into the dread chill stamping his feet along with them as they trundled his chest and bags in a wheelbarrow toward the quays and a hired rowing boat once in the street he turned and looked up at the front of the inn to see theoni framed in the windows of the room they had shared she had fetched a fourarm candleholder to the sill one that he didnt recall being lit when hed departed that illuminated her as well as the footlights of a drury lane theatre he waved widely blew her that required kiss which she played at catching and pressing to her own lips then suggestively sliding it down to her heart her face halfcrumpled twixt glee and agony and so bravely bearing up her morning gown was parted revealing amberish candlelit and ample bosoms damme if i aint ready tcry off sailin and go nufбle twixt those beautiesjust one more time lewrie speculated feeling the fork of his crotch tighten gawd she knows me too well already what sets me goosebrained witless for it one final wave a doff of his hat and a leg made in congй and he had to turn away and tramp off quickly before he was tempted to rush back and chuck his active commission chapter eight hoy the boat proteus the bowman called back showing four fingers to indicate the size of the sideparty for a postcaptain causing a scurry despite the fact that his return was known to the halfhour bosuns calls shrilled booted marines thundered on cold oak decks bare tars feet pounded on the ladders and icy hands slapped musket stocks as a welldrilled ships crew mustered to greet him as four bells struck lewrie took a moment to admire his ship now that he was closeaboard her starboard side dawn had made her a shining jewel of fresh paint and linseed oil of gilt trim and tarred rigging her yards crossed to mathematical perfection and fresh as a newminted guinea even up close she was just about perfection now that she was out of the yards and back on her own bottom lewrie stood swept back his boat cloak and tucked his sword behind his left hip so it wouldnt tangle between his legs then clung to a sidestay of the hired boat as it nuzzled up to the ships side by the mainchains the boardingbattens and manropes of the entryport judging the slight roll and toss of both boat and ship he timed a leap and made it on the first try nimbly ascending the side with but only the merest twinge of weakness in his nowhealed left arm as he gained the deck freshscrubbed and holystoned nigh to parchment whiteness and still damp from the crews predawn labours about the time he had drunk his last cup of coffee with theoni ashore swords were flourished boots stamped muskets were presented and the calls sang like eagles on high as he stepped inboard safely on his own decks once more and doffing his hat to the sideparty and his gathered crew who stood on gangways or in the waist with their hats in hand their heads bared in their own salute some still chewing the hands have eat mister langlie he asked in the process sir his first lieutenant responded my apologies for arriving in the middle of their meal then and pipe them back below fore it goes cold on em i take it that the galley is still hot aye sir then ill have a pot of coffee lewrie briskly said clapping his mittened hands together ive a chest and two bags to be got up ill see to it directly sir langlie vowed everything else in order for sailing mister langlie aye sir last despatches came aboard just after you went off for shore last afternoon the darkly handsome langlie said smiling very well dismiss the hands back to their breakfasts and i will be aft and below til six bells at which time well get her underway carry on mister langlie he went down the starboard ladder from the gangway to the waist then aft into his greatcabins past the marine sentry past the dining coach to larboard and the chartspace to starboard the two dogboxes where his clerk and his manservant slept and into his daycabin where an iron brazierstove tried its best to banish the cold its belly stoked with seacoal and kindling aspinall took his hat cloak and sword and his mittens while lewrie rubbed his hands over the brazier thinking that if admiralty were of a mind to punish him by shooing him off someplace very far overseas he could at least be thankful that it would be someplace warm riddled with malaria cholera and yellow jack but warm lewrie chortled to himself after a futile moment of trying to thaw out he went aft to his desk to survey the pile of official despatches bound in canvas and waxsealed ribbons his last personal correspondence nope nothin new he thought with a tired sigh he had tried to call upon lord spencer and mr nepean at admiralty but had been informed that those worthies had nothing particular to say to him hence he had not been admitted a letter had come from them urging him should there be no pressing delay in your affairs to repair at once to sheerness to supervise the refit of your ship and once in sheerness the dockyard officials had been dilatory in supplying his wants while other letters came down from london that urged a quick return to sea and slyly asking whyever not already oh it was harsh admiralty was miffed not for his affair or morals officialdom was miffed because he had had no control over his wife in public on such things were careers unmade if he wished proteus repainted it would be at his own expense though he had written one of those letters asking with the supply of paint on hand sirs and the meagre budget allotted for the task which side of the ship do you prefer that we paint that had not warranted a reply which was fortunate for admiralty was not known for its sense of humour and any answer would have been a harsh censure perhaps his relief and replacement as captain finally orders had come aboard for the west indies sealed orders most intriguingly not to be opened til he had weathered cape st vincent off spain s souwest tip had also accompanied them since the war started in prime minister william pitt and his coterie had shoved troops and ships into the caribbean eager for possession of every sugar island it had cost the lives of soldiers and seamen so far once fever season struck regiments and ships companies could be reduced to pitiful handfuls in a trice no matter lewrie had prospered there in his midshipman days he had gone down with yellow jack in and had been damned lucky to survive it even if every hair on his head had fallen out and he had turned the colour of a ripe quince he was safe therefore unable to catch it again but his hands whilst proteus was being rerigged and rearmed he had studied every anecdote every official report he could lay his hands on anent service in the west indies looking for any clue as to why some ships hadnt suffered catastrophic loss while others turned to ghost ships he had spoken to mr shirley the surgeon and his mates but even they were pretty much clueless it was bad airmalariathe miasmas that rose from the soil of tropic lands at night but they could not seal every port and hatchway not without smothering or roasting the people in their own sweat and exhalations they had requested assefoetida herbs to make sachets through which to breathe bad air but had been told that such would come from their own pockets like much of a naval surgeons stock of medicines no matter the terms of the recent mutinies that required admiralty to issue them free empirically freshboiled water was sometimes safer than water kept for weeks incask and water taken aboard in the tropics was best if placed in freshscoured casks and taken only from a clearrunning stream mr durant had suggested going a bit more inland for water to get above the usual wells or streams where cattle or horses drank to avoid taking on the obvious turds but even he didnt think that would aid in avoiding malaria or yellow jack cholera perhaps he had concluded with a mystified gallic shrug lewrie had even queried his coxswain andrews once a slave in a rich jamaican plantation house about malaria and yellow jack as he had seen it when growing up wuss in moskeeter time sah andrews had puzzled when its so hot an still an th airs full of em i heered some ships dont get took so bad do they stand offandon nor anchor on a lee shore but a mystified black mans shrug was nigh to a french one one could safely deduce for gods sake every safe harbour in the indies was in some islands lee shovin us off tsea in february lewrie groused to himself as he pawed through his pile of letters if that aint a sign of their displeasure i dont know what is lisbon first despatches to old jarvy and his fleet mid or late march maybe early april before we fetch antigua or jamaica hmmm a safe month or so fore it gets hot and the mosquitoes begin to swarm he pondered jesuits bark chinchona what was termed quinine south american probably cheaper and more available nearer its source it was reputed to cure malaria or ease its symptoms could he force the hands to drink chinchona bark tea as a preventative or would he have another mutiny on his hands since it tasted like satans piss fresh fruit would be plenteous everywhere they went and mr shirley was certain that almost any fruit was antiscorbutic to some degree so they could avoid scurvy if nothing else but one had to go ashore to get em he thought never anchor in a lee harbour or bay near marshes and such stand offandon after dark well out to sea and up to windward of any land yer coffee sir aspinall announced entering with an iron pot cradled in a dishclout against its heat to set on the brazier oh good lewrie replied turning to smile at him but seeing carolines portrait on the forward bulkhead of the dining coach back when she was young and newmarried fresh and willowy in a gauzy offshoulder morning gown with a wide straw hat bound under her chin with a pale blue ribbon east bay of nassau harbour behind her her light brown hair still worn long and loose and girlish teased by the noreast trades painted smiling instead of the more common stern visage of most portraits her merry eyes crinkling in delight with the riant folds below those eyes he averted his gaze he had considered taking her picture down but had feared what gossip that would cause worse busy ashore and sleeping out of the ship nights even when she was back in the water god only knew what the gunroom the bosuns mess the midshipmens cockpit on the orlop and the forecastle hands had made of that already there were the averted eyes the cautiously framed speech aspinall brought him a cup of coffee in his silvered tankard from the hms jester days with shore cream and pared turbinado sugar there were letters of a personal nature on his desk one from his father sir hugo one from sophie and a damned thick one from theoni already he quickly shovelled that one into a drawer nothing from caroline or the children though all his official correspondence was up to date his clerk mr padgett had seen to that the past afternoon all his bills paid there was nothing to do but stew and fret and drink his coffee til six bells and am when it was time to sail after the mists had burned off yer dunnage sir aspinall said as two of his irish sailors the dim giant furfy and his mate liam desmond came traipsing in with his shore bags and the chest of lastminute stores mornin men mornin capum sor top o th mornin sor that eager we be tsee th indies beggin th capums pardon sor at least itll be warmer theres a blessin lewrie replied smiling in spite of himself thankee men thatll be all toulon bestirred himself after an impressive stretch or two and a gargantuan yawn to come sniffing and pawing at the chest that held his treats for the coming months mewing with expectant delight toulon look lewrie enticed taking a new knit ball from his coat pocket theoni had made it complete with a wee harness bell and some ribbons firmly sewn to it tinkle tinkle see murrerrf was the cats glad cry in a trice he was hounding it from transom settee to forrud bulkhead tail up and thundering up and down sir midshipman grace their youngest and newest called from the forecastle heave and haul away lt langlie shouted back bosun pipe topmen aloft trice up lay out and make sail lewrie paced his quarterdeck wondering if he would ever be warm again gazing upward with his hands in the small of his back watching as his welldrilled crew scrambled to free gaskets take hold of clews and begin to bare canvas atrip heave and awash the best bower anchor broke free of the sandy bottom and swayed above the surface hms proteus sidled a bit swinging free of the ground taken by the nornoreast winds a quickly hoisted outer flying jib backed crossdeck up forrud to force her to fall off to larboard tack taking the wind on the lefthand side of her bows her square sails on her yards swinging about and luffing endon blocks clattering canvas snapping and rustling free langlie was an able deck officer lewrie left it to him and his juniors to get way on her as proteuss bows swung more easterly still not under control he stepped over to the doublewheel and the compass binnacle to stand by the quartermasters on the helm full and by on larboard tack mister motte lewrie ordered as he looked out to weather nothing to loord make her head due east or as close as you may manage aye sir due east an nothin tloord motte echoed as he tentatively spun the wheel to find a bite to the rudder the forecourse and main course were now drawing being braced in to cup the wind inner outer and flying jib were bellied alee as were the middle staysl and main topmast staysl the mizen topsl and the main and fore topsls were stiffening with the winds press and their frigate began to heel a bit beginning to make her sweet way churning salt water to a slight froth closeaboard chuckling and muttering back to the sea as she got a way on and hardening up on the winds eye on larboard tack there a first lift of the bows as the scend off the north sea found her as she gained the queens channel the first burst of spray under her jibboom free lewrie exulted taking a deep cleansing breath of iodine tang caroline theoni rage bills shoreshite he paced over to the windward railing up the deck which was now slightly canted as more sail sprouted to gather free willful winds a faint chorus sang in the rigging a faint applause rose from her wake as she laid the start of a wide bridal train astern fought to make the mustachio of foam before her bows he felt like singing at that moment do you wish more sail at the moment sir lt langlie asked once the tgallants were set and drawing no mister langlie thatll do quite nicely lewrie said as he turned to face him smiling at ease at last stand on as we are til we make a long offing aye sir and ill have a tune mister langlie lewrie added summon the fiddlers spanish ladies i should think er aye aye sir the hands were piped down from aloft the last tug of a brace was tugged sheets and halliards were gathered on pinrails and fiferails the hawsers were hosed down and stowed below in the cable tiers the hawse bucklers fitted to block spray and sluices from high waves excess ropes were flemished down in neat piles proteus was shipshape farewell and adieu to you spanish ladies farewell and adieu you ladies of spain for weve received orders tsail from old england and we hope in a short time t see you again well rant and well roll like true british sailors well rant and well roll all across the salt seas until we strike soundings in the channel of old england from ushant to scilly is thirtyfive leagues fiddles tinwhistles the youngish marine drummer and desmond on his uillean lappipes made it sweetly longing so let evry man raise up his full bumper lewrie joined in bellowing as was his wont when singing the words out let evry man drink up his full glass for well laugh and be jolly aand chase melancholy with a wellgiven toast to each truehearted lass a few lances of sunshine broke through the dawn clouds spearing hms proteus making her glisten as bright as a newminted coin as she proudly made her way to sea all bustle and swash gleaming fresh canvas and giltwork flashing out where she properly belonged no matter where those sealed orders took them chapter nine is he reading them lieutenant catterall the sly and waggish rogue who had risen from senior midshipman to third officer asked aye just now lieutenant langlie answered as he paced along the windward side of the quarterdeck stepping over the ringbolts and tackles of the light pounders and pounder carronades opened em sir bosun mr pendarves enquired i do believe mister pendarves lt lewis wyman replied with an abrupt nod as he stood at the top of the larboard gangway ladder so well soon know our orders wont we mister pendarves mr midshipman sevier the shy one opined near the ladders foot or not mr midshipman adair a clever scots lad jeered at him he has no duty to tell us anything if its secret doings gracious little midshipman elwes gasped secret work work o some sorts in order young sirs bosun pendarves told them noting that all six mids were hanging about ears cocked for a bit of gossip and doing nothing which was sinful in boys either nautical or civilian go on now back tyer duties lads bloody christ this is lunacy lewrie muttered aloud once he had broken the seals on his canvasbound supplemental advisories sir aspinall idly asked from his wee pantry someday id love tmeet a onearmed admiralty clerk aspinall someone who can never say but on the other hand lewrie griped at least aspinall was amused the royal navy was infamous for overvaunting orders sending a small brig o war to patrol off leith was too easy too simple no additional tasks were always larded on like sketching the headlands taking new soundings when not chasing smugglers amassing a new dictionary of scots slang trawling for a wreck rumoured to contain spanish armada gold and silver or fetching back some pregnant female sturgeons for the royal table his advisories did not require any new tasks of a secret or more perilous nature than usual but on the other hand lewrie most snidely thought snickering they were secret nonetheless lewrie suspected that they had been so labeled because no one responsible for their issuance was willing to let himself be known as a complete lackwit lewrie got to his feet shaking his head in wonder as he paced aft to the transom settee to gaze out upon the ships wake it was a grey and blustery day the horizon a bare two miles of visibility even from the mastheads when proteus was rolled and scended upwards atop a salty hillock the ocean was aheave greygreen and spumed by white caps and white horses proteus groaned and creaked then roared as she soared aloft on a wide rising wave her sails and masts her standing rigging strained windfull moments later the sluicing roar was even louder as she coasted and surfed down into an equally wide but deep trough where her courses were robbed of wind and slatted whilst her topsls and tgallants remained taut and her stout bows thundered as they met a low hedge of water that ran a shudder through her timbers from stem to stern he unconsciously shifted his weight from foot to foot as if he were riding a short seesaw atop a drum as proteus metronomically rolled about fifteen degrees either side of upright every thirty seconds or soall the while soughing or rising by turns at least one every fortyfive seconds now that the weather had moderated the seas had flattened a bit and the space between great waves had increased the last cast of the log a halfhour before showed that proteus was making about twelve knots even under cautiously reduced sail but the winds were finally out of the noreast on her starboard quarters presaging the first of the trades that would bear her slantwise for the west indies with a clean and newly coppered bottom proteus was always fastest on a quartering wind the rest of the voyage had been perfectly miserably vile but for a short break in the weather when they had met up with old admiral jerviss fleet to deliver despatches day after day of reduced canvas pouring icy rains and sleet pellets of soaked and swelling rigging all going slacker by the hour threatening the loss of spars and masts to every sickening heave toss or roll with the bows smashing fistlike into every oncoming wave with a deep echoing boom as if they had run aground an hundred miles out in the bay of biscay cold rations from an unlit galley tepid soups and gruels when they had risked fires in the hearths under the steeptubs hatches mostly closed and everyone in a dim foetid fug on the gundeck with bedding and every stitch of clothing sopping wet or only halfdry when redonned the drying salt crystals itching like mad creating boils wherever flesh and wool had a chance to chafe had made even the chearly hands grumble bedding was no dryer and the hammocks so tightpacked had swayed and dipped and jerked to the ships vicious motion robbing everyone of sleep and awake or anod the cold and wet had set everyone coughing even that brief spell of decent weather had been boisterous he recalled just nice enough to air and dry things out under a weak and watery winter mediterranean sun and being rowed over to old jarvys flagship lewrie had nearly been pitched from out his gig as it rose and fell so swoopily that hed had to hang on for dear life or end up flipped arseovertits like a pancake not the sort of activity for a man who could not swim nor was scaling the tall sides of a heaving rolling threedecker at least admiral jervis now lord st vincent had been appreciative and had a welcome glass of claret whistled up once lewried gained her upper decks all the while doffing his gilttrimmed cocked hat in his eccentric manner from the instant lewrie had addressed him til the moment he had turned to depart now even here past degrees west and degrees north where he had been at last allowed to open those intriguing additional advisories the weather was foul just better by matter of degree it was no longer frigid now it could perhaps be described as only cool and brisk and he had finally thawed out he slapped his hands together behind his back and rocked on the balls of his feet as he swayed from side to side along with his ship pondering no matter several expeditions sent out from france attempting to reclaim their prewar island colonies the french had lost most of them except for guadeloupe and the much smaller isles nestled close around guadeloupemariegalante la desirade the tiny iles de saintes and iles de la petite terre they had lost st barthйlйmy dominica and saint martin which they had shared with the dutch they had lost martinique its planters and settlers welcoming british occupation as salvation from the brutal jacobin terrors of parisian revolutionary officials who panted to behead or hang anyone suspected of less than total ardour for the republic the french had also lost tobago grenada and saint vincent and for a time had lost saint lucia til the islanders had rebelled driving british troops off the island three years before in grenada was also iffy with british forces only holding fort st george and the rest of the island in the hands of a slave rebellion led by a coloured planter julien fйdon guadeloupe so lewrie was informed was a hornets nest of privateers with everything from proper merchant ships to longboats outfitted and armed french frigates corvettes and smaller national ships sometimes called there for resupply a particularly vicious and greedy bastard by name of victor hugues had landed with a small army in june of after guadeloupe had been occupied by british regiments under general sir charles grey and had defeated them ever since he had sent agents provocateurs to stir up revolution on the former french islands among the frenchspeaking slaves and free coloureds on dominica and grenada among the black caribs of saint vincent a bloodthirsty fanatic he had guillotined over disloyal white settlers so far but he was brutally effective even getting agents arms and money to britishowned islands slaves and freedmen lewrie and proteus were therefore to patrol vigourously with an eye out for privateers proper french warships and anything suspicious no matter how small that might help foment more troubles right so far so good he thought sos especial care to protect british merchantmen and enforce the navigation acts british goods in british bottoms to and from british colonies and everyone else can go sing for thescraps except for the americans temporarily the spanish were still at war with england but his advisories didnt make them sound up to much cuba had few ships and was under a heavy blockade from jamaica the aforementioned santo domingo was not a real factor neither was puerto rico even if the locals had driven off a british expeditionary force should french ships not be able to use french ports their privateers and warships might be found near a spanish possession or lurking among the danish virgin islands then there was saint domingue and the americans again before the french revolution in so his advisories told him saint domingue had been the richest prize in the west indies and its trade in sugar molasses rum and arrack coffee and dyewoods had been worth more than all the british colonies put together william pitt the younger the prime minister along with lord dundas and those worthies in whitehall had desired it above all another british expeditionary force had invaded saint domingue from jamaica in with eager help from white french planters and traders the socalled grands blancs those richest with the most to lose along with their heads most were royalists whod be first in line for the turnbrils to the guillotine at present british soldiers held most of the seaports in south province and west province with the french republicans pretty much in charge of north province tired of staring at the ocean lewrie turned and strode forrud to his chartspace for a peek at a map toulon woke from a nap and trotted beside him good puss lewrie cooed as toulon rolled onto his back atop a map of the island of hispaniola thats it crush the dons in santo domingo not this half saint domingue was like the letter u laid on its side the two long arms aimed westerly first settled and richest north province was the upper arm and long peninsula that thrust towards cuba and the windward passage british troops held the harbour of mole st nicholas near its western tip and port de paix the royal navy blockaded the provincial and colonial capital cap francoishe made a note to himself that the locals referred to it as le capand the port of fort dauphin near the eastern border with spanish santo domingo between the two arms lay a vast bight and west province with all its freshwater rivers running down from the high mountains where the french had dug intricate irrigation canals to water their fields british troops held the port of gonaives just above the river ester and the port of saint marc in the south the small island of gonave was lightly garrisoned by british troops the isle broke the bay of port au prince into two channels leading to the large harbour and town of the same name down at the elbow bend where south province s peninsula began british troops had a firm grip on south province and the port towns of grand goave and petit goave on the northern coast and jacmel on the southern shore south province had been last to be settled and farmed with slaves it was much drier and less productive since it lay in the lee of those stormbreaking mountains in the rain shadow most nourishing rainwater fell on west province therefore such a rich place so lush and green and so deadly murjf toulon asked sprawled on his belly with his chin on the border looking for pets damn bad place aye youre right puss lewrie said as he swept him up to cradle him and tickle his white belly it was no wonder to him that the british forces now under general maitland had gone little farther inland after all that libertй fraternitй egalitй bumf of the revolutionary mobs saint domingue had erupted in civil war between royalists and republicans with the grands blancs and the petits blancswhich could mean any white settler from a modest tradesman or overseer to a drunken harbour layaboutup in arms with the help of those aspiring gens de coleur the free blacks and mixed race mulattoes until the whites had made it plain that the colony wished freedom from france but would keep the slave plantation system and the strict racial hierarchy that is then the persons of colour had made it a threesided civil war highflown edicts written in paris granting full voting rights to gens de coleur born free and of two free parents maybe in all the island had enraged the lower class petits blancs who would die before being valued lower than a cuffy and to top it all off in the darkly black slaves in the countryside had risen in revolt murdering their masters burning lush manor houses raping white women raiding and looting before forming into loose battalions that used hoes pitchforks scythes and cane knives to fight and defeat europeantrained and armed soldiers and militias as well as the countryside police who were mostly mulatto or halfcoloured to begin with paris had sent another slobbering fanatic lйger sonthonax to saint domingue with european troops and some portable guillotines more free blacks had arrived too fresh from the terror to lead the cause of full equality sonthonax thought that all island whites no matter their station were royalist or separatist so his guillotines stayed busy and as his homebred troops died of malaria and the yellow jack or got massacred in the backcountry by slave rebels he aligned with the mulatto militias who aspired to emulate their white parents rather than side with the darker mostly illiterate plantation slaves now the interior of the colony was controlled by the slaves in arms wellarmed too so lewrie was informedand led by a man who styled himself general toussaint louverture a former house slave himself when the war began in a spanish army of men had tried to invade saint domingue from santo domingo now louverture was just about ready to invade the spanish half of hispaniola to free his fellow spanish blacks such servile unrest his orders firmly advised was not to be allowed off that unhappy isle he was to take sink or burn any ships of a slave navy departing saint domingue before rebellion along with arms and encouragement could get to jamaica and other colonies but on the other hand toulon lewrie wryly mused as he stroked the ramcats silky belly making toulon rattlepurr and half shut his eyes in bliss he was to do nothing to impede the slaves since they were good at making mincemeat of what troops the french still had ashore or had a chance of fetching from europe as the orders subtly hinted arms and munitions imported by whatever means are not to be discouraged so long as no hint of future export to british colonies is suspected it was hoped the advisories stated that this spring of general maitland could march inland and defeat the illfed barefoot slaves further isolate any remaining french garrisons and finally conquer the damned place failing that the semblance of amity encouragement and cooperation with the slaves aspirations to either delude them long enough to disarm them or bring them into the fold as temporary allies would suit and speaking of temporary allies those orders and advisories waxed eloquent about the americans they were back at sea with a real navy after scrapping their last old continental navy ships in no longer dependent upon a tiny clutch of revenue cutters in the treasury department or small customs vessels maintained in coastal waters by the several states not that the continental navy had been worth all that much in those days lewrie recalled with a snort of derision hed only seen one real warship and shed gone down with her guns firing in a hopelessly onesided fight with his old ship hms desperate the brig o war liberty had been her name no matter the royal navy had taken sunk or burned or blockaded most of them til theyd rotted at their anchorages no it had been their adventurous privateers that had carried the fight decimating british trade americans were an odd lot lewrie had gathered if war came at sea theyd prefer the lax discipline and hope of profitsharing of a privateer to the regimented life of a navy vessel patriotism for flintyeyed avaricious yankee doodles went down better when sweetened by plunder prize money and the chance to gallivant in high adventure for a few months the americans hed met when a callow midshipman during the revolution had struck him as leery of a central government with too much power of a large standing army at the beck and call of potential tyrants or despots in that regard at least americans and englishmen were of one mind theyd much prefer a seagoing batch of minutemen what they called their casual volunteer farmersoldier militias to the high cost of a formal fleet perhaps an american navys more palatable puss lewrie told his cat now stretched nighboneless across his lap out of sight and no threat ashore less they smash up the taverns american trade had grown like mildew in his dirty shirts though merchant ships under their peculiar gridiron striped banner were seen on every sea these days trading with anyone despite the war belligerent or neutral and admittedly bore a fair portion of british goods as neutrals they were raking in the blunt with both fists he was advised that american merchantmen could be encountered in the indies in large numbers even entering spanish ports on cuba and puerto rico and he was to follow a wary but handsoff policy unless he suspected any contraband going to french or spanish ports lately though their old friends the french had turned a new leaf in their dealings with america french trade was practically nonexistent due to the royal navy but even so the frogs were now stopping and searching american ships for contraband requiring them to produce not just passenger lists and manifests but lists that showed the names and nationality of officers and crew rфles dйquipage or else america and great britain had recently signed a treaty that had settled some border disputes in the pacific northwest and disputes at sea about exactly what neutral really meant and that treaty had piqued the french even more they had renounced the american notion that free ships make free goods a clause of their own treaty of amity and commerce with america in force since france had stated that henceforth they would treat neutrals in the same manner that england did whatever that meant if american ships carried cargoes to or from england or her allies and lately even if they carried goods to or from france and her allies they were subject to search and seizure the british ambassador to the united states had estimated that nearly ships had been taken in the caribbean alone since it was all part of an ongoing plan to bully threaten cajole coax or bribe the united states into war on france s side french agents had been tampering with american domestic politics for years in point of fact even after neutral american merchant ships had both fed and clothed them in the early days of their revolution when crops had failed year after year and france was rocked by internal revolts against the jacobin republic now the advisories said france had declared that any american ships caught carrying any british goods were bonne prise and prey for their warships and privateers worst thing tdo to a yankee doodle lewrie thought hit him in the coinpurse engraged at last so the british ambassador had written those americans were rushing to finish six large th rate frigates that had been started in and and patriotic public subscriptions were being solicited in every seaport from maine to georgia to buy and arm or quickly build a united states navy the advisories hinted that america might even declare war upon the french and ally themselves with great britain so captains were warned to do nothing to discourage such a declaration perhaps find a way to encourage such a move they could always use another ally and one with nautical experience and knacky skillas shown by the privateers in the last war at any ratewould be more than welcome an ally that did not need vast bargeloads of silver to prop them up like the austrians and prussians and neapolitans did during the time of the socalled first coalition in would be doubly welcome so american merchant ships must be protected from privateers or french cruisers but on the other hand british trade and the navigation acts were still in force and american ships that overstepped the boundaries of their cooperation had to be stopped and searched at the same time american vessels could still use their neutrality to trade with the dons in cuba puerto rico and santo domingo but contraband and martial cargoes were not allowed on the other hand americans could trade with the french on hispaniola in saint domingue if they wished to risk it but on the other hand the export of arms monies and agents to british colonies on american ships was to be stopped good god the newborn united states navy so said his orders would share the private signals books with royal navy warships and an american naval presence in the caribbean was expected shortly but theyre not yet allies nor are they yet at war with france so give all aid and assistance but joint operation as cobelligerents out in the open for all to see was to be avoided unless there was pressing need for quick action doubledealing hypocrisy lewrie felt like shouting in anger as he leaned over his sleeping cat to scan his orders once more and to top all he was to be on the lookout for spithead and nore mutiny deserters royal navy deserters or british merchant tars who had taken service in american vessels to avoid the impress service and their proper duty in the royal navy even though american ships were already ready to fight over the demand for a rфle dйquipage by the french listing crewmens names and national identities most especially he was to seek out specific persons listed by name and description who had served in the hermione frigate in these waters those whod mutinied against a captain pigot murdered him in his bed murdered officers mates and midshipmen then sailed her off to a port on the spanish main and sold her as prize to support themselves even were they aboard american merchantmen or warships were any found they were to be taken aboard bound in chains on the orlop or in the bilges thence to be taken with all despatch to either english harbour antigua or kingston jamaica for courtmartial and later hanging whichever was closer troll for pregnant female sturgeons too he whispered god give me reasonable orders he gravelled to himself fetch home the golden fleece sweep out the aegean stables something like that somethin doable for pitys sake he lifted toulon from his lap and deposited him on the desktop before him the cat grumbling and arching as he turned to go aft for a whiff of fresh air the transom sashwindows were open a touch letting in brisk cool air after weeks of tightshut fug closeup he now took note of how the panes were splattered with dried salt and halfmisted on the outside with a dull grey film of sea salt crystals given his mood he could almost mistake it for smears of congealed pork fat he rubbed his hands together disliking how the air felt so coolly humid and greasy of how humidoilyclammy his skin felt under his clothes this cruise will turn tshit he muttered softly it would be more war on the cheap more sleaziness one more hefty dollop of semicovert underhandedness where he foully suspected his every step must be circumspect else hed finally find the one slick one that tumbled career repute and income to perdition aspinall aye sir a glass of claret if ya will fore noon sights sir aspinall dared to query surprised aye chapter ten the difference that a couple of weeks made was amazing running before the noreast trades sometimes with the winds large on the starboard quarter sometimes right up the stern and both sheets aft in what seemed a twinkling the horizon expanded the scudding gloom overhead lifted parted and turned cerulean blue swept by mares tails in faint cloudy tracings the seas no longer churned like washtub suds but rolled in majestically long periods spattered with choppy smaller waves that broke and parted against the hull with the sounds of elated sighs no longer hammering or threatening and the sunrises and sunsets magnificent orange suns presaged by a faint streak of grey on the horizon burst like bombshells painting the eastern skies amber shading to dusty rosered or the palest yellow for a brief minute or so and one could feel the day coming racing across the ocean faster than any frigate could ever swim or wingchurning sparrow fly as the warmth spread outward westward as if the doors to a lush garden had been flung open and hands and officers and mates standing quarters to greet any nasty surprises at dawn could smile with relief for proteus to be alone once more and with a small measure of delight at natures glories and the sunsets at the end of a long day of work or gun drill late enough now to fall in the second dog watch after the crews mess brought offwatch hands on deck to peer forward westward to savour a sight that most in their coalsmoked foggy and rainy towns hamlets or villages had rarely seen great towering cumuli shading off to pearlygrey or charcoal were speared by swordblades of golden light the sun goldenred surrounded by roses ahead and a soft bluegrey gloom astern in which first stars could be made out swept closer by the minute to overtake their ship as it surged over the sea with a sibilant hissing the topsls painted gilt or a gleaming parchment hue shoes had been dispensed with suffocating blue wool jackets so welcome in march were stowed away except for sunday divisions shirt sleeves were now rolled above the elbow loose slop trousers gathered above the knees collars spread wide and placket buttons undone for a breath of cooling air or a greater exposure to the healing rays of a benign sun shirts were rarely worn at all for many doffed them despite the surgeon mr shirleys warnings about sunburn and the cost of butterbased salves that would be deducted from their pay if they appeared lobsterred at sick call officers and senior warrants now some dignity was demanded though lewrie did allow them to dispense with cocked hats and uniform coats proper breeches clean shirts and neckstocks were de rigeur and stockings and shoes it was only during the second dog that they could undo their stocks roll up their sleeves and savour the cooling winds til full sundown before heading aft and below to the gunroom for their own suppers at the change of watch pipes would glow on the darkening deck as the smokers had the last taste before heading below offwatch or taking station for the eighttilmidnight fiddles fifes pennywhistles and the soft hums of desmonds uillean pipes would sound every sunset unless it rained and crewmen would dance hornpipes or slipjigs sometimes for competition between eightman messes sometimes between larboard or starboard watches to see who was the best countrydance tunes would jerk and tootle more urgent paces more exuberant turns on the decking and the men might pair off by twos to practice for future shore leaves in the islands or perhaps to whimsically recall better times before theyd taken the kings shilling and gone to sea bedding was dry now clothing did not have to be wrung out to be donned every third day or so there would come a mildish squall with lashings of warm welcome rain creating a scurry for all hands to rig canvas sluices to catch it in empty casks to trap enough for a cask to be scrubbed clean of the slick brownish growth that eventually would infest them turning reputedly fresh water pale brown and semiopaque stubs of soap would appear along with saltstiff sweatstiff shirts and trousers to be spread on the deck scrubbed furiously while the rain lasted sometimes only minutes then thrashed or slapped or wrung out then hung up to dry after the rain had passed a bit more than a few might strip naked and pound the smuts from the slop clothing they wore at that moment or merely stand widearmed mouths open and turned up like hatchling birds waiting to be fed to be showered cooler and cleaner all in all hms proteus was a happy ship they had been paid just before departing sheerness the usual six months of arrears made good and the wonders of the west indies were still to come if they were allowed ashore to sample the foods the alehouses and taverns and the women their days were filled from sunrise to sunset with the usual labours such as reroving the rigging tautening the standing stays every other day one side at a time after wearing from larboard to starboard tack off the wind when the lee side would have a little more slack to work with taking down the stormcanvas and stowing them below after the sailmaker and his crew had patched darned and sewn frayed seams hoisting aloft and bending on the lighter everyday set of sails and of course there were the unending drills during the forenoon watch runningin mockloading runningout and firing the greatguns carronades and swivels with a weekly live shoot at a jettisoned keg or chicken coop cutlass drill and boarding pike drill to keep their skills sharp and give them some additional exercise a turn at live musketry at overside targets even practice with horrid sea pattern pistols that were only considered accurate when jammed in a foemans belly and triggered off striking topmasts to the deck in quick order then hoisting them back aloft preparing for the day when a raging west indies hurricane might overtake their ship and the topmasts would have to be lowered for survivalor the day when enemy fire might dismast them and victory or defeat might hinge upon how quickly spare topmasts and spars could be deployed and when all that was done there was grog a turn at a waterbutt the galley funnel spuming a partly homesick aroma of wood smoke and boiling meat the smells of soups or pease puddings as the sun declined as a country cottage or town workers humble lodgings smelled at sundown when the days pay had been collected an ale or two had been drunk at ones favourite local pub among fellow workers and neighbourhood friends at the end of the loosehipped mellow stroll on the high street or side lane that led to family wife and home weary aye mostly satisfied with their lot for the moment some a trifle groggy as usual each dusk they still had the spirit to open their voices in rough tune revive the sentimental lachrymose airs that sailors liked best of all and sing the sun down toulon dont leave yer mark on the hammock nettings sailors have tsleep on those things lewrie admonished his ramcat perched on the canvascovered bulwark of tightly rolled hammocks overlooking the ships waist he gave him a necktousling pet then strolled up to the windward side plucking at his shirt one more sign that they were in the tropics the days heat that had been welcome at first was now nigh punishing more glaring and the prismatic flashes of sunlight off the sea were now more like a field of toobright snow that gave everyone a perpetual squint lewrie turned to face inward once he had taken hold of a mizen stay and given it a tug to test its tautness taking note of dowe one of the quartermasters mates serving his trick at the wheel he was an american the son of a longdead loyalist who had fled to nova scotia at the revolutions end dowe lowered his gaze from the draw of the sails and eased his own squint raising his brows for a moment which made lewrie smile with a face at ease dowe showed white untanned streaks round his eyes and on his forehead that squinting kept as pale as a ladys thighs them raccoon eyes sir dowe had termed them lewrie recalled making him chuckle too he thought he had seen one when hms desperate had put into charleston back in and he was sure he had eaten a raccoon when besieged and halfstarved at yorktown with lord cornwalliss doomed army either way lewrie thought the description apt sail ho the mainmast lookout screeched from the crosstrees where away lt wyman yelled back his hands cupped about his mouth though that was little help for his thinnish voice one point off th larboard bows hull down a schooner well about time too lewrie muttered pleased they had proved that the ocean was a huge empty place on their voyage for even though they had steered proteus souwesterly nigh to the latitude of dominica and across the mostused track for any merchant ships this would only be the second ship they had encountered most merchant masters bore on south from cape st vincent to dominicas latitude then ran it due westthey only had to solve their slight variation in latitude daily and calculate longitude by adding up the hour sums from their knotlogs by dead reckoning and if all else failed them the cloudswept peaks of dominica were the tallest marks in the caribbean damned hard to miss for even the most lubberly cackhanded navigatorlike the master of the only other ship that they had spoken a reeking portugee blackbirder laden with a cargo of threehundredodd slaves fresh from dahomey and so creaky and slow it appeared that at least a quarter of those forlorn souls would die before arrival the damned fool had actually asked lewrie where exactly they were here though within two days sail of english harbour antigua the presence of local shipping could be expected english harbour was a royal navy station a safe place for overseas trade as well this schooner lewrie surmised was mostlike a local schooners were popular craft in the west indies foreandaft rigged to go like a witch to windward and point at least tentotwelve degrees closer to the winds a desirable trait did one desire to beat back eastward against the unvarying noreast trades some adventurous types sailed schooners from as far north as maine in the americas and schooners made hellish good privateers too due to their speed and agility mister elwes aloft with a glass sir tell us what you see lieutenant wyman snapped aye aye sir the eager young midshipman piped back dashing to the rack by the binnacle cabinet to seize a telescope then scampering up the weather mizen shrouds as spryly as a monkey should we clear for action sir wyman asked not quite yet mister wyman lewrie demurred hulldown on such a clear day means shes ten miles off or more plenty of time to smoak her unless she runs of course hoy the deck midshipman elwes cried down schooner rigged and flying no flag sailing abeam the wind to the nornorwest i do however desire that we harden up to the wind sir and cut the angle on her make our course west by north shake out those first reefs in the tgallants and stand by should we need the royals lewrie said after a peek at the compass lewrie took a telescope of his own and ambled back to the windward rail braced himself on the mizen stays and eyed their stranger the merest sliver of her uppermost hull sometimes loomed up above the horizon as a distant swell lifted her in another moment she would be swallowed leaving only the upper part of her sails visible damme is she foreshortening he asked himself with a frown deck there mr elwes called chase is hauling her wind turning westnorwest chase is hoisting gaff staysls foreshortening aye showing proteus her sternquarters mr elwes might be presumptive in calling her a chase but that turn gave lewrie a premonitory thrill has she shown any colours yet mister elwes lewrie queried none sir lewrie rubbed his unshaven chin ideas percolating even were she british or neutral and innocent as anything fear of the french privateers might make a ship run from a strange vessel one that looked lean and fast like a ship of war but did the schooner continue westnorwest she could just shave by the northern coast of antigua and would be on a perfect course to duck into neutral waters in the danish virgins near st croix though by sunset proteus could surely run her down with her longer waterline and her much larger sail area or the schooner might try to come about rounding antigua and head sutherly for st kitts in antigua s lee schooners were twoapenny and by full dark she might hope to escape in the gloom letting another similar schooner be the goat proteus slowly swung onto her new course her decks heeled over more to leeward as the press of wind on her reset sails made her start to race and surge she was after a chase and like a staghound on a firm spoor like a tiger pacing an indian millet field after an addled goat she strode out confidently surely offwatch crewmen were drawn to the deck by the commotion all but licking their chops in anticipation of a prize this isnt a cockfight lads lewrie had to shout theres gundrill to perform keep yer eyes inboard and your minds on your evolutions fore the bosun and master gunner pass among you with their reminders even so lewrie knew the hands would whisper among themselves try peeking over the gangways or out the windward gunports men aloft would find a way to send the latest observations down to their mateys no matter what the bosun the master gunner the master at arms and his ships corporals threatenedit was simply too much of a novelty deck there midshipman elwes cried chase is hullup sirs she now shows a flag french colours a hundred horny paws slapped together and rubbed with a sound like dry grit a hundred voices muttered good prize together and a palpable frisson of delight and greed swept the decks making mates sailors and officers alike beam with joy and ships boys jigdance lewrie clapped his hands behind his back and pondered if he hoisted the french tricolour as well there was a chance that he might reel this schooner in like a fish relieved to meet a fellow frenchman so far from home a privateer lewrie silently mused more than glad tsee a national ship enough to haul her wind and fetchto waitin on us there was the possibility that a frog privateer would know the few confirmed french ships of war sailing out of guadeloupe by sight mister wyman lewrie said with a sly grin do you hoist a french flag on the foremast and run up a who are you where she can see it does she answer with a private signal shes confirmed and ours oh lt wyman gawped for a second my goodness gracious i see sir aye sir we know the frogs qui va la signal moments later it was done and they waited to see what signal would be hoisted in return despite his best intentions like most of those lewrie could rarely keep em a smug grin creased his face a slyboots look of cocky satisfaction deck there midshipman elwes cried french colours down shes hoisted british hah liar lieutenant wyman commented all but hooting to his fellow officers who had also come up to share the excitement well damme lewrie thought deflated in an instant didnt think o that could she really be he cupped his hands and bellowed aloft mister elwes has she changed course reduced sail hoisted any signal at all no sir still running same course and no private signal damn lewrie griped softly mister wyman get that frog rag and signal down then hoist our own colours and this months recognition signal and ready a forecastle gun to fire to leeward aye sir the red ensign went up the foremast a string of code flags was bent on and hoisted followed a minute or two later by a single cannon shot the schooner was closer now not over four miles off as proteus swiftly strode up to her with a bone in her teeth deck there chase now bears norwest by west i think i see stunsls no reply to signals dammit make our heading norwest by north mister wyman and hoist royals lewrie snapped now irritated and once thats done well beat to quarters and ready the larboard battery aye aye sir proteus heeled a bit more her wake and bustle growing louder and more insistent threequarters of an hour and the schooner grew larger as they closed the range to three miles no matter how swiftly the schooner scudded along in flight she had lowered british colours long before seeing that the ruse was fruitless hands stood swaying behind the greatguns already loaded with the smoothest and roundest solid iron balls charged with powder and the newfangled flintlock strikers primed ease that quoin out even more there lads lt catterall told his larboard gunners were heeled and shooting to leeward so keep the barrels aimed high well adjust once were close and the ports are open so you can mark your target and gauge the range mile and a half i make it sir lt langlie volunteered from his place near lewrie on the lee rails almost rangetorandomshot for the sixpounder chase gun well wait til the larboard battery can bear mister langlie lewrie countered slowly pacing now dressed in his secondbest uniform with his sword at his side and the sweat trickling down his back and itching icily on his spine i doubt yon schooner mounts anything heavier than a fourpounder once were near abeam with the guns run out perhaps this msieur will gain some sense and strike before we have to blow him out of the water antigua to leeward there i think lewrie heard lieutenant devereux their marine officer say and barbuda off our starboard bows he opined jutting his chin towards a greyish hump on the horizon no couldnt be sergeant skipwith sure i dont know sir skipwith commented still an hundred miles to leeward sir lt langlie took time to inform their senior lobsterback well a days sail by now i expect youre mistaking squalls on the horizon for islands were barbuda and antigua this close wed see them plain the channel between is only thirtyseven miles dye see half a day in chase lewrie muttered and he still had not gotten his chin shaved the galley fires had been doused and dinner had been delayed the crews hunger only slightly eased with hardtack biscuit water and dry crumbly navy issue cheese of course the rum ration had been doled out some customs were observed no matter what threequarters of a mile now sir lt langlie pointed out mister wyman lewrie called down to the second lieutenant by the foremast now in charge of the starboard guns one chase gun to windward let her know our intentions aye sir a windward gun was a challenge to battle and a threat strike your colours haul up and fetchto or else bang the focsle pounder barked out a blank charge billowing a sour cloud of maggotpale gunsmoke that was quickly scudded off to larboard across the forecastle by the trades that were now almost abeam proteuss deck lewrie along with every senior man allowed the liberty of the quarterdeck lifted a telescope to see what answer was forthcoming like most sternchases hours could pass before any noticeable progress was made then all of a sudden the chase would leap within spitting distance in an eyeblink no matter that her sails still drew her wake still seethed the mustachio under her bows still flung spray so busily about her as if shed grown weary of it all and meant to surrender to her fate quartermile i make it now sir lt langlie observed open the larboard gunports and run out mister langlie hull the bitch when nicely abeam lewrie coldly replied his eyes gone as grey as arctic ice as was his wont when angered or in action sir there was a puff of smoke upon the schooners bows then a tinny flat bang from a leeside gun the sound masked by her sails and hull muffled by the winds roar and the onward rushing sshhuush of proteuss hull she had fired a leeward gun in sign of peaceful intent or to signify her surrender a second or two later down came her patently false british colours as if she had indeed struck but up went a gridiron flag a busy banner of red and white horizontal stripes with a canton of blue splattered with stars in one corner an american mine arse on a band box lewrie exclaimed another sham lt langlie all but spluttered at their gall no sir look midshipman adair cried pointing her hoist that is this months private signal sir youre sure mister adair lewrie gawped at those pennants spinning to face the midshipman quite sure sir see here in my copy book its dammit shes let fly her sheets captain lt langlie said drawing lewries attention back to the schooner she had freed her large gaffhung fore and main sails letting them flag and clatter almost abeam the wind no longer cupping power from it keeping the outer and inner flying jibs standing but hauling down the foretopmast staysl and those upper gaff staysls without those sails she was now slowing like a bowling coach being reined in and braked well hoist the proper damn reply mister adair lewrie snapped the gun crews to stand easy mister langlie aye sir half the damned day weve chased this silly clown and it is only now he has wit trecall hes a yankee that were almost allies proteus would pass within an hundred yards of the schooner and would spurt past her rapidly with all her tophamper still drawing tgallants royals and stunsls rigged on the windward yards all that sail blanketing what wind the schooner could receive in her lee christ itll take an hour twork back to her he growled he took langlies brass speakingtrumpet and crossed to the lee rails to speak her whilst he could before they left her in their dust who the hell are you lewrie ungraciously bellowed united states treasury department cutter the trumbull came the thin reply lieutenant gordon master and you you bloody idiot this is his brittanic majestys frigate proteus captain lewrie commanding youd think you couldve but they were past by then surging along at better than ten or eleven knots mister langlie get way off her lewrie snarled turning inboard strip us down to all plain sail then well wear down below her tack and round up windward of her ive a bone tpick with that that mister wyman mister catterall worm out your shot and charges and secure from quarters goddammit hed wasted most a days sail chasing a pluperfect fool even worse hed been made to look the fool before his officers and men and mister langlie lewrie fumed glowering aye sir whilst we perform all those evolutions in plain sight of that yankee doodle ill want everything done to a very salty tee all hands all hands lieutenant langlie bawled accepting his trumpet back and turning away to hide in furious activity as topmen raced aloft to fist and fight canvas to haul in and reduce sail deflate the set of the stunsls clew them to the booms and haul them in along the permanent yards proteus slowed and soughed into the brilliant tropic waters sighing and groaning as her timbers resettled like a racehorse taking a cooldown lap round the turf minutes later the royals were furled gasketed and the thin yards lowered to the crosstrees the tgallants tworeefed and hands piped to stations to wear the schooner was by then at least four or five miles astern plodding along somewhat like an ignored hound under plain sail as if unsure of following its master all the way to the end of the drive she continued to plod while proteus wore downwind took the trades on her larboard side for the first time in weeks and began to reach back across the wind on an opposing course about two cables below the schooner mister adair assumin this slackjawed yankee can actually be able to read do you hoist take station in my lee lewrie sneered aye aye sir ill put her off our larboard quarters before we tack sir lt langlie asked hands behind his back where lewrie strongly suspected he still had his fingers crossed for luck too bad we cant shave his transom mister langlie by the by a creditable showing for our erstwhile allies so far that is uhm thankee kindly sir langlie replied with a gladsome grin though tempered with a first officers usual quick moue for all the things that could yet go smash and at the very worst possible time at your discretion mister langlie she replies affirmative sir midshipman adair announced the schooner began to fall off the wind all but pointing her bowsprit and jibboom at proteuss midships damn him i didnt mean come under my lee right bloody now lewrie barked wait til she shes well off our larboard quarters before we tack mister langlie a longer board closehauled before the tack as well mister adair haul that signal down hoist hold course aye sir the schooner dithered swinging back to abeam the trades while proteus surged past once more rapidly falling astern safe enough now i should think mister langlie aye sir all hands stations for stays proteus swung up onto the wind closehauled and heading to east soueast her hands freeing braces tacks and sheets langlie left it for a long moment rocking upward on the balls of his booted feet before opening his mouth to shout through the speakingtrumpet quartermaster ease down the helm ready ready lt langlie cried waiting turning and swivelling about eyes everywhere for this maneuevre helms alee rise tacks and sheets hms proteus for all her length and tonnage was a lively one and she came up to the wind briskly jibs clattering the spanker aft eased amidships and driving the foretopsl flat aback swinging easily until haul taut now mainsl haul and she was across the eye of the wind the deck swaying upright then canting leeward yards swinging blocks clanging and canvas rattling like musketry stars above if he hasnt come up closehauled the sailing master mr winwood exclaimed coming as close to blasphemy as that good man might ever dare lewrie spun about to glare at the yankee schooner chilling as the thought struck him that were she truly a french privateer that had captured a set of private signals now would be the very best time to fire with proteus and her crew still all sixesandsevens everything in the running rigging still free her guns unloaded run in and bowsed snug to the bulwarks even a puny broadside of popguns could confuse the crew turn their tack into a bloody shambles whilst a bold french privateersman could swing up to windwardlike the schooner was doingand scamper fullandby to weather pointing higher than ever a squarerigged frigate could attain into the open empty seas east of barbuda giving them a gallic horselaugh and with a tale to gasconade about the entire caribbean no lewrie took note proteus had completed her tack and would block this socalled treasury department cutter on her present course course does she hold her course shell ram us he thought i dont see moren thirty hands all told and all o them hangin in her riggin for agood looksee very good mister langlie now stand aloof of that henhead til we may cock up into the wind and fetchto mister adair lewrie bawled aye sir a second hoist young sir tell that aimless bastard to fetch to leave come under my lee flyin is god merciful even he might get our intent then should he actually fetchto in our lee i will wish you to lower both of those and hoist captain repair on board smartly now go again like a hound warned away from the promise of fresh meat when a hog was slaughtered in the barnyard the schooner shied off the wind to roughly abeam leaving a thankful gap between them and ending the imminent threat of collision as proteus began the evolution for fetchingto with some sails still drawing on starboard tack driving forward and others backed to snub her progress gad quite the quadrille were dancin with em hey mister winwood lt catterall said as he ascended the lee ladder from below thought we would do swing your lady the rest of the afternoon mmmmmm lewrie harumphed quite pointedly though he felt like growling at him though they arent quite fetchedto yet mr winwood noted save us a spot o bother that catterall breezed blithely on and give them a shorter row and us with more rigging and sail aloft with more freeboard well drift right down aboard her if this fellow dont winwood began to fret ill skin the bastard swear it that cackhanded whipjack cunnythumbed sonofa lubber damn him lewrie swore nigh to one of his rare footstomping rants or a helpless whimpering flinging his arms up in appeal to heaven at trumbulls captain and his ignorance his clueless disregard for sidetimbers paintwork or seamanship do we get under way once hes aboard sir perhaps our loord drift will not be so great before we uhm lt langlie helpfully suggested heaving a deep speculative shrug ah hummm prhaps mister langlie lewrie said helpless appeal to heaven won over rage as he sagged in philosphical defeat sideparty for a mere lieutenant or a putative captain sir lt catterall casually enquired buck lewrie answered with a what can you do shrug and an unintelligible little noise that sounded hellishlike a cluck very good sir catterall replied backing away with a wary look on his face chapter eleven the crew of hms proteus had oohed and aahed over the sights of land they had encountered as the frigate continued on about antigua and sailed near nevis and st kitts before reaching english harbour a pack of mostly johnny newcomes to the bleak infinity of the sea and starved for even a hint of green sere as those isles were they did have trees and bushes and plantations that reached down near the thin sand beaches but those appreciative noises were nothing like the ones they made when once they sighted jamaica morant point was barely above the horizon but the blue mountains stood tall and cool and bold to the norwest with blue mountain peak spearing over feet into the air smoky and hazy bluegrey clouddraped as if it bore a magical snowcap even in the tropics all above a descending hilly swath of headland so lushly verdant land so brightly green and welcoming that the hands could almost mistake it for faeryland or the irishmen in the crew could conjure that they had discovered the legendary happy isles that always lay just beyond a sunset somewhere across the wide western sea the officers and midshipmenand lewrie too it must be admittedstood entranced at the starboard rails or bulwarks as proteus cruised on under all plain sail nearer the coast straight west and within a bare two miles of morant bay and bound for kingston for alan lewrie it was almost like coming home for jamaica had been the scene of many of his adventures and misadventures during the american revolution where hed won and lost a very young and missish lucy beauman had gotten orders to scout the florida coast and march inland to the muskogee indians where hed learned the war was over in the summer of and knew hed lose his brief command of hms shrike the old snowrigged brig o war he had inherited from her former master lieutenant lily crop lewrie did not need a telescope to see the old headlands the planter houses near the shore the hints of coastal road between groves of trees or the fringe of beaches where he had once gamboled nighnude in shallow surf with some hired strumpet i do believe that is the palisades before our bows sir lt langlie announced just above the horizon and the ruins of old port royal at its western tip lewrie said with a slow pleased grin once the wickedest town in the whole wide world or so twas said and kingston beyond a comer on the wicked roster itself lets take two reefs in the courses and harbour gasket the royals mister langlie slow but steady on a topsl breeze the harbour entrance is narrow at the western tip of the palisades just by fort charles and im damned if i wish to tangle with another frigate leaving port and both of us with a dash on aye sir mister wyman once were shipshape aloft you and the master gunner mister carling will have a salute ready for admiral sir hyde parker mister catterall sir the third lieutenant said after a long moment ashore and with the jamaican ladies already were we mister catterall lewrie said with a smirk twitting him natural philosophy sir the flora looks quite intriguing lt catterall quickly replied why i might discover a new orchid or a sprig of captain blighs infamous breadfruit trees or when we enter harbour round up into wind and let go anchors ill be depending on you sir to make it presentable with our new admiral and twodozen postcaptains watching flora indeed ha aye aye sir catterall answered the underlings best reply in such situations best performance catterall gave the middies who would serve at both forecastle and stern kedge anchor a glare to warn them and pass the mustard on mister winwood aye sir the sailing master said presenting himself i think we should steer a point more direct for the entrance lewrie said do you concur aye sir we can round up abeam once were fair in the channel better than coming abeam a mile or more off the entrance and get a veer in the wind off those mountains then make her head westbynorth half north very good sir quartermaster if i wernt a gunner i wouldnt be here number five gun fire their new master gunner mr carling droned pacing aft from the forecastle belfry towards the stern one arm swinging like a bandmasters now and then swinging in a larger arc to point to a waiting guncaptain in signal to trigger his firelock and discharge his piece ive left my wife my home and all thats dear number six gun fire if i wernt a gunner i wouldnt be here marines in full redcoated kit pipeclayed crossbelts and hats of whitepiped black felt for once stood at the hammock nettings overlooking the waist and along the starboard side facing fort charles their muskets held at present arms usually they saved wear on expensive uniforms for which theyd have to pay if faded torn or soiled and wore sailors slopclothing when not standing guard duty by doors to the officers gunroom lewries quarters the spirits stores or the ladders to the quarterdeck proteus ghosted into harbour on topsls jibs and spanker and wreathed in gunsmoke from her salute that only slowly drifted leeward on a mild breeze there were several twodecker gun rd rates anchored near the north shore but none flew an admirals broad pendant or looked even close to being a flagship frigates sloops of war brigs and hired or captured warships below the rates were twoapenny though presenting a pretty problem as to where lewrie could find room for his ship to anchor and swing why so many in port he wondered to himself dont they know i need room dont they know theres a war on theres a guardboat sir waving a jack at us lieutenant langue pointed out i do believe hes showing us an anchorage well thank god for small favours come about onto the wind and steer for him mister langlie lewrie said with a wellconcealed sigh of vast relief do not run him over sir its bad form ya gigs ready sah his coxn andrews informed him from his left side ya don mind sah ill bring de boat off oncet you step ashore an keep an eye skinned tcome fetch ya when ya done lewrie frowned and turned to look at andrews who was sulled up like a bullfrog ducking his head and his eyes darting as cutty as a bag of nailslooking six ways from sundayin embarassment something wrong with a drink ashore andrews he teased be sumptin bad wrong do my old master see me capum sah oh thats right you ran from jamaica but surely so long ago woll he alius liked spanish town moren kingston true sah but him an his neighbours dey was a hard set sah hold grudges as bad as dem serbs an turks back in de balkans dya not mind sah i dont wanna take no chance o gettin took up again remind me to have my clerk padgett forge you a letter of manumission from a master in the carolinas andrews lewrie decided for the other black hands too just to be safe law thankee sah andrews said with a wide grin of relief on his phyz dotd be hondsomefine sah after all forging runs in the family lewrie chuckled but til weve proper uhm certificates ready aye bring the boat back to the ship and ill hire a bumboat for my return aye aye sah proteus found her anchorage rounded up to slither on windward for a piece her foretopsl flat aback to brake her progress until the very last of her way fell off and the helm went helpless at that moment the best bower anchor dangling from the larboard cathead was let go to splash into the water and the hawser paid out then snubbed after a run of half a cable to see if the anchor would hold with a faint jerk and groan proteus came to a stop her voyage over hello the boat lewrie called down to the guardboat that had been so obliging where am i to report to admiral parker his flagships in the careenage sir the midshipman in the boats sternsheets called back his staff captain keeps office at fort charles for now he added pointing back at the tip of the palisades the natural breakwater mole that made kingston such a calm anchorage in most weathers with the blue mountains lying in the harsh noreast where most hurricanes blew their fiercest early winds lewrie looked in that direction using a telescope to see if anyone had hoisted the usual captain repair on board code flags no nothing for the main base of the west indies station kingston maintained what could only charitably be termed as peacetime activity very well sir thankee lewrie shouted down im going that way sir the midshipman offered would you care to be rowed over aye thatd suit admirably come alongside lewrie agreed thank de lord he heard andrews whisper sotto voce dont feel too relieved andrews you may have to come and fetch me back then take me ashore to the civilian part of town you scamp you mebbe youd speak tmister padgett afore ya go then sah he get dem certificates started andrews countered still looking wary dear lord what a lackwit captain sir edward charles said after lewrie had filled him in on his meeting with the hapless lieutenant gordon of the united states treasury department cutter trumbull if hes an example of what we may expect to meet in the near future then god help them in such a small service as their treasury or the new navy of theirs surely only their very best and most experienced officers would gain commands unless they simply have none o course i gathered that most of their experienced naval officers by now are quite aged sir lewrie informed him those who won fame back in the revolution and most of them were privateersmen to begin with the interview was going quite nicely lewrie thought captain charles was admiral sir hyde parkers staff captain a most ebulliently friendly sortbig as a rum keg about the middle and twice as stout with the rosy cheeks and nose of the serious toper the first thing to be done was to fetch newcome captain lewrie a glass of claret and take up a refill with him to be convivial they sat in leather wing chairs to either side of a winetable not before and behind the massive desk as junior and superior might like catercousins or fellow clubmen lewrie was turned out in his newest and nattiest uniform run up in london for the december fкte to celebrate camperdown the dark blue wool coat was hardfinished and smooth and perhaps a bit too hot for a tropic day but a snowywhite silk shirt and equally pristine sailcloth cotton waistcoat and breeches somewhat eased any discomfort that lewrie might have felt the single gilt epaulet on his right shoulder all the buttons and goldlace cuff trim was so new and so well packed away so long that he fair gleamed and the two medals hung about his neck had gotten a polish along with his new hessian boots with the gilt tassels captain sir edward charless eyes had drifted to the medals several times in an almost wistful way since their introduction aint evry onewinged captain that can boast one medal lewrie smugly told himself much less two poor old souls jealous within two days sail of antigua was it sir edward asked as he topped up their halffilled glasses aye sir mister gordon told me that saint kitts would be one of their rondys as would dominica american merchantmen will gather there and await escort for convoys he said to perhaps as far north as savannah in georgia he gave me the impression that what few french privateers or warships that had harried their coastal shipping were now scared off by their new frigates and that the bulk of their losses now take place in the caribbean this new naval minister of theirs termed a secretary of the navy a man name of benjamin stoddert gave gordon the further impression that hes that eager to make a forward presence as soon as they have enough ships in commission of course well if gordons little cutter was the best they have to show the flag sir edward smirked over the rim of his glass how wellarmed was she four fourpounders and a batch of swivels sir edward and all roughcast lewrie said with a deprecating sneer of his own not two from the same foundry oldstyle touchholes with powderfilled quills for ignition that or portfires the muskets and pistols that i saw were a tad rough as well copies of tower muskets he said heaving a tiny shrug though some mates and officers had purchased longrange pennsylvania rifles and those were quite wellmade and very accurate we had a little shootoff sir i with my ferguson breechloader and they with their muzzleloaders who won sir edward snapped tetchy of a sudden uhm they did sir though ramming the ball down a rifled barrel with a lubricated leather patch about it takes forever i was told that their new marine corps will be issued rifles not muskets a squad of marines in each top with rifles could decimate the officers of a foe at nearly two hundred yards maybe even a full cables range then sir god help the french when they meet dont hold with such doings myself sir edward scoffed now growling with ill humour my marinesll volley from the bulkwarks shooting officers sir is ungentlemanly deliberately targeting an officer is abominable dishonourable might as well cut their throats in their beds piratical barbaric just what id expect of american manners morals or honour pack of red indians nearlike sir in all those deerskin clothes with feathersand dungin their hair so please you well not have such in this fleet sir and ill thank you to remember that the feathers deerskins or snipin lewrie had to ask himself never stood and fought in the open captain lewrie no they skulked in the bushes and shot from cover the cowards way armed to the teeth een the women and children sir edward querulously carped in a pet over past experiences lewrie surmised uncivilised thieves and highwaymen riotous armed bullies hah but never the stomach for a proper battle and i doubt theyve improved now theyre on their own without english law to rein in their chaotic nature do we really see american warships down here ill lay you any odds you wish they will skulk in port fatten off our stores but leave the hard work to a proper navy such as ours the frenchd eat em alive well sir even as addlepate as their lieutenant gordon was lewrie dared to point out they did run a taut enough ship and they sounded quite eager to prove themselves against the frogs evry calfheaded innocent sings eager before his first fight captain lewrie sir edward countered cause he knows nothing about battle let idiots and fools like your lieutenant gordon cross hawse with a real french frigate and then see what tune he sings hah no sir americans are too disorganised too stubbornly individualistic to achieve much put a dozen in a room youll hear fifteen different opinions lazy idle twiddlers whod rather get drunk on their corn whiskeya vile concoctionjust enough bottom to em to plant more corn so they can make more whiskey as moneygrubbing as jews too but not a single gentleman a single educated and civilised man in a thousand to boast of barbarians sir ignorant peasants does he really hate em that bad lewrie wondered or is he just drunk and ravin and how inthebarrel was he before i got here i spose well see sir edward lewrie said noncommittally this gordon fellow expected their warships rather soon in hurricane season sir edward responded leaning far back in his chair to the point that it almost tipped off its front legs agape with a mix of horror and amazement on his nowglowing phyz their secretary of the navy that mister stoddert is of the opinion that really bad storms occur more rarely than people think i believe gordon said perhaps no more than once a year sometimes once in five years sir american merchantmen in the caribbean keep records of weather and their studies of those records told you they were purblind fools the staffcaptain said with an angry bark well let me tell you captain lewrie the royal navy has records too and vaster experience in the west indies than anyone else hundreds of years in these waters and even we depart the indies by june and dont come back til late september why sir hydes flagship queen is in the careenage this very moment sir to ready her for her voyage to halifax and here i thought it was cause the seaweed on her bottom had taken root in the harbour mud lewrie thought hiding his smirk hed heard that sir hyde parker was making a vast fortune in prize money in the west indies the richest plum assignment that admiralty could bestow and that he was doing it the classic way trusting to others in frigates and sloops of war to junior officers in hired brigs cutters and tenders to reap the spoils whilst the big ships languished at anchor waiting for a french fleet that might never come so tight was the british blockade of the french ports why the other third bates are in outfitting too sir edward further informed him he topped up his own glass but made no offer to do the same for lewries this time by no later than midjune this harbour will be nearly empty then it will be up to the lesser ships on the station to exert themselves in our stead tenders to the third bates tenders to the flagship pets and toadies lewrie sneerfully told himself captains favourites who can fatten their seadaddys purse and their own while better men twiddle their thumbs and never see tuppence hired brigs captured schooners and a few frigates just to keep the french on the qui vive what is your draught sir umh lewrie said coming back to the moment seventeen and a half feet aft sir excellent though youll want to purchase or capture a tender or tow some additional singlemasted boats for close inshore work sir edward suggested base out of kingston here so the voyage over to saint domingue will be short when you run low on stores you may even contemplate landing some stores sailing lighter to reduce draught to seventeen feet or slightly less i see sir most helpful advice lewrie replied realising he was probably the lowestranking postcaptain onstation and would be staying after the valuable ships departed for hurricane season dull blockade work off some frenchheld port on saint domingue offandon plodding back and forth and nothing worth chasing but for islandbuilt luggers and singlemasted sloops and reefs and shoals aplenty so proteus is to patrol close to saint domingue is she sir he simply had to ask in way of sly prompting for a wider liberty for action and prize money or shall she have leave to patrol more uhm aggressively blockade work captain lewrie sir edward told him sounding almost glad to grind it in as if he had formed a low opinion of him in a twinkling get your sea legs in the west indies after all that derringdo of yours in european waters the staffcaptain sneered with a dismissive gesture towards lewries medals unfortunately the hand that he employed was the one that held his wineglass and he spilled a goodly dollop of it on his own breeches the winetable and his carpet which was a very finemostly pale turkey goddammit oh what a pity sirbout the rug lewrie said making a charitable grimace instead of the angry scowl he felt like showing best pair dammit sir edward seethed trying to swipe at his drenched thigh setting that dangerous glass down at least but he flung droplets from his hand with an idle shake that spattered lewrie in turn oh bugger actually sir edward i did a few years in the west indies in the revolution started out here in so i wonder if the best use of proteus is lewrie slyly attempted to wheedle damned puppy sir edward screeched of a sudden glaring back at him dont like your orders do you presume to talk me out of em will you in debt are you that eager for prize money never sir lewrie declared with his best righteous face on proteus is fast and nimble and does draw seventeen feet sir i was merely wishing to point out that a shoaldraught brig or large schooner would better serve closein whilst a frigate might stand farther offshore to better interdict ships attempting to smuggle arms into saint domingue and be better placed to intercept the odd french warship as you say in a few weeks our strength in the indies will be reduced til the end of hurricane season and fewer ships will have to cover a vast area so it struck me that the most uhm efficient use of all our vessels is necessary so teach your granny to suck eggs would you sir captain sir edward charles fumed back still mopping himself with a pocket handkerchief know better than your superiors do you absolutely not sir why specific orders will be draughted and aboard your ship by the end of tomorrows forenoon captain lewrie good day sir very good sir lewrie answered quickly quaffing the last of his claret and getting to his feet his face now an inscrutable public mask uhm there is still my courtesy call upon the admiral do you think he enquired in an innocent tone trying to salvage his odour thinking that should he make a favourable impression upon sir hyde parker what harm hed done himself with this quarrelsome drunk could be cancelled out and those orders changed our admiral is a most busy man captain lewrie sir edward intoned engaged with weighty matters anent the war and his additional duties as prime representative of the crown in this part of the world most busy some other time perhaps he concluded not without a malicious simper to his voice and a toplofty twitch to his lips he did at least rise to his own feet to steer lewrie out though more than a trifle unsteadily thank you for receiving me sir lewrie was forced by manners to say just before the double doors closed in his face and the muffled cry for a manservant to come swab up the mess reached his earsears that were burning with rage damme but i mucked it he chid himself as he stomped down the corridor all but leaving gouged hoofprints in the gleaming tropical mahoghany boards never argue with a drunk one who holds powers over you especially if my lucks not out mayhap hell be halfseasover by teatime and so foxed hell forget i was ever here arrogant old bastard he muttered under his breath must keep his manservants up all night washin the wine and the vomit from out his wardrobe not sayin hes so ignorant he doesnt know how to pee but ill wager theres moren a time or two his breeches are yellow and his shoebuckles re rusty god he spat aloud cautiously and it wasnt as if sir edward charles was likely to stand tall in repute either he groused to himself he was a staffcaptain not the flagcaptain of the fleet a drunken stumbler a pistolshot shy of being yellow squadroned a jumpedup senior clerk left ashore by his superiors to shuffle papers for the real fighting captains he found a black servant tending to a laving bowl and a stack of towels just by the wide double doors that led out to the courtyard and coachway a luxury for officers and civilian visitors who wished to swab off perspiration and cool themselves before reporting to superiors badly in need of a coolingoff lewrie set aside his hat and plunged his hands into the water sluicing his face and neck several times wishing that he could bury his head in the bowl until he blew bubbles or just upturn it over himself til his choler subsided thankee he said to the wellliveried slave as he offered him a towel needed that hot in there aye sah the slave replied not quite rolling his eyes with long experience of officers who needed his ministrations after their interviews damme i know isaw a man in admirals togs standin on a balcony as we sailed in was that parker lewrie recalled fort charles had partially blocked his view along with all of the gunsmoke but giddy house had been in clear sight for a little bit it had been too far off to count buttonholes or cuff rings but he had seen what looked to be a coloured sash and a star of knighthood uhm is admiral parker ashore today lewrie asked the slave aye sah the servant said with a sly smirk but hes werry busy sah he told him in a distinctive jamaican patois and here i must still pay my courtesy call lewrie responded retrieving his hat and his hopes something about the servants expression gave him a salacious clue and hed be busy doing the slave pointed a finger skyward to the upper floor above his shore office lewrie enquired his chambers sah the servant replied with a wee grin napping then lewrie further pressed oh nossah the slave answered with a wider grin and highpitched titter with company is he lewrie puzzled out well thats good reason tbe busy i spose all the livelong day i take it mos de night too sah he was further informed been ovah tsaint nicholas mole board ship so long de admerl he got а fine eye fo de ladies capum sah lewrie heaved a sigh of defeat the staffcaptains impression of him would get to sir hyde first and he and proteus would be slighted attempting to gain admittance midjollifications would make his odour even worse he clapped his hat on his head and strode out into the late morning glare pausing in the shade of giddy house to steel himself for the full brunt of the sun and merry and light as local birds he could hear the tinkle of a harpsichord and the soft chuckle of at least two people on the balcony above least someones havin a good mornin he growled chapter twelve remind em again about the maroons lewrie told his officers ail to be back aboard by midnight with so many ships in port its impossible not thear the watchbells chime it plain drunks and halfdead get slung below fightin drunksll get the cat and stoppage of rum and tobacco for a month remind em not ttake too much money ashore too that should do it pray god aye sir the officers senior mates and midshipmen chorused as they doffed their hats in dismissal it was a hellish risk he was running lewrie knew that more men took leg bail from ships companies that were fairly new together whereas ships longer in commission and shaken down together had fewer hands who would end up marked as run after a time the ship became home ones closest mates and supporters almost like family a stake in future payouts of prize money could provide a leash as well and hms proteus still awaited the reward for the orangespruit frigate maybe his luck was in he uncrossed his fingers lewrie had seen unhappy and happy ships both and felt that proteus had shaken down rather well even after the nore mutiny and camperdown the music the dancing in the dog watches showed him high spirits he had a somewhat honest purser so the rations were not rotten junk and were issued to fair measurements he had decimated the gunroom and midshipmens mess of bullies and tyrants by refusing to take back aboard those budding despots and brutes the crew had wished off during the mass mutiny of the year before there were very few requests for a change of mess these days a constant reshuffling of who could not stand the others in an eightman diningsleeping group was a sure sign of unrest and trouble and lastly he had called everyone aft and had spoken to them of trust and honour of shipmates future pay and the prize money of how marines and the army garrison and local militia kept up a full patrol that jamaica was an island after all that did anyone run inland there were venomous snakes released long before by plantation owners to frighten their slaves into staying put that runaways in the hills and back country the slave maroons were just waiting to butcher lone whites well hed stretched the truth on that one the maroons were mostly high up in the blue mountains fortified in the inaccessible places not on the very edge of kingston town but thank god for the naive gullibility of your average tartheyd eaten it up like plum duff and had goggled in horror but most of all lads i trust you i trusted you when we almost lost the ship and her honour at the nore he had told them and meant every word of it and you proved yourselves worthy and i will trust you with shore liberty knowing that you will return to duty with thick heads and a bruise or two mostlike does anyone run the rest of the crew will lose their chance cause youll have proved me mistaken in my trust dont let your shipmates down dont toss away what youve earned dont let proteus down prove me right in trusting you thats all dismiss larboard watch to go ashore in an english port he would never have risked it once ashore and with access to civilian long clothing a fair number would have scampered no matter how happy the ship but here and when one got right down to it lewrie thought that his men had earned something better than putting the ship out of discipline and hoisting the easy pendant to summon the bumboatmen and whores aboard he would be going ashore after all as would his midshipmen and officers and it didnt feel fair that the men who might still have to die with him for him and their ship would be denied what he could enjoy as a captain as a gentleman damme im become an imbecile in my dotage he chid himself one more time bad as a frog republican a popularity dick he found that hed crossed his fingers all over again the seat of government on jamaica was thirteen miles west over a rough road at spanish town kingston was the principal commercial harbour and naval base so even without the presence of the great or neargreat who decided things it was a lively place lewrie landed just by the grapes the cheery redbrick georgian inn and public house hard by the foot of the landing stage an inviting establishment mostly frequented by ship captains naval officers and chandlers along with an admixture of importers and exporters looking for a ship to haul their goods he strolled over to the chandleries and shops at first with an eye for novelty of being on solid ground and presented with the many rich goods displayed nigh as varied and of as good a quality as could be found in england there were his winecabinet and lazarette stores to be replenished more paper ink and quills to be purchased a book or two to readgreat whacking thick ones to be rationed out at a chapter per day he was low on mustard coffee and tea and eager for localmade preserves the mango chutneys the exotic dryrub spices he remembered from his early days that could enliven grilled shoe leather and like hindoo curry make even rotten saltbeef or saltpork worth eating more dried meatjerkyfor toulon and a fresh keg of lowtide beach sand for his box in the quartergallery and on the spur of the moment cotton canvas uniforms he sought out a tailors that he remembered got measured and ordered a brace of dark blue undress breeches another pair in white and coats for undress atsea days bleed all over your shirts and waistcoats sir the first time in a squall the tailor cluckclucked just as he had back when lewrie had needed a new midshipmans uniform in well wash the cloth a time or two first then run em up no shrinkage then either right lewrie countered cost extra it would sir the old fellow contemplated hang the cost better a shilling or two than suffocate in a wool coat with summer coming be ready in two days sir and do we sail before then im assured my ship will be back in harbour quite often you could hold them for me if i put half the sum down now quite acceptable sir unlike some dye see why here i recall you captain lewrie long before oh years and years but i do not owe you from then do i sir lewrie teased not as i recall sir and ive a long memry for debtors in this line such is ruin or salvation dont ye know the tiny bell over the front door tinkled and an army officer entered mopping his face with a handkerchief and fanning his hat ah colonel alls ready for you as promised the tailor chirped a largeish order or another who paid his reckoning on the nail lewrie gathered well stab me the officer said with a goggle damn my eyes lewrie rejoined quite happily cashman young lewrie made post hells bell s whod have dreamt youd rise so high they advanced on each other and clasped hands with warmth all but pounding each other on the back and shoulders and you a colonel lewrie marvelled well lieutenantcolonel christopher cashman allowed with a becoming modesty in one lewrie remembered as so brash but with your own regiment i take it aye the fifteenth west indies just raised last year a onebattalion wartimeonly regiment but all mine local volunteers and funded by rich planters we do have a colonel of the regiment but for the most part hes too busy making money the odd messnight boredom when he shows up to bask dye see so you may run things as you see fit at long last alan said mostly and thank god for it cashman said with a merry laugh you must tell me all about it well dine you in and you can see em cashman vowed and youve a ship i spose what is she hms proteus a fifth rate thirtytwo gunner damn near new and been busy i see cashman said eyeing lewries medals tell you all about it over dinner is baltasars still open the old frogs fancy restaurant cashman asked he died of yellow jack ages ago a free black feller dared buy it and kept the name frankly the foods much better and his prices aint so high lets make it my treat then lewrie offered feelin a tad peckish have time for it yes and yes let me collect my new articles and were off baltasars was much as lewrie recalled it there was a curtainwall with a wrought iron gate in front with a small brass plaque the only sign that it was a commercial establishment and not a residence within there was a cool and shaded courtyard with a small fountain that plashed and gurgled beneath a pergola between trellises hanging heavy with fragrant tropical flowering vines a second curtainwall split the entry into two clean white gravel or oyster shell paths by jardiniers filled with even more flowers inside was a cool open room with plaster walls and heavy wood beams wainscotted to chairheight with gleaming local mahoghany and the tables covered with clean white cloths at the rear there was a slightly raised dining area facing a back wall pierced by large windows and glazed double doors that led out to a back garden overlooking the harbour where even more wrought iron tables sat under sailcloth awnings for shade to dine alfresco the decor was much simpler than what lewrie remembered more caribbean than imitation versailles or tuilleries palace ornate most tables were taken and the intriguing aromas coming from the separate cooking shed told him why a fetching creole or mulatto wench came to take their orders a young woman with whom cashman joshed as though he was a more than regular diner or an afterhours lover like lewries coxn andrews she was lightskinned and her features were finer and handsomer than brutish a mere touch o the tarbrush cashman explained once she had headed for the kitchen shed and had spoken to the barman fair handsome lewrie amiably agreed a particular friend almost pass for white a fair number of em cashman told him ignoring the query but what may one expect with so many sailors and soldiers runnin off and takin up with the first decentlookin wench they see planters and overseers married or no who cant resist the cuffie housemaids charms some free girls who turn to whorin and out pops a mulatto git and their dialect did ya hear it damn near an irish brogue or a cockney twang that takes ya back to bow bells with a creole lilt jamaica could be a fine country same as india or canton in china anywhere europeans go alan said as their wine arrived taking cashmans evasion as confirmation same as saint domingue cashman pointed out with a frown if you think jamaica s a hodgepodge waitll you get ashore over there wasnt plannin on it christopher lewrie scoffed after tasting the hock from all ive heard a mile or two safe offshorell do me fine do they ice this by god marvelous massachusetts ice packed in straw and wood chips down in the storm cellars cashman informed him beaming americans can even turn shite tmoney struth whole shiploads of dried manure to dung thin island soils saint domingue though you know the french put the leg over a monkey did someone shave the face first saint domingues a bloody potmess when it comes trace dozens of terms for how black or white a person is mulatto quadron octoroon griffe dependin on whether the father or mother was black or white and what shade if the mother was slave or free houseservant or field hand how rich or important the sire most confusin bloody war ever ya did see and i doubt if the blacks over there can sort it out theyre comin to call it the war of the skin everybodys terrified of the real dark blacks the halfcastes with nothing side with this fella louverture the halfcastes with anything tlose side with rigaud or the whites the petits blancs side with the grande blancs lewrie added someone fill you in then written advisories lewrie told him scowling but you must know how little thosere worth and how out of date by now were going there soon cashman said general maitland has been run prettymuch ragged whenever he sends battalions out into the countryside lucky he hasnt been butchered and hung up by his heels suffered total massacres so far like the frogs poor bastards so what is this the last supper lewrie asked eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we shall die been there before call it a preventive dose of civilisation so i dont go mad quite as quickly cashman snickered how did you get your own regiment lewrie enquired last we saw of each other back in you were a brevetcaptain in a fusilier regiment ah well long story christopher said winking well take a long dinner lewrie assured him well once the revolution ended what was left of us were sent back to england recall i told you how much i despise cold climates damnall raw and rainy and damnall dreary too peacetime soldiering i had picked up a little loot here and there lots of officers in the regiment were selling up their commissions but i still couldnt afford tbe more than a lieutenant with a fifteenyearold over me as captain damn his eyes cost of a commission always goes up in peacetime in regiments that wont get sent overseas for a long spell but i found a daddy needed a place for his slackjawed young imbecile so i sold up and resigned then turned round and bought a captaincy in a kutchpultan kutchpultana poor undistinguished regiment with the bad luck tbe ordered to india couldve bought it for the price of coach fare with so many young fools worried about their thin pale skins of a sudden and id been there before as ye knew and it hadnt killed me yet so cashman sketched a neckornothing career of heat and flies of bad water and food nighpoisonous native guzzle surely poisonous serpents spiders and scorpions for bed companions the sun murderous to a bloody war or a sickly season lewrie proposed raising his glass with one of the royal navys toasts ah india the land of loot and lust i take it you were fortunate in both hmm brevetmajor in six months as officers keeled over like ninepins some kerfuffles with a native prince or two and id amassed me enough tbuy a permanent majority cashman boasted and laid enough aside tcome home a chickennabob and then i had me a think never in this life would i make lieutenantcolonel not even in a shoddy battalion such as mine home depot in england picks those who suit the colonel of the regiment or horse guards when theres no war and theyve no need of my harumscarum sort things got quiet after a few years so i sold up and took passage here not quite as hot a tad less dangerous and a tad less unhealthy got into sugar cane cotton and such in a small way ran up a rather nice house ran about twenty slaves my own canemill press and pans down southwest of spanish town on portland bight milled for neighbours who didnt get the wind to run their own mills proper done mainwell raisin horses and cattle as well takes less labour and fewer slaves oh i played ships husband for a while backin cargoes on the triangle trade but after a time or two i got out of that a drib here a drab there and it all added up somehow but your regiment lewrie pressed as their soup arrived a hot and spicy pepperpot sounds as if you had a fine retirement or second career but then you boredom lewrie christopher told him with an outburst of toobright laughter i was bored silly like most things one claws and schemes tget lifes treasures but once in hand they lose lustre and you find it was the chase that was the real fun i think i see your point lewrie replied thinking of his own tenant farm in anglesgreen the mark of a landed gentleman that should have been satisfaction enough and the mark of success and theres the slaves cashman admitted turning sombre recall do ya we once had a schemin session on a riverbank in spanish florida when we got sent up the apalachicola tdeal with the muskogee indians how itd be a great land for crops like cotton did i fetch in some bengalis stead o the indians grow it pick it and card it wash it bale it and ship or spin it and loom it on the spot usin the river for power even build a manufactory and sell made clothin all over this partof the world aye i do recall how close did you come lewrie smiled you pay a hindoo ryot for his work lewrie cashman confessed in a much lower voice one that would not carry to his contemporaries and fellow planters you hire him aye he slacks off and acts lazy and ya thrash him and hell take it and shrug it off then get back to work proper but the cuffies alan the samboes with them all we have is the lash die off in droves from snake bites diseases worked tdeath or starved halfway therehave tbuy more of em and start all over again weve thirtythousand whites on jamaica but therere over three hundred thousand slaves and barely ten thousand free black people and there might be a total turnover every generation do you see and ya cant do anything tease the misery cosset your slaves and your neighboursll think youre weak a merry andrew go too harsh like most of em do and you get rebellion and start fearin what yer house slaves serve ya do they slip poison in your food and drink thats no way tlive lewrie believe me i thought i knew what i was gettin into when i bought land and slaves twork it knew my way round natives dye see bengalis mahrattas muskogee or cherokee hell irish he added with a grin and a shrug but it didnt work that way lewrie said for him though yet mystified it was a given that slaves and acreage were the marks of colonial gentlemen of success and prosperity yet cashman sounded as if hed turned his back on everything except honourable soldiering mayve been the worst mistake i ever made lewrie to settle out here cashman confessed in a mutter i considered america but even with overmountain land goin for ten pence an acre it requires slaves twork it too less you settle far north among those stiffnecked hymnsingin yankees with all their shalt nots and its a cold damn place to boot oh i plunged in with a will at first and thought things were goin hellish fine doin what everyone else about me did but first thing i did was get out of the triangle trade lewrie knew about that sugar and molasses coffee and cotton dyewoods and indigo to american ports sell cargoes and invest some of the profit into rum tobacco hemp ropes tar pitch and turpentine resin and naval stores ship that to england and make another profit which was partly invested in cheap trade goods trinkets and gewgaws castoff muskets and cutlasses bolts of gaudy cloth and such to sell or trade in west africa where the black chieftains and arab traders would fetch you thousands of their own people or those captured from other tribes then ship black ivory on the middle passage to a caribbean port to be auctioned off three legs of trade three profits in one and five hundred pounds could end up fetching four thousand saw the wretches landed sold off at the vendue house cashman said so softly that lewrie had to lean over his soup to hear him i felt sick smelt the stink of a blackbirder have you once is enough for a lifetime fed me own slaves a touch better after that i did shoes and new slopclothing moren once a year let em have an hour or two more on their vegetable plots bought more salt meats and such felt i was doin right no matter what the neighbours thought salved my conscience a little but that was all i was doin what my overseers did in my name though whats the difference so you got more into livestock alan asked yes less cane where the real misery lies the killin work lewrie studied christopher cashmanthe kit of his early derringdoas he returned to spooning up his pepperpot soup before it got cold he looked much the same as the old cashman of his remembrance but for more crinkles round his eyes and mouth his hair now sprinkled with more salt than pepper he was still the lean fit and hungrylooking rogue from the s and had not battened as most men would once success and a semblance of riches got within their grasp his wardrobe had improved of a certainty lewrie could recall shabby uniforms so faded from red to pink that one could conjure that he had bought his regimentals off a ragpickers barrow now he was prosperous tailored as natty as anything well shod in popular hessian boots his sword of good quality and gleaming his tunic heavy with real gilt lace and embroidery his breeches waistcoat and shirt snowywhite and well cared for his hair dressed neatly but lewrie wondered where was that fly sardonic rogue from those days the one with the wry sarcastic or flippant comment in the face of danger or disaster you know about the second maroon war i take it cashman asked of a sudden as if all that had passed between them moments before had never occurred yes started in didnt it prompted by the slave revolt in saint domingue cashman said got beaten back but broke out again in i retook colours then as a major once more nothing near so big or widespread as our frogs suffer but bad enough twas a great slaughter een so eye for an eye tooth for a tooth and not a jot o mercy ambush for ambush massacre for massacre shut em down by but theres still many skulkin about then along comes general maitland who asks me to be on his staff at portauprince spent a year at that then the people here suggested raisin another local regiment maitland put in a word for me and i had the support of my neighbours who put up the money but kit whyever agree tfight rebellious french slaves if you didnt care for fightin your own lewrie puzzled aloud in any society alan my old cashman said leaning closer to mutter even softer with a sardonic gleam in his eyes youre either on the side of the angels or youre a pariah dog you have to sing along with the choir nod and say amen in the right places my good name was on the line and i didnt say i dont like fightin slaves theyd slaughter white folk like so many hogs in november given the chance they despise us dye see they despise me act harsh and they despise you be soft and they take advantage treat em well gift em on the holidays and theyll fawn and slobber on yer boots to yer face all gratefullike then roll their eyes and snicker behind yer back and despise you for your weakness id much rather kill em than own em any day lewries jaw dropped open in surprise is he daft he queried himself no he looks and sounds as sane as as me servile obsequious cringers liars and frauds all of em cashman rather calmly went on between sips of his soup and a dabbing at his mouth with a fine linen napkin ive an overseer runnin things for me for now once this war on saint domingues done ill sell up lock stock and barrel and get free of this pestilential place sham a lingerin fever invent a troublin wound grief any excuse to placate my neighbours and peers ill have done my bit by then and therell be no shame in it something that took too much outta me and dye know what ill do then lewrie shook his head in the negative ill sell off my slaves with the greatest of glee he said with a nasty smirk to the harshest masters i know and i know most of em believe you me those few i think were straight with me ill manumit and give em a small sum for a fresh start but the rest ill see em all in a livin hell then im shot o this place and off to the east indies again where a man with chink can live like a rajah and stuff evry wench in the bibikhana evry night do i get the itch and never have tbuy folk ever again surely you knew goin in lewrie countered you were out here for years and saw how a slave society ah but it looks so devlish easy goin in alan cashman scoffed sit on your balcony and watch the money grow play cards and dance in the parlour with everything at yer beck and call with nary a thought for how its fetched damned beguilin life from the outside lookin in when its other peoples slaves doin the bowin and scrapin to ya once in though its a hell on all sides at that moment the pretty young mulatto serving wench arrived with a tray heaped with platters split crab claws and legs lobsters split and steaming with freshcaught pompano grilled in keylime rob and crisp with breading removes of fresh chickpeas and diced scallions plump boiled carrots topped with brown sugar and a basket piled high with piping hot yeast rolls made with imported fine wheat flour ah paradise lewrie extolled after his first taste of every dish rolling his eyes in ecstacy and damn all navy rations another thing alan cashman said after a bite of fried fish and a sip of their chilled hock with a blissful smile on his own face when the time comes tsell a heros lands go higher than a poltroon who didnt serve or those of a secret abolitionist ever hear of william wilburforce or hannah more aye damn em lewrie sourly replied william wilburforce was in parliament hannah more was one of those society women with more energy than wit both were determined to reform english society in their own mould to tame it gentle it and improve it and they were church of england not dissenters church of england but they talk more like the wesley brothers and all their leapin methodists lewrie went on after a cleansing slosh of wine spendin all their time and half their money along with lots of other fools bout sunday schools so please you so our children dont grow up wild or pick up republican ideas and rebel like the fleet did somethin tbe said for that at least cashman commented ending bearbaiting dogfights cockfightin all sorts of country customs hell itll be fox huntin next bad as cromwell and his roundhead puritans out ttake all joy from life marketin fairs gamblin even morris dancin the heart and soul of us ill send them a contribution to their abolitionist society cashman secretly whispered and damn the neighbours now do you imagine the reception wilburforce and more would get did they ever dare come out here to preach well theyd be strung up and hung and pray god for it lewrie quickly vowed samed happen tme alan or get pence to the pound when i sell up cashman assured him did they know my true feelings on the matter im not gettin any younger and all i have is tied up in my lands and such id never have the time tpile up the blunt all over again from scratch i was lookin for an out and by god here came a chance to take colours once more and get away from the problem and so welltimed it felt dropped from heaven lewrie asked with a chuckle as he split and buttered one of those luscious rolls i see turne quod optanti divum promittere nemo auderet volvenda dies en attulit ultro ey wot why you pretentious hound sir cashman erupted in an outburst of hearty laughter much his old self once more thats about all the latin that ever got lashed into you isnt it ill lay it is sir i hold commission in the kings navy lewrie replied in a false haughtiness his nose lifted toplofty i am a postcaptain therefore eminently superior to any redcoat now how else may i make you assume the proper humility was i not pretentious one with crumbs on his shirt front cashman drolly rejoined aye by god what the gods couldnt promise rollin time brought unasked an apt quote ill grant ye never saw that side of you up the apalachicola which reminds me how is your muskogee wife soft rabbit was her name and that bastard son she whelped ah uhm was lewries witty response i take it youre married by now bein a captain and all cashman went on casually enquiring and married well i trust aye with three gits now capital but i wager you havent said word one to her about your first wife now have you cashman most evilly grinned i like breathin lewrie retorted a tad sharpish wondering if word of his troubles had gotten to the islands ahead of him somehow and what about you did you ever wed kit he countered the once cashman admitted quickly losing his jaunty japing air out here in no children sorry tsay before she passed over back in just about the time the maroon war began another reason to quit his lands lewrie wondered in sympathy another reason to take a commission im sorry to hear that kit i oh dont be cashman brushed off swirling his wine aloft as if squinting at it for lees prettier than the morning she was aye but meaner than a snake raised out here dye see used to managing slaves from her cradle and her kinfolk some of the harshest she ran through three or four riding quirts a year slashin and layin about at any servant who crossed her bought em by the half dozen she did fascinatin girl but a beast at heart horse threw her one morning broke her neck snap dear god but lewrie gawped appalled towards the end i couldnt abide the sight or sound of her cashman admitted with a rueful moue and shrug happened whilst i was off in the blue mountains start of the maroon war took colours just tbe shot o her too mean as she was i always suspected one of our stable boys made her horse shy perhaps some of the field hands left her tdie snapped her neck themselves so it looked accidental who knows did me a great favour if they did you get used to lordin it over slaves you simply have to turn mean and callous her i mean to say perhaps me as well but be shrugged off once more smiling disarmingly i heard such once before i think lewrie said after wiping his mouth with the napkin following a dollop of lobster and drawn butter out here come tthink on it oh ages ago when i was freshcommisioned here in kingston lady of my acquaintance sister of a girl i was wooing god they were hellish rich anne beauman do you know of her her youngest sister lucy was the one i was after anne said that a slave society gets callous and hard on everyone once you get used to wallopin the blacks so why not wallop every what the beaumans alan cashman told him in answer to the gawpy look on lewries face once hed seen the smirk on christophers who hold great swaths of land on portland bight do they theyre your neighbours of course you do know em hugh beauman and his wife anne are my patrons in the regiment cashman delighted in informing him made up his mind i was the man for him and hes used to gettin his way aye just as they were back in lewrie recalled so how is anne at the time she was the most exoticlookin woman ah well faded sorry tsay island women mostly do the climate and the sun i expect shrivel up and go sour and grey much too soon do they not perish o childbed fever malaria or the yellow jack there was another sister floss i think died cashman coolly told him ah pity poor old thing lewrie said but lucy now mmmmmm cashman agreed most heartily my first real love on my part at least lewrie confessed ran into her in venice two years ago shed remarried a sir malcolm shockley baronet richer than god why richer than the beaumans she was still here when i bought my lands in her first marriage cashman reminisced aye one of the great beauties of her time unfortunately dumber than dirt too lewrie pointed out my dear alan christopher cashman leered back at him i never asked her to recite you never lewrie chortled catching the sly meaning always did have the most philistine of tastes she did lewrie assured himself trying to picture lucy taking up with cashman ah but i did cashman slyly boasted along with half the young swains in jamaica i suspect you uhm no actually lewrie had to admit but not for want of trying mind she was only seventeen back then and chaperoned as close as a spanish convent girl watched like a hawk aye christopher said with a knowing nod twas after she wed that she took up her own household with a young husband on the land and her here in town got a ragin hunger for it and then no man was safe and too rich to be scandalised dont you know small world aint it bad as old mistress betty hillwood my uhm replacement lewrie said with a sly boast of his own for when i couldnt get the leg over lucy used to keep rooms uphill the fountained court oh my yes cashman said with another knowing purr it is a damn small world been there too alan she died though in and a hardun lewrie said sighing and returned to a crab claw with his name on it want to guess who the colonel of the regiment is then hugh beauman lewrie supposed aloud lord no much too rich and involved tbe playing soldier hold on there was another brother lewrie said frowning as he tried to recall a name to place on a braying horses ass ledyard beauman thats the one cashman said with distaste lord that fool that hoorawin jackanapes lewrie cried in utter surprise when i met him he was still limpwristed macaroni fashion years after the styled passed bout as sharpwitted as his sister lucy god help us couldnt pour pee from his boot without a footmans help hes lost ground since cashman sombrely assured him ledyard beauman by god and hes your colonel is he actually capable of anything hes been studying dye see tactics and such cashman grimly said out of books so please you marchin wee lead troops cross his dinin table rattlin on about cannae hadrianopolis and double envelopments caesar in gaul scipio africanus and hannibal turnin into a perfect pest well id allow he might look crackin fine on a charger at a parade lewrie snickered some more just so long as he knows his limitations and his place well thats the rub alan cashman said sighing a tad more and wriggling uneasily in his chair as if ants were inside his breeches he unconsciously crossed his legs as if to protect his nutmegs from harm lately hes of a minda fervid mindtgo over tsaint domingue with us when we sail bring us his insights or so he says how best to employ and manouevre troops and such god help your poor arse you must be joking lewrie gawped but he wasnt of course chapter thirteen eager to show off his command christopher cashman insisted that lewrie accompany him a mile or two towards spanish town to the encampment and would not take no for an answer after a quick row out to proteus to see if orders had come aboard or if members of the liberty party had created some havocthe orders had not and only a few of the hands had been returned paralyticdrunk by the shore provostslewrie felt sanguine enough to go along kit laid on a fine equipage a silktopped coachandfour of gleaming wood and fragrant leather bright coralred wheel spokes that raised the faintest cloud of dust from the sandy track and drawn by a team of matched roans of fairly impressive conformation horses raised on cashmans lands he was smugly informed there was a florid letter b on the doors though encircled by oak wreaths well o course alan old son cashman crowed this is a beauman coach nothin but the best for their hired colonel the th west indies regiment was under canvas their company tents pitched in neat streets with duckboards between in case of rain and mud laid out to mathematical perfection as laid down in the infantry manuals across a wide parade ground still stobby with sugar cane stubble for a cane field it had been til lately stood a giant greenandwhite striped pavillion tent large enough to shelter them all if stood shouldertoshoulder assuming anyone would allow any of the rankers inside that is it had been erected for a special occasion and was now filled with preening officers from the island garrison with uniformed visitors from both army and navy and with civilians in their finest come to watch a parade the ground above the pavillion teemed with carriages just as sumptuous as the one in which lewrie and cashman arrived with nodding teams of horses being tended by slave grooms and a long roped row of saddled riding horses in the shade of the trees think of graduation day alan cashman said as a black coachman came to fold down the metal steps and open the door for them and all the beamin parents come tsee their sprogs pass out into life and you took yourself into town stead of sittin on em like a broody hen lewrie wondered as he alit good god i can see three generals from where i stand a hellish risk kit i know they can drill alan cashman confidently boasted so whats the point of actin like i dont trust em have to sooner or later wont i let the officers find their feet too thout mother standin over em and makin em so nervous they wouldnt trust their own arses with their farts thats the problem with your typical army regiments either too rich and casual hopin to muddle through or theyre lashed drilled and browbeat so bad no one from majors down to corporals dare have a thought in their heads til a colonel puts it there same aboard yer ships i expect the way a captain can ruin a good ship and make her officers spend all their time lookin over a shoulder too scared tput a foot wrong well there is that lewrie allowed not much to work with ill tell ya true cashman said as they strolled the short distance to the pavillion and its wide welcoming flies and awnings the dregs of the island the scrapins from home regiments gone down from fevers rich boyofficers who had a mind tsoldier cause the uniform pleased the young ladies educated men who clerked or finished their apprenticeships but arent from rich or even squire familiesoh a dense lot in the beginnin but we set em straight sent em off on company marches and skirmish drill all by themselves for two three days with no one twipe their arses for em shed a few promoted a few hang their pedigrees and ya know id teach em tshoot alan by line by platoon by regimental volley and in teams of four two loadin and watchin whilst two deliver aimed fire out in the bushes nothin like your classic setpiece battle nossir all flags and gallopers and such like we were in spanish florida lewrie said with a smile of reverie twinging to what cashman had been driving at fighting red indian fashion like yankee doodle skulkers with rifles hunters cashman amended cept here we hunt men half the regimentll be in skirmish order all the time able to fall back upon the rest if they get in trouble cant parade battalionfront in three lines in a jungle saint domingue aint like europe all orderly and neat crops gone wild grown horseeye tall wild shrubs grown back up as thick as doghair aah general lazenby and your lovely lady lewrie got introduced then tipped cashman the wink and wandered off to fetch himself a glass of something leaving kit to play host to his guests it didnt take long a liveried slave in a white tiewig produced a silver tray bearing long flutes of champagneagain icedand lewrie took a brace of them it was a hot day for april dash it all he then wandered circulating and bowing or doffing his hat to the other guests as he encountered them as they encountered him really his was a new face in a rather insular society he suspected and forgave himself for the pun much like anglesgreen of a sunday with nought but the usual neighbours to see til the london season ended and absentee landowners came down to their properties fetching along a raft of houseguests for a week or two in the country or the coach that brought the mails also brought in a clutch of passengers every day folk would gather before the olde ploughman or the red swan inn just for a sight of them even were they merely alighting for a shot at the jakes a quick halfpint of ale with a cold beef pie before whip up and away and certainly he smugly grinned to himself the sight of two gold medals dangling on his chest didnt hurt when it came to a lure for the curious either as men shook his hand with almost an admiring briskness and the ladies curtsied or inclined their heads with fans rustling faster in what he took for approval he was pumped dry for information about the doings at home in england the latest titillating scandals at court the prices of goods the progress of the war he also got a chance to enquire about people he had met in jamaica in his early days mistress margaret haymer and her husband name escapes me dead oh years ago alas the hillwoods both passed over unfortunatly feller who invited my commanding officer and several of us from the midshipmens mess to a supper and ball once sir richard slade joined the great majority in was the shiftyeyed reply and good riddance frankly a backgammoner sir dye get my thought there was somethin a tad off about him myself lewrie could say with a frown of pleasure a man o the windward passage ey hid it well he did but his house servants were a young bunch and all boys well well alan lewrie is it you sir maam he replied turning in the direction of the query i say mistress beauman a great pleasure after all these after all this time years ye gods he chid himself dont remind her of her years cashman had the right of it anne beauman had aged badly only her lively brown eyes reminded him of the lass she used to be she had shriveled like one of those appleheaded dolls the rebels made that he had seen in charleston or wilmington stout as a saltbeef cask as well though still done up in the best apparel money could buyand beaumans could afford the bestshe more resembled a weary harridan who had not been blessed by life the sort of shopwoman one could see in london out on a sunday stroll since that was better than desponding up in an airless garret lodging congratulations sir she said as if recalling maidenly coos and styles lucy wrote us once she was safely back in england but she told us you were merely a commander at the time she and sir malcolm keep well i trust mistress anne oh indeed with you to thank for their lives i did nothing more than warn them to flee venice and get home before the french took the place maam nothing like lewrie said with his brow creased in confusion wondering what spindrift the minx had invented to improve her tale oh but was there not some adventure at some island along the dalmatian coast with pirates and anne frowned in turn we put in there for a bit once she and sir malcolm took passage with us but that was after wed ah there ye be a gruff voice interrupted most thankfully to alans lightshow did one disabuse someone of their kins veracity ah lewrie said feigning joy mister hugh beauman he offered his hand recalling that at one time this side of beef this breeding bulland his fatherhad threatened to thrash him in the streets of kingston and finally had shown him the door quite firmly assuring him hed never darken their lives again surprisingly hugh beauman took it and gave it a powerful shake of welcome with a viselike crunching squeeze thoughjust to remind him of his place lewrie ah de do beauman bellowed years wot all grown up i see stap me a postcaptain now last year sir after the battle of on yer own bottom have a frigate id expect yes good like all the beauman men lewrie sadly told himself they talk in fragments too busy for polite conversation probly begrudge the time wasted too the father beauman hed dealt with had been the same way when lewrie was courting lucy for all their wealth they were chawbacon with not a jot of ton or style tenanttramplin foxhuntin beerswillin countryputsthe very epitome of that newspaper artist cruikshanks droll cartoons of john bull as a testy drinkveined tub of ale with the temper of a rutting steer a poorly educated squire to the soles of his topboots howd ye get out here what fetched ye hugh beauman asked sounding a bit suspicious even after all these years lewrie was sorely tempted to answer by frigate then by coach but wisely forebore hugh beauman for all his business acumen didnt have what one could call an ear for waggish wit colonel cashman and i are old compatriots sir we met in town and dined together he invited me to see his regiment ah ah hugh beauman said as he took that in still looking like a man offered a dubious deal never heard that must ask i spose in spanish florida lewrie informed him with a secretive grin covert doins with red indians during the last war dye see neckornothin in places it was doubt a man of us got away with a whole skin once the dons found us he boasted to discomfit hugh beauman youve risen so quickly captain lewrie anne beauman quickly said to fill the gapsand no longer using his christian name lewrie noted as if to distance herself or haul their converse back to a politer plane and been decorated twice and is that a wedding ring that i see on your left hand you must tell us all about it ah her husband exclaimed as a trumpet sang out parades on later lewrie come dear til later sir maam lewrie said doffing his hat and bowing them away as they ploughed their way through the throng to the raised platform before the pavillion that would serve as the reviewing stand lewrie snagged himself another pair of champagnes in relief then drifted over to where he could see sure enough ledyard beauman made a splendid sight on a charger the horse was a sleek dapplegrey with the conformation of an arabian its saddlery and reins polished its showy sheepskin pad as white as new fallen mountain snow and the stiff underpad so large that it fell almost as low as the flashing silverplate stirrups blue trimmed in real gilt embroidery border real giltlace regimental badge roman numerals and oak leaves even silver bit and chains ledyard however look a uniform wearin a man some girl said in a very soft snicker behind her fan before being shushed by the man at her side it didnt do to sneer a beauman not and be heard ledyard rode well enough with his heels well down as he cantered his charger out and drew his sword to take the salute of officers standing in a rigid row before the troops now arrayed by companies on the far side of the field the pace did put his hata cocked one as large as a ripe watermelon all adrip with egret feathers and trimmed with giltlace cockade and vaneaskew though like leftover style from the s ledyard bought them too small to fit over his wigs a hand that held his sword hilt snuck up to right it as he drew reins to return the salute eliciting the faintest titter despite the setting always was a vain little coxcomb lewrie uncharitably thought after a bit of martial palaver ledyard spun his horse about on the offhand foot and walked it back to the front of the review stand a small band of fifes and drums struck up british grenadiers and at a command from cashman the first company on the right the grenadier company began to wheel about in lines four ranks deep shape mainwell a grudging commentator allowed for all the little that lewrie knew of drill and marching they did indeed seem to know what they were doing as good or better than the anglesgreen yeomanry that his father drilled on the village commons on muster days for a mob of the usual drunks failures neerdowells and nohopers that armies tended to recruit and given the smaller and scummier pool of volunteers to be found in the islands they marched in straight lines with no one staggering all in step and all their muskets sloped at the same exact angle they wore anklehigh shoes well blacked with tan cloth gaiters or spatterdashes buttoned up to midthigh over dark tan breeches not the usual white with matching waistcoats beneath the usual red tunics though lewrie thought their red was more winered than scarlet with buff turnbacks at the rear hems and buff coat facings trimmed with yellowoutlined buttonholes of red and blue and their hats were not cocked hats newfangled shakoes or narrowbrim civilian hats but were widebrimmed soft slouch hats turned up on one side he grinned in recognition hats like those had adorned the loyalist volunteer north carolina regiment in which his future brothersinlaw burgess and governour chiswick had served in the revolution he had discovered the practicality of slouch hats for keeping off both sun and rain at yorktown during the francoamerican siege lewrie also suspected that hats like those were much easier to sneak through brush and jungle making less noise did cashman really mean to hunt men on saint domingue in bushwhacking fashion matching stealthforstealth with the rebel slave soldiers under louverture and their arms a private soldier stood guard near the rope line by the reviewing stand and lewrie sidled over to study it and enquire in a whisper from the soldiers righthand side fusil sir fiftyfourcaliber ball the man muttered back from the corner of his mouth eyes still rigidly to the front theys accrate they is colonel cashman e hinsisted on em i would expect nothing less than the best from colonel cashman lewrie told him making the soldier stiffen his back a bit more in his pride and dare to grin despite the solemnities more accurate than brown bess aye lewrie thought iused one and i liked it more range than a plain musket too i still have one hangin on the wall in he cringed wondering how long it had taken caroline to remove any sign that the smaller side parlour had once been his and his alone the captured swords the ship model that his jesters had made for him the regimental pipes fife and drum band struck up a tune the black bear and swung out from the far right of the formed companies with the kings colour and the regimental colour party behind them to troop the colours before the men an ancient custom of recognition so that they would know their colonels place and their own in any battles confusion once the band returned to its place some orders of the day were posted by the adjutant before the call came to pass in review without the mass mutter of up yours too that sometimes could be heard from british troops on parade lewrie noted company by company the regiment marched past the reviewing stand with ledyard beauman swiping his sword to his chin in salute to each band the grenadier company then eight line companies lastly the official light company of skirmishers though cashman had trained them all for skirmish order finally a twogun battery of light horsedrawn artillery pieces no better than pounders trotted past and it was done the companies drew up at their starting points across that stubbly field to the cheers and applause of the assembled guests men ledyard cried rising in his stirrups men o the fifteenth west indies it came out rather thin and probably didnt carry far not like a quarterdeck bellow lewrie could sneer as he tipped his champagne glass to them creditable showin i say day or two more and were off to saint domingue bash those murderous rebels haw colonel cashman dismiss the troops sir and a tot of rum for all all dye hear hey talion cashman said in a proper baritone roar compny the captains chorused the preparatory order talion right wheel to column of companies at the halt ledyard beauman did not wait for his troops to wheel about and march off to their tent lines he tossed his reins assuming that some orderly or groom would be there to take them being the sort who went through life having things there when he needed them he took several tries at stabbing the tip of his expensive hundred guinea sword into its elegantly trimmed scabbard before getting it right then swung one leg over and sprang down not without a rub at his fundament from spending time in the saddle rather clawlike that was maybe his arse itches lewrie thought draining one of his champagne flutes making an experiment lewrie tossed the glass over his shoulder and was amazed to see a liveried servant catch it in midair hells bells it works he marvelled as if those murderous rebel slaves on saint domingue had already been crushed ledyard was swarmed by his rich neighbours hangerson toadies and those who mostlike owed him money or favours and lewrie had himself another covert sneer then toddled off for a reload of champagne now there was a long set of tables set up as a buffet inside that vast pavillion laden with dainties so far covered with a gauzy material or fanned to keep the flies off by slave women behind it all done up in wildly colourful sackgowns and head cloths marked by snowwhite bib aprons once the fawning was done and the regiments officers returned there would be a minor feed and despite his earlier meal lewrie found himself looking forward to grazing on fresh and spicy shore food he was deterred from an anticipatory stroll to see what was to be offered though surely you recall mister lewrie ledyard he heard anne gush as she led her brotherinlaw over just a boy of a lieutenant then captain lewrie you remember ledyard but of course i do mistress beauman lewrie answered having a gush of his own of false pleasure ledyard so good to see you my congratulations on your regiment and its performance good as the guards brigade in london he extended his hand forcing ledyard to take it though with an involuntary wince im certain that general maitland will be pleased to be reenforced by such a unit and that jumpedup poseur general louverture will have cause to run away and hide well yes haw haw ledyard brayed after giving it a rather longish think blinking in unlookedfor delight damn white o ye i must say lewrie damn white maul those murdrin scum go right through em like a dose o salts lose their cocky airs up against british infantry wot and pray god soon sir lewrie replied giving ledyard his due as his putative senior officer well then hum uhm ledyard hemmed having run out of polite conversation and with his eyes cutting towards the food and drinks anne beauman tossed lewrie her sympathy with a weary arching of her brows and lewrie responded in like sympathy for her having to tolerate such a boorish clan for so many years the best of fortune attend you and your troops then sir lewrie said preparing to free himself ill just look up old cashman then know him do ye ledyard asked engaged by lewries presence again and looking a touch more leery than pleased by that news oh for years sir here at his invitation in fact talented feller organised uhm ledyard beauman said musing aloud as if pacing behind an office desk weighing the benefits and disadvantages of a pending deal unorthodox o course but just what we need hey aggressive uhm a fighter wot he squinted at lewrie as if trying to convince himself of cashmans suitability to lead his regiment anew or reconvincing himself in the face of disquieting new evidence to the contrary the very best sir lewrie assured him mmmhmm ledyard answered as if tasting a tangy dessert take my leave then colonel beauman mistress anne he said bowing his way off and wondering why it was that every encounter with beaumans made him begin to chop his sentences to the bare bones in the same pidgin that they used lewrie snagged two more champagnes then sidled his way through the throng of guests entering the tent against the current til he stood outside beyond the ropeline waiting for christopher cashman as he rode up on a fine chestnut gelding trailed by his two mounted majors and the pack of company captains lieutenants and ensigns who were on foot but eager for the party to begin he walked out to meet cashman offering up the freshest glass sure that kit was going to need it well howd you enjoy the parade cashman beamed down at him as he drew rein and accepted his reward capital on your part at least they look splendid lewrie truthfully told him aye theyre a grand bunch cashman gruffly agreed showing pleasure over his good show and with a hint of rough love for his troops though theyre the usual scum whod go for a soldier gutter sweepins and harbour trash een poorer a lot than youd find in england mind hard men though tough enough to stick it no matter what comes met ledyard lewrie casually told him had a word or two aye and cashman asked one brow up kit old son i do blieve youre fucked book two quod genus hoc hominum quaeve hunc tarm barbara morem permittit patria hospitio prohibemur harenae bella cient primaque vetant consistere terra what race of men is this what land is so barbarous as to allow this custom we are debarred the welcome of the beach they stir up war and forbid us to set foot on the border of their land aeneid book i publius vergilius maro virgil chapter fourteen oh for gods sake quiet still the luckless lieutenant wyman shouted to the arriving boats bare minutes before eight bells nottingham ale boys nottingham ale no liquor on earth is like nottingham ale nottingham ale boys nottingham ale no liquor on earth is like nottingham ale that was the starboard watchs answer to his demands they had commandeered the poor bumboatmen who had rowed them offshore from town had made the oars beat like birds wings raising bow waves and leaving creamy wakes but once closeaboard proteus they had commenced rowing round her bound and determined to savour their last bottles of wine or beer and not end their precious shore liberty til the last watch bell had struck midnight you lovers who talk of your flames darts and daggers with nottingham ale ply your woman but hard for the girl that once tasted will hopelessly stagger and all your past sufferings and hardships reward you may bend her and twist her and do what you list her youve found the right way oer her heart to prevail sounds very much like that bastard irishman desmond midshipman adair commented aye hes a fine voice that fly lad lieutenant catterall said let her take a glass often theres nothing will soften the heart of a woman like nottingham ale ohhhh nottingham ale boys nottingham ale desmond lewrie barked leaning over the quarterdeck bulwarks in nothing more than breeches and a shirt hastily pulled over but not stuffed in you sing the last bloody verse and youll be late reportin back aboard me lad the lot of you now pipe down and fetchto alongside the larboard entryport youve five minutes by my watch muster the marines sir lt catterall asked lord no mister catterall lewrie demurred looking up from his pocket watch though from the look of em a cargo slingd suit i doubt theres a full dozen who can still keep their feet can you not keep order with your crew sir an aggrieved postcaptain aboard a twodecker moored nearby bellowed through a speakingtrumpet can you not i will youll stop all that caterwauling or ill send over my marines and deem it a mutiny tbe suppressed the larboard watch wakened from their innocent slumbers below had come up on deck to jeer and hoot from the gangways some with glee and some sounder sleepers with anger and threats lewrie could make out a spectral figure on the stern gallery of the gun third rate someone in a white nightshirt bearing a shiny brass speakingtrumpet that also caught the glinting moonlight damme the mans even wearin a tasselled nightcap lewrie muttered with a groan turning for his own speakingtrumpet no need sir theyll be aboard and quiet shortly he shouted across you doctors who more executions have done with powder and potion with bolus and pill than hangman with noose or soldier with gun desmond was rushing the last verse but the first bumboat was alongside the entryport and those who could among them were scrambling up the manropes and battens calling for rope slings or bosuns chairs to be rigged for the rest the second and third boats stroked in close in a shower of flung dead soldiers that peppered the harbour waters like a short broadside of roundshot to bump into the first the safety of the hired oars between bedamned to use it as a landing stage over which they crawled or staggered dragging the less sober from boat to boat than miser with famine or lawyer with quill to despatch us the quicker more beerless malt liquor our bodies consume and our faces grow pale but mind you it pleases it cures all diseases a comforting bottle of nottingham ale ohhhh now the idle larboard watch had taken up the chorus bosuns calls across the water were shrieking urgently and the twodeckers timbers drummed with bare feet as her crew was called out proteuss people were gathered in some sprawled insensible on the deck once they were hauled up and in by the larboard watch men reeled staggered and went to their knees still babbling song cast your accounts to father neptune overside not on the deck you drunken louts gawd halfacre youll clean that up this minute if you have to use your tongue bosun pendarves roared lewrie looked at his watch once more sharing a glance with midshipman grace at the timing glasses the sands in the halfhour and fiveminute glasses were almost run out one minute you noisy bastards lewrie shouted up you get smartly now a mast and rum stoppage for the last man inboard even the paralytic were spurred by that threat larboard hands were over the side in a twinkling to grab hold of the final corpses and fling them upward from handtohand not waiting for the slings a moment later and not one proteus was left in the bumboats nothing remained but vomit broken bottles snapped oars and the glowers from the free black boatmen officers muster your divisions take the roll to see if any have run lewrie told his lieutenants aspinall are you here aye sir his manservant piped up still wrapped in a blanket go fetch three shillings for each of the bumboats from my desk aspinall lewrie softly bade him to pay for any damage or loss aye aye sir lewrie snapped his watch shut and pocketed it as the first bells ending the evening watch pealed he paced the quarterdeck as the roll was called silently fretting many a deaddrunks face was raised by a slightly soberer messmate to be recognised in the lanthorns light many a name was answered with here sort of sir by anothers voice bless me sir lieutenant langlie reported several minutes theyve all returned all accounted for and not a man has run there was a rather loud thud on the larboard gangway as lewrie uncrossed his fingers in relief furfy manfully striving to stand had finally succumbed to rum and gravity going facefirst to the deck well in their condition mister langlie i doubt they could lewrie japed well rig an extra canvas hose in the mornin use it on their thick heads hose em out of their hammocks if needed ah aye sir langlie rejoined stifling a jaded snicker right then you lot lewrie called from the hammock nettings overlooking his swaying crew everyone had a good run ashore fine but tomorrows another day were sailing just in time to outrun the bailiffs and the damage bills you lucky dogs well also rise and scrub all decks as per usual so i trust youll use your whole four hours of peace and quiet for caulking not yarning or more of your offkey singing now lay below quietly remember to puke in the buckets he concluded not in yer hammocks those who could began to shamble to the companionway ladders snickering and snorting now and again as they whispered and chortled over their shore doings despite others shushing them or the gripes from the m asteratarms and ships corporals from bosun pendarves and his mates bodies were sluiced with water from the fire buckets or the slowmatch tubs between the guns those who woke were helped to their feet and halfdragged below those who didnt were attended by the surgeon mr shirley and his mates hodson and durant with volunteers grudgingly pressed into loblolly duty with carrying boards just leave em on the deck dont even try to sling em in a hammock mr shirley could be heard saying near a bucket mind five minutes later nary a man from either watch other than the men in the skeletal harbour and anchor watch were on deck lewrie got his shillings and paid off the disgruntled bumboatmen just as other boats neared the entryport hoy the boats mister adair called into the night first officer of hms halifax came the reply from a cutter filled with armed marines hurriedly dressed catchascatchcan sideparty sir mister adair asked looking for aid theres not enough sober hands tmake a proper showing no lewrie told him striding to the entryport help you sir my captain has sent me to put down your disturbance sir are you the officer of the watch the officer said all toplofty im the bloody captain and ill thank you to remember that lewrie shouted back dye hear a disturbance sir hark ye to the quiet why dont you well your pardons captain uhm the lieutenant stammered after a short span of silence to listen lewrie alan lewrie uhm ah the lieutenant from halifax said disconcerted to be in the unfortunate position between two postcaptains you would be the one some call the ramcat sir a pleasure to meet you sir i am sure permission to come aboard and ascertain for myself permission denied sir lewrie uncharitably growled we do not allow visiting tween ships after the first dog hells bells we are sleeping here sir there was no mutiny there was no riot there was no disturbance just high feelings and good cheer but its over and everyones below but but what am i to tell my captain sir my sincerest respects to your captain and tell him to get some sleep sir therell be a busy day tomorrow lewrie concluded and turned away to go aft to his own bedcot leaving the poor lieutenant stewing in his own juices poor shit his captainll have a strip off his hide hut thats his own lookout lewrie smugly thought as he kicked off his shoes and breeches then rolled back into his bedding aspinall snuffed a lone candle and the greatcabins were plunged into darkness once more toulon leaped onto the bed padded about and grunted for attention as lewrie cocked an ear for the night all he could hear were the creakings and squeaks of oars in tholepins as the halifaxs boats were rowed away the usual slow groans of timbers the faint flutters as the night winds jangled the running rigging and a myriad of blocks if anyone aboard was making noise it was the officers in the gunroom one deck below as they settled back in japing and sniggering among themselves after the return of the liberty parties from forrud there wasnt a peep out of the normal just the discordant chorusing snores whines and grunts from a nowsleeping crew the staffcaptain had quite forgotten his interview with lewrie those threatened orders had not arrived til days later and then they dealt with proteus preparing to escort a small convoy of hired or converted troop ships over to saint domingue to carry cashmans regiment and other reenforcements for general maitlands command that delay had allowed lewrie to award both watches with spells of shore liberty twice for each which had gone a long way to create good cheer time enough in port too for the ships peoples letters to be put aboard a mailpacket bound for home and time enough in port for another packet brig to come in and land mail for distribution throughout the fleet but nothing from carolinenothing for lewrie this time at least they had some good drunks hey lewrie whispered to his ramcat as he ruffled his fur and stroked him to a purring sack of limp contentment fore we go over to that pesthole bound to be moren a few of em never survive the fevers that are comin hey sweetlin their last joy maybe mine too lewrie grimly thought officers and gentlemen were not immune even so he had comported himself rather primly he thought some grand suppers more than one overfill of good wines a rather good session with a surprisingly tasty islandbrewed ale a ball for the th west indies regiment one night a jaunt out toward portland bight to a country house where he had mounted up and ridden himself halfexhaustedsightseeing of all things and a fine headsplitting drunk with cashman one night just the two of them reminiscing over a stone crock of american corn whiskey that cashman liked so much and of which the staffcaptain so strongly disapproved oh there had been some mild flirtations here and there but nothing had come of them he knew that he still cut a slim and elegant figure and could shine on a dance floor as old marine captain osmonde had advised so long ago hed seen the fans and lashes in full flutters of admiration and that had cheered him immensely to be welcome should he dare make the offer but oneandahalf stone of ramcat slung against his stomach as he shifted to his left side with one arm under his head and the scrunched pillows as toulon settled in for the night lewrie gave him one last long stroking that set him purring again toulon raised his head and let out a long stretching yawn in the faint moonlight coming through the stern windows the cats eyes glowed as brightly light green as a lensed fire on the eddystone lighthouse in startling chatoyance before they slitted in slumber night puss love you too murrff was the shutmouthed grunted reply chapter fifteen so near yet so far away from kingston to saint domingue was only a little over two hundred miles as the albatross flies but a real bugger to attain against the noreast trades forcing proteus to stand out far to the soueast once past the palisades tack and jog back as close to the eye of the wind as she could bear which was nornorwest even a conservative estimation had not allowed enough searoom in which to weather morant point so there was nothing for it but to tack again to the soueast and stand out at least sixty miles to make a goodly offing before one more try nornorwest that one at least had put them in the middle of the jamaica channel and out of sight of land steering as if for a landfall at santiago de cuba or guantanamo bay and with the mountains of spanish cuba almost in sight from the masttops they had tacked once more soueasterly and had jogged along closehauled in showers of spray saint domingue had come in sight at lastthe heights of the massif de la hotte that rose feet in the sky on the jutting southern arm that encompassed golfe de gonave another tack nornorwest out to sea again took them over miles north of the northern peninsula into the windward passage before they could at last turn soueast for the last time and beat into the golfe de gonave north of the peanutshaped isle of the same name and attain portauprince wouldve done better on our own sir lt langlie complained as hms proteus ghosted shoreward on a topsl breeze sails reduced to avoid disaster two hands swung the leads from the foremast chains up forrud to plumb the uncertain depths and even stolid mr winwood the sailing master harumpphed hemmed and fretted over admiralty charts of the harbour and approaches that were conspicuously littered with a myriad of reefs wrecks and rocksand those charts sure to be out of date if not complete fictions taken from french charts long ago which might have been lying fabrications to protect their secrets and those taken from ancient spanish charts from when they had owned all of hispaniola i know mister langlie lewrie softly agreed and damn all hired merchant masters and ships of the line and their captains go to loord like so many wood chips two merchant vessels had been their charge filled with soldiers and their supplies the casked meats and bagged biscuit the ammunition and powder for their muskets and field pieces ungainly barges slovenly handled and thinly manned that wore about off the wind instead of tacking ceding even more hardwon ground to windward at each maneuver at each corner of their voyage it had been all that proteus could do to stay with them half the time since the merchantmen crawled along at a snails pace and proteus like a thoroughbred racehorse had been forced to fetchto and wait on them at times if not she would have sailed them under the horizon within a fourhour watch and then there was hms halifax the twodecker in charge of their little convoy she too had borne troops and supplies rendered en flute with half her guns landed ashore to make room for them with her weather decks and gangways crowded with ignorant soldiery and her own slow handling in comparison with a frigate their short sail had become a frustrating hell not the least of which was her captain who had spent nigh on a week of getting his own back against lewrie and his impertinence hed known he was for it when the convoy sailing orders had come aboard at the last minute he should have known from the first had he been aboard proteus to witness halifaxs guns being removed and boats ferrying troops aboard her but no he had been ashore sporting too much imbibing a tad too much then sleeping later than was his customrather the navys custom to which he thought hed become inured after all these years of enforced activity aye give me a chance and ill sleep til noon every time he chid himself anew but damn the man proteus led the way into portauprince harbour with the merchantmen strung out astern of her and the twodecker last of all just in case there were uncharted reefs or shallows in store then let it be that saucy jackanapes lewrie and his toy frigate to suffer first pretty place though in a way sir marine lieutenant devereux pointed out after sharing a fetch em close with the other officers lewrie raised his own telescope at that comment as they slowly sailed down the passage denoted as the canal de saint marc towards the port at the very end of the long sack of the gulf to the left of portauprince was a coastal plain backed by a massive and steep mountain range that began at the port of st marc up north and ran soueast then east all the way to the spanish part of hispaniola south of the town the massif de la selle brooded over the gulf over feet high both ranges were densely wooded and impossibly green and lush on the lower slopes turning stonier bluer and cloudwreathed near the peaks the town though it was quite pretty lewrie decided after a long look or it had been in the past the streets were as wide as parisian boulevards lined with a few imposing and rather impressive civic buildings and hundreds of pastelpainted residences in a riot of sky blues pale mint greens pinks and yellows but beyond the town proper were entrenchments batteries redans and small fortifications all lazily fuming with cooking smoke or the smoke from armourers farriers or blacksmiths forges the town too fumed and lewrie caught the sweetsour aroma of burning garbage as the hazy pall overlying portauprince was wafted to them on a fickle wind off the eastern mountains that blunted and toyed with the trades trust the army tmuck pretty things up lieutenant catterall quipped all but elbowing devereux in jest makes you glad youre a marine i shouldnt wonder not one of those dirtyfaced soldiers yonder ah but youll note mister catterall devereux drolly gibed back how pristine the waters of this gulf weretil we sent all those ships in there sure enough the golfe de gonave which had been so clear and so sparkling just a few miles astern was now nigh the colour of mud and tobacco from the plantation runoff of a certaintybut also dotted with refuse and floating excreta from the many ships heads very well mister langlie gentlemen lewrie announced as he lowered his glass hands to stations for anchoring pick us a spot mister winwood not too near shore mind does malaria come from bad night airs then these smell sickly enough even from out here aye sir and well depend on our own watercasks long as were able lewrie decided as mister shirley suggested with so much ordure in the local streams dumped by our own troops no working parties to fetch water either aye sir the glum purser mr coote sadly had to agree all hands all hands ready to bring ship to anchor neatly done sirs lewrie could quite happily congratulate his officers and mates several minutes later they had come into harbour in manowar fashion rounding up into the wind firing their salute to the highestranking naval officer present and taking in all sails at the same time whilst dropping the best bower rigging out the booms and beginning to lower their boats even as the smoke cleared our number sir captain repair on board midshipman elwes called out from halifax sir and why am i not surprised lewrie muttered under his breath gigs in de watuh sah crews mustered andrews reported sharing a weary grin of foreknowledge with his captain dot mon got it in fo ya capum has a tin ear cant appreciate good music lewrie quipped he squared away his hanger the set of his waistcoat and shot the cuffs of his best broadcloth uniform in the lee of the mountains port auprince was a stifling place even at midmorning humid steaming and the air wet dishclout close right then lets be doin it ah captain lewrie so good of you to join us captain george blaylock said with a patently false purr of welcome though peering at his watch rather pointedly before snapping it shut with a tiny smile of satisfaction halifax had still been under way the two merchantmen had nigh run down his gig as they had swanned about seeking anchorages close to shore where they could still have room to swingand a much shorter row for their boats to ferry troops and supplies to land at the last andrewss boatcrew had had to row like the devil was at the transom to catch her up shortly after she had anchored and fired her own salute a glass of something captain lewrie blaylock offered waving a hand at a winetable bit early in the day for me sir thankee lewrie replied it was not too early for colonel ledyard beauman and his staff who had travelled on halifax it being the most spacious christopher cash man was the only one of them who sipped cold breakfast tea from a china cup looking impatient to get his troops ashore whilst the two majors and the adjutant a young sprog of a captain by name of sellers and a nephew of ledyards lewrie had learned indulged in a decanter of claret my word what sort of sneakers the navy takes in these days captain blaylock tittered turning his head to share the laugh with the others lewries neck began to burn to be compared to a sneak one of a carousing crew who didnt keep up his alcoholic intake at the same rate as the rest and feigned his participation when by god he had kept up with the best of em in his youth still could he was sure blaylock was a sour little stick of a man a greying minnikin as spare and reedy as commodore horatio nelson though possessed of a much deeper voice from one so lean he wore a short tightly curled tiewig even in this heat his face and hands tanned woodybrown from thirty years of sea duty and a complexion flushed with rosacea or some such rash perhaps too much drink lewrie uncharitably thought asking himself if the entire west indies fleet was solely and utterly peopled by hard drinkers weve sent ashore for orders lewrie captain blaylock said as he wavedno shooedlewrie to a wingback chair asking when and where general maitland wishes us landed and in what order cant clutter up the piers ledyard beauman commented make all sorts of confusion take our time hey not til needed what poor excuses for quays this harbour boasts are too busy already captain blaylock added but what can one expect from the idle french good enough for them i spose youll hold all of your boats lewrie til we tell you when and where to come fetch and land tell maitland what weve brung ledyard opined legs stretched out and all but resting on his spine in his chair his glossy boots that rose above his knees dragoon fashion gleaming know best what he needs first artillery or shot loose powder cartridges lewrie caught cashmans frown of disapproval no matter it was carefully veiled in the presence of his betters in my experience at toulon sirs id imagine that cartridges for the troops already here would best suit lewrie blandly stated if not at the quays then there are several stretches of beach would serve the purpose cartridges prebagged powder for his artillery one company could be employed to pile and tote then guard at that debacle were you captain blaylock snapped what a bloody muddle it was aye i was sir were you as well lewrie asked no i was not sir blaylock said with a petulant little moue utterly ruined by the timidity of our socalled allies the spanish by putting too much trust in the french royalists admiral hood was hah hoodwinked goodun sir capital ledyard beauman hawhawed hoodwinked captain blaylock repeated so taken with his jape that he could not resist by gasconading boasts of fealty from french antijacobins was the way i heard tell it the dons admiral ready to trade fire with hood over who held the right to command lost out and sailed away and not six months later took hands with the frogs against us pah outgunned outmanned and undersupplied though sir alan lewrie pointed out after the growls of past betrayal and prejudice had subsided generals dugommier and bonaparte held the high ground and all the cards oh tosh much the same terrain when you look at it cashman piped up in a cagey sort of voice a seaport with a small perimeter of level ground surrounded by heights too few troops to push out into the countryside thout getting cut to ribbons and outnumbered nearly ten to one too few troops to defend a larger perimeter too few guns at the moment to break a determined assault sirs lewrie allowed himself a tiny grin of agreement at the stress that cashman used were he this general maitland he was certain that ammunition and more field guns would be his greatest demands now and yes now that kit had brought it up lewrie realised that a strong comparison could be made between toulon and portauprince it explained the fey feeling he had experienced whilst ghosting shoreward that prickle of wariness and uncertainty the situation was much the same too with a british force surrounded almost besieged by enemy troops in much greater numbers did it turn out the same was there to be a massacre of the innocents as had happened when hood had quit the place and the republican french soldiers had waded out into the water to shoot and bayonet the thousands who could not find room aboard the departing ships he gave himself an involuntary shake wishing he had taken the offer of a drop of something after all for certain he was suddenly glad that he would be shot of the place once the stores were landed and proteus could get out to sea to serve in the blockade samboes dont have guns ledyard quibbled most of em are armed with caneknives few muskets few shoes wot our artillery will cut them down in waves like reapin cane captain sellers chortled never even get in musket range major porter added when the grape and cannisterll lay em out long before why we brought along caltrops ledyard beauman boasted it was cashmans suggestion wasnt it caltrops captain blaylock enquired peering at cashman scrap metal ten pence nails and such sir colonel cashman explained with a shrug of modesty colonel beauman has the right of it very few of em are shod take two and bend em together so however it lands a couple of points always face up sirs strew em by the hundreds in the long grass before a position even if a clear field of fires been cut and theyll tramp right over em before they see em even a cuffys horny hoof cant take that lame em take em out of the fight die of lockjaw days later and take even more ttend em brought enough for our own use and i know that general maitland had his quartermasters on jamaica scour the countryside for scrap iron sure tbe umpteen thousands of em cased up and waitin to be landed soonest slows em up somethin wondrous sirs een through flimsy wornout shoes ledyard hooted gad think o louverture hoppin about in his fancy boots after that ooh merci ooh sacre bleu ooh massahl captain sellers playacted in a slurred slave accent dancing his feet on blaylocks fancy rugs and shrilling in pain which made all but lewrie and cashman double over with laughter tak eet out i be a goood niggah you do not find it amusing captain lewrie blaylock asked once the impersonation had paled louverture and his tagrag troops have defeated everyone on the island sir or so my advisories from admiralty inform me i doubt thingsll be quite so easy they never are unfortunately and long as louverture fights us hes supported by france recognised by the directory in paris as a patriot sir to them and to a great many people in saint domingue theyre better equipped and armed than we suspect too sir from hugues down on guadeloupe and from the americans theyre beginning to make decent muskets and oh rot sir captain blaylock said with a sniff of humour weve the whole coast bottled up with the cork hammered home not a rowboat could land supplies no the samboes are fighting with what little theyve gleaned from the prewar garrisons and theres little mineral wealth here not enough to make iron or steel nor the ingredients for even halfway decent powder lead for shot before this war began the rich merchant traders at rochefort lorient and brest preferred selling manufactured goods here and blocked any attempt to make none but the simplest things locally good rap and they crack ledyard beauman said nodding with as much sagacity as he could muster nought tfall back on then how have they maintained their army this long sir kit cashman had to ask him how has rigaud and his faction done so and the grands blancs up at cape francois good reason for my troops tbe landed as soon as possible captain blaylock and for old lewrie to get back out to sea to add to your blockade soon as were ashore god bless the man lewrie thought in soaring thankfulness like he read my bloody mind have to gift him fort handsomely weill captain blaylock said after a long pondering during which a sly smile had crept upon his phyz perhaps are we so thin on the ground hereabouts colonel cashman even more reenforcments may be needed to hold the perimeter long sixpounders from a quarterdeck or forecastle might be a welcome addition carronades easily handled by a small team of gunners and capable of large loads of grape or cannister too experienced naval gunners along with some marines he turned his head away from the rest who were nodding along in rote agreement and cast his lidded gaze upon lewrie who plumbed with a sinking feeling in his innards exactly where such pounders carronades and warm bodies would be found damn you ya cant be that big a bastard he silently yelped i best think fast and hard to the contrary captain blaylock lewrie rejoined as calmly as he could it would seem to me that halifax has the larger marine complement commanded by a captain of marines with two lieutenants as aides and since she is a very deepdraught ship of the line surely she could be no assistance in the blockade you are already en flute and therefore should hardly miss your quarterdeck and focsle guns you do do you blaylock smiled back his lips and voice as thin as winter ice might remind you captain lewriehis gaze fell pointedly upon the single epaulet on lewries uniform compared to his pairthat i am senior officer of our convoy i will decide just pointing out the most efficient use of what we have at present sir lewrie said having to swallow his bile and eat bitter shite though wondering if there was another naval officer ashore on one of those ships hed saluted who could countermand this idea and how quickly he could get to him to complain before the confrontation could get more serious there came a discrete rapping upon the greatcabin door and the stamp of a marine boot first awfcer sah enter captain blaylock testily barked in came the unfortunate lieutenant that lewrie had spurned at proteuss entryport just nights before with his hat under his arm he looked a thinhaired halfbald and longsuffering sort frazzled by his onerous duties and lewrie suspected just about done in by a constant diet of blaylocks dung on his plate a short session with the man was bad enough but to serve under him day after day watchandwatch ive a reply from general maitland sir the lieutenant said well out with it man gods sake blaylock tsktsked the generals compliments sir and he desires that we begin to land troops and supplies at once sir he adverted me to use the word urgent captain well then but mister duncan in which order hah the ah lieutenant duncan stammered consulting a list newly arrived troops under long arms and with full field packs and ammunition issue at once sir musket ammunition and specials thatd be what he called caltrops sir second with field artillery and teams caissons and limbers and munitions third rations are to be last captain well then blaylock said stroking at the top of his wig there it is then gentlemen to horse or rather to boat haw uhm there is also a note from captain nicely sir the lieutenant added as blaylock rose to his feet indeed captain blaylock rejoined with an offended snort here sir duncan said shoving the folded note at him and acting hangdog but eager to get away sure there would be reason to flee all this intrigued lewries curiosity who stood with his hat under his arm shamming respectful deference but aquiver to escape as welljust as soon as blaylocks sudden dyspepsia was explained a postcaptain senior to blaylock this nicely and from the sound of it no friend of his some rivalry he wondered blaylocks rosacea bloomed like carolines spring gardens and the man actually growled like a wakened bear oh this must be good lewrie told himself some dirty passed on from one vengeful bastard to another blaylock crumpled the note into a tight wad so hard his fingers turned white and his mouth and eyes pinched in rage he could ram the note down a musket barrel for wadding so fiercely did he work it captain lewrie ill thank you to return to your ship and get your boats back here instanter captain blaylock snapped i will brook no delay no dawdling or skylarking hear me you are to land colonel beaumans regiment on the town beach north of the quays and god help you do you shillyshally aye aye sir directly lewrie parroted off from long usage bowing from the waist like a german and stalking for the door the unfortunate lieutenant duncan took the opportunity to flee as well using the excuse of mustering the side party to render him honours bad blood is there lewrie casually asked once on deck of long standing they were once midshipmen together oh good as a scottish feud then campbells and macdonalds lewrie tossed off with a grin of sudden understanding theres more than a few still eager for my liver those compatriots of my youth well sir success has a way of attracting the envious lieutenant duncan told him with a shy smile one almost of open adoration damme is my name that well known lewrie asked himself am i some sort of paragon to emulate mine arse on a bandbox i wish to apologise for being short with you the other night lewrie told duncan feeling the need to sound noble of a sudden it put you in a bad patch but then i suspect you already know what that feels like hmmm oh aye captain lewrie duncan had the sudden temerity to agree in a faint whisper i uhm gather that captain nicely should have fresh orders for you as well soon as youre done sir ah any hint you may share with me mister duncan lewrie cajoled hoping against hope that this nicely hadnt had the same idea about using proteus as an armory or reserve barracks out to sea where youre the best use sir duncan said with a tired but wistful expression but you didnt hear it from me i quite understand and thankee mister duncan for not saying a bloody word lewrie beamed offering his hand twill be halifax i was told that will be stripped for guns and gunners our marines and duncan continued eagerly taking the offered hand and shaking it with joy though with a sad and disappointed look on his face the curse of old liners i fear sir never so exciting as being appointed to a frigate of course every aspiring young officer yearned for place aboard frigates and sloops of war where the independent adventures happened though lewrie did wonder if duncan was as guileless as he looked and whether he was slyly wangling for a berth aboard proteus should any of his present officers die of battle or fever given the joylessness of life aboard halifax under captain blaylock though lewrie decided that strokeoar on tom turdmans dung barge would be a distinct improvement hell leave him something hes been helpful lewrie decided so many men sent ashore though mister duncan lewrie continued theyll need a capable officer as i was at the siege of toulon in a grand opportunity for an aspiring man to make his name there is that though isnt there sir duncan said his mood brightening in an instant i am senior he mused all ascheme and blaylock despises you lewrie thought much like old captain braxton on cockerel hated me thats how i got my chance ashore at toulon he wanted tsee the back o me a grand chance for glory and official notice lewrie encouraged it was the honourable the courageous thing one had to say when a man like duncan was seconded to command a neckornothing endeavour instead of gawd help yer misrable arse that simply wasnt done grand chance o dyin with a pitchfork in yer belly more like lewrie imagined if things ashore have gotten that desperate it will be wont it sir duncan decided aloud putting the good face on it despite his own qualmsand if he didnt have any qualms lewrie would have considered him daft why duncan joshed a few more chances like thisun and i could end as famed as you sir oh dont do that mister duncan lewrie poohpoohed the idea breezing it off as a properly modest hero was supposed to do the hours are horrid you cant keep clean and its damnall hard work far too much for a lazybones like me but the very best of good fortune go with you if you have the honour to be appointed ashore thankee captain lewrie thankee indeed duncan chortled now in high fettle his saggy hounddog eyes alight and crinkled in joy the bosuns calls were twittering marines were stamping boots and slapping muskets about so lewrie doffed his hat to them all and turned his back outboard to descend the manropes and boarding battens gazing at duncans face and wondering if he should have thrown in more than a trifling note of caution for lewrie had the queasy fey suspicion that he had just shaken hands with a dead man who would dare too much in pursuit of fame just as long as it aint me he gratefully told himself chapter fifteen bloody chimera christopher cashman said with a growl of disappointment always looks better from a distance gotten worse since last i was here too before the french revolution had begun in portauprince had been the second richest town in saint domingue trailing the main port of cape francoisle capby only a few livres now it was sadly fallen no longer the lively and cultured town of music and arts of operas and farces and grand balls frankly it was a cesspit the few stores still open sold only the barest necessities with most shelves bare and the prices exorbitant there were too many refugees down from the countryside and many of those closed stores were now converted to housing if they hadnt been commandeered for army use even the grand pastelstuccoed mansions that lewrie had seen out at sea resembled tumbledown longneglected hovels in the worst stews of london s east end centuriesold manses turned to anthills of tiny rental lodgings some going for a penny a night for a pallet on a bare wood floor and many bore chalk marks denoting that a certain company of a certain regiment lodged there with the smaller houses bearing a number around or showing how many troops could be barracked the reek of garbage of human wastes was even stronger ashore and the kerbside gutters were stained with it the channels down the middle of those faeryland boulevards could run brown with ordure when it rained and it rained a lot in saint domingue like venice lewrie supplied to their conversation pretty to look at but dung wharf once you get into the canals oh for the sailors life cashman drolly singsonged why th places i been an th things i seen cor blimey tyke new south wales frinstance kangaroos as bigz dray orses eat men up whole an spits hout th bones ey does you sound in better takings this evening lewrie pointed out course i do alan cashman chuckled as they strolled along ive all my troops ashore all my field guns with five days rations and cartridges and something tdo with em our heroic colonels off swillin in the staff officers mess and if gods just hell find it so agreeable the second coming couldnt stir him out of it a chance tpreen with general maitland and play dashin hangeron with the real soldiers damn is eyes i dont know why i let you lure me ashore lewrie said for the third time puzzling as he peered into a converted shopfront that was filled with refugee families in stained finery the way theyre talking its the last place i care tbe besides i always get in trouble ashore dye know that i promised you a grand supper cashman rejoined quite merrily and bein a curious corinthian tales of mystery and gluttony won you over the staff messd be safer than traipsing about like this would it not lewrie asked noting how dark the night was and how dimly and spottily portauprince was lit and its formerly grand parisian system of illumination badly maintained if at all anymore ah but only swill served alan cashman laughed at his reticence most of the officers are englishraised so they have no idea of good food no sense of adventure its all john bull boiled beef and puddins and wots is here tripe pвtй de foie gras wouldnt feed that foreign trash tme hounds you know the sort not like us we have worldly palates just so long as ill have a whole neck down which to swallow lewrie said taking comfort in the two small doublebarreled barkers in his coat pockets and the heft of the hanger on his left hip just in case he had secreted a wavybladed krees mindanao pirate dagger inside the left sleeve of his coat to boot been here before cashman promised and it cant have changed all that much in a year tis a hard man and wife runs it once you taste their dishes youll slit yer own throat just tprolong your pleasure as the yankee slaves say its slap yo mama good good god lewrie had wit to jape never have i heard such a backhanded compliment backhanded dye see godll forgive you cashman snickered ah here we are he had directed them to one of those imposing pastel mansions at the intersection of two boulevards where a roundabout and fountain stood though the fountain barely burbled these days and was mostly green and brown with moss mildew and scum the house was fitted with a rounded wraparound set of balconies on the two upper floors and the overhangs formed a wrought iron collonade above the ground floor doors and windows which were barred with more intricate wrought iron grills heavy draperies were pulled over the windows but from within lewrie could espy the faintest hint of candlelight though the place seemed to be abandoned cashman lifted the hilt of his smallsword to rap on the heavy ironstrapped doors a particular taptaptaptaptaptaptap after a moment the judas hole swung aside and a glint of light showed from within quickly covered by a mans eye a moment later though those doors were flung open and they were hurriedly welcomed in jeanpierre maman cashman cried in joy flinging himself upon the swarthy man and woman who stood guard in the tiled foyer with pistols cutlasses and a brace of muskets ah commandant keet bienvenu has been so long we see you a colonel now cashman preened twirling about to show off la mon dieu felicitations the wife of the establishment cried hands to her cheeks with joy you hunger oui you wish wine as before come you and your frнen nossing but ze best pour vous swarthier manservants in livery came to take their swords and hats servants who also bulged here and there with weapons discreetly hidden they didnt seem to share the joy of rencontre with cashman or the sight of lewrie either they wore permanent wary scowls the swords lewrie carefully noted as they were led to a table in a back parlour were stood against a sideboard within easy reach should he or cashman need to grasp them once seated the pocket doors were slid half shut on the hall and he and cashman had the entire parlour to themselves from without lewrie could hear the low humum of other conversations in other chambers a piercing laugh now and then some boisterous shouts as a toast was made and drunk hmmm some rather highpitched laughs and words some women things might just be looking up he thought a waiter in livery and a white bib apron entered and chatted quite gaily with cashman for a piece in patois french of course so lewrie hadnt a clue what was being said though it looked quite jovial and innocent innocuous rather as the waiter departed cashman tipped lewrie the wink old jacques wonderful old fellow hell take care of us cashman informed him took the liberty of orderin for us do you not object spйcialitй de la hфte youll love it i assure you so what are we havin then lewrie asked as the waiter came back with a magnum of champagne and two crystal flutes though it was too much to expect that portauprince might run to massachusetts ice the champagne was velvety smooth and spritely from a famous vineyard in france and much finer than lewrie might have expected grand aint it cashman said once hed had a taste jeanpierre and maman always have the best of evrything before the revolution sent things tom obedlam this was the most exclusive place in town theyre the best smugglers and speculators too no one knows how or where they get things or cache em til needed but you wont eat or drink better were you in paris itself are those smugglers and speculators we hear then lewrie had to ask savouring the dry mellowness of the wine it was miles above any vintage hed tasted lately even better than the beaumans cellar cutthroats pimps courtesans mistresses and their men or the odd profiteer cashman quite cheerfully catalogued rogues from the canting crews successful pickpockets and thieves rich rakehells who havent fled yet a shifty lot but they pay well and theyre always flush with chink blieve it or not alan with all o their hired beef watchin their backs this just may be the safest place in portauprince and i doubt thingsd change did louverture march in tonight give em a week and hell be dinin here him and his generals may make more of a mess stain more napery but as to supper cashman enthused changing the subject and refilling their glasses we start with shrimp rйmoulade followed by an omelette au bacon et frommage followed by spinach salads before the goat ragout which is bloody marvellous by the way and the roasted coq au vin with asparagus and other removes burgundy hock or saint emilion bordeaux praps a beaujolais with the omelettes if you like the sideboardll groan with bottles and for dessert a crиme fraоche over strawberries and cut fruit you should see the berries they can grow in this soil thought most of the folk here in town were starvin lewrie said in wonder as the waiter bustled in once more this time trailed by a brace of serving wenches in freshpressed and sweetsmelling sack gowns one with light brown hair the other a striking redhead and wearing their own hair not wigs artfully done up in ribbons they are but that dont signify if you have the blunt and know your way about cashman said dismissively theres some thatll always prosper oohla vivienne you darlin still here are ya cashman said turning his attention to the striking wee lighthaired wench drawing her even closer as she sidled her hip against him and served his rйmoulade fine coinsilver utensils magically appeared from a pocket of jacquess bib apron more spoons knives and forks than an english household might display all at once prissily set out in bewildering order either side of their plates msieur the redhead purred as she served lewrie pressing her hip against his shoulder too mademoiselle enchantй lewrie instinctively responded with a welcoming purr of his own and a slow sly smile comment vous appelezvous he asked henriette msieur et vous brave englis capitaine he told her took her hand and kissed it for good measure and tipped her a wink before turning to face cashman youre going to get me in trouble arent you kit he asked with a wry grin hope you fetched off your best cundums cashman muttered back with a smile of his own this one of beatific innocence god this is good lewrie had to exclaim after the maids had departed in a swirl of skirts and hips and had closed the pocket doors completely so they could dine in peace reminds me cashman said daubing at his mouth and sipping at his wine fore we depart well ask jeanpierre for some coffee and cocoa beans saint domingue coffee is as good as anything from brazil and their cocoas sweeter an mellower too mix it with what ya have alreadyonetotwoand youll think youre in heaven it may be dear what with the crops not bein tended much since their slaves rose up but worth it if they have any dearer than what jamaican chandlers ask lewrie frowned bout half id think cashman told him pausing to savour a bite hard to believe theyre samboes aint it who our hostlers lewrie asked them and our servin girls cashman told him winking they are lewrie said amazed but they look so petits blancs need love too alan cashman drolly snickered most real whitesve fled to havana or charleston even new orleans he seemed delighted by lewries surprised look those who stayed are mostly halfcastes brights fancies quadrons or octoroons what are lumped into the catchall term mulatto hereabouts some of them owned plantations sent their children to school in paris before the war rich as the grands blancs richer but that dont signify either tis pure white blood the guineastamp round here remember i told you how the french divided folk by grades of white or black therere one hundred and twentyeight diff rent gradationsstruth get into marabous and sacatras maybe threequarters or more white and you couldnt say one way or tother even in broad daylight but even a sangmйlй with one part black blood to a hundredtwentyseven white is still a sambo to them vivienne an henriette theyre high marabous maybe low sacatras and still get the short end of the stick cause their folks werent rich or landed or much of anything cept imitation petits blancs and the worst part for them is cashman paused for dramatic effect and a sip of his wine the real darkies off the fields the ones in louvertures regiments think the same way about em dye see cashman said with an air of grim foreboding they look too white for one camp but theyre too tainted with the tarbrush for tother lovely place saint domingue aint it he sarcastically drawled so what happens to em if portauprince falls to louverture and his laddies lewrie asked world turned upside down cashman tossed off as if it were no worry of his the too whitell get knackered and all the restll be allowed to kowtow and join up with louverture make their salaams bang their heads on the floor and liveon the bottom of society mind and a poorun itll be you mark my words take em a century tturn this island back to a payin proposition jeanpierre well by god but this is a marvelous rйmoulade dont ya think alan aye tis lewrie agreed a trifle impatient for cashman to complete his statements though but what about im oh hell mostlike have a schooner lined up for a quick getaway cashman speculated with another blasй shrug does he stay he might do alright less they scrag him for profiteerin when other folks were starvin god knows which sidell do that louvertures as an example or them that starved for revenge now does he cut an run with all his goods and money he could set up fresh in the united states savannah charleston new orleans they all have socalled creole citizens under polite society ocourse take the lightest girls along and reopen a bordello some o them could lie like blazes and swear they were grands blancs all the way back to adam pass for white dye see ah our omelettes in came jacques and the girls to remove the nowempty plates recharge wineglasses and deliver steaming pissrunny french style egg disheswith more subtle bumping and lingering touches lewrie studied henriette more closely the only hints of difference he could discern were a slightly olive cast to her flawless complexion and very full lips her dark red hair though curlier did not appear to be hennaed and her greenhazel eyes would not have been out of place in the germanies somezing is wrong msieur capitaine lewrie she asked feeling the intensity of his scrutiny perhaps resenting it as a prejudice on his part he wondered in no way mademoiselle henriette he answered smiling more broadly adding a touch of leer to dispel her wariness i was just captivated utterly dumbstruck by how lovely you are you are too kind msieur henriette purred back her lashes fluttering most fetchingly as she leaned down a bit allowing a promisingly soft breast to compress against his epaulet but delightful to hear you do not object he dared to tease mais non capitaine lewrie henriette replied lowering her eyelids a poor girl always enjoy the compliments and you henriette lewrie muttered leaning back in his seat to look up at her from even closer are you kind la i can be trиs kind capitaine lewrie she whispered all but in his ear letting her loosely gathered hair brush his shoulder if you wish that is she added with that secret smile that women make when being sultrily coy you would like nestce pas hells bells were doin it on the table lewrie wondered to himself as he caught sight of cashman and vivienne from the corner of his eye kit already had his wench in his lap one hand groping about up her skirt and sharing a soul kiss with her he turned back to henriette who wore a leer of her own after seeing what was transpiring across the table lewrie gently reached up and took hold of her chin to steer her lips to his enfired by her warmth and the womanly aromas beneath her exotic flowery perfume very much very bloody much lewrie chuckled deep in his throat feeling her lips grinning against his mouth in agreement later mon cher henriette silently sounded against him later chйrie plus tard certainement cher alain she breathed against his cheek a moment before vivienne gave out a yip as cashman playspanked her on the bottom and shooed them out how longs it been since ive had a whore he asked himself phoebe aretino no dont count she was a mistress gawd calcutta and canton way back in cashman smugly stuffing himself with a huge smile of anticipation and slurping lustily at his wines made lewrie wonder if their dining chamber would have to serve amours purpose it was dimly lit with only a few candles the drapes heavy and drawn the windows ironbarred the wainscoting and overhead beams made of dark wood that ate what little light the candles threw there were several settees and a pair of chaise longues along the walls it could have been a seraglio in a sultans haremone of his oldest and most enduring fantasiesbut it was a rather seedy close and stuffy seraglio with not a breath of air stirring much as he liked kit this was they have rooms tlet i spose lewrie asked finally niceuns too cashman said with an enigmatic leer theres some dont wait but i never thought of it as a spectator sport bad as mountin yer filly in the middle o lords cricket grounds try a glass o hock with your eggs theres a touch o cinnamon to it that goes maintasty with em even better than champagne tmy thinkin i think i will at that lewrie exclaimed reaching for one of the bottles on the sideboard now enthused and inflamed by thoughts of pleasures to come and filled with a boisterous expectant bonhomie he was relieved too that his sport would be the private sort and not a public spectacle with cashman or vivienne deducting points for awkwardness fond as he was of that harem fantasy it had always been him and a round dozen wenches with not even a sleeping eunuch as witness god aint it grand cashman snickered with delight as he hoisted his glass to be refilled not too much though good as the wines are lewrie cautioned ah plus tard hey cant take yer jumps if foxed blind it did come to mind lewrie happily rejoined yoicks tallyho cashman crowed chapter sixteen henriette was incredibly kind upstairs in an airy room lined with wideshuttered doors and window coverings that let in a blissful breeze of much cooler air down off the high mountains to the east a lone trio of fingernarrow candles lit the chamber barely illuminating anything beyond the bedstead yet throwing mesmerising shadows against the walls and shutters with each mild gust up that high above the fouled and littered streets of portauprince it was refreshing to escape the miasma of too much garbage and the reek of too many people and those gently flickering candles threw such enchanting highlights and shadows over henriettes fine body too limning a chiaroscuro portrait in ambers and black hollows making her even more exotic than she already was the sheets were clean if wormed with small seams of repairs and were redolent of soap and sunlight the candles were localmade scented with flowers almost as sharp on the nose as chinee josssticks or very high church incense henriette had dabbed on fresh scent too after theyd locked and barred the door and that was all over the bedstead the pillows and him by then for cool as was that breeze it was still a warm and humid tropic night and they had perspired oh how they had perspired in the throes of lust the more common term of sweated came to lewries mind sweated like coolie labourers loading cargo on jackass point in canton or hindoos up the hooghly river but more than worth it he smugly decided stifling a yawn as he sprawled beside her getting his breath back and watching the candle patterns dance on the overhead canopy of the bedstead there came a stronger gust of wind a cooler and welcome zephyr it rains henriette whispered sure enough the zephyrs were followed by the faintest plashing of raindrops on the balcony there was a basso rumble of faraway thunder and an eyeblinks flicker upon the shutters from a fork of distant lightning the wide wood shutters thrown in blue relief for a second mon dieu merci lewrie sat up and groped to the foot of the bed for a discarded sheet to fan it and lift it to trap the cooler air to let it fall slowly and drape over them then fan it to soar and hang again merci to you too cher alain she smiled getting up on one elbow to face him and reward him with another token of kindness on his lips i have the basin you wish me to sponge you you are trиs hot i cool you better i get to sponge you henriette he chuckled reclining once more with his hands under his head and the pillow i dont wish tget too cool a certain heat is required aint it uhm lardour la passion but you were born with the passion mon amour she told him mon dieu so formidable whores lies he thought but so pleasin she slid out of bed on the window side all those delectably shadowed hollows and sweatsheened bright spots awakening his interest anew lean waist long slim neck and arms with entrancing hollows at throat and collarbones firm round and jutting young breasts that nearly defied newton s laws of gravity a bouncy round and firm bottom strongthewed thighs with such a seductive dark hollow between she peeked flirtatiously over her shoulder as she walked to the windows rolling her hips chuckling over the effect she knew she had on him at the nearest window she posed herself drew open the shutters and stood silhouetted feet apart and arms widespread with a theatric sigh of contentment she threw back her head to savour that cooler wind began to run her hands over her body as if smoothing in a lotion made of raindrops or the nights magic with her back to him well he wasnt having any of that lewrie sprang from the bed and crossed the room to snuggle in against her from behind to help her enjoyment his hands roamed and made henriette softly groan deep in her throat over her waist and belly the tops of her thighs then up to cup her bounteous breasts and circle her large dark nipples and areolae with his thumbs up to the tops of her shoulders then butterflying downward over her breasts again and she stiffened with delight and parted her feet more widely as he softly traced down either side of her stomach down to her prominent mons and the pouty lips of her vagina she leaned her head back on his shoulder raised her arms over her head and juddered her luscious bottom against his groin a moment more a groan more and she stepped quickly away over to the washhandstand for the sponges and the basin of cool water so she could return and do the same for him working her way down down til she knelt before him teasing her hair over his member now hard as a marlingspike a look up into his eyes a teasing smile upon her face then she halflidded her eyes took hold of his manhood and put her lips over the cap pour vous mon amour formidable she whispered pausing for a moment before lowering her head once more to her ministrations the distant thunder seemed to rumble twixt his ears steady as the excited pulse of his heart he threw his own head back and let out a low moan put one hand on the back of her head and gripped a shutter with the other whores by god he exulted to himself looking down at last to watch her and him work together wives never know this now and then maybe a mistress but go it darlin tonight youre mine tdo evrything i want bought an paid for and by god it feels fine the novelty of having a woman so casually of using her as much as he wanted any way he wanted then discarding her without a backward glancethough with a japing teasing friendliness a fond parting kiss and extra shilling or twoit was so damned beguiling so alluring that he wondered why hed eschewed whores all these years wasnt for the navy idve mostlike become a pimp he recalled from his early days the chuckle in his throat higher this time almost a cackle of mirth thudthudthudthud went the faroff thunder thudthud no it wasnt thunder he decided after a moment of coherency in the grip of mindless pleasure and it wasnt his heart either those regular thuds for they were in counterpoint to the beat in his chest henriette stopped and sat back on her heels suddenly looking forlorn and frightened clamping her arms over her breasts here now he began to say irked that shed quit before the melting moments louverture henriette squeaked the drums drums oh lewrie gawped going to the window so thats what that sound is like like muskogee indian drumming sort of is voudoun henriette gasped beginning to shiver in dread cuffy mumbojumbo lewrie scoffed is vrais is true very powerful henriette insisted at the verge of teethchattering terror voudoun priests bless rebels and curse town peoples we hear the drums it mean louverture and his armies ave come in the hills now oh mon dieu zey kill us all theyll not get the town chene lewrie told her following her round the room as she dithered thinking of packing thinking about hiding the next moment picking things up and then throwing them down theres a british army out there with dozens of field guns redans and fortifications lashings of ammunition theres ships in harbour just stiff with artillery too nothing to worry about now let us get back to our pleasures where were we hmmm he took hold of her arms and brought her to a halt by the bed urging her to get back into it shed raised his desires had brought him close to joy and damned if he was going to quit now british keep us safe she asked sounding leery about it safe as houses i assure you he lied embracing her and kissing her neck and shoulders her hollows but with a bit of a spraddlelegged dance to the edge of the mattress a bit of pressure to topple her back to her duties cant let a pretty young thing like you get in their clutches now can we henriette ma chйrie he coaxed she submitted and sat on the edge of the bed to reengage her mouth over him sulkily at first but quickly warming to her work ah thats me girl lewrie sighed rockhard again she quit again but this time it was merely to reach over to the nightstand to retrieve a fresh unused cundum and sheath him with the tanned sheepgut to tie off the ribbons around his waist and under his crutch then award him a brave smile as she lay back and opened her limbs to him lewrie slid in kissing his way up her body lingering over her groin for a long minute or two til she began to grind her hips and make whimpery little groaning sounds up to kiss and lick her belly that actually shuddered under his feathery touch her hands now eagerly drawing him higher tonguing and suckling on her marvelous poonts and even playnipping that made her squeak and bounce and chuckle then her thighs raised and he was atop her and in her and the mongol horde or all the imps of hell could have been howling for blood belowstairs for all that lewrie cared henriette too it seemed to lewrie this time was not artful or coy but furious and mindless as if sex could silence those drums and drive the baduns away rapraprap on the door i say alan old son time tbe out and doin cashman muttered go away later plus tard lewrie gasped back amid a skirl of squeaking bedropes and slats and henriette panting into his mouth as if trying to suck a long life from him whining in ecstacy heard the drums i really think bugger off drake had time tbowl ive time for a romp whoo darlin henriette was keening grasping clawing nigh to a scream oui oui oui mon dieu oh oui i henriette shrieked i am going eeeeehhhh aarrhhh lewrie chimed in a moment later rule brittania by jesus yes he collapsed on her aswim in perspiration once more gasping like a pair of landed fish aslither to press close and grasp to keep the mindlessness in hand as long as possible happy now came the sardonic muffled voice beyond the door aint paradise yet but damn close lewrie called back as he rolled off the bed groaning with exhaustion and lingering joy as he stood barearsed naked and stripped off the cundum for a quick washing and later use quick sponge and ill be out in two shakes of a wee lambs tail and the firsts already been shook uhm henriette me darlin know where i dropped my shirt though it was hours before dawn and still raining in a light desultory way the streets of portauprince teemed with people some refugees were up and packing or trundling twowheeled handcarts down to the harbour in hopes of a departing ship there was more light at last with almost every window or porchway illuminated by the curious and the fearful citizens stood on their stoops or balconies to stare out towards the countryside or shout questions at passersby and their neighbours who were also up and peering in their nightshirts or gowns british troops and those handfuls of persecuted saint domingue royalists who had taken arms with them mustered and marched to drums of their own and the thin tootle of fifes in the opposite direction forcing lewrie and cashman to shoulder and sidle aside on their way to the port and those faroff drums still thrummed regular as a metronome seemingly from every inland point of the compass as if portauprince was already surrounded and under a fell siege there were some out on the streets who seemed glad of it though it was far too early to show enthusiasm or loyalty the guillotines set up by the original jacobins still stood waiting for their next victims terrified petits blancs or mulattoes could still turn into a mob and tear people asunder if they had no other weapons than their hands toussaint louvertures secret allies those supposedly happy personal servants and household slaves fetched in from the country had turned on their masters before it was no wonder everyone went about as cuttyeyed as a bag of nails with one hand near a pocketed pistol or the hilt of a sword at present all they could do was glare maybe smirk with delight of a future victory their chins high and their eyes alight as lewrie and cashman passedtwo officers alone with no escort easily taken by a quickly gathered gang lewrie could feel their speculation as if he were a yearling calf under the gaze of the farmer with a knife hidden from view yorktown toulon lewrie snarled keeping his eyes moving and a firm grip on his sword hilt looks and smells the same of a sudden defeat and disaster he was still short of breath and their rapid pace wasnt helping oh rot cashman snapped still out of sorts for being kept waiting when he was afire to dash off to join his troops what we built round this place we can hold for months if need be break em on our guns and ramparts certain you can kit lewrie replied but the rots set in those drums tales of voudoun and past massacres british troops might hold but whole towns against you ready troll over and quit cant you feel it already theyre scared ill grant you cashman answered but let em see us shred the first assaults and theyll buck up let some of the fainthearts run no use anyway and thatll be fewer mouths to feed a weekr two of slaughter and the slaveysll melt back into the hills lickin their wounds weil hold count on it he said firmer of resolve as if saying it would make it so though lewrie doubted that it might make a real difference on the rest of the island what would be gained with another fever season coming lewrie wondered the slave armies decimated for sure but not defeated as his advisories had boasted free to recruit and rearm strike another place less well defended another year of campaigning that would eat european troops ammunition and money like a gluttons box of sweets to what end after all the lives lost well here we are cashman said clomping to a halt camps that way the quays tother good luck out at sea alan i do think youll have more joy of it than i the next few weeks pile em up in heaps kit lewrie said offering his hand to his longtime friend and thankee for a hellishgood run ashore that i will and youre welcome cashman said with a smile easier and more relaxed now though what a staid family man suchs yerself is doin makin a right meal o things is beyond me or praps tis been too long as a family man and all youre corrupting lewrie assured him youre corruptible cashman hooted why i like you so well damn those drums youd think even theyd like some peace and quiet a bit o shuteye fare ye well ye tarry ol whoreson you too you old rogue lewrie bade in hearty return and then they became formal doffed their hats and bowed away in congй to their separate commands lewrie made the last cable or so to the quays where he could whoosh out his relief to still be living the warehouses and houses had seemed more than usually ominous he stood in the dull rain and peered about for a boat suddenly distrusting himself alone aboard an island bumboat with a black crew who just might favour louvertures party finally a navy guardboat ghosted past and he whistled and waved til they steered towards him going my way lewrie called to the young midshipman in the stemsheets who held a blazing torch by which to see lewrie from the proteus frigate oh aye sir come aboard curlow help the captain aboard there the boy cried seeming relieved and snapping at a jamaican sailor who served as bowman uhm those drums sir started up bout an hour ago my pardons for asking sir but what does it mean it means lewrie intoned once he had gotten settled upon a thwart that a whole hurricane of shit is about tcome down on this place younker and thank your lucky stars youre in the navy and not ashore when it does and the jamaican bowman chimed amen sah to that chapter seventeen the coffee was rich and savoury hot as the hinges of hell and laced with firstpressing sugar lacking only milk to make it perfect but then hms proteus did not run to nursing cows and lewrie had never cared for sheep or goats milk and that was all they had up forrud in the manger one lean bullock due for slaughter in a day or two for a taste of fresh beef a sow with six piglets one bedraggled and shorn sheep and a nanny goat along with about a dozen egglaying chickens and their few hatchlings were all the ship could boast it was a grand morning to lean against the aftermost windward bulwarks of the quarterdeck right aft near the taffrail and the flag lockers and greet the day with the first pewter mug of coffee relishing the brisk coolness of postdawn the beginning of what promised to be another of those sparkling days at sea there was just enough wind to make the ship lively and bedew even the quarterdeck with bursts of spray with the slightly choppy wavetops curling and creaming with catspaws and seahorses frankly every morning since proteus had departed portauprince had been delightful the coffee and cocoa beans and sugar bought from cashmans friends was a piquant spice to early rising not one of lewries favourite things about being in the navy this standing to dawn quarters but the habit had been drilled into him long before as a prudent precaution in peace or war no matter which sea one sailed or how rare the encounter with an enemy warship was reputed to be beg to report sir little midshipman grace piped up doffing his hat the first lieutenants duty and there are no sails within sight sir very well mister grace lewrie said with a nod and a final sip of his strong coffee my compliments to mister langlie and hes free to stand the hands down from quarters and pipe them to breakfast aye aye sir little grace replied eager to be the conduit between commission officers lewrie thought he was shaping well for a lad whod come aboard with his father and grandfather before the mast at sheerness just before the nore mutiny though small he was lithe quickwitted and eager to learn to excel at the rare opportunity for a shoeless lad from the fisheries and mudbank dredgings of the nore to become a midshipman some day a royal navy officer with a commission of his own lewrie had been shorthanded after he had to cull the crew of mutineers was grateful for the graces support while retaking the ship and there had been a mids berth open the graces had lost their own fishing boat and had scraped by on charity and the odd daylabourer berth aboard a friends boat before taking the kings shilling out of penury and desperation so far lewrie had no reason to doubt his hasty decision he idled over to the helm sat his mug down on the binnacle cabinet and studied the chart with the sailing master mr winwood the sailing master squinted muttered under his breath as he counted then bent over to place a tiny x on the chart bout midway twixt cuba great inagua island in the bahamas and mole saint nicholas on saint domingue sir winwood speculated in an offhanded way two hours run offwind and well be well in the windward passage isle of tortuga is about six hours sousoueast on this mornings wind captain once the hands have eat mister winwood well tack and charge down toward tortuga til midday say lewrie decided the winds a touch more northing to it today does it hold we may tack again and reach almost north towards great inagua cover a goodly portion of the area and take a peek into the caicos passage as well and i am of the mind to see into the mouchoir and silver bank passages too tis one thing to stand offandon on close blockade but it may be more productive to roam a tad farther afield aye sir leave the small craft to our luggers and cutters but the large ships will be ours mr winwood said the brightness of his eyes the only sign of amusement or joy the laconic older man ever evinced to others fair winds and deep water then for most of the day sir i will for the space of it breathe much easier perhaps even caulk a bit mister winwood lewrie pretended to scoff heavens where is your famed industry flown then held in reserve sir for more trying circumstances winwood insisted i assure you sir i do not flag in my zeal for accuracy or never mind mister winwood lewrie said with a sigh expecting that should they be in active commission together for ten years jest and winwood would never be mentioned in the same breath mister catterall you have the deck lewrie said turning to their third lieutenant he took one last look at the gundeck as the artillery was tompioned and bowsed snug to the bulwarks a final peek aloft at the commissioning pendant for the wind direction then went aft and below to his own breakfast shore bread butter and jam a proper twoegg omelette with two strips of bacon and some grated cheesedone firmer and fluffier to his liking not the runny frog fashionand lewrie was sated once the tack to the sousoueast was completed he thought there would be bags of time to idle with a cup of hot chocolate and a new chapter in one of his books perhaps even one of mr winwoods naps he speculated twixt then and clear decks and upspirits at seven bells of the forenoon then noon sights deck there the faint cry came wafting down sail ho off th larboard quarters boxing the compass in his mind lewrie frowned in puzzlement at that news only slowly rising from the table to don one of his cotton coats the wind was more noreast by north and proteus was now closehauled on the starboard tack steering norwest by north for a ship to be sighted astern of her off the larboard quarter would put her down to the souwest of them how could they have missed her earlier unless she was bound north from the windward passage astern of them at dawn or he also supposed beginning to smile in anticipation she had rounded cuba by way of the old bahama passage south of great inagua and was sailing sutherly deck there two sail off th larboard quarters thud went the marine sentrys musket butt on the deck midshipman o th watch sah come mister catteralls duty sir and midshipman grace began to say i heard it too mister grace run tell mister catterall that ill be on deck directly and he is to ready the ship about aye aye sir grace yelped with excitement scuttling out in a twinkling to scamper up to the quarterdeck and relay his orders before lewrie could get to the quarterdeck the bosuns calls were shrilling and proteus thundered to the drum of feet as the crew came up from below officers and mates were calling for order readying them to wear off the wind and head souwest leaving the evolution in capable hands lewrie took a telescope from the binnacle rack and went aloft up the larboard mizen shrouds to just below the catharpings to weave his limbs about the stays and ratlines for a quick peek he saw what he thought were two schoonerrigged vessels close together the rake of their masts and the slant of their batwing fore and aft sails putting him in mind of americanbuilt schooners heading sutherly for certain according to the arrow of their jibs and main sails pointing in that direction they were well hulldown with only the upper parts of their sails showing so far schooners were wickedfast but he grinned once more off the wind though unless they hoisted crossed yards a frigate with its acres of sail and a long waterline could run them down once it got a bone in its teeth placed as they were with proteus to windward the schooners had nowhere to run or beamreach where they could use their famous speed beating up near the eye of the wind was out for proteus was already there he shut the glass and scampered down as lt langlie issued the final orders to wear the afterguard who tended the mizen had little need of an officer in the rigging to daunt their work it couldnt be that yankee doodle revenue clown dye think lt catterall whispered once they had fetched the schooners hullup after a hard hour of sailing offwind one schooner chasing another he mightve gotten lucky sooner or later anyone may all cats are grey in the dark old son lt wyman softly replied diff rent colour scheme to these i think do they part catterall continued dont go borrowing trouble wyman countered looking shocked at the notion of two disparate chases to run down lewrie paced away from them out of earshot the dread of the schooners haring off on widely different courses had already occurred to him and he didnt wish to hear such either the word was the sire to the deed like causing the worst to happen just by saying it out loud or wishing on the wrong star the schooners had hardened up on the wind a bit to use all the power of it they could now they bore just a bit east of south but on that course theyd ram aground near mole saint nicholas on the north arm of saint domingues bay did they stand on that or run into one more british blockader and have to shy away were they smart lewrie fretted one might bear away souwest angling for the jamaica channel and the other to put about and sail for cuba s eastern tip why they were still together he could not fathom for it was the obvious ploy he could only catch one of them and had already determined that the cubabound one would be the easier prey he could cut the corner on her and fetch her up whilst the other stood a poor chance of sailing past saint domingue without being taken by another royal navy patroller but here they both were clinging to each other as if glued or chained the one astern slightly slower than her consort there were about two miles between them now and proteus was within two miles of the nearest and god help em if theyre more yankees lewrie thought still rankled by the wild goose chase that trumbull had run them the idea of wasting an entire day in pursuit of a brace of idiots would be galling maybe ill flog me one lewrie imagined rather happily for an example to the others he began to pace head down and his hands clutched in the small of his back unable to stand and wait any longer forrud along the larboard gangway all the way to the forecastle and back as if by pacing he could walk proteus closer to them floggin a seaman called making lewrie wonder if they were of the same mind did these schooners turn out to be callow americans summat carried away there er mainsls floggin lewrie raised his head and peered at the far chase sure enough her mainsl was now winged out and flapping like laundry and she sat flatter on her bottom instead of being heeled over so far and in his quickly hoisted telescope he could barely espy a scurry of activity on her small quarterdeck even a pair of antlike figures ascending the shrouds to rerove either her throat or peak halliard he swung to see what the trailing schooner was doing and found her standing on still on courseno by god she was falling off the wind a bit to run nearer her consort as if she would come alongside and aid her what in the world he muttered puzzled even more proteus now loped nearer the pair of them almost within a long gunrange and lewrie quickly strode aft to his proper place among his officers on the quarterdeck mister langlie well try a ranging shot from the fore chases he snapped once there at the centre of the hammock nettings if anything else well put the wind up em aye sir mister catterall a ranging shot aye aye moments later after much fiddling the starboard pounder gave out a sharp bark flinging a ball with the quoin completely out from underneath the breach to stretch the guns reach lewrie could see that roundshot as it slowed at the apogee of its flight then dash into invisibility once more as it descended there was a splash a slim tower of water that rose from the waves as the shot struck about two cables short of the trailing schooner oh damme lt langlie cried not again the schooner had hoisted an american flag ill not believe it til i stand on his damned decks lewrie vowed stand on and reload aye sir misrable pusgutted poxy sonofa lewrie grumbled the pounder yapped again and this time the roundshot struck within a cable of the trailing schooner a third try with the quoin in this time and six pounds of iron struck short and skipped several times like a flat rock being shied across a pond to slam home with a thud flinging a small burst of dust paint chips and splinters huzzah pound her til she strikes no matter who she is the far schooner was still sloughing along her mainsl bagged out and flogging even with the mainsheet drawn snug she too hoisted an american flag making lewrie wonder if he should continue firing into them surely this would be a nasty diplomatic incident if they truly were yankee doodle ships but why had they run so long even after proteus had hoisted her own colours an hour before could an entire people a whole race be quite that stupid there came a fourth shot from the bow chaser and another strike twixt wind and water smashing in part of her low larboard bulwarks and caroming through a rowboat stowed amidships in a cloud of splinters lewrie eyed her through the telescope once more mine arse on a bandbox theyre havin a melee yonder he gasped take a look theyre fighting mongst themselves those thatd strike and those thatd fight sir lt langlie wondered aloud ah there go her main and fore sheets and their flag halliard shes struck cease fire there cease fire lewrie bellowed sir do you close on the far one and take her under fire when in range chasers only rest of the gun crews are to ready a boat for lowering aye sir langlie responded mister sevier keep your eyes on thisun sing out does she renege and try to escape the near schooner quickly flashed down the starboard side and the far one still not repaired quickly neared the bow chaser fired once more finding the range almost at once and dropping a ball closeaboard her waterline and down came her american flag too briefly replaced with the french tricolour that had barely been twoblocked at the peak of the halliard before being quickly lowered and allowed to trail over the schooners taffrails in sign of surrender well definitely lower boats for thisun mister langlie and a marine boarding party lewrie instructed feeling his chest swell in triumph still puzzled it must be said but triumphant the schooner astern is underway again mister langlie sir midshipman sevier cried attracting their attention shes following us with her flag rehoisted curiouser and curiouser lewrie muttered rubbing his chin fetch us to mister langliefore we end up in portdepaix do you keep thisun under our quarterdeck sixpounders and carronades just tkeep em honest aye sir for long minutes the frigate and schooner wallowed together a cables distance between them as the labourious process of hoisting up swinging out and lowering ships boats off the crossdeck timbers was carried out men from the larboard guns and gangways were ticked off for a boarding party along with half the marines all under arms hoy lewrie called across with speakingtrumpet what ship are you comment was the reply and a rather snippy one too oh frog lewrie groused quel navire ici cest loiseau un marchand the songbird lewrie translated aloud but a merchant ship mine arse there must be an hundred crew aboard her her sides are pierced for at least eight guns vous кtes le menteur sanglant vous кtes un privateer he bellowed across vous кtes le prix а moi he could feel the surgeons mate the french exile mr durant wince near his side your french is remarkable capitaine durant all but tittered good enough tcall him a bloody liar lewrie said with a grin and a shrug of haplessness outside his native english whats privateer in french privateer sir durant informed him unable to hide his mirth i believe zat is where it came from ze french capital he caught my drift then lewrie chuckled before he turned back to watch more warily as his boats thumped into the songbird and his boarding party began to clamber over her rails yankee schooners passing to windward of us sir midshipman sevier pointed out drawing lewrie to larboard with his trumpet hoy the frigate thankee sir a man in a masters coat said as the schooner let fly her sheets to slow and luff up this is the bantam ten days outta savannah yon french bastard took us off the berry islands two days ago who do i owe thanks to end vis ze preposition tsk tsk durant muttered hms proteus captain lewrie commanding lewrie shouted over then turned to durant my french his english it seems but what can you expect from our recently departed colonials stood up to us bold as a dog in a doublet he did bantams master was shouting flyin our flag with an american doin all the talking for em im machias wilder by the by soon as you can hogtie or chain up yon french bastards id be that proud to stand ye to a stiff drink captain lewrie and i would be more than happy to accept captain wilder probably has no palate eizzer durant lamented no cognac only raw corn whiskey i mus warn you capitaine oh dont poormouth corn whiskey mister durant lewrie said throwing his head back to laugh it has its own charm once you get accustomed i wish to thank you as well capitaine for ze extract of ze chichona durant went on vis gods help ze four bottle will suffice i wish to ask zo will we be back in portauprince so i may purchase more from your mysterious source cant guarantee anything mister durant but does fever break out among us well make every effort zat is all i may ask sir forgive my intrusion durant said doffing his hat and leaving the quarterdeck odd damn feller lewrie thought as he watched him go gloomy as anything competent though we can only hope the captured american trading schooner snugged her sheets once more and began to ghost away upwind out of proteuss business for the nonce the royal navy didnt put much stock in capturing a privateer lewrie told himself as he paced along the lee rails facing his prize taking a national ship a warship counted for more and the payout from a prize court was much higher because a warship was usually purchased into the navy for reuse privateers though well worth a pittance for each gun aboard along with the head money for every crewman noted in her musterbook before capture there might be more if the privateer had transferred cargo from earlier prizes into her own holds and that got sold at auction but most of the time taking one was hardly worth the trouble which way why he decided privateering thrived so openly most navy officers didnt want to risk their precious bottoms inshore to chase them back to their lairs and would let three privateers sail past if there was a chance of taking a richladen merchantman or of winning an honourable fight with an enemy man o war that was one explanation for why french privateers operated so boldly in the caribbean and why it seemed that the dozens and dozens of british warships had such abysmal luck in catching them but this loiseau or songbird would fetch them something to show for their efforts he could greedily speculate the return of an american merchantman to their control might just result in a reward of some kind too something beyond this captain wilders generosity for restoring his livelihood to him something official from the united states government once they found a consul at kingston or deck there the lookout called down from his rolling swirling perch high atop the mainmast as proteus lay fetchedto sail ho fullrigged ship four points off th larboard quarter a frigate oh no lewrie muttered climbing up the mizen shrouds once more his telescope slung riflefashion over one shoulder youre not in sight ya cant have a penny of em whoever you are not enough tshare as it is once settled securely he unslung his glass and extended it til he had a shaky view of the new arrival sure enough it was a threemasted fullrigged ship heading almost bowson towards them from the proud cant of her jibboom and bowsprit that hobbyhorsed closer and closer from the thickness of her crossed yards and lower masts she did look like a frigate but whose he slung his glass again and scampered back to the deck with a bit less decorum than a proper captain ought to display trying to hide his anxiety as he peered over at the french schooner mister langlie is that prize of ours well in hand yet he snapped her crews been disarmed and fettered sir and is now under guard by a file of marines the efficient lt langlie replied ive placed mister catterall aboard her as prizemaster with towpenny the bosuns mate as his second and midshipman adair and twelve hands to get her under way sir if those choices meet your approval that is captain perfectly then lets get under way ourselves and ready the ship to meet yon frigate they may have sent a man o war north with a clutch of privateers tkeep an eye on them and their prizes once under way sir well return to quarters and someone tell that captain wilder over there tstand well aloof of us if things go wrong aye sir langlie replied without a qualm at the thought of impending combat deck there the lookout shouted anew at strange sail is a frigate shes hoistin colours american well whyever not lewrie said making it a humourous gripe to disguise his own qualms and ease his crews as well everyone else has hey but it may be a common ruse in these waters we will still get under way just tbe sure all hands langlie began to cry another hour with the sun beginning to lower in the west and hms proteus was nearing the stranger boldly standing towards her with gunports open and all national flags hoisted ready for battle if the strange frigate was lying but with a query in that months private signals also flying aloft the frigate stood on towards them as well with her ports shut and angling a bit below her bows to the westward as if to cede them the wind gauge and the traditional advantage pacific of em sir lt langlie commented to sail alee mmmhmm was lewries chary opinion of that rather a bigun aint she lieutenant wyman noted my goodness gracious she must be a fortyfour gunner oversparred though mister wyman sailing master winwood pointed out with much too much aloft you midshipmen take note under all plain sail her masts are as tall as ours when flying royals mark the length of her yards as well under a sudden hard press of wind shed not get those reefed in safely she may very well be an american frigate tis a common mistake ive seen from yankee yards my word perhaps shes a fiftygun fourth rate wyman opined finally spotting the second upper row of closed gunports painted black to match her bulwarks instead of the white of her lower gunwale the yankee doodles built some twodeckers during the revolution but i never heard of them serving lewrie felt prodded to contribute dredging up socalled intelligence from his advisories mostlike i believe they rotted on the stocks before launch their new construction plans may call for twodeckers but did they need hulls on short notice they might have razeed one before completion and outfitted her as a large frigate by god but she is big though he thought daunted by the idea of having to fight her with a twodeckers much stouter lower timbers and deck beams she might be able to carry pounders below and even pounders on the upper gundeck razeed ships are rarely successful though mr winwood droned on for they tend to hog at both ends from the weight of their guns and without the thick upperworks of a proper ship of the line theres not enough linear support to prevent it a long cruise or two is about all one may expect before theyre due a serious and prolonged refit in our own navy weve experienced such failures as signal hoist sir midshipman nicholas interrupted i make out this months private signal so she is a yankee lieutenant langlie said managing not to sound much relieved at that news shall we stand down from quarters sir close the ports but ill reserve judgement til i hear them speak us mister langlie lewrie demurred not til i hear a nasal yankee twang we will let her close us though aye sir and there goes any government reward for retakin bantam he sourly imagined not with a yankee frigate to escort her away my god damn the big american frigate sailed past alee of them taking advantage of the windshadow from proteuss sails to reef in and reduce canvas then rounded up and tacked once in clearer air she was well drilled and handled belying any slurs on yankee seamanship and seemed handy despite her great length and the greater freeboard exposed to the wind from her higher sides under mostly topsls and jibs as if accomodating the smaller british ship she angled up to within a cable alee and abeam at last this is his brittanic majestys frigate proteus lewrie called first through a speakingtrumpet captain lewrie and whom do i have the honour to address sir the united states ship hancock captain joshua kershaw howdedo captain lewrie i see you been busy hancock lewrie thought smirking despite the occasion sounds like masturbation aye hes a yankee right enough not downeast more like the carolinas or virginia which connexion reminded him too much of his wife making him hunch his shoulders and wince to dismiss such idle interruptions buy me a drink captain kershaw and ill boast most immoderate on it lewrie shouted over done sir well met and lets fetch to chapter eighteen captain joshua kershaw us navy was a hearty older fellow a tall bluff and stout man in his fifties and in his youth might have been a most handsome and impressive physical specimen his waistcoat strained over a rounded abdomen and his thighs were as thick as standing rib roasts his jowls were round and he wore a white sidecurled wig that was much too small for a head that large yet he appeared elegant and well turned out though lewrie did find the american navy uniform a bit too like the french to suit him the turnbacks lapels collar and cuffs of kershaws dark blue coat were frenchstyle red as was his waistcoat nicely trimmed with gold lace and gilt buttons his breeches were dark blue though not french red or the usual white such a fine ship sir captain machias wilder off the bantam kershaws other supper guest exclaimed for at least the tenth time in as many minutes on their abbreviated tour of the hancock as he looked over the sumptuous decor of the greatcabins aye yere fortunate sir tbe appointed into her you are indeed captain kershaw lewrie agreed keeping professional appreciationnigh aweto a minimum just goes tshow what american knowhow can do capum lewrie wilder boasted as a cabin servant took their hats and swords i pity the french frigate that tries tcross hawse with her wilder by contrast was a wizened little fellow dressed in somber black ditto a civilian suiting and eschewed a cocked hat for a narrowbrimmed thimble of a thing much like what lewries marines of late were issued wilder was a downeaster a very brisk older classic yankee from connecticut with the stereotypical nasal twang and fast speech that the london stages so delighted in twitting unlike most folk he wore grizzled grey whiskers andfrom the way he had pranced about all but stamping his feet and clapping hands in paroxyms of wonder on their abbreviated tour of the shiphad made lewrie think of him as a shorthaired terrier puppy like to soil the deck if he got any more excited for a poor old man from south carolina i spose i am lucky at that captain wilder kershaw said with a proud and pleased simper sit gentlemen sit well have us a preprandial before our supper is ready he steered them to some wingback chairs done up in red leather and nailheads and puttered about at his cherrywood and brasstrimmed wine cabinet lewrie shot his cuffs settled the tail of his handsome new cotton dress coat and crossed his legs at the knee surreptitiously eying the greatcabins measuring worth again he was impressed there were good figured carpets on the deck atop a painted canvas covering of a solid colour despite the artillery bowsed to the ports it was an elegant place agleam with wax on the overhead deck beams and wainscotting the furniture was mostly cherry or oddly pale washed oak and was awash in brass coinsilver or gilded fittings on one bulkhead in the diningcoach was a portrait of the ships namesake the hancock of revolutionary patriot fame lewrie dimly recalled that he had done or said something in the large way but the circumstance escaped him this kershaw was obviously not so poor as he bemoaned he decided this was the baronial suite of a rich shipowner or merchant trader in honour of our guest captain wilder well partake of a good englishmans favourite claret kershaw announced turning back to them with a decanter in one hand and three stemmed glasses nested together in the other he did the honours of pouring them all a brimming glass wilder went along though a little irked that stronger spirits such as cornwhiskey or neat rum were not served to your rescuer captain lewrie kershaw proposed capum lewrie wilder enthused before tossing his wine back in one neat slug lewrie hoped for his sake that it would be a short night captain wilder is right ya know captain lewrie kershaw said as he topped them up once more i was fortunate in getting orders to hancock all our major seaports raised subscription money to build or buy suitable ships for this french fracas had i depended on waiting for the charleston georgetown or beaufort ships tbe built id still be running up and down the banks of the ashley or the cooper like the joke thats told back home bout the old boy whos flatbroke if indiamen went for a shilling hed still be running up and down the bank cryin why aint that cheap man of your reputation though capum kershaw wilder scoffed tbe left on the beach when the united states needs evry experienced man o war man why it helps that most of the really experienced men were of age in the revolution kershaw chuckled too old now to strap back on the harness i was only a midshipman in only served in our old continental navy til and then resigned my commission to be first mate aboard a privateer that would have paid better for certain lewrie said after a sip of his wine kershaws claret was of a piece with jeanpierres wines at portauprince hellishgood and more exciting too made my fortune by true sir kershaw replied booming for a moment with a burst of laughter your royal navy tied us up in knots fifty ships in the old navy and i doubt more than three were in our hands in any shape to sail by the end of the war burned or took or blockaded the rest so long they rotted at their moorings in our ports or in france privateers though we could always get to sea and have a high old time of it always find hands when no oned go aboard a ship o war quite true too captain wilder kershaw allowed diff rent now i take it lewrie asked now that your nation is all but at war with france cant beat em off with a stick sir kershaw boasted down below new hampsire of course our southern states are a bit more hot for it than others like some of your neighbours captain wilder its our ships the french are takin like mine a few days ago captain kershaw wilder grumbled squirming a bit in his chair as if mildly stung or twitted its our trade and livelihood theyre harmin were all in it together north and south the coasts and the overmountain folk most of our skilled officers come from above virginia do you see captain lewrie kershaw explained though georgia and the carolinas have thriving ports and build a fair number of good ships that far from the centre of power though this new swamp they bought up on the sly then turned into our new capital what theyve named washington city oh a power of money made on that transaction by people in government who knew about it beforehand or had a hand in enacting the placement we poor southerners feel a bit overlooked worse when the capital was in new york or philadelphia the terrierlike capt wilder all but bristled even further away and wasnt it a whole pack o marylanders and virginians who profited from it he slyly asked laughing to prove that he meant nothing by it all of which mystified lewrie it sounded like a visit to a country house for a weekend and gossip about neighbours one had never laid eyes on or a family spat only slightly alluded to before strangers damme do they dislike each other that much he had to ask himself though north against south middle against both backwoods versus the low country interests and is that exploitable should we be at war with em in future their states dont sound that united never saw much of your part of the americas captain wilder lewrie assayed sandy hook a time or two perhaps a stroll ashore in new york im more familiar with savannah and charleston in fact my wife is from the cape fear country well i never captain kershaw boomed out which prompted one of those pleasant interludes wherein family names and places were exchanged a sport in which this captain kershaw took particular delight he had dealings with some chiswicks who still were seated around wilmington and surely they were carolines kinfolk by then kershaws steward appeared and announced that supper was ready so they repaired to the diningcoach and sat down to a fine meal of fresh turtle soup a roast chicken panfried in corn meal grilled turtle steaks and airdryed leatherbritches pod beans for a remove washed down with a decent hock or a bordeaux kershaw apologised for the lack of a fish course but there was little chance of catching anything fresh with his frigate bowling along at twelve knots or better most of the time the catch would have been jerked to flinders by the time they got it on deck caught us a shark tother day wilder hooted didnt mean to really hopin for sea bass dolphin or snapper but a shark makes good chops my first mate calls it sweet revenge ha ha and dye know the very first thing those french sonsabitches did once we struck was turn up their noses and heave it overside perhaps they had no crиme fraоche in which to poach it captain wilder lewrie snickered bsides the french may boast of being a maritime nation but they arent all that bold at sea maybe they thought the shark had dined on their poor sunken cousins way they go after poor helpless merchantmen maybe they are kin tsharks but too proud and arrogant tturn cannibal wilder rejoined quickly raising his glass to clink against lewries youve seen no french warships as yet captain lewrie his host enquired no sir my advisories tell me that there are very few true warships about lewrie answered though hundreds of privateers i wonder sir perhaps we might break the old strictures and share some uhm shoptalk after all ill be cruising north of saint domingue and i gather that your frigate will be going south after we part thats so sir and an excellent idea kershaw agreed keepin a close eye on me for the rest o my voyage captain wilder hoped aloud you may count on my support sir kershaw assured him i wonder sir lewrie said putting down his glass do you have any qualms about acting in concert you and i should we meet with a french warship i uhm kershaw waffled we are ordered to cooperate in certain circumstances america is not officially at war with france not yet i am not even certain that outright war is desirable if a change in their policy towards neutral shippingreturning to the status quo ante without boarding and demanding manifests and muster rollswere to result from a show of determination with the threat of force to make them change their minds well he trailed off and waved one hand in a flaccid iffy gesture before busying his hands with a wine decanter but do you encounter one of their privateers in the act of pillaging an american merchant vessel a merchantman sailing alone as a prize lewrie pressed irked by the mans sudden diffidence or if you met one of their privateers or warships in these waters alone then i would have a free hand to engage at all hazards and i would at once sir kershaw told him a bit more formally and stiffly than moments before but before we assemble a proper squadron in the caribbean my initial orders are to cruise to escort convoys down as far as dominica or antigua make a show of force off guadeloupe and the other french isles then pick up a convoy and escort them back as far as the bahamas before returning to boston yet lewrie said with a faint frown steepling his fingers to his lips were we to be in sight of each other and i unhindered by any strictures engage a french national ship would that allow you to cooperate in her taking would that be one of your certain circumstances captain kershaw none but a poltroon would reject a chance for action captain lewrie kershaw intoned making lewrie suspect that he had in some way stung kershaw below his personal sense of honour i doubt im allowed to cruise in concert with you we may both blockade guadeloupe for one instance but you run yours and i would run mine our areas may overlap at times but that would be all since my country is not officially allied with yours but does the chance of a fight arise then thats a different story in that instance i can see no limits on my coming to your aid or conversely refuse any aid you render should you heave up over the horizon and find my ship yardarmtoyardarm with monsieur lewrie could but nod at that cautious circumlocution and reach for his wineglass to bury his nose in it and slurp thinking it over now thats not to say that when we have more ships down here a proper squadron my orders wont get expanded to closer cooperation kershaw continued hemming and trimming as if speaking for himself and not his government this time or with enough ships we might wish to go it alone either way i doubt the french will back down and let our ships alone without they get their noses bloody first there is always a chance your frigate and mine could fight sidebyside against the french pray god lewrie chuckled after seeing her i wouldnt wish to test my metal against the weight of yours kershaw and wilder both chuckled along with him thankful for a jest to lighten the mood then youll be thankful tsee the good ol john hancock stand up alongside ye captain wilder boasted shell save your bacon and beat the french so hard theyll wet their britches at mention of her name ol johnll write somethin else large ha ha oh so thats what hancock did lewrie suddenly recalled wrote his name on their declaration of independence so bloody big and bold though a ship so well armed and well manned may never fear for her honour against the frogs sir lewrie offered extending his hand across the table to kershaw do we meet again in such a circumstance you may count on me to wade in and help you kershaw pondered that but for a moment before reaching out as well and seizing hands with lewrie to pump away enthusiastically in agreement hancock and i shall back you as well captain lewrie any british ship that we encounter in need of assistance and damn any fool in washington city whod dare say i exceeded my brief then gentlemen a toast lewrie proposed once he had gotten his hand back in usable condition to the united states navy huzzah captain wilder cheered hurriedly pouring for all good supper sir aspinall asked once lewrie was back aboard proteus and flinging hat and shoes to the wide in his greatcabins passin fair lewrie told him with a grin though id admire a brandy the yankees didnt much run to it it bein french and all probly swore off for the duration outta patriotism and find a place for this would you aspinall took the large gallon stone crock of cornwhiskey and set it inside the wine cabinet down at the bottom where it would not tip or overweight an upper shelf a monstrous frigate i tell you hellishpowerful built as stout as a norman castle back home lewrie sleepily enthused and what wouldnt i give thave a ship like her someday he asked himself as he undipped his hanger and stood it in the arms rack near his desk in the daycabin though id change some things hancock was massive as solid as any towering ship of the line and she did mount pounders on her lower gundeck as he had suspected with an odd mix of pounders and pounders on her upper decks he put that down to the uncertain supply available in the states seaports arsenals or yards when the war came and the iffy condition of american foundries and their reliability at producing ordnance in the required numbers or ordnance of decent quality with a patriotic smirk of his own he recalled how many of the artillery pieces hed seen on his brief tour had borne stamps or proof marks from british manufacturies though not officially allied those yankee doodles were not averse to buying arms from their late enemies what had amazed him even more was the first sight of her upper deck once he had been piped aboard it was built flush what junior american officers had boastfully termed the spar deck and that deck was simply stiff with guns his own frigate and every royal navy warship he had ever seen had open waists twixt the raised quarterdecks and forecastles with narrow gangways meant only for sailtending and marine musketry spanned by crossbeams between them fit only for binding the ships sides together and as a place to rest ships boats as boattier beams the americans though had widened those gangways made hatches for companionways smaller and reduced the size of the waist open to the sky to long and narrow openings much like a merchant vessels cargo hatches and stiffened that spar deck with thicker crossdeck beams and longitudinal timbers supported by stout carline posts until that deck could bear heavy artillery as well too damn much artillery lewrie silently groused stifling one more weary yawn everything hut carronades and thank god we dont sell em those captain kershaw had seemed very proud of the fact that hancock while officially rated a fortyfour gun frigate bore nearly fiftyeight guns of various calibers and weights right down to pounders on the quarterdeck at that boast lewrie could have almost sworn he heard hancock groan like atlas under the burden at first glance the sailing masters suspicion that the frigate would hog at both ends and eventually break her back seemed an accurate premonition but down below lewrie had espied the massive knees futtocks and beams that made up her hull as thick as anything aboard a first rate flagship and the other beams those oddly angled timbers that curved up from below and continued upwards past the overhead deck like some diagonal strapping inside a wellmade wicker basket could they stiffen her enough to make her as rigid as an iron cauldron a ship immune to the eternal flexings and groanings as stresses made her abrade and weaken herself with every pitch roll or toss despite being more than sated with supper and all that wine he felt driven to sketch his impressions that moment before they faded from his mind if the royal navy could attempt some construction along similar lines with those diagonal thingamajigs he sat down at his desk and fumbled open a drawer for paper and pencils suddenly aware that his brandy was sitting on it with toulon lurking over it one curious paw raised and his nose at the edge mouth hanging open the way it did when he found a new scent mine lewrie hissed dragging it to him he took a sip then stood briefly to strip off his coat before beginning to draw toulon was intrigued by that too following the pencil end wideeyed happy the officer who brought admiralty an innovation lewrie told himself happy too the officer who provided a hint that americans were divided by sectional differences that their burgeoning new navy was rent by jealousies twixt the rich maritime states closer to the seat of power and interest and the rest who dwelled too far away to north or south even as he drew a part of his mind was composing a report that he would pen in the morning once his head cleared they have an elite an aristocracy just like us lewrie thought new york boston and philadelphia all of em related and schooled together yale and harvard wilder mentioned just like our cambridge or oxford fine republicans they are what a sham oh dear lord sir aspinall softly gasped what lewrie snapped impatient to be interrupted he looked up to see aspinall staring at him as wideeyed as toulon come down with the pox have i what is it man yer shirt an waistcoat sir aspinall mournfully told him that new cotton dress coat o yours has bled blue all over em what lewrie yelped jumping to his feet and trying to crane around his own body arms raised to see how much damage had been done he pawed at his sides trying to drag his shirt round to the front he quickly undid the buttons of his waistcoat and stripped it off to hold it up to the light well damme the thin white satin back of the waistcoat was very blue and so were the armholes shading outwards almost in a ripple pattern like a troutsplash down the sides to a paler skyblue even the front of the garment originally pristine bleached white sailcloth was now faintly stained where his coat had overlain it shirts worse sir aspinall meekly informed him kershaws greatcabins had been close airless and humid without canvas ventilation scoops even the overhead skylights in the coachtop had been closed obviously kershaw from already muggish charleston was used to perspiration perhaps even had a froggish fear of night airs and their miasmas especially in the tropics since yellow jack and malaria were no strangers to the carolinas well lewrie said at last lowering the garment in defeat it seemed like a good idea in broadcloth wool id have turned to soggy gruel hours ago live and learn i spose try and wash em but damme lewrie began to strip off his shirt too ill give it a go sir but i aint promisin much aspinall said uhm yer breechesre in the same shape sir still have white stockings do i lewrie asked feeling the need to laugh the tiniest beaten snort of sour amusement it was that or scream to high heaven ill fetch yer nightshirt sir and a basin of water aspinall before i show up on deck tomorrow as blue as an old druid aye sir lots o soap too once coolly bathed and clad in his thin nightshirt lewrie bent once more to his drawing adding curved diagonal lines atop the crosshatchings of a ships skeleton thinking that even if the matter of his cotton uniform coat hadnt exactly worked out the evening hadnt been a total loss he had learned more than he had expected had elicited some sort of promise of cooperation from a yankee captain that could in future apply to the others as they assembled a squadron he eyed the small washleather purse of coins that bantams captain had given him ј in various english french spanish and dutch specie that so far took the place of a trustworthy united states currency it was what someshould they ever come to know of it and he would be damned if they didmight call a bribe taking bantam and restoring her to her owner would involve reams of paperwork at the nearest prize court at kingston placing a value on ship fittings cargo and such to determine proteuss official reward with poor wilder paying court fees and demurrages for swinging at anchor for weeks in that port til the matter was adjudicated and his ship returned to him easier all round really for lewrie to write his report saying that in the spirit of cooperation he had surrendered precedence and possession to the arriving american frigate they had after all the value of loiseau to reckon with with eight greatguns and over one hundred privateers brought to book with head money for each along with the schooners worth as a tender to a larger ship why with any luck theyd buy her in perhaps even let proteus claim her as a tender and if they did lewrie leaned back from his artwork with a satisfied smile in full scheme with loiseau he could run the same subterfuge he had in the mediterranean when captain oн jester with a captured lugger on the genoese and savoian coasts as an innocent harbour raider to cut out merchantmen who thought themselves safe in a friendly port or as a tempting piece of cut bait trolled before a privateersmen flying a french tricolour flag looking for rescue from those horrible english bloodies he hefted the coin purse calculating in his head twoeighths of ј was ј a captains share of the bribe who knows it might just cover the cost of the ruin of his wardrobe chapter nineteen by noon of the next day hancock and bantam were out of sight in the south and loiseau was hullunder on her way to portauprince to report her capture and dump her hundredodd prisoners on somebody else and with any luck at all lewrie imagined that hms halifax and her irascible captain blaylock would become their gaolers now that she was stripped of even more guns and would have bags of room below it was piquant to picture blaylocks phyz turning purple at that news and lewrie further surmised that captain nicely who already despised blaylock worse than cold boiled mutton would be more than happy for a chance to slip him a bit of the dirty one more time and perhaps even think fondly of the officer whod made it possible again with any luck proteus might have loiseau back as her unofficial tender within the week and then they could really hit their stride the winds had backed a full point from noreastly to noreastbyeast as well proteus had loafed soueasterly after their meeting with hancock during the night closer to cape st nicholas so a beat closehauled to the northbywest could take them up to matthew town at the western tip of great inagua where proteus could once more keep an eye on both the windward passage and the old bahama passage before tacking and heading soueast for tortuga then she could slowly zigzag her way easterly between turks island and saint domingue towards the tempting mouchoir and silver bank passages where arriving french merchantmen and privateers must appear sooner or later mister langlie well stand in as close as we may to the cape of saint nicholas before tacking lewrie announced claw us out all the ground you can to weather before we come about to northbywest aye aye sir ah now that is monte cristi sir mr winwood pointed out as he fiddled with his charts at the binnacle cabinet bearing uhm souwestbywest and to the eastrd cape isabella lewrie supplied which now bears ah soueastbyeast or thereabouts i make it eleven miles if the chart is correct as to its height he lowered his sextant and fiddled with it for a moment then we are here sir nine miles offshore of spanish santo domingo twixt monte cristi and cabo isabella winwood opined and the depths shown are still abyssal first real soundings with a deepsea lead dont begin til were within the threemile limit captain three miles hmm lewrie muttered mister wyman well haul our wind and stand due south for a piecetil mister winwood says were near soundings after that we will wear and reduce sail to scud back along the coast towards cape francois and see whats stirring aye aye sir wyman said reaching for a speakingtrumpet with which to relay orders to the watch and lets hope something is out of harbour mister winwood indeed sir lewries familiar old stomping grounds about the turks islands had been nearly empty of all but local fishing boats and small traders the caicos turks mouchoir and silver bank passages glittering but barren and conversations with local boats had revealed that it was a rare day when theyd seen any sail at all such stops had allowed the purser mr coote to purchase a bonanza of fresh fish and sea turtles now trussed with their flippers threaded together and all for a song but useful intelligence was nil once we take a good long look into cape francois well head back to the old bahama passage lewrie decided aloud yankee merchantmenll be floodin south this time of year and mostlike that will be where the frog privateersll be thickest too so many of em tradin at havana and other spanish cuban ports before heading further south to the leewards ey mister winwood always a wrench to cede the windward station sir but in the circumstances the sailing master said with a noncommittal shrug as he carefully almost lovingly stowed away his own precious sextant in its velvetlined rosewood box shortest distance we mightve been better off in the gulf of gonave if theyre comin from havana lewrie griped mostlike sailing right past us or passing far to the eastrd of the bahamas and puerto rico well sir theres great risk in that winwood replied digging out another chart and spreading it on the traverse board there are reefs and shoals aplenty near puerto rico and the danish virgins and our own anegada and virgin gorda are infamous wrecking grounds and the north shore of saint thomas a rocky maze sir mr winwood used a closed divider as a pointer as he indicated the dangers sketching courses from america do they leave new york boston or philadelphia the chesapeake or even the carolinas or georgia their best course would be very far easterly out to beyond bermuda before taking a slant across abeam the noreast trades with hopes to fetch anguilla or saint martin just a touch alee of them and close to all those leeside harbours whichd put them in our antigua squadrons bailiwick then lewrie said nodding and wed never see emtil on their way back home through these waters aye sir but they cant all sail that far east and south first there must be some who trade closer to home lewrie griped witness those yankee men o war and treasury cutters convoying merchantmen here or are you saying weve been handed a bill of goods mister winwood winwood winced and sucked his teeth it was a cold day in hades when he ventured an opinion outside his own expertise it might not have been the most productive area to patrol sir how else may one explain why with over seventy or eighty men o war on the west indies station weve been so unsuccessful in eliminating the many french privateers sloth and indolence lewrie scoffed with a sour laugh so little profit in it such hard work when its more exciting more profitable to hunt enemy merchant ships and warships prowling about for such even if its fruitlessholds the greater honour and a chance tget your name in the papers back home make a great show with all the huffing and puffing by god we almost had em but for a slant o wind but well do better next time wot surely you know their sort by now mister winwood indeed sir winwood said in response very even and flat and by god was he lookin at me cuttyeyed when he said that lewrie thought trying to recall six months of bombast or excuses sail ho lewries head snapped upward to the mainmast lookouts perch where away four points orf th starbd bows the spry young topman wailed back three four sail theym sloops and luggers there and were inshore of them lewrie exulted where bound he shouted aloft through cupped hands standin north sir north hmmm lewrie mused riffling through the charts for one of saint domingue and santo domingo fishing boats perhaps out of a french or spanish port either sort theyre fair game he traced the reciprocal course back to the coast but found no point of origin other than a few coves or inlets and those were twoapenny he glanced at the commissioning pendant high aloft which was flowing to the wind now steady out of the noreast once more a point higher than we could manage goin closehauled that fits he muttered now mister winwood were you wishin to coast to the east youd have to zigzag wouldnt you aye sir a short board along the coast but a long one out to sea to make any ground to weather winwood agreed even with a sloop or lugger rig it would be an allday chore to make twenty miles to the good sooner sooner or later theyll have to come about onto larboard tack and head soueast would they not right into our range so to speak sir lewrie snickered aye sir do they not see us first and if they do their best hoped be to come about souwest and run back into whichever little harbour or inlet they left lewrie crowed and were still inshore of em and can run em down do they put about this instant lewrie went to the larboard bulwarks and looked out at the land now that proteus was within three miles or so of it and scudding along almost due west fingers drumming on the caprails thinking evaluating with a jump he was at the binnacle rack and snatching a glass then up into the starboard mizen shrouds clambering aloft up past the catharpings and onto the futtock shrouds dangling dangerously for a second or two before gaining the mizen top platform where he felt the need to pant for a bit before scrambling onto the stays and ratlines to the upper masts and crosstrees above the mizen topsl stupid stupid stupid he chid himself ya impatient sod that left arm still dont feel right mustve hurt it worse than i thought at camperdown send a midshipman next time or wyman hes a well fed look about him lately once hed levelled his glass there they were two twomasted luggers and a brace of singlemasted local sloops or cutters flying large jibs forrud and all four of them fairly big boats perhaps over forty or fifty feet overall and crammed with people incredibly tiny dark exclamation points were crammed shouldertoshoulder over there he realised braced up against their weather rails perhaps as human ballast to keep them sailing flatter on their bottoms making them faster deck there theym hullup now four points orf th starbd bows the lookout atop the mainmast forward of his perch cried deck there lewrie shouted down cast of the log now those luggers and sloops might just be about forty feet or so in length lewrie compromised at fourtyfive feet their masts should be a third again longer did they follow caribbean custom of tall masts to catch more wind in larger sails as opposed to european custom using shorter masts with longer booms and the centres of effort of the sails lower to the deck with sixtyfoot masts he could estimate that they were at least four miles out to sea did they turn and run before the wind he guessed that they could make five or six knots with the sail they already flew captain sir midshipman elwes squeaked we make nine knots thankee mister elwes good lad mister wyman hands aloft and set the fore tgallant the main tgallant staysl the middle staysl and main topmast staysl smartly now aye aye sir smartly twill be he looked aloft to the commissioning pendant once more it was a decent wind this morning a dependable clear day tradewind with a bit more sail aloft proteus could make ten or eleven knots with it on their starboard quarters as it now stood sailing almost due west theyd intersect those small craft within the hour now tget my puckered arse down from here he told himself in a silent grimace clambering down to the lubbers hole was not manly or nautical and after those uneasy twinges in his left arm he didnt quite trust himself on the shrouds and ratlines he slung his glass and took hold of a standing backstay using his right hand and leg to swing out and wrap himself around it to slideclamber handoverhand to the deck the greasy slushed stay grating twixt his knees scissored calves and along his groin with a thump against the bulwarks that he felt through the soles of his shoes he reached the deck and jumped down to the quarterdeck with an evident whoosh of relief flexing his singed fingers despite a career of callouses damme he sighed looking at his breeches and shirt now greasy with the skimmed fat from the steeptubs used to lubricate the rigging to keep it supple and the tar used to keep it waterproof at least theyre the pale blueuns no great loss no amount of scrubbing could improve that condition as aspinall had proved the last few days whenever they had caught some rainwater from the brief daily squalls they were now hopeless perhaps skyblue will become fashionable sir wee midshipman grace tittered being the youngest he was the only one whod dare youre no bigger than bait mister grace lewrie told him with mock severity and i dearly love fresh fish id keep that in mind were i you younker making the other midshipmen snigger he reached out and tipped graces cocked hat over his eyes to prove that he wasnt upset then stalked over to the helm to stow his telescope mister wyman once youve everything bristol fashion i wish the ship beat to quarters aye aye sir whoever yon bastards are well have them for dinner deck there puttin about haulin eir wind and wearin ah mister langlie lewrie said quite gaily as the first officer came to the quarterdeck noting that langlie already had his pair of singlebarrel pistols hung on his belt along with his smallsword i see youve come fulldressed for the ball good the first dance is just begun after a quick look about langlie got a sly look on his face as he said from the look and sound of it captain sir id say theyve gone past the quadrilles right to the galop and country dances or rather off to the races captain sir mister langlie sir lieutenant wyman reported i am ready to call for quarters ill take the deck mister wyman langlie asserted his right i yield with pleasure sir wyman grinned back with delight of the chase and the hunt in his eyes mister sevier to stand as acting lieutenant in lieu of mister catterall sir langlie asked he can oversee the forecastle guns very good mister langlie and call on desmond and his lads to give us a tune once were at quarters something lively i will be below getting presentable and armed dear lord sir but i suspect thatun was the battle of aughrim lt langlie who had a good ear for music exclaimed an old fight from back in king williams days just like our irish to cock a snook at us lively though you must admit lewrie replied beating one hand along in time as desmond the ships fiddler a marine drummer and a brace of fifers held forth in the middle of the waist the pipe on the hob the brides favourite and old double jigs were mixed with the derry hornpipe and fishers hornpipe as music for sailing into battle followed by jennys wedding and lord macdonald a pair of reels now within a mile of the sloops and luggers desmond and the band were well into a lively merry tune named planxty browne with the fiddler and fifers prancing the deck in impromptu dancing i prefer hornpipes langlie groused jigs reels and all are too toodly all over the shop and too many fluttry notes well so was bach and that little mozart fellow lewrie said with a chuckle mightve killed him in fact too many notes in his head and pop hmmm dye think were in good range sir i do indeed captain langlie soberly agreed then please run out the starboard battery and give them a try mister langlie lewrie bade turning formal aye aye sir mister wyman make ready thank you for the music lads but now belay run out the starboard battery creaks and groans squeals and screeches sounded as tackle was run through wooden blocks as wood trucks and axles turned under guncarriages as they were trundled up to butt against the portsills and ports were opened tacklemen stood aside overhauling their runout as guncaptains fussed at elevating quoins ordering crowlevers for a shift in point of aim the traintackles were tautened and breeching ropes adjusted so the guns would recoil smoothly without a kink that would jerk their deadly weight aside and maim their minders one at a time guncaptains put up a fist to show readiness and their number twos leaned away from their pieces holding the trigger lines that led to the flintlock strikers over the touchholes taut and cocked on the uproll fire a seconds pause as proteus surfed and wallowed off the winds slowly rocking upright and hanging still for a moment or two her deck level to the horizon then her pounders erupted in earringing power almost as one great thunderclaps huge jetting clouds of hot gases and smoke reeking of rotten eggs and coal as the guns lurched inboard to the limits of their breeching ropes snubbing with a shock that seemed like to jerk the stout bulwarks apart and made the frigate shudder as if shed run aground the smoke was quickly whisked away by the trades to scud downwind off her larboard bows to the shore which was now only two miles away so the officers could spot the fall of shot among those boats another long seconds pause and geysers erupted from the sea tall and slender feathery plumes that hung in the sky like suddenly frozen icicles that only slowly collapsed downward upon themselves in matching circles of frothing spume drenching the targets like a torrential summer squall and making them heel and rock their wingedout sails sluiced and drowned with seawater damn good shooting lewrie commented now serve em another he ordered raising his telescope sir mr winwood whispered from his right side sir we are getting rather close inshore and we do have them abeam perhaps one point abaft of abeam you wish to harden up and stand out from the shore lewrie asked the glass still to his eye i would sir the best we have are centuryold spanish charts mister langlie a point to windward lewrie called and put some spare hands in the larboard forechains to sound with the lead aye sir as you bear on the uproll fire under a mile now lt wyman was letting guncaptains aim for themselves picking their own targets proteus shuddered and jerked anew as the pounders exploded in a stutter that ran from her bow to her stern wyman paced the waist of the ship between the starboard and the idle larboard batteries between the foremast and main urging guncaptains and more experienced senior quartergunners for a steady pace to keep the guns firing two rounds every three minutes hit lt devereux the marine officer cried from among his men on the starboard gangway above the guns well shot you lads youve hammered one of the luggers and shot a mast clean away the gun crews cheered even as they tugged and hauled even as ships boys scampered along the deck with their leather cases holding sewn powder cartridges from the risk of premature explosion even as barrels were swabbed out by the rammer men as number twos held leather thumbstalls over the touchholes to prevent backblast from the lingering shards of cartridge bags and smouldering powder embers cartridges were rammed down roundshot was thumped firm against the charges as ventpricks were inserted into the touchholes piercing the bags to spill powder so the jets of fire from the flintlock strikers and the priming powder in their pans could ignite the charges in the blink of an eye when the trigger lanyards were jerked up the deck to the ports the guns were rolled one more time as proteus swung her bows seaward one point not only to flee the risk of hidden rocks and shoals but to close the range on the small craft and cut them off from running any longer to the souwest with the wind more on the starboard beam it was harder to run the guns out but the fireblackened muzzles jutted through the ports and began to wave and elevate in small jerks til the guncaptains were satisfied as you bear on the uproll fire the damaged lugger was struck again a heavy ball smashing into her larboard side and spilling people into the sea a onemasted sloop in the lead of their gaggle was hit near her sternquarters and jerked to the impact rolling half on her starboard beamends before rocking slowly upright but beginning to settle as she started to fill stern down but still sailing like a wounded goose too good to last sir the other two are breaking free from their partners lt langlie pointed out his arm outstretched to the right and a bit aft ducking astern of us lewrie took a long look at the damaged sloop and found it low in the water aft its transom almost level with the sea it wouldnt last long in his estimation nor would the crippled lugger whose lone surviving foremast could not drag her to freedom fast enough two points more aweather mister langlie and engage the two off the starboard quarters lewrie decided those twoll be there when weve dealt with these damme right plucky of em to tack and cross our stern theyll be within carronade shot in a minute well open with the stern chasers and carronades ready the afterguard perhaps theres more fight in the frogs than we thought sir lt langlie commented lewrie raised his telescope once more and eyed the boats that were aiming to beat soueasterly and run aground where they might on the spanish shore of santo domingo before proteus could kill them whatever they are mister langlie they aint french lewrie said after he had gotten a closer look at their foe theyre black evry man jack of em from what i can see the surviving sloop and lugger were within four cables as they completed crossing the winds eye and began to gather speed for their run to safety and lewrie could pick out details the men aboard them were armed and wore a semblance of uniforms cocked hats military or civilian but all decorated with the redwhiteblue cockade of revolutionary french jacobins white breeches and colourful sashes into which pistols swords or cutlasses were jammed some wore shirts and dark blue french uniform coats or coats with no shirts some had to make do in waistcoats and no shirts but with crossbelts and brass breastplates in the middle of their chests there were a few in full uniforms and plumed hats wearing officers swords and dragoon boots or breeches without stockings or any footwear but all bore muskets with their bayonets already affixed closer still and lewrie could see kegs of what could only be taken for gunpowder kegs at which some rebel slave soldiers chopped with hand axes and tomahawks while others worked at flints and lint to kindle sparks and flames whilst others held oiledrag torches to be damn my eyes mister langlie i do believe those bastards mean to blow themselves to kingdom come and us with em he shouted as the two small craft fell off the wind even more and gathering speed began to turn toward proteuss stern quarters attacking the frigate marines to the quarterdeck mister devereux man the swivels and the carronades smartly now lewrie urged feeling a bit of panic mister winwood a bit more speed tget clear of em mister wyman a broadside would do right nicely bout now coming sir directly sos bloody christmas lewrie muttered under his breath too fearful of the suicidal slaveys to care about captainly behaviour dem fools got de nutmegs sah coxn andrews breathed in awe as he appeared unbidden but welcome at lewries side with a brace of pistols and lewries trusty ferguson rifle and its accoutrements dey law deys laughin about two cables distance now the small boats surging up to carronade range and lewrie could hear a chant that nighshriveled his stones above the rumble of guntrucks and the drum of running feet eh eh heu canga bajнo tй canga moune de le canga do ki la canga li what the devils all that lewrie demanded to know don know sah obeah stuff maybe andrews replied crossing himself for luck and blanching a touch pale some sorta witchie workin voodoo voudoun deir creole tongue on the uproll fire wyman screeched at long last not a full second after the guns erupted before the spent gunpowder could even begin to wing alee there came a huge tongue of yellow flame off the starboard side amid a titanic gust of wind that flung a peasoup fog of reeking bluewhite smoke at them stinging hot and shot through with splinters chunks and burning embers in that stentorian blasting roar shrieks and screams could be heard things went wetly plop against the deck where they stood aah thats part of a hand lt langlie said in a shuddery voice as he recognised the object get it overside and lets sink the other one lewrie snapped nauseated by the sight the smoke of the broadside and the blast was clearing very slowly and the second one still lived somewhere out there there sir marine lt devereux shouted pointing at a vague outline it was the onemasted sloop rounding up within a cable off proteuss starboard quarter chasing her six pounders and swivels aim aft lewrie shouted gathering up his rifle marines put em down eh eh heu heu canga bafio tй marines cock your locks level by volley fire canga moune de le canga do ki la lewrie took aim the action at full cock and squeezed the trigger of his ferguson the butt slammed back into his shoulder with an emphatic reassuring thump his target an officer in a blue coat over ebony skin and ragged field workers trousers clapped both hands to his face as the bullet took him in the left cheek knocking his ornate cocked hat off as he left his feet and flew backwards into the tillerman and some sheettenders the stutter of a volley of brown bess muskets followed a second later and half a dozen blacks were cut down their cheering and shouting stopped swivel guns mounted in the metal forks atop the taffrail and after starboard bulwarks barked and yapped spewing handfuls of grapeshot or caliber musket balls in a deadly hail that chopped down even more then the pounders loaded with roundshot and stands of grapeshot began to fire slamming so hard that chunks of hull and bodies were flung skyward almost burying the sloops bow in its own wave as it was bludgeoned to a stop canga li a torch was lowered to an open powder keg the bearer bleeding from a dozen wounds but still chanting and screaming at them before more musketry could bring him down he smiled and shoved the fire into the keg canga li his dying comrades gleefully urged him duck lewrie shouted along with twenty others not one hundred yards astern in proteus wake the sloop went up in a boil of flameshot smoke smashing in every transom window and taffrail lanthorn glass pane a huge feathery pillar of water arose bearing up planks and oars bits of mast seared ropes and gobbets of flesh to patter down amid a foetid shower of seawater the people on the quarterdeck got back to their feet mumbling and working their jaws tugging at their ears from the assault on eardrums and sinuses a few even bled from their ears and noses astern there were now two roiled circles of white spume with only a few identifiable bits of wreckage to be seen dont spose theres much point in looking for survivors is there sir lieutenant langlie said it wasnt a question he looked stunned no i doubt there is mister langlie lewrie replied his own ears ringing like bow bells with an outward calm he did not feel he cranked the breech of the ferguson open bit off a cartridge then shoved it ballfirst into the breech and cranked it shut he primed the pan and closed the frizzen now lets come about and see to the other two boats sir place us up to windward of them and well use the larboard battery no closer than two cables to em quite sir langlie enthusiastically agreed carpenter to sound the well and inspect the transom from the bilges up water carries the power of explosives better than air im told lewrie prosed on slinging the rifle and turning to andrews to take his doublebarreled pistols to load and prime them too we may have a plank stove in below the waterline from that aye aye sir anyone hurt lewrie called out yer bowels still work his still shaken crew began to chuckle even if more than a few were shifting their sloptrousers and clawing at their fundaments as if their bowels had worked just hellishfine thankee ah still living mister winwood lewrie chirped aye sir never seen the like sir winwood marvelled about as much as winwood could sound surprised by anything why they must be mad as a hatter to immolate themselves like that drunk as swine anything tkill oppressors morelike mister winwood lewrie speculated still working his jaw popping his mouth open like a fish to fully restore his hearing they tried tsink us or die tryin they came out here deliberately then do you think sir runnin arms and powder along the coast lewrie said shrugging in perplexity the roads must be horrid with all those mountain ranges ashore as bad as italy we were told that this louverture was out to invade spanish santo domingo we might have put a spoke in his wheel for a few weeks by intercepting these madmen perhaps the other two boatsll tell us more do we take a prisoner or two wouldnt put it past em lewrie imagined though sent em out to sink a blockading ship lured us in was it deliberate jesus proteus wore off the wind again to due west well clear of her previous encounter reduced sail and ghosted down on the two crippled boats in the short space of time since they had maimed them one of them the smaller sloop had sunk and only her bow bobbed upright in the sea with a few wailing survivors clinging to it the lugger was low in the water and people were bailing with hats pails and their hands others trying to rig a jurymast from a pair of oars atop her plankedover forepeak attempting to spread the leach and foot of her after lugsail to the wind by extending the oars out like cats whiskers with the tack of the sail shinnied up the foremast as the frigate neared the lugger wailing could be heard and her crew augmented by survivors from the sunken sloop took up arms and stood trembling but game some levelling their muskets at an impossible range pass the word for surgeons mate mister durant lewrie said he speaks good french those slaves once got their work orders in it the larboard pounders were run out and ready the carronades and pounders manned as were the swivels devereuxs marines stood along the larboard gangway with their muskets and a boarding party in wymans charge had cutlasses slung in baldrics over their shoulders more muskets and pistols in their hands and boarding pikes ready to deter any more suicidal charges a point more alee mister langlie lewrie ordered and their frigate veered even closer to the lugger less than a cable sir winwood warned mister sevier a shot from the bowchaser no shot across the bows hull her if you can the pounder on the forecastle yapped and its ball hit short but in line with the lugger to carom off the sea and bound across her deck at headheight scattering the closepacked blacks and killing a couple of the taller or slower ones ah mister durant lewrie said turning to the surgeons mate since my french is so execrable perhaps you might try to make them see reason and surrender no onell be harmed tell em ill even let them go once weve inspected their boat and had a chance to interrogate them they dont stand a mouses chance else ill set em ashore unarmed and ill sink the boat but theyll live were not grands blancs were british i will try capitaine durant vowed stepping to the bulkwark bonjour mes amis he began and slanged a long palaver in frog reddition came a defiant shout at the end of that jamais zey do not believe us capitaine he say we are all blancs french or british it is no matter zey die before zey surrender do they have powder aboard like the others sir langlie cautioned mister wyman you may open upon the lugger lewrie ordered one broadside only from the main battery guns damn the fools as you bear on the uproll fire proteus roared and shook flinging defiance for defiance and a new chorus of screams erupted as the lugger was shredded at such short range as the smoke of the broadside drifted down alee and past that lugger she was revealed as a total wreck her mast was gone and the juryrig up forrud was wiped away along with the men who had tended it the luggers starboard side was shot through like a colander and she heeled with her rails awash to the sea of her crew there might have been fifty or sixty men crammed aboard before that broadside now her decks were piled with offal with the dying and dead wallowing in their own lifes blood in a coiling mass of entrails and body parts there were some in the water splashing about and trying to swim or grab some flotsam on which to gasp and keen now well closeher lewrie snapped before she goes under mister wyman a boarding party to search her for papers anything mister langlie lower a boat for mister wymans party aye sir langlie parroted though not sounding happy fetch to sir stand down the larboard battery but keep the swivels and sixpounders manned about a cables distance hmmm lieutenant wymans boat had barely reached the stricken lugger hed barely had time for a very quick snatchandgrab from her decks before she slipped under in a welter of bubbles and foam and sank forcing those few members of the boarding party whod gained her rivened deck to scramble for their lives as she rolled over and sank sternfirst lewrie could see that the lugger had been big enough for a coachtop and some accommodations below her main deck with a canvas spread over a cargo hatch between the stumps of her masts lieutenant wyman waved then smiled showing that everyone in his boat was uninjured and returning safely wyman steered well clear of the blacks swimming near his boat though with some of his hands levelling their muskets or pistols at the bobbing heads ho heres one sir able seaman inman cried from the entryport pointing down over the starboard side which was now alee of the winds lewrie peered over to see the muscular mahoghanyskinned man in the water below the boardingbattens and manropes treading water and bleeding from the mouth and a scalp wound upon his shaven pate in the water his skin was as shiny as a seal pelt dont got a fuse and powder keg wif im does e yeoman of the powder foster cracked mister devereux have your marines fetch him here he might talk to us lewrie decided ill have more need of your services mister durant now weve gotten thisun into a more amenable mood from lewries vantage point high above the man did seem shattered a pathetic pleading halfgrin on his features he even raised his hands upwards in supplication inman waved him up leaning out the entryport come on you son of a whore up ye get come on we wont eat ye safe see the man nodded querying as if he could not believe his luck pointing to his chest as if to say who me before thrusting upward from the water and grabbing the lowermost wooden batten in one hand then a manrope in the other slithering and scraping along the barnacles at the waterline wincing with the pain but scaling the side as proteus rolled and wallowed the boardingbattens first vertical then easier to climb thats th way mate up ye get therell be a cup o grog in yer gullet in no time laddy inman encouraged reaching down as the man got near the lip of the entryport ware ware lt wyman shouted from the boat as it neared a pistol in his hand awkwardly dragged from his waist belt knife canga heu the survivor screamed whipping out a long cane knife secreted in the back of his ragged trousers and slicing inmans throat almost to the spine with a single backward slash wymans pistol barked and the black stiffened back arched and blood spouting from his mouth as he was lungshot before letting go and falling back into the sea with a large splash followed not a moment later by inmans body that fell into the same target of roiled water freshkilled their lungs still full of air after a deep dead plunge they both wafted to the surface almost arminarm god almighty damn lewrie breathed shuddery and faint from surprise and shock get him aboard get inman back aboard now no use capitaine mr durant sadly said what ze noir did to him durant sucked his teeth and shook his head i dont give a damn i wont have him in the water with that treacherous murderin bastard lewrie raved sheets and halliards and braces were flung overside safely belayed about the pinrails and a dozen hands sprang down to the chain platforms with quickly fashioned loops of line to snag inman and bring him alongside then coil them about his body and haul him back up to where others could take hold of his arms and lay him out on the gangway lewrie went forward his head like to burst with rage but his feet as benumbed as if he were walking on pillows until he stood over the body removing his hat in reverence as the people parted and made way my fault my fault my bloody goddamned fault he thought full of hate for himself inman leaked a great puddle of water from soggy slopclothing leaked from that huge ghastly rent in his throat my fault he croaked having to swallow hard and cough before he could talk further wanted prisoners information damn em shouldve known my fault nossir couldnt a known bosun pendarves countered raising an agreeing chorus from the hands nearby savages someone else spat ya cant show mercy coz they dont know what it is aint christians like usuns another growled they sunk us wif at powder theyda slit our throats quick enough mr neale the masteratarms supposed aloud lets kill em all all that still tread water no lewrie shouted well leave em let em sink swim or be taken by sharks as god wills twas my fault that inman died our only casualty well give him a proper shipmates burial tonight at sunset and ill not have his welcome to heaven ruined by more murder amen sor landsman furfy said tearyeyed and sniffling hat in hand and leaning on his mate the leaner and shorter liam desmond we know the rules now lewrie announced close to tears himself irritably dashing at his eyes with a coat sleeve we know how they mean to fight and how much they hate us we ill not be mistaken the next time next time well stand off and shoot em to kindling survivors bedamned that elicited a guttural growl of agreement mister durant sir would you and mister shirley be so good as to prepare able seaman inman for burial but of course capitaine we will see to him durant vowed wiz as much tender care as his own mother men assist me please lewrie turned and stalked aft to the quarterdeck cramming his hat back on anyoldhow and slamming his fists together his rage no longer quite so aflame but still scouring himself for a fool er captain lewrie sir lieutenant wyman called scampering after him excuse me sir but thought you should see this sorry if i shot too late sir never killed a man before not up close artillery aye but never with a pistol tried to warn him i i know mister wyman lewrie said dont blame yourself i was at fault for letting him aboard when i shouldve known better uhm this musket sir wyman said getting back to point and this cutlass and this sword look at the proofmark and these makers marks stamped into the blades sir bloody hell american lewrie barked utterly nonplussed by this evidence theyd sell arms to rebellious slaves surely if they succeed their own plantationsll go up in flames their slave ownersll be massacred muskets a copy of a french charleville arsenal poor made sir perhaps surplus from their own armys armories the blades who knows about those sir wyman said shaking his head in disgust northern foundries lewrie noted not so many slaveowners in their northeastern states sir wyman spat so perhaps what happens after theyre sold dont signify to them as long as a profits made most of their ironworks are in the northeastern states but lewrie trailed off with a sigh god this is hellish business mister wyman i know it hurts the french in saint domingue for rebel slaves to obtain arms and later our enemy the dons in santo domingo but the massacres that follow we could tell someone sir wyman suggested in a soft voice an american consul a senior officer let them lay an official protest perhaps we could mister wyman rather we should and we will just as soon as dammit lewrie vowed someone will pay for this chapter twenty morning found hms proteus ten miles norwest of cape st nicholas with her crew in a sombre mood following seaman inmans funeral two days before even a run close inshore of cape francois the port still held by the surviving whites of north province on saint domingue and a lively exchange with a harbour fort had not lightened the mens gloom inman had been popular a cheerful and hearty worker and one of the best voices in the focsles offduty chorus a dabhand at the hornpipe competitions between larboard and starboard watch and a wag of no mean skill when imitating ships officers midshipmen and mates behind their back or below in the privacy of the messdeck lewrie was up early before dawn to watch the hands at their labours at the change of watch at am today was the day that the bears were broken out and dragged across the weather decks the heavy and roughsurfaced weighted sledges that sanded the planks harder than the small bibles men on hands and knees normally used to keep them newwood pale especially round the larboard entryport where inmans blood had fountained and the rebel slaves blood had erupted some vinegar poured on the stains before using the bear might even completely erase them someday it was predawn with only the palest streak of lighter sky to the east astern and everything else buried in a hazy bluegrey just enough light to see from bow to stern with a gibbous moon still low on the horizon a few bright stars still aglow aloft the galley chimney fumed lazily as the mens oatmeal gruel was boiled up and coffee for the officers was kept warm and shore bread was toasted for them lewrie sipped at his mug of coffee savouring the stoutness of saint domingue beans savouring the blessed windy coolness before the tropic sun burst over the edge of the sea to fry and roast them for another day hat off clad only in breeches and shirt he could almost feel a faint chill as the trades whisked up the frigates stern to waft her westward towards cuba once more good pickings round cienfuego in the last war he thought why not just stand on both sheets aft old captain lilycrop and took more than one prize there in on west roundabout jamaica s west cape and into kingston to wood and water the people need a joyful diversion god knows and deck there a lookout shouted down lights ashore on the larboard quarter looks like signals lewrie set his mug down on the binnacle and returned to the aft rails with a telescope hearing the scrubbadub and hiss of the bibles and bears cease as he spied out the mysterious light proteus was enough west of cape st nicholas to see into a long inlet that led to the britishheld harbour of mole st nicholas high hills on either side of the inlet the island that formed the northern shore were blueblack and forbidding at predawn only a tiny lighter shade were the waters leading inward there were the usual wee winks of lanthorns ashore in windows but there was also a brighter light no a pair wheeling about each other first in one position then another mister wyman lewrie called his glass still to his eye i think you said you were familiar with those new semaphore towers back home did you not aye sir the second officer replied sounding unsure know how to read them well just a bit sir wyman admitted but ive a book below in my cabins he morehopefully concluded do you please have it fetched then sir in the meantime lay us on larboard tack abeam the wind aye aye sir ahem excuse me captain marine lt devereux said clearing his throat ah mister devereux lewrie brightened turning to face him didnt know you were on deck sir an early rising for one who gets all night in and doesnt stand watch the freshest coffee and the coolest part of the day sir the marine said with a modest shrug and a wave of his own mug of steaming coffee he too was dressed in only breeches shirt and waistcoat at that early hour twas originally an army signal system captain to alert the coastal garrisons should the french invade cross channel one that our local army leaders didnt deem fit to share with us i gather lewrie posed a touch sarcastically what a surprise i know a bit of it though sir if i may lewrie gave devereux the telescope and ambled back over to the doublewheel and binnacle to retrieve his coffee before it got cold a moment later up came midshipman elwes with lieutenant wymans book and both officers began to confer with a deal of what the devil and goodness gracious commentary a deal more pageturning and some scribbling on a slate theyre not signalling to us sir lt wyman reported at last cant even see us way out here i expect from what i and lieutenant devereux may construe all that waving is meant for vessels still in port the nubbin captain is an order for all ships to begin loading supplies and prepare to extricate our garrison to pull out lewrie puzzled they seem to be hardpressed by a slave army sir and things are going against them the signals say that the troops ashore are at the outskirts of the town that theyve been driven back from the outer entrenchments and mole saint nicholas aint that big sir more like a hamlet than a thriving seaport lewrie nodded and pursed his lips turned away and took another sip of coffee pondering his options he turned back to them at last mister wyman ah mister langlie there you are stow away the holystones and vast scrubbing well let the deck go hang just this once theres a problem ashore fetch the ship to for now and pipe the hands to their breakfast once theyve eat well shorttack our way inshore to the port aye sir aspinall just some toast for me lewrie bade the long inlet leading to mole st nicholas was frustrating in the extreme the first part ran roughly soueast an easy sail across the wind for the first few miles until the hills and the taller inland mountains blocked the trades and created one contrary zephyr after another leaving proteus chasing patches of sea that were still catspawed by wind and each weakly wafting from the opposite direction of the last one then came the noreast leg directly into the trades meaning a short board to either larboard or starboard no closer to the wind than sixty degrees the channel narrowing and shoaling so that each attempt at making ground to the eastrd was measured in mere hundreds of yards to the good after each pair of tacks and the worst part were the sounds coming from shore the faint echoing sputter of musketry now and then and the thin crump of field artillery that tolled like minuteguns at a steady pace someone needed them soonest but it took forever to get there and as the day progressed and the land and sea warmed the thin skeins of smoke from ashore drifting upwards through the jungley tree line went vertical and the winds died away to nothing damme well row her into range lewrie snapped pounding his fist on the caprails overlooking the waist mister langlie do you lower the ships boats and pay out towing cables sir theres a rowing boat coming offshore for us midshipman grace cried i can make out army officers i think through his glass lewrie could see at least two dozen rowboats already working round the few ships in harbour there was a brig and at least three large schooners a small and dowdy threemaster swinging at single anchors hired ships and lightly armed thinly manned by civilian seamen with little experienceand even smaller willto turn their popguns ashore it was all they could do to stow supplies belowdecks as fast as they could be stripped from the canvascovered piles near the piers and the beaches topmen aloft hand all sail well row her in barepoled lewrie shouted to his crew uhm the depth sir mr winwood pointed out coughing in his fist how shoal does it get sir lewrie growled turning on him id not get closer than two cables from the docks sir else we run her into the mud mole saint nicholas cant dock deepdraught ships they anchor out in the roads ive hands in the chains heaving the lead already sir just wished you to keep it in mind captain damn lewrie spat making winwood wince at the profanity he was a sober hymnsinger very well mister winwood two cables no more our guns can range a mile inland and from the look of things what targets we engagell be a lot closer than that just beyond the town morelike keep me apprised i will sir the rowboats were hoisted off the midships tiers then swayed out with the maincourse yard as a crane and slowly lowered into the water with snublines to check the swing and sway it took forever it seemed by the time even his own gig had been wetted and the boat crews began to scramble over the side to man them bosun pendarves had gone hoarse from shouts and curses pass the word for the master gunner mister carling lewrie ordered and once the master gunner had come up from the magazines to the rare privilege of the quarterdeck lewrie pressed him at once we may have to fire over the heads of our own troops mister carling dear lord sir carling said grimacing and glancing ashore i know lewrie said in sympathy for the great risk of killing british soldiers with a graze or a short round quoins full out breeches resting on the carriages for more loft but with the foe so close to the town what about reduced charges perhaps saluting charges so we dont throw iron half a mile beyond could do that sir but thatd be indirect fire captain mr carling countered rubbing at his closeshorn scalp and no way to know the fall of shot could waste a deal of shot and powder and not ever hit a godd a blessed thing sir like firing mortars he had stammered noting that the prim mr winwood was nearby it worked for a frenchman who sank my ship at toulon back in lewrie said with a snort and his first real moment of humour of the morning bastard spotted fire for his guns from a bluff if the army could signal us were we long or short on target or not so its their responsibility not mine lewrie could not help but conjure towing cables are ready sir and were prepared to haul away thankee mister langlie carry on smartly now so if they could signal us would it work mister carling aye sir i spose but carling answered rubbing his scalp more vigourously the sixpounders on the forecastle and here on the quarterdeck main battery twelvesd not be able to elevate in the ports high enough the carronades lewrie insisted theyd elevate even with a full charge they dont throw much more than four hundred yards if we loaded with reduced charges but with starshot barshot and chainshot grape or cannister atop those excuse me sir but the rowing boat with those army officers is now closeaboard lt wyman interrupted very well mister wyman lewrie snapped exasperated with all the demands upon him pipe em aboard dust em off and trot out a tot o rum for em i dont bloody care uhm aye sir proteus began to move as the pair of army officers appeared at the larboard entryport and took the hastily gathered salute from a muchreduced sideparty lewrie hoped that they were unfamiliar with proper naval custom and wouldnt know that theyd been slighted he was more concerned with the helm and the gelatinously slow creeping pace that the towing boats could generate a fiddler and fifer atop the roundhouse overlooking the beakhead began to give them a tune to slave by as the hands dipped their oars and strained redfaced for a yardbyyard advance captain lewrie lewrie said announcing himself major james sir captain ward the older officer replied doffing his hat damn fortunate you were bound here sir we need a bit of help wasnt bound here just saw your signalling in passing once in range i intend to swing abeam the town and anchor with springs on the cables so i can throw shot thatd be most welcome captain lewrie most welcome indeed thoughtis a hellish risk dye see major james told him we are now entrenched not an hundred paces beyond the farthest houses on shore and the blacks are perhaps one or two hundred paces beyond now that proteus did not make her usual noises under way nor had the windrush to mask sounds lewrie could hear the boomboomboombboom of voudoun drums far back in the forests much louder and closer than any hed heard at portauprince do your artillerists signal me it could be done lewrie said well now sir i doubt my brigadierd wish to risk our men in such a way major james objected im to wait til the cuffies are running down the piers then to keep them off you as you row away lewrie said with a snort you say you need my support but how bad are things ashore lord sir major james said with a sigh fanning himself with his hat two days ago we held a perimeter nigh a mile inland only have the three regiments dye see and we thought most of the blacks were off near cape francois or down south near portauprince so we had no worries but they hit us at dawn just popped up in front of the trench works spent all night crawling up to us in the grass sir captain ward supplied looking as shaken as if it had happened this morning quiet and slow as mice they were drove us back damn near overran us major james admitted casting a leery scowl at his junior officer for sounding as if he had the wind up lost nigh on two whole companies sir capt ward continued despite his superiors look of distaste but he was one of those boy captains not a day over sixteen whose parents had bought him a set of colours early enough in life so he could live long enough to make a full colonelcy if not become a general before retirement or inheriting some share of the estate back home in england field pieces overrun as well i suppose lewrie commented we are short of artillery yes but major james objected some more you wish my help or not sir lewrie snapped then lets be about it an artillery officer aboard proteus here another ashore to relay the fallofshot using your signal flags or whatever it is that you do so theres no errors in communication perhaps a chain of signallers from your trenchworks right back to the docks i suppose we could captain lewrie major james said frowning dont know much about artillery myself all that woolwich bangbangin im infantry dye see he drew himself up with a touch of pride wounded pride lewrie suspected that he was forced to reveal himself as just another drone who knew how to shout squarebash on parade and look good in scarlet and hadnt learned a thing in his climb from subaltern rank outside of his own narrow interests and his promotions bought not earned but you could arrange lewrie prompted flexing his fingers on his sword hilt in frustration might be best did you have your people do the signalling and use your own system captain lewrie major james said at last your guns your fallofshot he tossed off a helpless shrug dont have a system for such as this lewrie quickly growled i can send a midshipman or two ashore but only to aid your people well uhm damme sir you wish help i didnt shorttack in here six hours worth o hard labour then put my people rowin so hard theyd herniate just twatch a rareeshow you refuse ill put about and stand back out to sea and bedamned to ya and naval captains outrank army majors lewrie told himself i am almost sure of it on your head be it captain lewrie major james demurred no on some overeducated woolwich graduate be it lewrie countered knowing how redcoat officers demeaned the bluecoated artillery corps tradesmen who could not buy a commission but had to learn work and think before the woolwich arsenal passed them for field duty sure enough major james treated lewrie to an smirk of sudden understanding and began to bow himself away now who do i send ashore lewrie wondered after doffing his hat to the soldiers and turning away to see to his ships snaillike progress midshipmen sevier and nicholas were the oldest and smartest the rest aboard too young too impressionable and not yet challenged by independent command away from the ship none of them were really and who do i stand to lose who dies at my command chapter twentyone i think were ready for a try sir the scruffy and worried royal artillery officer a captain wandsworth announced at last after several minutes of arcane scribbling and muttering over a slate with his assistant a younger lieutenant arcs windage elevation range charge to be used et al had been figured and refigured very well captain wandsworth carry on if you please and devil take the hindmost lewrie said hands in the small of his back and his fingers crossed for luck hands well clear of actual responsibility then lewrie nodded to mr carling on the forecastle the man stiffened and winced so openly that lewrie could almost feel the fellows lips stretch as he stepped clear of a pounder chasegun and yanked the trigger lanyard the pounder yapped spewing a great cloud of smoke from a barrel elevated higher than normal and rolled back on its truckcarriage slewing a bit out of true as it recoiled the solid shot soared into the sky visible for a splitsecond as it slowed at its peak of apogee and dashed downward may work after all captain wandsworth muttered taking off his cocked hat and running his fingers through his sweaty hair did we fire direct well your decks are only twenty feet above the sea and our trenches are about fifty at ten degrees elevation as high as oned risk an iron barrel with a full charge without bursting hope no ones standing up over there else hell have his head took off lewrie wasnt quite sure that wandsworth had addressed him directly so he raised one eyebrow and said hmmm not to mind just nattering wandsworth said waving him off ah there fifty yards beyond our lines no effect still shame we dont have colonel shrapnels bursting caseshot sir the lieutenant told his superior timed fuses spread some grief no way to graze solid shot true wandsworth responded lost in his arcane work whilst he scribbled some more on a slate cant lay em waste like a game o bowls this way what guns we have on the linell have to see to that droppin heavy things on their heads wheee plop cowpats wont even bounce ill warrant this wont do any good after all lewrie asked put the wind up em captain lewrie tbe sure wandsworth replied with a fiendish little grin who knows you hammer away at a wall for days before you effect a breach im thinking grapeshot or cannister might get a rise out of em saturate an area stead of an aimed shot at high angle where a miss is as good as a mile try one of your carronades lovely things the lieutenant said in praise and envy we never get to play with such now do we increase the charge by a dram or two sir stand of grape on its wooden wad base uhm thats eighteen and onehalf pounds total shot with one cannister atop lewrie shared a look with his lieutenants langlie and wyman like watchin witches stir their pot lewrie thought one more eye o newt or no two wolf teeth or was it three no no four drams at the least but wandsworth quibbled they fussed with one of the quarterdeck carronades pushing the regular crew out of the way whose members looked to lewrie for a clue as to whether they should submit or not all he could do was toss them a shrug and let the army piddle now then wandsworth announced would you be so good as to let fly my man whats your name harper blaze away guncaptain harper blaze away the pounder carronade never meant to be fired at such high elevation lurched backwards on its slidecarriage wood rails groaning and smoking despite the grease and slush slathered on to prevent too much friction and slammed into the crosstimber at the rear that stopped the recoil you know sir the royal artillery lieutenant said was it up to me id come up with some sort of snubbers some screwjack compressors to increase friction and reduce recoil well its a thought ah wandsworth mused before raising his telescope to peer shoreward for the signalmen well damme one hundred paces beyond our troops and roughly on target well well i make out saturation twenty yards wide oh how wondrous did it do any good lewrie asked once more a fall of hail twenty yards wide and perhaps twenty deep sir grape and cannister shot wandsworth crowed i should imagine thatd take down young trees captain lewrie knock more than a few heads to flinders here lets load up all your carronades and give it a go half a dram more loose poured atop the bagged charges and a single cannister atop a stand of grape to each barrel the lieutenant pointed out spread of two degrees twixt guns yes thatd share the grief about direct the aim of the guns back there whilst i see to these two wandsworth ordered aft lewrie stuck in feeling he had to contribute something ive my pocket compass the lieutenant told his senior but of course you do dear boy wandsworth chuckled with a bit of luck and twoandonequarter pounds of powder per barrel we could duplicate these results with the sixpounders hmm once you find the proper angle ill send a man forrud to the forecastle and he may lay those guns as well lewrie offered oh no sir wandsworth countered once weve found our pace way back here aft lewrie supplied again feeling more than useless now ill send scaiff to deal with those wandsworth bulled on thats his name dye know now lets see hmmm this time all four pounder carronades on the quarterdeck lit off almost as one the heavier charges punching the air with an earthquake of sound and a mountain of roiling smoke making the ship reel and shiver for long minutes with so little wind in the harbour the gun smoke lingered only slowly drifting away to let them see the flags waving from the end of the longest pier think we caused a stir that time wandsworth said thought i heard screamin couldve been the shot fallin oh well now dear me what hath we wrought they had stirred up something suddenly there came a crackle of musketry brisk and urgent volley fire followed by a rolling platoon fire up and down the central lines punctuated by the louder barks of field guns piles of smoke began to build in the forests like the thunderheads of a seasquall hanging thick and greasygrey under assault dammit wandsworth spat stirred em to rise up and charge stung em to move or die im hoping half dram less and the same loads if ya please he shouted to the gunners ready stand clear by battery fire this time they could hear faint and thin screaming a moment before there had come the chanting that chilling canga bafio tй shout then the screaming the musketry and cannonfire went on for a minute or two before fading away to a last few sputtered shots damn this smoke wandsworth said coughing and fanning the air with his hat as if that would disperse such a gigantic pall proteus was almost completely wreathed with it ah heres something well im damned charge broken shift right range same easier do we haul in on the springs mister wandsworth lewrie reminded him how far oh bout ten or fifteen degrees i spose wandsworth mused conjuring on his slate and squinting at it and the shore mister langlie haul in the stern springline aye aye sir deck there a lookout called down ships off the larboard beam workin into harbour five sail fullrigged ships first is a seventyfour lewrie walked over to the larboard side and raised his telescope but it was hopeless proteus was so swathed in spent powder that everything beyond fifty yards from the deck was lost in a bellicose haze what flag lewrie shouted upwards ours sir leadin seventyfour is halifax know her topsl patches the lookout confirmed did your brigadier send a small boat for aid he asked of the royal artillery man mightve but there hasnt been enough time surely wandsworth replied acting irritated that his work on his slate was interrupted perhaps not lewrie had to agree thinking that a small boat would barely have had time to reach portauprince and certainly could not have stirred up a rescue force that quickly just this set of guns at first wandsworth decided til we are shot in and then well use those up yonder the quarterdeck carronades then the forecastle guns lewrie prompted whatever you say wandsworth muttered bending over a carronade barrel with a triangular piece of metal graduated in arcane marks and bearing a plumbbob challenging this no dispart sights and no elevation screws on your long guns just the carronades do it by guess and by god oh well ready by battery fire it went on for hours under a blazing hot noonday sun and well into a sultry airless afternoon the guns hammered and bellowed and spewed til even the officers bound kerchiefs over their ears to protect their hearing proteus reeked of sulfur and rottenegg fumes and trickled tendrils of spent powder gases at her planking and seams as if being smoked belowdecks to drive out the rats and insect pests the swabbuckets and firebuckets were filled at least twice with water and the carronade and pounder crews were rotated every halfhour with reenforcements from the mainbattery men so those relieved could search for a patch of shade and sluice down a tot of water panting for a single breath of clean air shift left shift right on the springlines reduce the charges and loft murder shorter add a dram or dramandahalf and spew grape and cannisters of musket balls sometimes solid roundshot in conjunction with a slightly greater range all around the perimeter of the town wherever there was an upsurge of enemy activity the guns were there shot sleeting into the dense forest and undergrowth to the point that whenever the smoke cleared a bit they could see whole new clearings whole new glades that their guns had made by god captain lewrie dye know there just might be something in this indirect fire twaddle wandsworth chortled clapping his hands together over and over in glee theres an article in it for certain some mathematics to be worked out so others could copy what weve done but hmmm dare i imagine it could someday be termed the wandsworth system hey usin naval guns as mortars and usin flag signals tmask ones own batteries woolwich arsenal tbe sure but perhaps the royal academy too for the science of it scuse me capum foster the yeoman of the powder said as he scampered past the first officer after receiving permission to be on the quarterdeck weve run clean outta madeup cartridge bags for the carronades an sixpounders and fired off almost three whole kegs o powder haveta break out another capum outta the second tier how long lewrie asked nigh deaf and having to lean close to hear what the fellow was saying quarter hour mister bess the gunners mate says sir very well thankee foster captain wandsworth hey captain wandsworth lewrie repeated louder and nearer heard ye the first time no need tshout dye know captain lewrie wandsworth said cupping a hand to his ear even so we have to cease fire out of made bags and low on powder uhm sir foster added still on the quarterdeck most likely for a breath of air himself lewrie didnt wonder were low on grape and cannister too mighty low we can make up stands from the twelvepounder supply but itll take some time capum low on grape and cannister too lewrie shouted to wandsworth yes i could use a glass wandsworth shouted back beaming exasperated at the bobbing grinning fool lewrie took hold of wandsworths slate and wrote his message down oh silly me wandsworth barked yes well cease fire and the silence after so long was almost painful lewrie took out his watch and opened the face shocked that it was nearly pm an hour into the first dog he looked forward and saw a ships boy smeared with powder stains from serving as a monkey to a forecastle gun peering into a sandglass and ready to ring the ships bell to mark the hour someone may have done that for all the time theyd been firing for all lewrie knew to his senses everything rang by then mister coote lewrie called down to the waist to the purser how is the scuttle butt bone dry sir ive sent hands to break out another cask and the rum issue was cancelled as well should i aye fetch it up bosun be ready to pipe clear decks and up spirits soon as the water and rum are on deck lewrie bade make it a full measure mister coote no sippers or gulpers how long sir wandsworth asked licking dry lips at least a half hour sorry tsay lewrie told him we are not supplied with grape and cannister the way your army guns are you have what half your caissons full of that half of roundshot about that yessir wandsworth agreed we carry about oneinfive loads were almost depleted hmmm perhaps once yon twodecked ship of the line comes into harbour i should go aboard her then wandsworth decided gesturing with his chin towards halifax and her small convoy that had yet to get within three miles of an anchorage the wind as it always did under a long cannonading had been shot to a funereal stillness and rd rates were nowhere near as agile or as weatherly in light airs as a frigate it might be sundown before halifax hauled up within hailing distance much less gunrange she may not be able to anchor as close inshore as us lewrie speculated might be better did we borrow grape and cannister from her she mounts twentyfour pounders those should fit into our carronades but once the sixpounder stands and bags are gone ah i see wandsworth seemed to agree and did scaiff and i shift our flags as it were wed have to recalculate our figures for the height of her gundecks distance from shore and all i agree better we borrow than let that ship supercede us captain lewrie uhm sorry i have to ask captain wandsworth but once its dark what do we do lewrie wondered aloud ah well hmmm wandsworth said tugging at an ear as if trying to get it to work properly once more now thats a poser if i do say so cant see signals from my men or yours after dark we could fire blind since we know were striking beyond our trenchworks but do the samboes pull back to rest wed be wasting our shot in harassing fire might keep em awake might not and then once they come at our troops in the morning we would really be low on effective shot lewrie grimly concluded well it may be moot after all sir wandsworth said with a weary grin surely those ships coming into port are here to take us off another day of this and well have everything loaded aboard the little ships and wont leave the samboes a torn shoe or dirty sock one may pray lewrie said nodding with hopeful agreement he was weary too even from mostly standing and pacing about on his feet for hours he strode over to the larboard side hands pressed against his kidneys to ease the kink in his back arching it and lifting his feet high and shaking his calves to spur life back into them and ease the slow burn in his soles signal sir midshipman grace yelped from halifax our number up anchor and make way sir shes spelling out there was a much longer string of code flags to interpret clear way to quays sir grace puzzled out slowly damme do we move mister wandsworths calculationsll be off and hed have to start from scratch lewrie muttered mister grace hoist unable followed by am engaged and we can only hope all of this gun smokell tell em what weve been up to a new cask of water was fetched to the main deck the marines with muskets and fixed bayonets and fife and drum ceremoniously got the gay redandgilt rum keg to the forecastle belfry and the people began to queue up for their tots chattering and laughing along as the merry tinkle of the string of copper measuringdrinking cups jangled she repeats her first signals sir mr grace said turning a worried eye to his captain knowing that there was bad blood between captain blaylock and lewrie already well explain once in hailing distance lewrie said though feeling that he was in for a cobbing no matter what he did boomboomboombboom the drums began once more now that the punishing guns the ones that struck from nowhere had ceased a shot sounded a thin and weak crack from a lone musket a desultory spatter of two more a gust of gunfire then the field guns began to bark anew there was a massive shout a challenging roar that caused a blizzard of musketry in reply and then things fell silent again flags waving wandsworths deputy scaiff pointed out need us again i expect my my wandsworth grieved wearily your midshipman fellows runnin off inland scaiff said who what lewrie snapped returning to the starboard side what the devil hes takin a horse into the woods curious scaiff said yawning that rum ye issue captain lewrie could a poor soldier get a taste im dry as dust aye go forrud and tell the purser you want a tot lewrie muttered intent with his spyglass on the doings ashore wondering why young nicholas would go dashing off towards the trenchworks so suddenly water sir aspinall offered coming onto the quarterdeck god yes thankee lewrie said turning to accept a tall mug and drain half of it in one gulp fresh batch sir good an cool from the orlop quite fine quite fine lewrie answered sighing with contentment and relief his mouth had been as dry as a private soldiers a man whod been biting off cartridges all day toulon s hiding down below i take it down in the midships hold sir like he always does poor ol puss the guns scare him somethin pitiful aspinall chuckled the sound of gunfire in the forest erupted again louder this time more sustained and urgent the volleys of tworanked soldiers on top of each other as fast as they could load the artillery crashing a steady tolling up and down the lines and men were running down the short streets of the town to the docks men in red coats bearing weapons but bearing the corners of a series of blankets too jogging along as fast as they could with wounded thirty or so sentries who had been guarding the diminishing piles of stores were massing led by a swordwaving officer who looked very much like that major james who had come aboard earlier and were trotting doubletime the other direction into the forest lewrie lifted his telescope to see better and found a figure in white sloptrousers and a short midshipmans coat hatless waving at him it was nicholas and his right sleeve and hand were smeared with gore he clung with his left hand to a side of a blanket which bore a wounded man and tears could be seen coursing down his face in terror or grief andrews lewrie roared for his coxn away my gig to shore mister nicholas is coming back wounded hurry man hurry awn de way sah furfy sharp you two bastids ovah de side lewrie felt glued to the ocular of his spyglass wishing for a stronger one ruing his cheapness on his last shopping trip to london chandlers nicholas trottedno staggeredcloser to the end of the longest pier four soldiers still bearing their burdento which he clung with a whitefaced death griptil they reached the very end and laid it down midshipman nicholas sank to his knees beside the blanket then lifted the man in it taking the wounded fellow by the chin to try to shake him back to consciousness pointing out towards their ship it was midshipman sevier as pale as death row like the devil andrews theyre both wounded lewrie bellowed his innards churning to think that his decision might have gotten both lads maimed or killed eh eh bomba heu heu canga bafio tй the enemys chant seemed a cruel mockery chapter twentytwo boats comin alongside pass word for the surgeon mister shirley lewrie shouted signallers are waving once more captain lewrie captain wandsworth pointed out hellish urgentlike do you have any cannister or grape stands remaining i think its needed something desperate very well lewrie began excuse me sir but halifax spells out up anchor and move he can go bugger himself lewrie snapped second hoist for halifax make request all your cannister and grapeshot thatll keep that pestiferous bastard busy mister grace well run and send it lewrie growled noting graces wideeyed goggling of the stir by the entryport where sevier and nicholas were being hoisted aboard aye aye sir grace gulped and dashed for his flag locker and halliards mister foster break open the shot lockers and make up charges for the guns quick as you can and keep it coming til its completely gone lewrie said wanting to dash to the entryport himself to see to sevier and nicholas things were coming too thick and fast to suit him unlike the long minutes of an evolution at sea charge yer guns shot yer guns a grizzled quartergunner was intoning to his weary crews who had set their rum rations down on the quarterdeck that priceless elixir of ease abandoned for a rare once in the face of need other crewmen who had gone forward for their rum ration had gulped it down then returned to their posts their prime moment of relaxation and jollity stolen by stern duty wandsworth and scaiff fiddled and calculated gazing heavenward and counting on their fingers muttering and whispering to themselves before reaching a mutual decision a quick trot down the deck to see to the elevation and by broadside fire the pounder long guns and the stubby pounder carronades lit off together shuddering proteus anew refogging her in a reeking pall of powder smoke and making everyones ears ring seconds later the sound of musketry ashore rose in volume crackling down the line of trenchworks like the advance of a brushfire with the crisp sound of burning twigs there was a roar of several light field pieces then a howl of human voices raised in rage or fear or glee the daft bray of a foxhunting horn to urge them on just before another musket volley samboes broke the entrenchments wandsworth found time to say tugging at his ear again and i think we just saw em out where your midshipman was wounded i shouldnt wonder mister langlie you have the deck lewrie said going to the gangway where sevier was being hoisted inboard easy with him lads mr shirley was saying already clad in his butchers apron of light leather for surgery his sleeves rolled to the elbows the grey armyissue blanket was lowered to the deck already half soaked in gore and mr shirley sadly shook his head for a moment as the loblolly boys transferred seviers body to a carrying board an eightman mess table with rope straps to bind the patient to it and other rope straps for lifting shirley looked up at lewrie and grimaced in sadness with another wee shake of his head sevier had been savaged by thrusts from bayonets or swords the cloth and lace of his shirt the flap of his white breeches were cut open baring the hideous wounds beneath cloth stained bright red over purpling puckers and slashes his face was a newpaper white his eyes unfocused and his breath a faint labouring wheeze with small flecks of foamy blood on his lips mister durant mister hodson see to mister nicholas while i see mister sevier below shirley said getting to his feet and leading the loblolly boys and their burden to the gundeck ladder what happened mister nicholas lewrie asked the terrified boy who stood and shuddered all but blubbering as blood dripped from his injured arm ssamboes sir nicholas replied between chattering teeth hundreds of em broke the line they were in the trenchworks with knives and bayonets killin our people left and right and laughing fit to bust sir jemmy he him and the army signallers against a dozen and him with just a pistol and his dirk they got that far behind our lines sir before i saw one of the signalmen running and shouting they were all being slaughtered and i what little mister nicholas needed first of all was a hug and a lap lewrie thought but that was impossible he was a gentleman volunteer a future officer i tried sir honest i did nicholas wailed fresh tears coursing down his cheeks cutting clean runnels in the filth on his face as he shivered trying to remain manful before the ships people but they were jabbin him and cuttin at him after he was down before we got there and then they came for me and they were so big and horrid sir and if the soldiers hadnt come i lost my dirk sir i looked for jemmys too but they took it fore they were run back across the trenchworks im sorry sir i lost my dirk a gentlemans blade be it inherited sword or humble dagger was part of his honour to nicholas he had failed miserably at saving his fellow midshipman and friend had been bested and wounded when faced with facetoface combat and to top it all had lost his blade sure sign of failure perhaps even a sign of cowardice to drop it and run the pounders and carronades bellowed again lewrie had to wait to speak til the echoing roar passed no matter mister nicholas he said touching nicholas on his left shoulder you went to his aid like a brave fellow and helped the army stop their charge after he rushed to yours then you brought him back aboard so he could be among his shipmates no shame in any of that so he can mostlike perish among his shipmates lewrie thought now let the surgeons mates tend you lewrie said giving him another reassuring pat on the shoulder before returning to the quarterdeck but he could hear mr nicholass cries when they tried to peel his coat off to cut his shirt sleeve away and lift the cloth from the wound nicholas sounded like one of his sons after skinning a knee and nowhere near a stoic young gentleman volunteer ready way up there wandsworth was shouting to the gunners on the focsle ready here fire midshipman grace interrupted lewries gloomy thoughts halifax has hoisted another signal sir its captain repair on board we still fly unable and am engaged mister grace he asked hands in the small of his back aye sir haul em down then rehoist em in reply lewrie said with a snarl he dont like that he can go fuck himself uhm aye aye sir grace said blushing and tittering by dusk when the wagging signal flags could no longer be read and proteus had shot away her last stand of grapeshot her last cannister of musket balls even the lot scavenged from premade loads for the pounder greatguns the ship fell silent halifax had not responded to her call for shot but had anchored about a cables distance away in deeper water along with the merchant ships she had escorted into mole saint nicholas rather surprisingly those hired ships had become beehives of activity disembarking boatloads of soldiers who were quickly rowed to the beaches and quays followed by heaping piles of supplies ammunition and field guns when the last shot had been fired lewrie called for his coxn and boat to be rowed over to halifax pointedly he did not change to a clean uniform nor scrub his face and hands the greyness of his uniform from the gun smoke fog would speak for him excuse me sir mr shirley said just before he could leave the quarterdeck for his gig and a salute from the sideparty that poor lad sevier passed over sir and mister nicholas the slash on his arm quite shattered it we had to take it off just below the shoulder captain lewrie blanched nothing else to be done no use of it now sir mr shirley replied and no feeling in it at all halfsevered already and why he didnt exanguinate on the dock before your boat fetched him is a wonder captain very well then mister shirley lewrie said with a mournful sigh you did your best for him for them both thankee we were lucky with you sir shirley admitted those boys well theres only so much modern medicine may do sorry to say well then lewrie lamely said in answer unconsciously massaging his left arm and turning away damn you captain lewrie damn you for blatant insubordination and arrogance captain blaylock howled as soon as lewrie had been let into his greatcabins under halifax poop you frigate captains are all alike damn your blood swaggerin cockahoops who think they hung the bloody moon i will lay formal charges before admiral parker and see you courtmartialed ill see you broken dye hear me that is your right sir lewrie wearily replied prepared for a cobbing since midafternoon and steeled beforehand for any abuse that the choleric captain blaylock had in his shotlockers it will also be my right to point out to the court that i was unable to clear the mooring since i was engaged in supporting the army ashore with testimony from the royal artillery officers aboard at the time or the testimony of brigadier sir blazing away at nothing blaylock bellowed back firing off blank charges just to excuse your insolence firing blind indirect fire sir lofting grape and cannister to harass the slave troops lewrie pointed out theres no such bloody thing there is now sir lewrie responded almost ready to chuckle in genuine insolence too tired and sad to let blaylocks insults get to him the only thing that irked was the presence of halifax s lieutenants summoned aft to watch their captain take the hide off an upstart lewrie snuck a peek from the corners of his eyes at them some of the six seemed to enjoy the show though the much putupon duncan and others seemed ashamed of the spectacle their eyes on the painted deck covering disputes between postcaptains personal or professional in naturemost especially taking another officer to task or upbraiding a midshipman petty officer or matewas not to be done in public if there was no way to find privacy it was to be done out of earshot with no noticeable vitriol or raised voices good officers good captains dont do it this way lewrie told himself but blaylock well says it all dont it its impossible damn your eyes blaylock insisted then i suggest you ask of captain wandsworth royal artillery sir lewrie coolly rejoined hes rather proud of what we did and is simply panting twrite a paper on it for the royal society oh i dare say hell take all the credit for it call it the wandsworth system of supporting fires but he needed royal navy guns to do it sir lieutenant duncan and three others stifled smirks of glee even snorts of taboo laughter there then came a rap on the door come captain blaylock snarled and a warylooking midshipman entered the greatcabins well what the devil is it excuse me captain sir but brigadier general sir harold lamb has come aboard and the boy managed to stutter well then fetch him in damn yer eyes blaylock snapped the midshipman gulped reddened and dashed out of sight coming back a long moment later to hold the door open while an army officer and an aidedecamp entered the greatcabins ducking under the beams overhead and almost managing not to knock their white wigs askew or bang their noggins on the polished oak captain blaylock the general officer in all the gilt lace and gimp enquired fanning his sweaty face in the close warmth of the cabins sir harold sir welcome aboard blaylock said turning as unctuous as anything and practically oozing from behind his desk to go seize the brigadiers hand a glass of something cooling hey well met sir well met our arrival was more than welcome im bound and without notification captain general lamb said yes i am a touch dry blaylock snapped his fingers at his steward who sprang to the wine cabinet for glasses and claret ive despatches from general maitland for you sir harold he related to me verbally thoughblaylock all but simpered to be in the know from the elevated maitlands own lipsthat your troops were to be reenforced with the garrisons of gonaives and saint marc we picked them up on our way dye see the other small ports twixt here and there were to concentrate on portauprince from the sound of it ashore as we arrived i got my convoy in just in the nick of time haha sir harold took a seat without being bade opened wax seals upon his orders and shifted under a coinsilver overhead lanthorn to read them quickly reaching into his ornate coat for a pair of spectacles that he held close to the page like a quizzing glass he looked up briefly as blaylocks steward placed a glass of wine on a small round table by his chair nodded his thanks then returned to his letters a deep frown growing on his wrinkled face that should be all gentlemen you may go blaylock said to his lieutenants you too lewrie i will send you a letter aboard in the morning he warned turning pointedly frosty and stern youre captain lewrie sir harold brightened lowering letter and specs and rising to his feet dodging a deck beam at the last moment as he came to lewrie hand out spoke to wandsworth god bless you sir you and your ship never seen the like in thirty years as a soldier without your good offices i dare say my lines would be completely rolled up by now and an entire regiment massacred twas a risky experiment general lewrie said shaking hands with lamb but with your captain wandsworths able and eager direction him and his aide lieutenant scaiff we thought it worth trying spur of the moment all that which succeeded admirably lamb prosed on pumping away with belated joy your two brave lads who went ashore to signal one passed over sir the other lost his arm lewrie related turning sombre again shouldve sent older men commission officers or gone ashore myself instead of werent to know captain lewrie lamb assured him war aint predictable or clean you pick men for such send em off with your fingers crossed even those in a forlorn hope to breach the walls of a fortified position never knowin what the butchers bill will be the sorry price to pay for holdin command over men but our duty shouldve seen him captain blaylock him and his ship this morning he told the stricken blaylock who stood with mouth agape in anguish put out boats and rowed his ship into the shallows and just in your nick of time too else i and most of my troops wouldve been slaughtered long before you rounded the far point ah but we surely know we can count on the navy to save our hides hey sir do you let me make free with your claret id admire to offer a toast to captain lewrie and his ship hms proteus sir lewrie supplied beaming with pleasure and sensing salvation from blaylocks bile and a courtmartial saw major james lead a reenforcement inland general lamb i wonder how he fared lewrie asked as blaylocks steward fetched out another glass and poured a brimming bumper is he well caught em strung out and disorganised he did sir carved em thin as a roast at a twopenny ordinary lamb boasted gave em the bayonet and ran em back into the woods where your grapeshot and cannister strewed em six ways from sunday oh james got a cut or two and i doubt his tailord approve but hes mainwell i will tell him you asked of his welfare id appreciate that sir lewrie replied brave fellow for a complete nitwit lewrie qualified to himself but even they sometimes have their uses takes one to know one as my granny always told me captain lewrie general lamb chortled well sirs to lewrie and proteus huzzah lewrie and proteus captain george blaylock said in chorus the smile on his face patently false his teeth grinding all the while well have need of that sort of support in the morning lamb said once they had tossed back their wine and the steward circulated with a cutglass decanter to top them up louvertures laddies aint done not by a long chalk even reenforced well be hardpressed think ill rub blaylocks nose in it lewrie maliciously thought like a puppy in his scat use the upper hand now or lose it id like to oblige you sir harold but ive fired off the last of my grape and cannister along with an entire tier of powder kegs and have only roundshot left oh we could make up new stands of grape and bag musket and pistol balls easily enough he breezed off before turning his gaze to captain blaylock were there some about lamb swivelled about to peer at blaylock almost catching that worthys outraged scowl which expression was rapidly amended to the genial slacklipped smile of a doting uncle surely captain blaylock your ships magazines should be positively stiff with the proper munitions general lamb suggested ah blaylock answered with a petulant snap of those lips as he contemplated his ship of the line being plundered a second time um i expect they are but now weve landed two more regiments and two batteries of sixpounders this indirect fire will be unnecessary hmm and should such still be required would it not better serve to shift proteus to the outer harbour now her quivers spent and let halifax take her place go on go on step right in it lewrie inwardly gloated my carronades and chaseguns are mounted an entire deck higher than lewries after all hence less risk of accidentally firing on your soldiers sir harold and tis a business fraught with risk as it is captain wandsworth could recalculate his sums i spose for halifax s greater height lewrie allowed as if reluctant to accept damme though it cuts a bit rough tbe supplanted now weve got it down to a science finish what you started dye mean captain lewrie general lamb quite sympathetically imagined aye something like that sir harold lewrie said making his confession seem a harddrawn thing then theres the excitement i must allow blockade work was gettin boresome in the main and then here came this marvelous chance for real action and for us to upanchor and move downharbour as a guardship well wed be worse than useless not patrollin not makin a contribution he concluded all but piping at his eyes in sadness over not doing his bit since proteus has exhausted her magazines blaylock said getting a slyboots look on his phyz that lewrie for a moment dreaded with crossed fingers hidden in his lap theres no reason for lewrie to idle here at all halifax can handle anything that arises got you ya greedy gloryhuntin bastard lewrie thought trying not to leap up and whoop in gleeful triumph itll be the onliest way that barge of yours gets your name in the papers oh sir now he pretended to protest not too loudly perhaps a quick return to kingston would be in order captain lewrie blaylock casually suggested to replace your lacks hmm surely there must be someplace closer someplace not so deepdownwind o the trades though sir lewrie grumbled that would take proteus far from her patrol area and at such a parlous time he left off the tsktsk inherent in his respectful gripe then down to portauprince blaylock brightened theres a storeship in port now which freed my ship to escort the convoy here and guard the evacuation of gonaives and saint marc got my guns back too he added with a prissy so there sniff of retribution well if needs must then of course sir lewrie said almost tailwagging eager to serve no matter how humbly wherever we are needed do you sail in the morning then captain lewrie general lamb told him ill send a letter of appreciation aboard your ship before you depart expressing my undying thanks for your actions today and a copy to your admiral parker as well to let him know what a paragon he has in his command you do me too much honour sir harold lewrie vowed modestly though eating up such approbation like plum duff that letter would get posted in the news back home getting his name in the papers nonsense sir harold waved him off captain blaylock can write a properly appreciative report of his own hey captain blaylock why i blaylock responded mouth agape in high dudgeon and shock for a raw second before turning bland and agreeable once more but of course sir harold anything to oblige he stated obviously weighing the cost of a refusal against the present goodwill of a rich and knighted senior officer do you wish then to take my anchorage tonight sir lewrie prodded shamming some more eagerness theres still enough light you would not mind sir blaylock asked leery of his offer to cede the place of honour so quickly it will give captain wandsworth more time to do his sums before dawn sir lewrie replied rising as if dismissed the decision having already been made and being toothless i can accomplish no more makes sense sir general lamb commented nose in his glass aye upanchor and stand down below the port captain lewrie blaylock said draining his glass and rising to his own feet as if to begin the evolutions for moving his ship that instant do let me walk you to the deck captain lewrie an honour sir lewrie replied lying most pleasantly blaylock for lambs benefit even went so far as to thread his right arm through lewries left as if they were now as close as catercousins on the way to the door do not make the mistake of trying to best me again lewrie blaylock muttered from the side of his mouth once they were out of sir harolds earshot still beaming like an admiring papa ive years more experience at navy politics than any jumpedup illbred jackanapes of a dashing frigate captain you finagled me once back in portauprince and robbed me of guns i spose you think you did it again tonight hmm well let me tell you something oh i will pen you a modicum of praise for your damnfoolery but stress the horrid risk you ran of killing our own troops and one never knows does one the samboes just mightve had artillery in those woods and any casualties from grape or cannister i can always lay at your feet and there goes your good odour boy dont you run the same risk sir lewrie pointed out after all itll be your guns tomorrow tomorrows accidental dead can always become yesterdays dead on paper lewrie blaylock whispered evilly beaming and just who dye think will do the writing once youre gone lewrie you will of course sir lewrie levelly responded thats right thats exactly right blaylock softly crowed unless its sir harold writing admiral parker should you kill some of his men sir lewrie pointed out then its on your head ah but in my case lewrie twill be an unfortunate accident a mistaken signal from army artillerymen well since you seem to have everything covered sir ill go back aboard proteus and shift anchor lewrie said outwardly uncaring and eerily calm in the face of such a threat goodbye little boycaptain blaylock sniffed again for the benefit of general lamb he raised his voice for a proper parting sentiment have a safe and quick voyage to portauprince thankee sir lewrie said conversationally loud as well but dropped his voice to a whisper again as he stuck out his hand forcing blaylock to take it to make a decent show before i go though you should know sir without grape or cannister proteus cannot guard the harbour tonight against what blaylock asked with a snort of derision cuttingout expeditions by louvertures men sir an attempt to blow you skyhigh sir oh tosh blaylock actually giggled at the very idea you did not read my report about the four boats we intercepted sir when they saw that they could not escape us they turned and lit their cargoes of powder tryin to take us with em theyve dozens of small boats up and down the coast im bound out of reach of the armys trenchworks who knows what theyll be up to now they have been stung so bad by naval gunfire hmmm sir blaylock looked as if hed sneer for a moment dismissing such a threat but then went blank as he realized that it was possible and that his precious ship was now at the point of danger by god you do you have your report aboard by six bells sir to accompany sir harolds i blieve i can breast the slack of the tide and work my way out on the landbreeze if you please sir didnt think o that didya lewrie gloated some more the first ship out of heres mine carry in your damned despatches by god ill have your arse for this lewrie if you say so sir lewrie rejoined his voice deadlevel and his eyes going from calm blue to steely grey if you say so chapter twentythree portauprince was a much more crowded harbour than when proteus had last lain there and this time when sailing down the north channel past ile de gonaves instead of the exotic and otherwordly cries of a myriad of brightly coloured island birds the overlying sounds were of distant fieldpieces thumping flat and hollow the faint crackle from musket volleys and the brooding menacing thud of voudoun drums an ancient stores ship hms grampus lay at anchor once a tall and proud nd rate of guns she was now a tarsmeared and filthy old barge little better than a mastless receiving ship or prison hulk so bereft of upper masts that proteuss people could conjure that the only way the old warrior could have gotten over from kingston was under tow caint see dot loidot songbird we took sah coxn andrews pointed out shading his eyes to scan the crowded harbour well damme id hoped lewrie said having counted on the prize being there so he could get lieutenant catterall and midshipman adair back aboard to reenforce his depleted petty officers and leaders mister coote he called shrugging it off youll take the cutter under mister elwes to grampus once were anchored grape shot cannister makings and powder first mind were naked without them their last night at mole saint nicholas without grape or cannister hed paced and fretted a move by louvertures men with an armed double watch on deck armed marines in the fighting tops and both eyes skinned for any suspicious shadow or drifting log in the water worried that his malicious warning to captain blaylock had been borrowing trouble for himself mister langlie once mister coote returns begin loading ill be ashore to find out what aid we may render or what were to do aye sir though i dont suppose theyll ask for indirect fire here langlie commented taking off his hat to mop his forehead with his coat sleeve our armys too far inland for that and i doubt general maitlands staff runs to lunatics such as our friends wandsworth and scaiff lewrie replied softly japing him that too sir langlie chuckled turning his attention to the draw of the sails and their course half a point aweather helmsman two hours of mopping his face swatting flies and pesky mosquitoes dipping up water now and then from the communal bucket at general maitlands headquarters and lewrie had even less of a clue as to what proteus should do once she was rearmed at last coming from a tall set of double louvred doors leading to a parlour converted to offices he spotted a blueandwhite uniform not worn by the royal artillery but by a postcaptain of his own service and lewrie practically pounced on him naming himself captain lewrie is it the officer asked once hed spoken aye sir nicely of obdurate the officer replied and his name fit him most appropriately nicely was a square older fellow with pepperandsalt hair still thick and wiry a man possessed of the merriest blue eyes and a permanent tan his countenance fixed in perpetuity in a benign half smile as if pleased as punch with his place in the world his lot and the progress of all that he surveyed youre senior officer present sir i take it any orders for me lewrie asked askin of the army well you were off to patrol the north shore nicely mused fingers to his lips to recall him before snapping his fingers as he got it aye sir but we put into mole saint nicholas a few days ago and shot away all our grape and cannister now that grampus is here and we may rearm shot it all away tell me nicely said leading him by dint of personality down the hall towards the front doors after hed related the whole tale nicely let out a loud whew of amazement damme but youve been a busy lad captain lewrie you have a written account o course you do give it me that laving bowl and the buckets fairly fresh avail yourself whilst i look this over lewrie swabbed his face and neck once more and ladled up a dipper of water sipping off half and using the rest to swirl the dippers ladle clean before slinging it on the stone steps of the commandeered mansion where the water steamed on the hot sunheated stones damn are they trying to shift supplies east to invade santo domingo the best use for your ship would be right back on the station you left nicely grumbled fanning himself with the sheaf of paper in their airless oven of a hallway no love for the dons understand but i wouldnt wish louverture on the demons of hell soon as theyre in charge here theyll be over the border quick as you can say knife and god help the spanish then this indirect fire may prove useful here in a few days im afraid i must order you to stay lewrie i understand sir lewrie answered nodding and smiling as he contemplated another visit ashore and a rencontre with that henriette with a qualm too for this time should he have to fire over the head of british troops he wouldnt have wandsworth or scaiff to carry the can should things go wrong perhaps captain blaylock would get his wish after all and hed end up slaughtering british soldiers by error his error quickly followed by a courtmartial blaylock testifying that hed told him so and excuse me sir but you said lewrie plumbed at last if louverture is in charge of portauprince should have said when rather nicely told him turning sombre mole saint nicholas reenforced with troops from saint marc and gonaives thereby ceding those little ports to louverture do you see us here in their south province and west province concentrating forces at portauprince and jacmel on the south coast weve given up little and grand goave arcahele just north of heretwas that or get their garrisons massacred louvertures unleashed his armies on us in an allout effort and frankly the swarthy little bugger is beating our poor army like a cheap drum lewrie your coming here is much like out of the frying pan into the fire well damme couple of days back it was run or die up at croix de bouquets routed maitlands troops and ran em clean out of the plain de culdesac nicely explained flank units gave way under hellish swarms of em then the center lost heart and scampered before they could be cut off and encircled abandoned guns caissons wounded thats not over five miles from here our six or eight thousand healthy and present gainst fifty or sixty thousand of theirs damme i suspect well be asked to evacuate the army in a few days a total muddle lewrie complete and utter dear lord lewrie said with an authentic qualm and a gulp of amazement whodve ever thought it possible know captain blaylock do you nicely asked of a sudden and with a less than nice expression on his phyz not really sir not til our convoy here oh weeks ago had praise for your actions faint praise but some is better than none nicely pointed out picking up a used towel with which he sponged and mopped his face aahh lord its so hot and still they despise each other lewrie quickly schemed damme perhaps the truth serve for a rare once navy politics feuds and jealousy gawd but i do need a patron out here bad general sir harold lamb insisted that he do so sir whilst i was present so he could hardly refuse him lewrie said daring a cynical grin id already angered him in kingston harbour and i think he blames me for having guns stripped from his ship once we brought a convoy here and whilst engaged against the samboes i rejected his summons to go aboard halifax til we were out of munitions and targets munitions which i requested from his ship which request was ignored too sir his loss of guns was my doing nicely said grinning after he had dried his face what did you do in kingston harbour my libertymen sang too loud and woke him at midnight sir nicely found that delicious and uttered a bark of laughter youll do captain lewrie nicely told him youll do quite well tomorrow morning once laden take up a closer anchorage to the shore i shall put a flea in general maitlands ear regarding this indirect fire business have him second his most experienced artillery officer aboard your ship theres always the possibility that if the enemy presses maitland back to the town environs we may have to try it on and see if theres anything to it and how well you do aye aye sir lewrie said getting the wind up again ill forward your report to admiral parker at kingston with a recommendation of mine own nicely promised is there anything else i may do for you lewrie i sent in a prize with my third officer and best midshipman in charge of her sir i lost two midshipmen at mole saint nicholas and i need my people back cant nicely brusquely said sent her on to jamaica with all those french privateersmen id no place to secure them shes in the hands of the prize court though so therell be some reward coming should that be a comfort oh well then lewrie said with a sad shrug shorthanded a tad longer promote a couple of quartermasters or mates as acting midshipmen uhm when the army buckled and broke sir do you know anything about the fifteenth west indies regiment an old friend of mine commands it you dont mean that fop colonel beauman do you nicely asked a look of distaste on his face oh no sir lewrie all but gasped i know colonel beauman from long ago but i refer to colonel cashman oh him nicely laughed throwing back his head one devil of a fellow thats alright then pity though about him and his regiment theres a bit of a stink after the battle up at croix des bouquets not in good odour with maitland since your friend lives though have no fears on that score theyre somewhere along the lines fairly close to town i believe well thats good lewrie said letting out a breath of pent worry whilst were loading do you not have anything for me to do sir id very much like to look cashman up shouldnt be a problem nicely decided god keep you then captain lewrie well surely speak again as long as this poor siege lasts adieu sir nicely and lewrie doffed hats then nicely strode out into the torrid sunshine reaching into his left sleeve for a handkerchief and sneezing as the full brunt of the sun struck him before stomping briskly towards the quays the staff officers at the commandeered headquarters were loath to loan him a horse but lewrie cajoled them after a long palaver and rode up the streets out of town the paving stones gave way to silty dirt and sand the last tumbledown shanties and hovels of free blacks and petits blancs were left behind and the undergrowth grew thicker and closer to the track reaching overhead to interlace and block off the sun making multiple swaying dapples of soft green light along the eerie tunnel through the woods maybe this isnt such a good idea lewrie thought drawing his thinshanked weary mare to a halt he took off his hat to fan himself and swabbed his cheeks and chin of dripping sweat on his right sleeve though he was in deep shade there was no relief from the heat and perplexingly it felt even warmer than under the crushing sizzle of the sun airless too the heat muggy and close and so humid that he could feel his breath flow in and out like running water eeriest of all it was ominously quietbut for the throb of those damned drums and the hum and buzz of mosquitoes tiny bees and large flies that swarmed his sweaty horse and sweaty self when first hed entered the woods there had been a faint hum of town doings astern and the ring of axes thwocking into timber somewhere ahead exotic birds had screeched and hooted crickets and grasshoppers had sawed and fiddled and cheeped frogs had croaked and whateverthehelltheyweres had rustled and whined now all was silent but for the deep waggon ruts in the dirt track and the imprint of army boots along the verges where soldiers had slogged to avoid the puddles he could conjure that he was the only human in the trackless forest the only person to have come this way in days maybe i dont like cashman that much he told himself considering turning around and going back aboard ship with grim remembrances of the underlying terror of wild wastelands hed felt as a young midshipman in the woods of the yorktown peninsula in the virginia colony before the siege began his future brothersinlaw governour and burgress chiswick had taunted him about skulking red indians rebel snipers and irregulars just waiting to lift his hair cut his throat and carve off his privates whilst screeching with glee and dancing above his halfdead body lewrie could not see half a decent pistolshot in the forests on either hand the dirt track a demilune forming the bottom of the view down a telescopes tube and he heard a jinglingplashingthumping approach up ahead and round the slight bend in the road he groped for the doublebarreled pistol in his waistband thumbing the right hammer back to halfcock his legs tightening about his mount and ready to saw the reins to run back into town heels pressed to the mares belly about to thump her to her fastest gait oy thank god a soldier a corporal cried as he came round the bend on a horse he was a wizened little fellow not as big as a minute clad in a tunic that had faded from red to pink and stained white breeches his walnuttan face grizzled with several days worth of whiskers a short musketoon was slung across his back and across the saddle in front of him lay several lengths of chain ah lewrie snapped very much relieved decocking his pistol thort i wuz tonliest man alive fer a bit there sir the old veteran merrily cackled pacing his horse up next to him spooky of place ese woods sir indeed lewrie windily agreed im looking for the whereabouts of the fifteenth west indies bout a mile an a bit straight on sir then veer right along the lines first track ya come to woods open up sos ya can see your way not a quartermile yonder where a big plantation wuz an youre fairsafe then among soldiers beyond em fields an all sir thankee corporal be glad tget outta th woods meself the corporal said taking a swig from a wood canteen get ese tracechains fixed sos me majors waggonll draw again why do i not find a handy smith hitd take me all this day an night sir majord not expect me trisk is road after dark sir no e wouldnt the water in the mans canteen smelled hellish alcoholic to lewries nose an experienced old hand the corporal obviously wanted any excuse to toddle off and dawdle over his errand getting a shot at a decent meal a thorough drunk and a woman before having to go back to the armys misery you goin up to harrest some o them officers from at regiment sir em fifteenth good lord knows somebody should th cowards tis said sir some of em rode off an left eir men tdie or get took by em dark devils wont see at in an english regiment nossir but wot can ya hexpect from such an idle lot sir visiting a friend lewrie answered ill ride on then sir an keep safe the soldier bade him saluting for the first time with a leery expression for anyone with a friend from among that regiments officers same to you corporal lewrie rejoined doffing his hat and clucking his mount into motion once more chapter twentyfour he found the fifteenth at long last after casting rightwards past the fork in the road slowly walking his mount along the rear of several other units encampments and entrenchments lewrie had seen defeat and despair often enough in his eighteen years of service and this army was showing all the signs of it care wasnt being taken of equipment but for personal arms uniforms were still mud and grassstained and the clotheslines were not the usually crowded rows oн bunting the soldiers looked hangdog and lethargic when he got to the lines of the fifteenth west indies it was even worse there were very few tents replaced with brush arbors or mere awnings stretched beneath the trees where exhausted sick and holloweyed men lolled nighinsensible to everything around them not even raising their heads at the rare sight of a naval officer on horseback what tents remained contained the wounded and the stillneat line oн larger pavillions for officers one the largest of all he took for ledyard beaumans that was where some fashionably dressed and rather clean officers had gathered raising a merry din as if they were enjoying themselves where fine horses stood cockfooted and shivered their skins and lashed their tails and manes against the flies blowing and nickering now and again in exasperation or boredom lewrie dismounted and led his horse down the lines until coming to a sizable pavillion with a large fly and two sides halfway rolled up he recognised the coat hanging on a nail driven into the tentpole in front from within there came the sounds of snores hallo the house he called rapping on the pole ummph came a querulous halfawake plaint wakey wakey lash up and stow you idle bugger lewrie japed alan cashman croaked coughing and clearing his throat before sitting up on his sagging cot what the bloody hellre you doing way out here he asked swinging his booted legs to the ground came in search of good cheer lewrie said kneeling down and tying his reins through a rusty iron ring set in a tetheringstone came to the wrong bloody place if you did more fool you cashman grunted scrubbing his face with dry hands and yawning broadly reaching for a towel to soak up his sweat no joy here believe me ran into a soldier on my way here not hard tdo that cashman snorted taking the lid off his tin water pail and dipping out a ladleful to swish around his mouth and spit out were lousy with em least we were said youd had a spot of bother recently asked if i was up to arrest anyone lewrie said ducking under the tent fly to sit on a folding camp stool and fan himself with his hat how cashman slept under canvas was a wonder to him the temperature felt as if it had increased by a full twenty degrees inside the tent wish someone would christopher spat dipping up more water this time to guzzle down my luck though theyd come for me what happened lewrie asked waving off cashmans offer of a crooked localrolled cigarillo feel like a stroll cashman asked fumbling with his tinderbox and striking flint on steel several times before getting the lint burning with which to light his cigarillo not really its hotter than the hinges of hell it was no matter to cashman who now puffing away stood and pulled on his waistcoat coat hat and swordbelt and led the way out to the bare and sandy tramped ground of the encampment well go up and take a look at the lines cashman announced setting off for the woods to the east lewrie could but shrug before following him at least from cashmans initial pace it would be the slow ambling sort of stroll he had in mind that purblind goddamned fool back there his old friend said at last once out of earshot of the officers lines he got us halfway massacred and now swears it wasnt any fault of his ive lost a third of the regiment dead or wounded and the restre so terrified i doubt theyll be worth a tuppenny shit the next time they face those devils of louvertures how lewrie asked why by being himself alan cashman said the scorn dripping by bein his merry little useless witless self general maitland put us out on his left flank braced by a veteran regiment of regulars on the extreme left heard about the battle we had tother day at croix des bouquets the portauprince derby only that there was one lewrie told him had us some trenchworks not much bout waistdeep with the bushes and such cut and cleared a couple of hundred yards out beyond cashman explained as they threaded through a worn path into the woods towards their new front caltrops in the grass and all two guns on the line for help bout a halfhour before sunup here the darkies came the sun in our eyes advance party a forlorn hope that had mostlike spent all night creepin through the grass to us sprang up at the first volley and got into the trenches with their caneknives and short spears some o them just firehardened canes or branches if you can feature it id kept two companies back for just such an emergency and brought em up myself first time in real action our lads so a fair number broke no matter what the sergeants did tkeep em steady you know how that is im with you lewrie said idly swatting a mosquito that landed on his cheek dont do that cashman snapped in a hoarse whisper it draws fire the darkies snipe at any sound and some of em are dab hands at shootin not just muskets out there some have jaeger rifles and rifled huntin pieces took em from their dead masters plantation homes sometimes they take a blind shot at night especially tkeep us awake and scared mostly but every now and then theyll wing some poor bastard sure enough a second later there came the sharp crack of a gun from the distant woods the faint warble of a ball passing over their heads and a spattering of leaves native birds screeched in sudden alarm and took wing sounding like a musket volley as they beat their wings and crashed through the limbs and leaves you were sayin lewrie prompted as they began to walk on first waves came on runnin flatout cashman continued with his tale of woe not a one of em armed not with muskets actually socket bayonets jammed on sticks that sort o thing and were firin by platoon volleys wastin lead on em and the smokes gettin thick like it always does and up comes beauman the chuckleheaded bastard you could hear em breakin without seein em yellin and hollerin fit tbust at first then steppin on the caltrops and howlin like a pack o ramcats wounded and dyin weepin and wailin i decided tsend the two reserve companies back to the rear but beauman wouldnt hear of it wanted em formed twenty paces behind the trenchworks and him behind em personal bloody guard even if their charge was broke and bloodied it was over dye see alan louverture and his generals theyll trade half a regiment just tcount your guns see if they can find a weak spot before they send in the troops with muskets we had em beaten with only eight companies them slidin off to our left and catchin more hell from the regulars feeling about for your flank lewrie intuited damme well make a soldier of ya yet cashman chuckled with a sour amusement thats exactly what they were doin right professional of em really fightin falls off on our front the gun smoke clears weve laid out an even hundred or so and the ladsre feelin right pert and cheerin like billyoh then the firin picks up on the far left and you could hear a charge against the regulars where theyd found the flank and field pieces firin cannister and grape into em you could just see the men of the ninth hampshires wheelin about refusing the flank with three or four companies and a gun bent back at right angles thats when beauman lost it for us the simple sonofabitch whatd he do took the two reserve companies the light and grenadier company from our line and ordered em to reenforce the hampshires cashman growled slashing at the undergrowth with a stick we told him wed lose touch on both our flanks if he did it that the cuffies would see it and hit our six remainin companies soon as he moved the hampshires needed help theyd ask for it a reserve regiment was in our rear for just such a thing but he wouldnt listen wanted to do somethin grand i spose had hold of his bridle and he lashed at me with his ridin crop sittin up there on his big grey horse so arrogant and dumb off he goes with his favourites drawin out their swords and yelpin for it all his bloody neighbours and debtors hot for bloody fame well even before they set off and filed the grenadier company and light company out of line the hampshires had smashed the samboes and didnt need the help but he was already in motion and i was left tstring at what was left to cover the front and the slaves hit you again lewrie said halfknowing the worst a big attack that time alan old son cashman said sighing with disgust and sorrow damn near a brigade in a big block column maybe two hundred across and mightve been fifty deep the front ranks with muskets this time and skirmishers out front in pairs i sent a galloper after beauman twarn him what was comin and how we needed all our lads back soon as dammit but they were on us before he could stir his slack arse up damn him cashman spat slashing hard at the weeds as if it were happening that instant and not several days ago the line broke no we held men goin down like ninepins but we held for as long as we could cashman said sent another galloper back for the reserve regiment warn em dye see well here comes help at last beauman with our four companies but i look back at him and do ya know what i see hes formin em a hundred yards behind the line were on our own oh hes trottin back and forth wavin his sword and makin his stallion rear all gloriouslike mightve seen it in a damn painting i spose but he aint helpin us after my lads see em all lined up and ready then see the enemy comin at a dead run with bayonets levelled well that was when we broke and no holdin em thought it looked safer to the rear that tore the line wide open our wounded are gettin butchered and the cuffies are rollin up the right flank of the hampshires and the left of what regiment was on our right and the race was on those units pivoted companies backwards to refuse and our lads took it for a retreat so did beauman damn him and hes shoutin for us all tfall back on the reserves and im yellin no but our peoplere dyin no matter if i couldve held em then its devil take the hindmost i tried torganise volley fire front rank fires and falls back ten paces treload whilst the second rank fires but beauman and his damn pets were orderin em trun so once the first rank retired they took off for the woods and not a second later the second rank and its a complete rout goddammit thats where the whole army broke then lewrie asked the very place cashman said with a sneer and its all our fault oh i got em stopped once they ran out of breath and formed em up what was left of em even got em tgo forward again thelp the reserve regiment no help from beauman or his beaudandies they scampered off god knows how far to the rear didnt even see em til late in the afternoon when the whole army had fallen back but theyd had time tget their stories straight and met up with general maitland first and fed him a tale of woe how no one couldve held against such a horde no matter their valiant efforts blamed the regular regiment the hampshires for gettin flanked and me for being unable to control the line surely you protested kit lewrie barked in outrage youve witnesses you could even demand a court tclear your name sent maitland a written protest with a list of witnesses but the way things are goin itll be months from now fore a court can be seated and wheres my witnesses then half stand a fair chance o dyin on a darkys bayonet long before i need em cashman groused and in the meantime beaumans free tsay anything he chooses and lay the blame on you lewrie realised kingston and spanish town papers are owned by some of his very best friends too cashman said continuing his litany of anger after we lost so many local men ill be lucky im not hung before a court could sit or dewitted like that dutchman got pulled to wee pieces by a mob with their bare hands the sales price of your lands wouldnt matter much then hey lewrie commented using a stick to whack some tall weeds himself even if i prevail at the courtmartial ill still be ruined cashman spat better i just challenge him put a ball in him and be done kit for gods sake lewrie said frowning you cant just shoot him or carve him up youd have to resign your commission and then youd never get a court lieutenant colonels cant duel colonels anymore than i could duel an admiral have tbe a civilian before you can blaze with a senior officer otherwise wed have eighteenyearold generals and admirals and all my lieutenants would be ten want a promotion want command just eliminate the next highest over you besides he added your maitland aint a complete fool he must know that ledyards got the forehead of a hen and youre the one who saved what was left think it over compose a letter of your own for the jamaican papers laying it all out believe me no amount of money or powers going tmake people believe hes the better soldier any man whos had dealings with himll mostlike already think him a dunderhead might work cashman allowed but if it doesnt and i dont get my court then ill have no choice but to resign my commission and then duel him if youre still around ill ask you to be my second there was no way that a friend and a gentleman could turn away from such a request lewrie could only dumbly nod his head and accept if theres no other solution and if thats the only satisfaction youll have then aye of course kit ill second you he refuses im proved right and shown him up for a coward cashman said looking wolfish with anticipated delight does he take me up on it then ill kill him think i could sail away happy after that thankee alan i knew i could count on you what friends are for lewrie replied feigning agreement he had no doubts that cashman could blow beaumans heart clean out with a pistol or carve him to chutney sauce with a sword what sorrowed him was the fact that once the deed was done his old friend would be penniless and too suspect to ever go for a soldier again his lot would be ignominous exile perhaps to those southern united states that hed disparaged think my writing general maitland could help lewrie offered oh please cashman sneered with bitter amusement support from a sailor who wasnt even there hardly but thankee for the offer alan old son hmmm gettin on for late afternoon best we get you back to town the darkies begin to play up at night sure enough the drums had begun again and that infernal chant could be heard far off in the eastern jungles eh eh bomba heu heu canga bafio tй canga moune de le canga do ki la canga li what language is that lewrie asked chilled to the bone once more by the sounds and what does it mean some african tongue from the ivory coast where they came from cashman told him starting to lead them back toward the tent lines i was told it means we swear to destroy all the whites and everything they own lets die if we dont way they fight id believe it anything i can send to ease your misery lewrie asked him cant thing of anything no cashman sadly told him keep a sharp eye peeled mind theres always skulkers along the roads after dark oh thankee for tellin me lewrie barked i was nervous enough ridin up here alone in broad daylight you could always stop in town at jeanpierres and look up yer little henriette cashman snickered theres a spur tmove ya along way portauprince is fallin apart im better off aboard my ship lewrie admitted a knot of unease growing between his shoulder bladeswhere the musket ball spear cane knife or poisoned arrow might strike were he unwary or just plain unlucky on his lone ride back tis not a sailors fight this sort of cashman cocked an eye at the sky and the place of the sun he clapped lewrie on the back suspiciously near that knot of unease as if he suspected his qualms then chuckled nothin like a little dread tkeep you cloppin along faster think theres time for the stirrupcup at my tent then well get you on your way fore twilight gets too deep therell be a last rush of troops and officers on the road bout now so it shouldnt be too bad but keep my ears open and my head swivellin lewrie queried suspicious of such blithe reassurances reins in yer left cocked pistol in yer right cashman intoned and lewrie made it a quick stirrupcup both he and horse antsy to the faint chorus and the vibrating drums canga bafio tй canga moune de le lewrie took the salutes from the sideparty doffed his hat and stepped inboard just as the late afternoon heat began to dissipate in the face of a freshening breeze off the sea as the sun sank lower in the west lt langlie and the surgeon mr shirley were awaiting him on the starboard gangway looking anxious excuse me sir but this order came aboard for you about one hour ago langlie said offering a single sheet of paper folded over and sealed with a tiny daub of wax lewrie took it and split it open aha he sighed making a face i see well damme bad news sir pardon my curiosity langlie enquired seems that general maitland and admiral parker have struck a bargain with our foe louverture mister langlie lewrie informed him his weariness taking over after days of enforced activity and briskness since we now hold untenable positions in saint domingue and to spare the further useless effusion of blood he went on dripping sarcasm maitland has proposed an armistice once he receives louvertures assurances that the civilian populations of jacmel mole saint nicholas and portauprince will be spared any reprisals we depart depart sir but strike our tents and sail away lewrie spat wadding up the order abandon em to the good offices of louvertures men tuck our tails twixt our legs and slink off without even a last bark at em were to prepare to embark the army and all its stores and sail back to kingston well damme sir langlie groaned removing his hat to swab his forehead and shake his head in sorry wonder they beat us aye it appears they have lewrie said mister shirley the army hospitals are filled with wounded youd best prepare for some of them to be put aboard of course sir shirley replied hemming and hawwing a bit though there is another matter that you must know first captain and whats that lewrie asked suddenly filled with a defeatist lassitude several of our people are sick captain shirley told him in a gruff mutter all but wringing his hands in despair so far i cannot tell you with any certainty whether its malaria or yellow jack three hands show the fever sweats and headaches of malariaalong with the requisite icy chillsbut two more also exhibit pains in the back and limbs one would expect to see with a case of yellow fever so i cannot oh god no lewrie blanched his worst longlingering dread for the ship at last confirmed only five so far as of the start of the first dog watch sir but it could be a dozen more by sunup shirley grimly prophecied you are aware how quickly it can spread captain aye i am lewrie sadly whispered lets hope that chichona bark extract avails mister shirley keep me informed and make them as comfortable as you can anything you need he turned away and went to the quarterdeck bulwarks to peer out at the now dark and brooding shore of the anchorage portauprince its docks and streets near the harbour was lit by torches and faint lanthorns where soldiers and sailors off the stores ship laboured at the mounds of munitions and rationsthis time to start reloading them for evacuation despite general maitlands truce the dull crack of a musket now and then broke the twilights serenity along the lines deeper in the trackless jungles for nothing lewrie thought groaning with weary cynicism twas all for nothing nicholas and sevier seaman inman toussaint louverture a plump little black man unschooled in weapons and tactics and his army of tagragandbobtail former slaves with agricultural tools had beaten the british army he had no way to fathom the how of it except to think that louvertures victory and the uneasy peace which might follow it was for the best every experience he had with slavery the more he was put off by it just as cashman was in the face of such an amazing debacle even a rakehell as casually churched as he could shrug and think it gods will that wasnt to say that it didnt rankle though the bitter cup of defeats gall had never been easy for lewrie to swallow ever since his first taste of it in and pondering the disgrace of sailing away after being bested by illiterate blacks by hordes of beasts with the musk of overworked demons and not a jot of christian mercy not a jot of civilisation to their souls truce or not what would keep louvertures hordes from butchering everyone indiscriminately when they massacred petits blancs and townsfolk in an orgy of gore would that be gods will too what would their inquisition be like the voudoun drums in the hills and forests throbbed on as they had since weeks before tonight though they sounded less funereal though just as ominous now the drums almost had a lilt a celebratory liveliness and lewrie could conjure images of men and women capering and leaping in the savage glare of bonfires flaunting finery stolen from the dead brandishing cane knives spears and muskets firing rounds off at the moon and whooping like victorious muskogee indians in spanish florida just thank god ill never have tset foot on that shore again he whispered and you bastards are welcome to it for now he had a crew to worry about another debacle blooming on his own decks impossible as it might prove to be to save his men from almost always fatal plagues he didnt think it gods will or a form of punishment from on high that his poor sailors should suffer so for being unwitting pawns against the saint domingue blacks eventual freedom perhaps god would take their innocence into account and spare them or help him find a way to save them book three sed ti qui vivum casus age fare vicissim attulerint pelagine venis erroribus actus an monitu divum but come tell in turn what chance has brought you here alive come you driven in your ocean wanderings or at heavens command aeneid book vi publius virgilios maro virgil chapter twentyfive we may consider ourselves fortunate sailing master winwood said rapping his knuckles lightly on the wheel drum of the idle helm for luck even so fortunate aye sir lt catterall replied with a roll of his eyes eight dead so far and thirty helpless with fever below why with a run of luck such as that id stake the family fortune consider the lot of those poor devils aboard the other ships winwood pointed out gesturing across kingston harbour nigh half of their men down sick or buried consider the lot of the soldiers we brought off from saint domingue sir a full third of them are dead and now interred ashore no sir for my money proteus has come off rather easily for all the time we spent close to that pestilential shore even as a good christian which i hope i am i must confess i find a certain comfort in the tales told about proteus and her almost inexplicable birthing and about our captain though the tales of his last ship jester and the tales about our own smack of heathen pagan old seagods the idea of him and us with him being guarded by a benevolent divine hand are a form of solace in the face of lifes unfairness comforting aye mister winwood but catterall replied with a faint shrug it was too warm for wider gestures catterall a happygolucky deist and cynic found mr winwoods mysticism amusing the captain may be spoken of as a lucky captain and his ships lucky by association but twould take a pagan seagod to deem us worthy in his sight that left unspoken the bald fact of captain lewries adultery his recent dalliance with a halfcaste portauprince whore the rumour of which had made the rounds belowdecks usually accompanied by hoots of appreciation and admiration rather than disapproval or envy ahem mr winwood commented by clearing his throat blushing at the unsaid reminder of their captains human frailty but god loved even his king david bathsheba notwithstanding catterall drolly posed something like that sir ahem their priggish sailing master reiterated tonguetied and unable to respond to such wordly japing without violating his vows not to curse the proof of the statement that god loves a sinner in hope of his eventual salvation or has use of him in his majestic plan stands before me sir winwood finally answered glowering a touch point taken sir catterall rejoined with a wink and chuckle he was in fact rather proud of his repute as a rakehell and a pagan so mr winwoods comment caromed right past him and i will stand in humble abeyance til his fated use for me is revealed uhm excuse me sirs but the captain is coming off shore midshipman elwes informed them approaching them from his vantage point on the starboard bulwarks sure enough the quick use of a glass showed one of the ships larger boats stroking away from the piers where it had landed another funeral and burying detail very well mister elwes summon the sideparty catterall instructed permission to mount ze quarterdeck surgeons mate durant more laconic and weary than ever requested from the base of the starboard ladder from the waist aye come up sir catterall allowed hows old wyman i regret to inform you sir zat the poor man as just now gone away from us durant told him wiping his hands on his apron using a french phrase for departure from life well damme catterall muttered face creasing in genuine sorrow though taking an involuntary step away from mr durant as if to flee deaths miasma or the noisome reek of the yellow jacks last agony when the victim voided his bowels after many days of inability and spewed up dark bloody vomito negro the stench of wymans dying clung to durants apron bare arms and very hair like a whiff off the river styx that will make you second officer mister catterall winwood needlessly pointed out and young mister adair an acting lieutenant indeed catterall said in a whisper realising the enormity of their loss and the onerous weight placed on his shoulders as a result god help us then winwood sniffed god help us all tis a horrid toast to a bloody war or a sickly season so we may attain our desired promotions uhm yes catterall said to that turning away and feeling like a weary atlas sobered for once from all sarcasm god not another damn funeral was lewries first thought once he had gotten the dismal news of lt wymans death the first men who had died had been buried at sea cleanly and neatly the last fiveno six lewrie had to remind himselfwere interred in the military cemetery outside kingston they lingered longer in the mind the plots of mounded earth and simple wood crosses not quite so forgettable but more permanent and seemingly eternally dispiriting in the last few days administering the last rites had become a daily chore supplanting all the other cares a captain should have for his ship and the mellifluous prose of the book of common prayer cloying and banal the litany so familiar that he could almost recite from memory as if declaiming passages from caesars gallic wars at school lewrie looked over at midshipman grace feeling pangs of sympathy as the lad stumbled about the gundeck as if in a trance redfaced but dryeyed after their last trip ashore in the cutter to bury his grandfather the canny nore fisherman theyd known simply as the older grace now mr graces father too lay insensible beneath an awning stretched over the boattier beams up forrad by the focsle belfry by turns shivering and teethchattering under three blankets or sweating buckets and thrashing for relief from malaria arthur the middle grace might recover mr shirley believed it was malaria not the yellow jack and chichona bark extract was lengthening the calm periods twixt bouts though he was still as weak as a wet dishclout young grace stumbled forward and knelt by his fathers pallet taking his hand and clinging and patting it hows he doing lewrie asked durant in a soft mutter it comes and goes sir durant said heaving another of those gallic shrugs of his improving i venture to say mister shirley he is resting capitaine ze strain as been orrible it is a wonder so enervated he as become zat he as not succumbed himself so far it is ze old and weak ze very young who fall ill and die any more cases lewrie asked crossing his fingers two capitaine seaman ordinaire harper and landsman drew durant mournfully went on both owever display no sign of yellow jack only ze malaria and zey are strong but only one death today lewrie insisted ze poor lieutenant wyman oui but zere are two more ands who ave the yellow jack and near ze last stages of ze malady sir i cannot imagine zey will see tomorrows dawn damn damn damn lewrie spat weakly thumping a fist atop the caprail of the starboard gangway bulwarks im tired o this mister durant there must be something more we can do we do all zat medicine knows sir durant objected chichona extract at the first sign of sickness salt water clysters and all the fresh water zey can drink to ease ze constipation and lack of my english pissing in zose wiz yellow jack better air on deck shade and coolness mister hodson smokes ze ship below wiz faggots of tobacco we scour wiz vinegar and salt water we root out ze rats and cockroaches no one as lice or fleas but it is all so confusing zat we ave both malaria and yellow jack at once together capitaine is ze chichona bark good for zose wiz the yellow jack or harmful is fruit juice helpful or does it produce more bile zat i zink is a symptom of yellow jack and contributes to the vomito negro ze liver and ze kidneys of men who die of yellow jack when examined after death are ruined it explains ze lack of piss ze constipation but ze why or ze how and weve pumped the bilges so often you could eat down there theres no ordure the pumpwater comes out bright and clean lewrie wondered aloud weve burned loose gunpowder buckets of tar not a damned preventative thats supposed to work works water casks emptied scoured wiz vinegar and sea water as well durant sadly agreed it was most odd though sir ze water casks we filled once we reach jamaica when we open zem wiz mister coote an his mate i find ze top of ze water thick wiz little nits set aside in a glass i cover wiz gauze i find zat mosquitoes hatch out i read of zis regarding slave ships calling at dahomey zat zey found nits in fresh water taken from running streams as well as still pools wiz ze gauze i filter ze water skim ze tops before we stow clean casks bellow zis time and ashore capitaine pardon ze expense but we found a shop zat sells extract of citron and candles made wiz citron they smell good aye better than the messdecks do now at any rate lewrie agreed with a firm nod of his head how expensive cheaper zan ze assafoetida herbs capitaine durant said right quickly to justify what was surely an unauthorised outlay besides ze assafoetida is very ard to find at present mais non ze merchant assures me zat if citron candles or if a mix of hot tar and citron oil is lit and let smoulder and fume ze house where they burn does not suffer malaria or yellow jack damme a cure lewrie exclaimed with great relief for uhm women of ze house it seem capitaine durant said with a weasely look men who are about business outside ze home are just as vulnerable but sir zose inside are protected ze citron i believe exudes a sweet miasma countering ze bad miasmas zat cause malaria and yellow jack regard capitaine durant said becoming agitated and cheerful waving off lewries justassudden scowling you go into ze forest you find ze poisonous plant or weed but every time growing close by is ze antidote nature will ave her balance nestce pas every grandmиre your grannies know of zis sickness follows contact wiz ze shore but after a week or two at sea ze number of ze stricken diminishes until ze next contact wiz shore citron candle and citron tar smokepots burning below by the hatchways perhaps hung all about ze upper deck after dark blocks ze insinuation of tropical miasmas sir how much lewrie asked again arms crossed in leeriness twenty pound ten shillings five pence capitaine five pound of my own some from mister hodsonzough he does not believe he will grasp at ze straw nestce pas some from mister shirley because he is desperate and ze rest uhm from ships funds sir for perfume lewrie scoffed for that was the only use he knew of for citron other than colouring or zesting desserts please i beg you let me try it capitaine ze merchant says it is well recommended on ze spanish main by ze portugese in brazil oh for gods sake mister durant he sold you a bill o goods if nozzing else msieur capitaine ze citron seems to drive ze pesky mosquito away durant insisted playing his final card aye then lewrie finally relented if for nothing else but a good nights sleep without all that buzzin and swattin ill let you try it spose we could write it off as an experiment god bless you capitaine lewrie merci merci beaucoup you will see i ave made up ze hot tar and citron oil already thankee for asking first sir lewrie scowled turning away to go below to his cabins mind you this turns out to be a cure for malaria and yellow jack put me down for a large share of the profit but of course msieur capitaine guaranteed durant said with a gush grandly doffing his plain hat and sweeping it down to the deck as he bowed his gratitude before scrambling down the ladder for the main companionway hatch and his medical stores below the transom sash windows were open wide the glazed panels in the coachtop overhead were propped open and a canvas windscoop ventilator caught what little air stirred in the millpondstill harbour but his greatcabins were still stifling lewrie stripped off his formal funeral finery and changed into a worn pair of white slop trousers trading his fancy hessian boots for a dowdy pair of calfskin slippers he sat at his desk with a topsilver palmetto fan clawing his neckstock off and opening his shirt aspinall brought him a glass of sugared lemon water silently padding about as if fearful of catching lewries eye hed been that deferential and insubstantial ever since the first deaths lewrie had a sip and pondered which onerous task hed undertake first sighing he plopped his feet atop his desk and slouched down in his chair feet aspraddle and crotch aired it was too warm and humid to cross ankles there was the matter of letters to write to the dead mens kin but at the moment he felt too enervated and too steeped in death to tackle that chore besides he had exhausted all the stock platitudes he knew for grief and it wouldnt feel quite right to pen an identical letter to all like an admiralty form for indentures or broken spars with so many dead dying or bedridden for weeks as they healed there was the watchandquarter bill to be amended but lewrie thought that would best be done in concert with lt langlie and the midshipmen who worked more closely with the hands than he perhaps have them all in for a working breakfast there was a cook to be discovered among the crew since poor old lamed curcy had been one of the first to pass over and the food issued since had been positively vile foster the yeoman of the powder would move up to gunners mate to replace poor mr bess whom theyd buried the last morning hed find another man handy with canvas and needles to replace the sailmakers mate young hickey if things went on as badly as they had so far fully half of those thirty sick men presently laid out fiat would die before the week was out he realised and the survivors wouldnt be worth tuppenny shit for two or three weeks more only two ordinary and two able seamen were lost so far but a fair number of the sick were the spryest topmen the young and experienced hands a ship could not do without and their replacements were half a world away due on the next hired supply ship and not expected to arrive before the end of hurricane season round october or november when the bulk of the liners returned from halifax and always had first choice damn them their captains and the seniority and favouritism that dictated the new mens dispersement not wishing to think about watchandquarter bills lewrie had another sip of sweet lemon water and scowled one eye asquint at his desk at his mail from england after the first rushed reading he wasnt so sure that he wanted to revisit those either damme pile it on why dont you he muttered to god or fate and thankee that trouble usually comes in threes plague uselessness and his personal life each one a horror the letters from his father sir hugo had been the easiest stood and had contained more pertinent information what little hed gotten from caroline had been pure vitriol for it seemed that another of those damned anonymous my dear friend you simply must know epistles had turned up on carolines doorstep and this time whoever the devil wrote them had known all and had told all regarding his visit to theoni connors london town house the day after caroline had stormed off for anglesgreen in high dudgeon how theoni had coached down to sheerness and had cohabited as man and wife with him for an entire week before proteus had sailed the anonymous writer had even named the inn and the placement of their set of rooms how early their candles were snuffed so much for time heals all wounds lewrie glumly thought once hed read carolines lone accusatory missive and you can chuck least said and soonest mended and absence makes the heart grow fonder over the side too and damn his father but he wrote about as superciliously as he looked with passages of sympathy interspersed with others bearing the tone of i told you so or even sour amusement as if writing one of his old cronies from the hellfire club or his first regiment about the peccadilloes of a total stranger over which they could both crow sophie continues rather wan lewrie read though she has taken up of late with the company of richard oakes one of harry embletons fellow roisterersone with some sense at bottom at the very least who is a captain of cavalry in the local yeomanry militia and shapes well as a soldier pity hes a first son not down for a set of colours like his brother roger he will however inherit substantial acreage and may be thought a prize catch in these parts dull as they may be you are aware though that somewhere along the line to carolines great furor you evidently gave permission for sophie and your own first officer lt anthony langlie a worthy unknown to me to correspond the arrival of a letter from jamaica is become a momentous event in your household and when the devil did i do that lewrie muttered to himself vowing that he and young langlie were due a hearttoheart meeting soonest a rather loud one he expected caroline of course dismissed the very idea at once damning all sailors as highly suspect which vocal and insistent disapproval has given sophies contrary nature made her the more eager to correspond just recall how your earlier disapproval of harry embleton almost drove her to elope with him to gretna green and damn his father some more but hed found it so amusing that he simply had to relate how once services were done two sundays past inspired perhaps by rev goodacres sermon on the forgiveness of sins your little charlotte accosted all and sundry in the church yard with the pronouncement that my daddys a sinner and a filthy beast in her usual loud and piercing voice extolling the congregation for their prayers embarassing of course but quite droll you must admit out of the mouths of babes as it were hey droll hell lewrie thought squirming anew in longdistance embarassment and caroline not so quick to shush her either that was followed by a long plaint as to how he was being cut or snubbed by the local gentry forced to spend more time on his farm aloneor being positively driven to flee up to london where his new town house was shaping mainwell and plans for a gentlemens hфtel and lodging club were coming together quite nicely thankee very much and the london season was lively and provided him much distracting solace and diverting amusement in their time of troubles as to those troubles but your brotherinlaw governour is hellish exercised nigh to choleric frenzy by your faithlessness and swears that he saw it coming years before but could not dissuade you or his dear sister from your folly he now goes about swearing that had he the occasion to confront you visage contre visage as the french say he would quite gleefully do you in for the shame you have brought upon the chiswick name the gentlemanly constricts of a duel bedamned lewrie had himself a skeptical snort over that threat governour was approaching twenty stone in weight and getting out of bed lately was enough to turn his visage choleric damn swords or pistols if it came to that hed challenge him to a foot race and see who keeled over first back during the revolution when governour was as lean and sinewed as a young panther it would have been a different proposition but good living and prosperity had taken its toll on that score his father had further written when last i took my midday meal at the red swan inn the churl actually dared to banter me your carcass not being immediately available i quickly informed mr chiswick that should he desire an early death i was more than willing to oblige him did he desire pistols at twenty paces i would await his seconds though it was no affair of mine and that his use of my presence as an excuse for his disgraceful and boastful behaviour would not be tolerated even by a gentleman of only the slightest acquaintance with you i further informed him that i found all his ranting to be due to your absence and not a thing he would do in your vicinity then following that slur did he wish aggrievance i told him that i would meet him that instant on the side lawn with a smallsword alan the weather has been most cooperative this spring and you should see how verdant the countryside is become the side yard your lawn and my newsodded ones have come up something wondrous to behold do you care to know he made a great show of apoplexy but sidewise demurred not refusing exactly and stated that his argument was with you not your poor old father at which shillyshally i brusquely informed him of the consequences of his rash intemperance assuring him that once you were returned to england you would be more than willing to confront him in any manner he wished and to temper his utterances with the sure certain and fatal risk to his self in mind and set me up for a killin duel lewrie gloomed thankee very damn much you old braggart you never did me any favours did ya sir hugo further carped that he now took his custom to the olde ploughman inn and that sterling beer notwithstanding he had never been so bored in his life nor entered such a seedy establishment than that comparable to a tumbledown irish shebeen or hindoo arrackdive poor him being forced to rub elbows with the common folk it seemed that caroline in a raging snit had determined that all plans for hugh to take colours as an army officer or even see the slightest glimpse of sea water all his born days much less go in his fathers disreputable footsteps as a midshipman in the royal navy were quite well scotched too sewallis and hugh she had written him would board away this fall at a school which stressed christian and classical preparation for the civilian country gentry life if not a career in the clergy which decision sir hugo had deemed a mortalpity in his letter decrying the waste of hugh at least who was so suited for a military or naval career caroline had portrayed the school differently of course and spitefully implied that it was the least expensive she could discover that still held the acceptable ton for hugh and sewalliss entry into society that they could no longer count upon their oftabsent and indifferent father in his meanness to fund a better schooling their new school was small shed written but not too far away in guildford and was run by a renowned and respected high church rector and his equally virtuous wife well recommended by the reverend goodacre at least your sons will grow up in proper fear of the lord under a strict christian tutelage that imparts modest and humble moral behaviour even if you were deprived of such sir sewallis and hugh i vow will never emulate you and to his greater sorrow caroline no longer thought that any purpose would be served by any correspondence from him nor would they be allowed the distraction of writing back his sons had greeted that edict with much wailing and weeping she had confessed but the least said soonest mended and out of sight out of mind i know that boys shed their grief after a season unlike girls after a time the rigours of education the distractions of games and healthy sports would engross their interests making your memory an eminence gris one best left unseen and unthought of hence sir sooner or later quite justly forgotten as all ogres merit damn but that felt so unfair right so hed strayed rather like a rutting bull run from his pasture admittedly but to turn his children against him actively encourage their hatred break their hearts and send them weeping and snuffling just for spite and revenge well that was simply too much lewrie shook his head in sorrowful wonder that his sweet and gentle wife who made such a do about the works of christian charity and forgiveness would go so far as to seem a medea who would slay her children to get her own back against that bootless jason poor little tykes was his first thought wonder what this will cost me was his second in comparison the thick packet of letters from theoni connor one for every week hed been gone were a drink oн cool water ambrosia of the olympian gods rather than the gall and dirt that caroline had offered up oh they were so chatty so informative about her doings how her firstborn michael was sprouting and how much joy their son alan james connor provided her now that he was toddling and beginning to babble almost comprehensible words scandals in society in which theirs didnt signify thankee jesus political rumours from supper parties among the powerful notice of naval actions farther afield from his own bailiwick and firm devoted fond and teasing love most especially the nonjudgmental kind of love to her lights he was still a paragon a hero her own true blue heart of oak one who could do no wrong and though we may never dare show our affection in public yet every night i clutch my pillows proud to be your amour dear alan and sometimes find it hard to eschew a ringing declaration of the fact of us to one and all and bedamned to their disapproval you just keep up that eschewing old girl lewrie thought with a groan or two for the consequences squirming some more in his chair groping at his crutch in remembered fever and thinking that he should write her back instanter to warn her about that anonymous scribbler so eager to ruin his life sooner or later he could find a target for his bile closer to home and heap calumny on her as well but it was so hot and still and he was so very tired and worn down to a nubbin by his cares that any task involving anything more of him than slouching and brooding felt quite beyond him at the moment faintly he heard groans from up forrud and below on the messdeck there came a retching noise a weak oh god save me from one of the sick or dying he knew not which as one of the fevers caused a sailor to void his stomach there was nothing he could do to help them he now realised in grim sorrow durants citrontar fumes would avail or not and only god would decideit was beyond him all he could do was bide his time til the next death the next drear funeral the next grief he closed his eyes lolled back his head and tried to nap to find at least a little mindless temporary escape in unaware sleep chapter twentysix now it was fourteen hands dead and buried proteus still lay immobile from her best bower and stern kedge anchors moored seemingly forever in a slough of despond days after the ships of the line had departed to summer on the north american station at halifax taking with them hundreds upon hundreds of whole fit and healthy sailors their crews made up to full capacity or even beyondsailors lewrie would have happily killed for just for some of them the merest pittance of reenforcement was there a single bright spot to their situation mr durant had provided it for the liberal use of smouldering guttering citron candles and hot tar and citron oil pots seemed to have cut the number of new men infected almost to nothing even still moored near the miasmic jamaican shore which should have been a ready source of new infection oh there were still over fourty hands sick or staggering weakly on light duty as they mended and of those sick durant expected at least five or six more to succumb mostly to yellow jack which was a much more pernicious disease the bulk of the crew who had gone sick had caught malaria which was manageable with chichona bark extract a man could live with malaria despite the unpredictable recurring bouts that would follow him the rest of his days hodson and durant had assured him the surgeon could no longer assure lewrie of anything he was the thirteenth corpse to be laid to rest ashore wearing out his strength in caring for others coxn andrews had expressed the thought that mr shirley had perished of shame and guilt for not being able to do more or save more that had presented lewrie with a vexing problem of explaining to durant that his warrant as surgeons mate was predated by mr hodson making him senior and earning him promotion to actingsurgeon instead of durant durant had taken it with seeming good grace disappointed though he was hodson was risen from a doctors apprentice before he joined the navy whilst durant had been a trained and certified doctor in france before the revolution and the terror educated even beyond the usual damnednear as well as a university educated englishman who could merit the prestigious title of physician and be addressed as a doctor instead of the mister of a mere surgeon lewrie had tried to assure him that it was the perverse way of the service not a slur upon his nationality mr durant had squinted his eyes in the faintest expression of painhells bells perhaps in frustration or simple bitterness in the face of british prejudiceand had said no more i assure you mister durant my reports to superiors mention your stalwart efforts your acumen and your dauntless fervour along with your countering sweet miasma theory with the citron oil extract lewrie had stressed almost going to his knees to beg his pardon and i know who is the better man but damned seniority rules me else id name you in charge this instant sir the staffcaptain durant had merely shrugged philosophically once more then gone forward and below and lewrie was sure that hed lost him as if one more thing could go wrong aye the staffcaptain sir edward bloody charles too when lewrie had taken his reports over to giddy house and fort charles he had found a new source of worry and aggravation this time there had been no chummy glass of claret for him no clubmans wing chair captain blaylock describes you prettymuch as i expected you to turn out captain lewrie sir edward had gravelled from behind his desk face as frownish as a stout bulldogs rash intemperate selfcentred obstreperous and nearly insubordinate ah but you will have your own way go your own way orders bedamned will you not i consider that an unfair characterisation sir lewrie told him as reasonably and as moderately as he could i decide how you are characterised sir sir edward had barked in full dyspepsia im also aware of your foolhardiness over this indirect gunfire support good god man you could have killed half our own soldiers but i didnt sir general sir harold lamb was most appreciative of it he sent admiral parker a letter about it i have a copy of it lewrie had shot back unable to stifle his combative nature in the face of an injustice to his repute captain blaylock of halifax seemed eager to emulate our work next morning did he sir lewrie asked did he kill anyone from our side when he took my anchorage sir no he did not sir edward had truculently admitted but he only fired a few rounds before our troops reenforced by the regiments he landed retook enough of their old perimeter beyond the range of his carronades poor blaylock lost his first lieutenant duncan along with three seamen shot from ambush captain lewrie by sneaking lowdown skulkers bad as jonathon riflemen officers deliberately targeted bah poor duncan lewrie thought feeling fey and queasy knew iwas talkin to a dead man last time i saw him price you pay when you go huntin fame and glory my condolences sir but i lost two midshipmen under much the same circumstances lewrie had replied and a damn good reason never to engage in such harebrained idiocy sir edward had glowered only a perfect lunaticd dare it captain lewrie someone daft as you i dare say aye we received sir harolds letter but hes a bloody soldier so what does he know of things both admiral parker and i concur in deeming your experiment a madhatter exercise and are considering sending a letter of censure to admiralty unless you are thinking of ever doing it again hmmm things had gone downhill from there no the ships of the line needed every fit sailor they had to work them north so proteus could not have a one of them sir edward feared that with the fleet so reduced by fevers already sending him healthy men would be good money after bad since proteus was still a raging pesthouse where valuable hands would quickly sicken and die and no neither the shore hospitals nor the other vessels could at present spare a warrant surgeon to replace poor mr shirley with so many ill to tend no surgeons mates were available either so lewrie would have to soldier on shorthanded no the cost of citron oil and candles could not be reimbursed from admiralty funds did captain lewrie wish his ship to smell nice and cover the funk of vomit that was his own lookout and the costs could come from his own pocket sir heres my report on how surgeons mate durant reduced the rate of infection by the use of citron oil much like the purchase of fresh fruit eliminates scurvy which is covered by admiralty well if your rate of new infection is dropping so precipitously sir edward had haughtily sniffed you really do not have need of a surgeon or extra surgeons mate do you i still have fourty hands sick and they need care sir with so many so weak on light duties barely able to rise from their beds sir then you may remain in harbour til theyre well and take joy of the port sir sir edward had chuckled over the rim of a glass of claret though with your crew still infectious there will be no more shore liberty you understand might not even be able to fetch off the bumboatmen and their doxies til your diseases have passed and gone oh but hed enjoyed ordering that you will not place your ship out of discipline therefore do you wish as i gather you do to amuse yourself ashoreyou and your officersliberty will be allowed to you and them of course sir edward had had himself a hearty simper over thatun as if gossip about lewries personal life had made its way as far as the west indies at last speaking of officers sir lewrie had said leaping for the opportunity and letting the slur slide off his back like water off a ducks i am one commission officer and two midshipmen short sir edward had gotten a crafty look had simpered and chuckled to himself a tad as if contemplating which of his many lieutenants on the west indies station was possibly the most despised and useless to the fleet whom he could lumber on lewrie lewrie had realised that sir edward would rather prefer to deny him everything but that was too blatant an act of prejudice one that could be documented and complained about to officials in london and sure that sir edward was a toplofty prig who would have no use for a midshipman come from the lower deck up through the hawsehole hed further said i spose i could promote a pair of quartermasters mates or a pair of literate seamen as acting midshipmen sir but he winced as if the very idea was disgusting to him as well no no sir edward had countered at once waving off the idea and sloshing a few drops of wine over the papers on his desk better i send a brace of young gentlemen aboard your ship along with a new officer your lingering maladies notwithstanding ill think of someone promising and aspiring then hed gotten a fresh sly look that had almost put a cold chill down lewries spine sure that captain sir edward charles would saddle him with his very best slackwits drunks or droolers but you cannot spare a surgeon or surgeons mate sir lewrie had queried as if it were inexplicable to him with hundredsnay thousandsmore sick or dying sir i think not sir edward had harrumphed you must do your best with what you have in that regard for i cannot spare anyone very well sir and once proteus is pronounced clean of disease once more may i have your permission to hold recruiting rondys ashore sir but of course captain lewrie sir edward most grudgingly allowed knowing that the first sign of a press gang or recruiting party setting foot ashore would stampede every ablebodied male on jamaica to the hills the threat of death at the hands of the maroons bedamned once manned close to requirements sir what would be my orders after that lewrie had pressed why put back to sea to patrol captain lewrie sir edward had come nigh to sneering admiral parker and i will remain here through hurricane season i think a close patrol of hispaniola both the french half which we just abandoned as well as the spanish halfyou do recall were still at war with the dons do you not thatd suit quite admirably since you have trouble following orders perhaps a roving commission til you run out of rations would do quite well time apart to ponder your faults out of sight out of mind sir lewrie had dared say completely out of mind and sight lewrie completely very good sir lewrie loafed on the quarterdeck under a vast sailcloth awning stretched beamtobeam to provide a welcome bit of shade and cool dimness for some reason the awning seemed to create a breezeway that drew zephyrs beneath it the way a tent never would the awning trapped the smell of tar and citronoil pots now doctored with liberal doses of ground sulfur to improve their efficacy but that was a small price to pay for a breeze to chill the sweat on his shirt and ice him down in the process despite the many ill shipwork continued stays still had to be tensioned worn runningrigging still had to be spliced rerove or replaced sails still had to be hung and dried to prevent mildew and the sailmaker still had to sew and patch emptied kegs still had to be undone and the staves bound up for reuse decks still had to be scrubbed and washed laundry still had to be aired along with bedding from the gundeck sleeping quarters and most certainly from the sick bay his crew those of them still on their pins were having a make and mend day almost a ropeyarn sunday of purposeful idleness free of drills with lashings of fresh fruit and scuttlebutts of fresh water on hand the gig launch and cutter were overside angling out from the single bowpainters so their seams and caulking their planks could soak up water and swell back to watertightness more hot tar sulfur smells arose from the gundeck where hands knelt and crept as they plied heated loggerheads over freshly tarred deck seams to melt the tar and oakum into the gaps to restore watertightness against the rain as well lewrie saw midshipman grace by his fathers side helping him take tentative weak steps to get his strength back now that the last bouts of fever had left him lewrie also saw his two new midshipmen mister david burns and mister george larkin and he could not help but scowl at them burns was a pimply darkhaired scarecrow a mouthbreather who gulped quite often else hed have drowned in his own spittle his family had left it late and had only sent him to sea at fourteen now with one certified year at sea he still gawped about as if just wakened from a trance wondering where the devil he was he was blankly pleasant a perpetual cypher whom lewrie was sure had been hustled off to sea for the navy to care for for his young but widowed mother surely could not or would not and probably had promising prospects for remarriage if only she disposed of her hopeless git it was an old story young george larkin was mostlike born an unwelcome bastard an angloirish byblow of a wealthy absentee landowner and some daughter of a poor tenant he was stout almost knobbly at elbows knees and shoulders possessed of an unfortunate nose so irish pugged that it was more swinish than anything elsehe stood a fair chance from drowning did he look up at a driving raintopped by an unruly shock of strawcoloured hair larkin at least had some wits about him a cheerful mien and an evereager anxiousness to please and perservere quite unlike poor mr burns who tended to stare gape and gulp a lot with his eyes only half focused on the task at hand larkin was poor as a church mouse his uniform a seedy melange of issue slopclothing and the cheapest coat waistcoat and hat ever found in a trash pile or looted from a corpse he was sixteen with three years of duty at sea and was at least tarryhanded naturally the crew had taken to the little ape as they never would with mr burns theyd pity burns and try to keep him from tripping over his own feet but lewrie had conferred with mr winwood and at his recommendation had promoted one of his masters mates to make up the sixth midshipman that proteus rated jemmy merriam now mister james merriam was midtwenties and as salty as anyone could wish though it was hard to be a gentlemantobe over former forecastle messmates merriam was so far coping but at the same time merriam was junior to everyone in the orlop cockpit even to burns larkin and little grace and how he kept a straight face below with them in the offduty hours lewrie had no idea try as he might sir edward just couldnt conjure up a replacement lieutenant for them so mr adair had been confirmed as an officer lewrie strongly suspected that captain charles had had a few runners in mind each about as thick as an anchor stock but might have felt that burns and larkin were trials enough for his leastfavourite captain on station even he at the last could not be utterly vindictive lewrie had just settled down in his folding canvas and wood deck chair a contraption that most other seadog captains would look upon as dangerously luxurious with his feet up on the taffrail flag lockers pennywhistle to his mouth and toulon curled up napping beside his feet on the lockers he essayed a scale then launched into a gay hornpipe when the midshipman of the watch shouted hoy the boat there mr larkin shrilled hoy the ark a booming voice rejoined is noah aboard who sir larkin gawped never expecting such a challenge your captain laddy buggerin camels is he both male and female did he take aboard the voice posed rather loudly aye hes aboard sir and who would you be come acallin colonel christopher bloody cashman the lord of plunder lewrie whooped in glee and got to his feet his music forgotten captain sir unfortunate mr burns said doffing his hat as he came to the quarterdeck but theres a drunk soldier alongside is asking for you and he gulped a time or two fretfully tell him im fucking a zebra lewrie said with a chuckle i cant tell him that sir burns said so embarrassed that his face paled making his acne stand out like bubonic buboes make it carnal knowledge ofnever mind ill tell him lewrie said gladly trotting to the entryport to lean over and wave permission tscamper up that wee ladder thing sir cashman cried standing unsteadily in the gently rocking rowboat ive come tget you drunk admiral lewrie and ill not be denied dammit all the zebra i was stuffin was a virgin you reprobate so this had better be good lewrie called down to the great amusement of his crew half dozen o jeanpierres best bubbly admiral noah cashman promised displaying a bottle from a strawpacked case at his feet in the rowboats bilges aye then scamper on up that ladder thing general cashman chapter twentyseven so this is the infamous toulon cashman said stripping away his scarlet tunic neckstock and waistcoat as a seaman fetched in the crate of bottles he tossed his uniform at the starboardside settee then plunked into an upholstered chair reaching out to the desk where the cat sat hunkered down over his front paws uncertain of this newcomers antecedents meow puss killed any rats lately he asked as he offered fingers under toulon s nose a moment later and toulon was on his side tail lashing and head writhing in bliss to be petted fickle bastard lewrie grumbled ah aspinall kindly take the tompion from the muzzle of one of those bottles and run it out in battery for us will you theres a good lad what is that smell cashman asked wrinkling his nose tar citron oil and sulfur lewrie chuckled our surgeons mates are still tinkerin with the formula but its cut the number of men who come down sick and run off the flies and mosquitoes like satan breakin wind under clean sheets cashman hooted takes our minds off the bilges and the peasoup farts lewrie told him as aspinall produced a loud thwockl and a flying cork which made toulon scramble to his paws and fly off the desk to intercept it good flutes were filled the bottle stood on the desk then aspinall faded back into his tiny pantry damn fine even warm aahhh damn fine lewrie said after a first tentative sip well not see its like this side of paris any longer cashman mourned jeanpierre and maman escaped portauprince and took all their wine cellars with em their cooks their families and their best girls hired a schooner emptied their house o furnishings and plate chests and chests o money and all and headed for charleston mighty tempting target all that pelf lewrie speculated with a frown whos tsay the crew wont turn pirate for an hour or two and have em over the side took a half dozen o their bullybucks armed to the teeth and their girls and kin as well cashman snickered topping them up once more doubt theyd have any trouble on that score by the by your darlin henriette sends her love when in charleston look her up she says thatll be the day lewrie scoffed mustve made a hellish impression on her old son but then you have that effect on all the willin little biddies dont ya hey hah lewrie replied even while wondering if even cashman had heard rumours from home by now so whats the occasion alan my boy were havin a wake a proper old irish wake in honour of someone somethin that just died cashman grimly stated you came to the wrong place to celebrate death kit ive lost fourteen so far with five or six more lookin peaky lewrie objected miser cashman countered i lost nigh half the regiment by now shot or butchered on saint domingue or to the fevers already mourned them no i refer to the regiment itself and my military career with it theyll disband em lewrie gawped sitting up straighter in the process cashman spat called us excess to requirements now weve no major campaign to wage oh theres still a deal o work wantin down on grenada and saint vincent takin on the black caribs and the real caribs but its no concern of ours theyll chuck ledyard beauman then lewrie surmised god i can understand sheddin him but you general maitland had you on his staff last year you told me surely he doesnt mean to tip you out with the bathwater doubledealin sonofabitch cashman growled tossing back his glass so quick that half of it flooded his shirtfront he and that louverture were correspondit all the time did you know it secret negotiations were goin on even whilst we were bleedin and sweatin in those woods fightin like we really meant it men died while he was dancin to and fro with our enemy hell the last week before the evacuation we fought louverture seven times he beat us seven times but each time thered be secret letters flyin back and forth well ya lost here my dear maitland so will ya give in no then how bout thisun maitland sayin didnt we bleed ya enough still have soldiers and arms for another try mdear toussaint oh dear now will you pack it in mon cher maitland pah even did maitland get down on his hands and knees and beg me to stay with the colours even throw in fellatio id still spit in his goddamned face well i never lewrie said with a groan as disgusted as kit cashman he had lost sevier and nicholas inman and shirley and poor old lt duncan had died all those lost to malaria and yellow jack had died in a sham as a way to save a generals reputation before some amateur black rebel slave outsoldiered him the bastard wont get him titled cashman sarcastically snickered no thanks of the crown for him when he goes home if maitlandd stuck it out louverture wouldve strewed us dead on the beaches hedve had another week so i can see the temptation to sign anything and get out louverture dessalines petion and christophe theyre damn good alan samboe versions o julius caesar with more troops under their command than xerxes brought to greece poorarmed but even so they just swamp right over you pick up the guns from their dead and keep right on comin fine they beat us fair and square and so what what really irks me though old son cashman leaned forward on his elbows on the desktop grating deep in his throat with eyes slit in fury he wrote his letters behind the backs of his own men damn him he couldve told us after the first couple o defeats and he saw how things stood he could o told us he was negotiatin he could o asked for a truce and ill lay you any odds ya wish old toussaint louverture wouldve granted it he didnt want any more o his men killed either hundreds o men would still be alive the battle that broke my damn regiment need neverve been bloody fought maybe louverture would have gone right on and fought us kit drivin out a white british armys one thing but slaughterin them to the last man on the beaches is another his message to the world us leavin with our tails twixt our legs aint enough of a message cashman waved this off leaning back in his chair and tossing down his fresh glass of champagne shit alan thats shit and ya know it louverture aint through fightin theres still the spaniards in the east h ants ttake on theres still that halfcaste general rigaud down in south province against him theres probably some of his very own generals just slaverin like hounds for a shot at power too no louverture wants tstay alive and in charge liberate the entire island of hispaniola hell the whole damn west indies he needed thusband the army he had hes too smart tthrow it away on gestures and messages to the world struth so whatll you do lewrie asked stretching to refill his own glass resign or wait to be retired ask for a court cashman told him brightening a touch get my record cleared make sure everyone knows for certain it was that fool ledyard who lost it for us see alan maitland and his staff are lookin for scapegoats and damned if ill play goat maitland holds a courtmartial and blames beauman for losin him the battle that cost him the entire campaign why he can go back to england smellin like a bed o spring roses the regular armyll love it cause what can ya expect from yeomanry militia volunteers and amateur officers pile up a big smelly heap o shit over here then you hardly notice the reek from over yonder dye see then no onell take maitland to task for conspirin with the enemy thats what you can deem secret letters with the foe you could almost call it treason and thats a hangin offence no matter what your rank or titles hell never allow it lewrie said after a long moment to mull it over ya dont think ledyard beauman doesnt know about maitland and louverture negotiating already better for ledyard his lawyer will know of it and how to use it the royal navys just as eager to cover its arse when someones mucked it i know ive seen it close at hand kit better for maitland to explain to horse guards that he was grossly outnumbered and swamped by bloody waves of fanatics then only opened negotiations when he saw he had no chance to win he saved his army he saved the civilians on saint domingue by wangling a promise that louverture wouldnt take reprisal on em remember kit i was at yorktown and oh that tale again cashman waved it off lord cornwallis had had his arse kicked from the cape fear to yorktown then got himself stuck like a bung in a barrel countin on the fleet tsave him did graves hood or denby pay for failing him christ no they didnt did cornwallis pay for losin the last army wed be able to raise losin the war for losin the colonies at one stroke hell no to that too they still love him this latest rebellion in ireland weve heard about that french landing under general humbert theyre sending cornwallis tsort it out so maitland wont pay either cashman said as he squinted at his old friend rather squiffily by then end of his active career mostlike kit and no honours but hell flap away as free as a dove with not a harsh word said to him you just watch and see lewrie prophecied and everyonell say what a pity when just one more regiment one more battery just a wee bit more luck and wed have conquered the place and were better off out of there anyway dye see hell write his memoirs and prove it wasnt a bit of his doing and nothingll get in the way of that so before you pile up your stink hell shed you and ledyard disband yer regiment and then its least said soonest mended for everyone not for me damn yer eyes cashman thundered its my honour my good name thats dragged in the mud without a court itll always be me who funked it twill be me whos whispered about laughed about ill not have it alan if i have to challenge maitland too once im a civilian oh dont talk rot kit lewrie scoffed half worried now the beaumans have already begun whitewashin his odour kit snapped repouring from the bottle which was already deeply drained their newspaper friends those papers sent to england on the packets two three months more and ill be all over the london rags as the one who cut and ran people in town already im bein snubbed goin to the other side of the street when i walk by gazin skyward with a cut sublime out at our camp wives and children widows come to find what happened to their menfolk and i in the privacy of lewries greatcabins the indomitable christopher cashman began to snuffle and swipe at his eyes with his shirt sleeves making lewrie wince in pain for him yet avert his eyes so as not to stare too directly and shame him to see someone unmanned private soldiers know the truth they try ttell their folks but the way they still glare at me alan its so cashman wept suddenly he smashed a fist on the desktop so hard he made the glasses the bottle inkwell and correspondence box jump damn beauman damn him and his kin damn all those rich stuckup bastards and bitches thell and gone theyll ruin me to save that useless goddamned pinch o pig shit take all i have take my honour and all ive done before run me outta jamaica like an untouchable hindoo too low caste tswamp out a toilet make me sell up for a pence to the pound and lose evry farthing ive invested here well ill not have it ill find a way tget my own back if it means that i murder ledyard or murder em all now youre really talking rot kit lewrie spat back think with your head not your pride for gods sake want tend up hanged then wheres your honour or your good name hey lewrie tossed back his own glass of champagne then took assay of the bottle on the desk talking fools out of idiocy was dry work he bent down to extract a second bottle from the wood case and ripped away the lead foil gave the cork a twist and opened a replenishment topping them both up and tossed toulon a new playpretty duelin hims better remember duelin lewrie asked once he had taken another deep sip what you talked about on saint domingue not two weeks ago ill stand as your second god help me let em retire the both of you theres no kings regulations preventing two former officers from fightin you blow great holes in him or slice him to pork chops theres your revenge but hell cry off id bet and thatll prove hes the liar and a coward to boot then youre able tsell up justified might not get full price even so but the buyersll be gettin a fair bargain and not robbin ya blind he cant deny me alan his brotherll make him so so you kill him all legallike and take shilling to a pound lewrie snapped nigh exasperated with trying to make sense to a drunk a twentieth or tenth of yer worth beats poverty all hollow old son and the bastardll be dead cashman said half to himself as if the end result had just occurred to him beginning to beam as if he had just discovered the joy of it thats the point aint it lewrie maliciously grinned dont know cashman said sighing and reaching for the resh bottle for a refill shaking his head like a disappointed tot denied a surprise from town by a thoughtless daddy doesnt seem enough somehow not by half it dont well you could have him raped by a cart horse first lewrie suggested throwing his hands aloft and sinking back in his chair my god kit what is enough besides your honour your good name reasonable profit from your properties and public acquittal that is i dunno christopher said with a semidrunk shrug pillage his lands burn his house down poison his wells and livestock an end to the whole beauman line his sister lucy excepted aye spare the whores and the simple lewrie sneered they at least have their uses run his slaves off to the maroons in the mountains cashman fantasised blood and thunder and gore abubble behind his eyes spare me a halfdozen stronguns when you do kit im sorely in need of hands lewrie suggested hells bells even if theyre nought but simpleminded soldiers id gladly take some of your wharf rats when your regiment gets broken up need fresh marines too theyll parcel em out to tother understrength unitsoh cashman said perking up like a wakened cat and sitting more upright almost managing to resemble sober his phyz became suffused by a grin one of the sly sort filled with impish mischief slowly like a highlatitude sunrise he peered at lewrie then winked what lewrie demanded perked to the edge of his own chair how many marines did you say you were short alan cashman enquired with a soft smugly satisfied chuckle we could use five lewrie told him delighted at the offer he thought was coming not that hed relish gaining hands from a friends misfortune but neither was he loath to refuse soontobe unemployed volunteers not when hed considered stopping american merchant ships once back at sea and pressganging anyone who had even a slight english accent or the slightest error in his citizenship certificate and god knew threequarters of those were bogus or given or sold by an american consul like so many cough lozenges ill have a word with the best men i have cashman promised hallelujah theres still some have a taste for soldierin cashman said tittering with impending glee or so calfheaded i can talk em into it but alan but but mine arse lewrie quipped what tell me you sot you dont mind black sailors do you alan not a bit already have some think i always have had every ship ive ever served theyre good hands too so no it dont signify if they were eskimos lewrie assured him your slaves how many dye think youd need then cashman asked avoiding the query though hugging his sides in a tittering fit a round dozend suit lewrie allowed make landsmen of em for pulleyhauley chores some younguns might make topmen sooner or later and damme lewrie began to enthuse id kill for just one older one who knows how to cook decent for an hundred or so would it be too much to ask for one of em tbe a cook oh i think we can arrange that cashman promised becoming even more mystifying youre not askin me to buy your slaves are you kit lewrie asked growing wary of a sudden damme if im that keen on slavery after all you told me and damned if i can afford em not even at a shilling to the pound so not mine alan old son and free scotfree whose then lewrie said with a chary scowl ledyard beaumans cashman hooted slapping the desktop mine arse on a bandbox lewrie exclaimed in wonder itd be sweet wouldnt it cashman managed to say just about wheezing with mirth by then sweet revenge for one you sail out to portland bight soon some dark night and abscond with some of his slaves younguns like you said so they havent been branded or had their backs whipscarred yet so whos tsay whose they are once on your ship i know some black freedmen who can get to em and promise em theyll be free if they ship with you what dye say lewrie fell back into his chair astounded by the idea giving the proposition a hard think beginning to chew a thumbnail taking slaves liberating slaves was just about the worst crime in the west indies right up there with horse theft and a hanging offence damme but i do need em hellishbad he thought but the risk of getting caught and the ramifications would be equally hellishbad hed be stripped of his command courtmartialed cashiered and sent home in disgrace at the very leastsent home to face a termagant wife disaffected kiddies and another scandal as bad as this one with theoni and his bastard the navy was all that he knew and without a civilian career hed be in debtors prison before a year was out he just knew it before that though thered be the civil courts here on jamaica that would mostlike scrag him by the neck so why worry about infamy in england sooner or later someoned talk kit lewrie schemed sass from a slave who didnt get to go damme dont ya think theyd miss em raise the hue and cry remember there was a frigate offshore the night they scarpered and put two and two together ledyard none of the beaumans would know one of their slaves by sight less they were house servants cashman said dismissively of his qualms no brands no worries first off theyd hunt em northward if they thought theyd run off to join the maroons and you can depend on me tplant that rumour even offer tlead the hunt but later ill be sellin up anyway cashman went on puttin my own slaves on the block so whos tsay i didnt sell you some o mine with a certified bill of sale tprove it or manumitted em before ya lured em aboard we can forge some papers give em other names like father like son lewrie thought recalling sir hugos doings back when hed pressganged him into the navy so he could get his paws on the supposed inheritance from granny lewrie way off in devon because hed needed the money hellishbad to clear his debts before he lost his st jamess square house and got slung into prison himself his father had ended up running to oporto in portugal after his scheme had gone bellyup lisbons nice and cheap lewrie speculated if all else fails a rogue on the run could live well there wines good hmmm ill even throw in a cook from my own stock cashman cooed well if we sent ships boats inshore on a moonless night and kept proteus hulldown lewrie muttered hellish row though like a cuttingout expedition id never be able tlet em take shore liberty with the other hands though do ye think theyd want trun the risk any more than you hey those you get the ones i said i sold couldve been sold to a trader from the bahamas who took em away so your name never appears in it what dye say alan you know id have to sail off to hell and gone right after lewrie pointed out i wouldnt be here to second you when you duel ledyard reprovisioned id be gone for four or five months at the least do i not run out of hands for prize crews right so i kill him first then we steal his slaves cashman merrily suggested itd make sense that theyd run with him dead and no wife or heirs ttake em over and god knows where theyd get sold after id be in port til you and he get retired then you duel him then we steal his slaves lewrie scoffed captain sir edward bloody charles wont let me linger a minute more than necessary so i get someone else tbe my second i spose cashman decided disappointed wanted you there tsavour the moment if for no other reason but perhaps its best you were gone when it happens less way tlink your name the slaves disappearance and all hmmm lewrie gnawed a cuticle more deeply giving it another hard think perhaps it would be best he thought to be well to windward when the shit started flying he and his clerk padgett could do up freedmens papers for his new volunteers and it would be a grand jape on that ass ledyard beauman what are the dues dye think to join the slavery abolition society he said offering his hand across the desk chapter twentyeight hoy the boats lieutenant langlie hissed into the darkness as hms proteus fretfully rocked and rolled on the scend three miles off portland point blackbirds coxn andrews hooted back and everyone gathered on the gangway let out a huge sigh of relief moments later the boats were thudding against the hull and people were scampering up the manropes and boardingbattens eyes and teeth gleaming in wonder and delight reflecting the single lanthorn theyd dared display there were only eleven of them ten youngsters and one thicker older man with grizzled grey hair they came with small packs of possessions bound up in castoff pillowcases or shirts barefoot wearing ragged nankeen or sailcloth trousers worn gauzythin by work loose and ending above the knees topped with shapeless stained pullover shirts without collars just neckholes and equally frayed for a long moment they just stood in stupefied wonder taking in the height of the masts the guns the mazes of rigging and most of all the sea of white faces confronting them shying into a tight group elbow to elbow as if this suddenly seemed like a bad idea and the price of freedom too high sure and i hope one o ye knows how tcook landsman furfy cried breaking their stricken tableau ah does the older man said gideons me name welcome aboard then mate furfy gushed stepping forward to take him by the hand and pump it energetically shoulda seen what we been doin with good rations itd sicken a goat you boys come on now morley one of the black seamen urged stepping forward and waving to the other halfdozen fellow blacks among the crew to join him making the newcomers nervously grin dont be standin round capum wants ya tsee th surgeons mates get bathed an into new clothes make yer marks an sign ships books cold rations awaitin another promised then a bit o kip in yer new hammocks last allnightin yell have who de capum one of the newcomers asked peering about him dere capum lewrie morley pointed out lewrie had thought it best to turn out in his newest uniform to welcome them aboard to impress them from the first he stood apart on the quarterdeck hands behind his back the youngster came toward him eyes alight as if hed seen jesus and fell to his knees at his feet tankee massa tankee oh for gods sake lewrie muttered wondering again if this was a bad idea himself dont do that get up man im not your massa i dont own you no the navy does and if that aint a sort o slavery ill eat me hat lewrie had to think as he helped the youngster up whats your name youngun calls me cambridge sah cambridge is all your mothers choice lewrie asked or your masters nossah the teenager shyly grinned mama call me noble noble youll be then noble lah lewrie he carefully pronounced god no lewrie had to bark in amusement im in enough of a stink with my wife already uhm noble hood hoods a great admiral in the navy a knacky fighting man noble hood yassuh noble hood the boy happily agreed well let you choose new names all of you lewrie told them in a louder voice names thatll never fetch your old masters suspicion once on ships books with papers showing you as free men you wont have to fear being taken so think it over whilst you see the surgeons mates mister hodson and mister durant then well fit up the washdeck pump that idea seemed to make them shy back together all sailors do it when they sign aboard a new ship lewrie explained patiently wash off the shore stinks and get baptised in salt water like a church baptism when babies get named he extemporised quickly dont nobody baptise us sah the older man gideon said in a jocular tone dot fo white folks then its about time aint it sir lewrie quipped did they not church you mr winwood asked of a sudden coming forward and sounding indignant did they not tell you of being washed in the blood of the lamb of being good christians preach at us now an then sah one told him dey say dot we arter be good christians but baptism and a washing then winwood enthused clapping his hands at the prospect to cleanse your souls as you take your free names to wash slavery from you forever and baptise you as sailors the finest calling in the world recalltwas sailors that jesus first made his disciples simple fishermen and sailors let me sir he almost pled turning to lewrie ill attend to it it appears ive gained sailors and you converts sir lewrie chuckled pray god sir that i have souls delivered up to the lord ill leave you to it

langlie run the ships boats round astern well tow them til after dawn quarters lewrie ordered lets get way on her and make an offing soueastbyeast for now aye aye sir langlie replied still looking worried lewrie clapped his hands behind his back once more and paced to the railing overlooking the waist feeling like breaking out into jigdancing it had worked they had pulled it off and hopefully no one was the wiser he saw andrews and the last of the boat crews climbing up to the deck and went forward to speak to him how did it go andrews lawd o mercy sah andrews answered shaking his head sadly id forgot how evil dey treat people warnt one o dot mista ledyard beaumans big plantins just a drunk overseer twatch em so i think we got away clean but you never see such misry mamas an papas

fo de second comin next year in jerusalem lewrie muttered to andrewss puzzled look he explained what the jews say for better times coming yessah andrews replied with a shrug good langlie had gotten proteus moving at last the steady noreast trades now coming up her stern as he directed the crew to wear her off the wind before rounding up on larboard tack to the soueast somethin odd ashore though sah andrews continued someone see you lewrie almost blanched in alarm nossah some thing andrews said sending a premonitory shiver up lewries back ya know deys seals in dese waters sah deys been hunted almos out but deys some still about seals lewrie exclaimed feeling fit to burst with fey dread of the old pagan cess that seemed to follow him from hms jester to a new frigate a benign and benevolent sea gods protection dey started barkin and splashin an i thought everbody was gonna die o fright til we saw what dey was sah andrews chuckled swam out with us dey did rollin an snortin so close dey made it hard tkeep de stroke fo de oarsmen leadin us sah out to de deep water stayed with us almos right to de side sah den disappeared lewrie dashed to the landward the larboard side to peer out almost anxiously for a glimpse of them but the night was black and the sea was ebon with only tropic starlight to gleam off whitecaps and horses as the deep ocean waves met the shore and the rebounding echoes of those that had crashed on the beaches hours before there he thought espying a misplaced whitecap between wavetops in a trough the faintest quickest glimpse of a head a flash of eyes as briefly chatoyant as a cats from the single burning lanthorn lambent and large approving seahounds eyes then the apparition was gone as if it had never been as if he had wished it to be leaving him grinning when he should have been deflated with disappointment and dread of his crime damme if i dont feel weve done something right tonight lewrie said even was it wrong aye sah there came a whoop as a newcome was hosed down under the force of the washdeck pump turning and shivering naked along with a laugh from his waiting companions and the offwatch crew whod gathered for the show encouraging him to make the best of it mr winwood came forward a bared sword in his right hand once the fellow was through urging everyone to hush he laid the blade on the mans right shoulder as if conferring knighthood and said with god as my witness i christen thee in a new life and a new name put on sailors clothing and be known as abraham the former slave supplied in an awed tone as abraham howe welcome aboard lad winwood cried laying the sword on his left shoulder then the top of his head eliciting a round of applause from the sailors and two dozen hands to be shaken uhmm andrews lewrie murmured aye sah you might uhm pass the word among the crew about those seals might make them easier of mind about our little raid lewrie suggested oh aye sah andrews laughed tumbling to it by de way sah dont know if ya ever knew it but my slave name was caesar sah my ol massa name me after some damn ol roman andrews said in a soft voice as if daring to suggest a firstname basis want to pick another whilst mister winwoods dolin em out lewrie replied with a tentative chuckle feeling that there was an accusation in there someplace it stung in fact since he had known it ages before but had quite forgotten it like any seaman aboard ship andrews was andrews or coxswain known by his place and his duty with nothing more required between a common seaman and an officer if andrews to hide his identity in the navy had chosen a new name a new first name when hed run away hed never bothered to learn it either think ahd have tstrip an bathe sah andrews asked a tiny mocking edge to his voice mister winwoods church of england not a dissenter so total immersions probably not necessary lewrie said tongue in cheek to jape andrews out of whatever pet he was in a wee dribble atop yer headll be all damn he still couldnt recall his first name ahll stick with the one ah got then sah andrews said as if weary of trying too many ships books an those fake papers you and mistah padgett done for me already got it down id admire did you have a word with our new volunteers once theyre named and settled in lewrie went on as if andrews had not put him on the spot for whatever bloody reason cruel as it was they might be feeling a touch homesick missin dey mamas an daddies sah andrews expounded and worryin bout how bad de beatins and whuppins gonna be when dey is missed gonna be a ruckus raised white folks is antsy enough bout runaways and rebel slaves already you dont think theyd talk do you lewrie asked suddenly i think deyd die fo dey say a word sah andrews told him turning to face him in the darkness for a moment deir sons is free and dots all dot matters de massas are fooled with a scare put on em and dot sort o victorys worth all de lashes dey can deal out but theyll still be homesick lewrie pressed aye sah dey will and ill talk with em and try to ease dey minds matthew lewrie suddenly recalled after frantically dredging his memory his first names matthew id admire that matthew andrews aye sah in the faint gleam of the single lanthorn lewrie could see his eyes brighten carry on then coxn book four saepe trucem adverso perlabi sidere pontum saepe mare audendo vincere saepe hiemem how oft under unkindly stars thou glidest over the savage deep how oft in thy daring thou conquerest the sea and oft the storm catalepton ix publius vlrgilius maro virgil chapter twentynine proteus now had a distinguished list of names on her books for all the world to wonder at there was a howe a hood an anson even a byng there was a skinny little runt going by george rodney another by hawke yet another was now a cook a massive teenager who still was growing if such a thing were possible for someone already built like atlas was named jones nelson and of course there was a groome to reflect his slave duties as a horsetender a carpenter a sawyer even a brewster for a slightly older fellow whod tended the vats where the molasses had been turned to rum along the same line proteus boasted a newcastle a bass and a samuel whitbread in honour of their favourite imported english beers even if theyd never been allowed a taste the stone bottles and names emblazoned on them had been thought of as a white mans their masters ambrosia what proteus did not have though were skilled sailors for the new volunteers were farmboys landsmen and newcaught fish about as ignorant of the sea as any clerk pressganged from a wapping tavern in london and to beat all for the first few days the bulk of them were seasick as well as homesick lewrie had decreed a sea school be formed with the experienced tars both white and black as the bear leaders to guide the newcomers about name the myriad items of rigging and sails and get them acquainted with their future duties during this time none were to be started even the stupidest their frigate stood out from hispaniola far to the soueast to cruise along the southern shore of saint domingue well out of sight from the port of jacmel or any shore watcher most especially of other royal navy ships that might get near enough to speak her and wonder where proteus had gotten all of her hamfisted puking amateur black sailors and her newcomers had had a lot to which to adjust besides the homesickness and nausea the first few days theyd been dazzled by their spankingnew slopclothing uniforms the privilege of stockings and brassbuckled shoes hastily put aside except for sunday divisions never bought for field hands the art of sleeping in a properly spread and hung hammock and its rollingup each dawn of scrubbing decks and pulleyhaulingeatingalongside white sailors they had been at first amazed then incongruously daunted by that closeness as if it were perhaps too much egalitarianism to digest at one sitting certainly their first sight of white sailors being started by the bosun and his mates on their way aloft to trim or shorten sail before the almostdaily squalls had been a revelation even if lewrie never allowed petty officers to use the stiffened rope starters in real anger just as instructive incentives to quicker action and while it had been weeks since a man had merited a dozen lashes from the catoninetails whilst lashed barebacked to an upright hatch grating the idea of punishment for anyone in violation of the articles of war that lewrie had read weekly had sent them first into giggling fits then a sombre reflection about upright behaviour and just what they had gotten themselves into and the novelty of three square meals a day with portions at least twice the victuals they had ever gotten as slaves even on the rare holidays was a wonder for the first time in ages lewrie was just about dumbfounded to hear people rave over boiled salt meats the pease pudding or even the burgoo and as for the daily rum rations and the small beer the newlys agreed though that the rockhard ships biscuit was a peril to all mankind but the currant duffs and the weekly figgydowdys were just handsomefine even a banyan day of cheese beer biscuit and gruels pleased them for now then there was the matter of arms drill no one in the west indies or the new world ever put weapons in a blacks hands nor even in his close proximity for fear of revenge murder or fullblown rebellion even black freedmens rights to own weapons was strictly regulated here though the newlys were expected to become proficient with cutlass hatchet boarding pike musket and pistol and were even allowed to purchase claspknives to hang on their belts with the tips blunted like everyone elses even if used for nothing more than whittling in offduty hours or for cutting their tough meat portions most enthusiastic students ever i did see sir lt devereux told lewrie one morning off santo domingo the spanish half of hispaniola as the hands shot at towed kegs from the taffrail even do i halfway suspect ulterior motives such as sir lewrie asked well sir theres bound to be one or two using us as a school for later rebellion like irish volunteer soldiers who get paid by our army to teach em how to fight us devereux said offhandedly as if he was merely joshing after all where else might young black men get the chance to learn weaponshandling as good as any european soldier or sailor or do you come to it sir the art of the greatguns and the use of artillery over yonder with louverture and his bully bucks lewrie responded jerking his chin northward or with our jamaican maroons exactly sir devereux said with a sage nod but with a wink as well but we got em young so perhaps serving aboard our ship where theyll get firm but fair and humane treatment will be a civilising influence against rebellious thoughts dont make me rue my decision mister devereux lewrie said with a mock shiver ive qualms enough already and how i let cashman talk me into it ill never know lewrie thought anew hes corruptin and im weak and corruptible just as he said always have been and i doubt the sorry old plea of drink and bad companions will excuse me in court damme but that wee rodney fellow is a cracking shot sir een with our poor old muskets devereux exclaimed little george rodney had plumbed a round right in the center of the keg lid in the second that it had swirled about endon to the ships stern and at a creditable seventy yards too sergeant skipwith pounded him on the back in congratulations and his mates whooped in shared glee whilst rodneys face lit up in ecstatic joy wonder what he could do with my ferguson rifle or with one of those fusils lewrie said we might detail him in the maintop as a sniper when we go to quarters alongside your marines ey mister devereux make him a marine lewrie japed with a wide grin well uhm lt devereux demurred wincing and sucking his teeth that might present a problem sir there have never been any black marines and did we wish to experiment as it were my men would resent it mightily most especially our five new volunteers we got from your colonel cashmans disbanded regiment i dont really intend to kit him out in pipeclay and a red coat mister devereux lewrie said with an amused snort those five are west indiesborn and bred or have lived here so long theyve taken on local prejudices sir devereux explained and strictures against armed blacks most of all their regiment was lilywhite and you know how little mixing there is in island society outside the sheets that is lewrie dryly commented uhm aye sir devereux agreed shyly so should we station rodney with a musket at quarters it might be best did he shoot from the bulwarks but not in the tops with the marines sir are they disgruntled youre saying lewrie demanded only mildly sir so far devereux replied his usual air of elegant detachment slowly shredding theyre happy in the main for another chance to soldier with their pay uniforms and rations theyre adapting well to most aspects of shipboard life so much so that theyre already expressing theusual low opinion of sailors and the superior air of marines none seem to be future disciplinary problems though theyre tough men sir no raging drunks or troublemakers have reared their heads yet a ship though with so many of her people black so their only plaint is against our black sailors lewrie asked damme sir its not like they havent seen ten blacks to each white settler already ashore havent seen ships stationed out here for three years or more with half their british crews perished and god knows who mannin em they have sir but damme are they so disgruntled theyd blab where we got em oh no fear of that sir devereux was quick to reassure him their disgust with that colonel ledyard beauman is so great that they found our little raid rather delightful frankly captain they despise him worse than cold boiled mutton and think what we did was a grand buggering no the only fear i have concerns desertion sir should they hear of a chance to see colonel cashman duel the henheaded bastard and run off to cheer him on i see lewrie said calming but still furrowing his brow in contemplation of a new threat thats a comfort i think about fusils sir devereux said with a shifty look in his eyes eyes usually steeled with rigid marine rectitude our new men were trained on and equipped with fiftyfour calibre fusil muskets while theyre no match for german jaeger rifles or yankee doodle pennsylvania rifles fusils are more accurate than brown bess your friend colonel cashman sent us extremely good marksmen born to shooting and hunting so i was wondering uhmdevereux coughed gently into a fist to cover his schemingshould you have another opportunity to speak with colonel cashman sir might it be possible that he could obtain some fusils for us with his regiment disbanded their arms will rust away in an armory and you just know how the army will insist everyone use seventyfive calibre tower muskets just to ease problems with ordnance supplies so you wish to arm our marines with fusils then sir lewrie asked rocking on the balls of his feet with a stern glower on his face opposing the wisdom of our lords commissioners of the admiralty oh not all of them sir just a dozen a halfdozen fusils devereux squirmed the army surely would not miss so few was a swap possible our short sea pattern muskets for fusils well righteous lieutenant devereux muttered like a housebreaker chatting plans for his next robbery in an ale house he coughed into his fist again but too hard to explain to the ordnance board and our own superiors when proteus pays off mister devereux lewrie told him with a knowing leer and a tap on the side of his nose why damme if they didnt charge us for em and i doubt the local army staff would find it easy to explain either how a dozen or more weapons went missing might charge them for em too besides as far as the army is concerned horse guards and god almighty ordained the use of the tower musket long land pattern calibre seventyfive mightve been etched into the tablets moses brought off the mountain for all i know but we could claim damme sir lewrie barked with amusement dye mean for me to steal em for you mister devereux since im such a dabhand at stealin slaves for sailors well i would not characterise it as stealing sir exactly devereux said tucking his hands behind his back perhaps to keep them a semblance of clean whilst his phyz reddened with flusterment and jutting his chin horizonward youve another synonym handy i take it sir lewrie teased snickering to see their stolid marine officer so discomfited a mere halfdozen would suit sir well perhaps ten or the dozen devereux all but begged for our new men and those already aboard who are demonstrably good shots why think of the possibilities sir he wheedled skilled men in the tops equipped with fusil muskets could decimate an enemys officers and mates at one go sir we could cripple any ship we face with one accurate volley even does our staffcaptain sir edward charles oppose such a practice of targeting officers and gentlemen as savage and barbaric mister devereux i am ordered never to engage in such tsk tsk well sir what actually happens and what is written up in a report are two horses of another colour devereux slyly posed i do also recall our recent competition with the american frigate and how the hancocks men outshot ours do we ever fight them they will not feel such nice compunctions against shooting us sir and neither would french naval infantry or bloodyhanded privateersmen granted lewrie allowed and i must own sir that the yankees superior arms and skill did irk me and fill me with envy devereux confessed recall our fight with those rebel slaves off monte cristi sir had we possessed fusils accurate longrange musketry would have slaughtered them long before they could get close enough to detonate their cargoes of powder and done it more cheaply than using our greatguns too sir improve our uhm efficiency gainst small privateers and smugglers devereux fantasised aswell with ideas and barely disguised impatience hmmm lewrie sobered pondering that galling event and weakening a trifle and have we not sir with you as our guide already set an example as being more than ready to uhm extemporise if needs must captain devereux pled extemporise lewrie scoffed as they paced forward to amidships of the windward gangway now theres a word that covers a multitude of sins damn my eyes mister devereux are you pissing down my back with me as our guide christ on a crutch he snorted dismissively we may not be able to swap for them sir but your friend the colonel could ah spirit them away for us devereux schemed or fusils could be explained away as personal weapons of our officers and gentlemen midshipmen sir kept aft in the gunroom or your cabinstil we get a chance to go ashore and hunt sporting arms sir aha after all fusils arose as officers weapons back in the seven years war so they could appear as common soldiers to french or indian sharpshooters and not be targeted as leaders but didnt wish to bear the burden of a brown bess musket a fusil is much lighter no we must never overburden officers lewrie laughed aloud theyve enough stress already hmmm though personally he liked the calibre fusil musket and had from his first experience with them with kit cashman at the tail end of the american revolution even fetching off one as a memento of their failed expedition up the appalachicola river in spanish florida and where was it now hanging over the mantel in his private officestudy at home in anglesgreen that is had caroline not sold it or given it away out of bloodyminded spite if all else fails sir we could claim we captured them off a suspect merchantman or a privateer or devereux hinted you wish em hellishbad dont you mister devereux i do indeed sir devereux vowed childishly hopeful even if that means sailing back to kingston for em and exposing our new hands to recapture us into court or letting your new marines ashore for liberty where they might brag and get us hung well uhm devereux shied with a painful squint do you put it that way sir i know its a risk but i still think that did we have them it would be in the ships best interests captain dear me mister devereux lewrie said checking their pacing and with a sad shake of his head but i do believe weve managed to corrupt even such a proper young fellow as you society ought to lock us all away as a threat to the public good and the navy hasnt sir devereux chirped suddenly elated yet gesturing at the bare featureless horizon could you but try to speak to your old friend colonel cashman well lewrie hemmed and hawed and whilst you do that sir devereux rushed on to pose ive an idea about that indirect fire those slave boats were too far for grenadoes you recall but did we have say three or four small coehorn mortars in the tops mortars we could extemporise to the metal stanchions and forks for the swivel guns we could fire explosive shellsteep plunging fireright onto an enemys decks like that colonel shrapnels fused exploding caseshot and six bells chimed from the forecastle belfry precluding further thought on that subject the first was trouble enough to lewries imagination six bells eleven of the morning and a half hour til the welcome pipe of clear decks and up spirits for the issuance of the rum ration one bit of devilment at a time if you please mister devereux im not as young as i once was dye know lewrie told him grinning too much audacity at one sitting leaves me breathless these days lt langlie came up to join them doffing his hat six bells sir permission to secure from arms drill very well mister langlie lewrie replied now properly stern make sure theyre well cleaned and oiled before stowing does time permit have the senior hands instruct the volunteers in basic knots very good sir langlie replied in his own properly crisp manner yet sharing a meaningful glance with devereux as if they both were in on things anything else you wish then mister devereux lewrie queried a whore transport to trail us about perhaps a what sir devereux gawped this time wholly surprised ask andrews about it lewrie suggested its an old tale and you mister langlie sir langlie paused halfway to turning and saluting youd not turn up your nose at a personal sporting hunting fusil i take it lewrie grinned what the entire gunroom well uhm ah langlie flummoxed sharing another glance with devereux as if to ask what trouble hed gotten into now damme but i begin to fear were a ship filled with conspirators from keel to truck lewrie snickered one might term it ah aspiring captain langlie replied aspiring hey hmmm works for me carry on lieutenant devereux mister langlie a word sir devereux saluted and left a bounce in his step as if eager to inform the other officers that theyd be getting fusils by hook or by crook langlie stood and waited as a perpetually putupon first officer should waiting for another heavy shoe to drop on his head i am informed by the latest post that you and my ward sophie de maubeuge are in correspondence mister langlie lewrie said and i am also informed that my permission was granted exactly when did i allow such mister langlie hmmm why uhm at chatham sir langlie said reddening and of a need perhaps to cough into his fist for cover the last night we lay at anchor when we dined your family aboard and held the singing and such sir sophie uhm mistress de maubeuge the vicomtesse rather said that shed spoken to you about it and had received your permission so i assumed sound a tad more french when she told you did she lewrie asked still sternfaced well as a matter of fact aye she did captain a tad do you have the pleasure of seeing her facetoface again do keep in mind that when shes scheming she sounds more french than english mister langlie lewrie informed him i did not give her leave to write you oh god im sorry sir i langlie exclaimed i beg your forgiveness and i never meant to thats what you meant about conspiring just now oh hush mister langlie lewrie wearily told him waving one hand dismissively after knowing you for a year i rather doubt youre the sort to trifle with the girl or tarnish my familys reputation assumin such a things possible these days uhm ah langlie began to agree then thought better of it his mouth worked as if trying to bite his tongue or stifle a titter of amusementthe sort of laugh that would never do his career or his professional relationship any good uhm yayss quite lewrie chuckled archly sarcastic over his own repute you wish to continue corresponding i do sir and im to assume that sophie is of the same mind despite the distance involved lewrie asked and the temptations of local beaus i may only gather ah assume at present sir that she is not averse to receiving my letters langlie stammered many a slip twixt the crouch and the leap lewrie allowed slapping his hands together behind his back and gazing aloft well then since you aint poxed drunk on duty breakin out in purplish spots and can eat with a knife and fork mister langlie ill let this stand just dont do anything momentous at long distance dye hear me god knows how long itll be before were back home again and god only knows what home therell be to welcome you if there is a home at all thank you sir thank you so langlie cried carry on mister langlie lewrie insisted shooing him away carry on very good sir he said doffing his hat eagerly clumsily rapturously aquiver and his face a perfect portrait of bliss you may not thank me later dye know sir lewrie cautioned the wife now despises the navy worse than god despises the french if such a thing is possible and thatll put you right in the middle of it right in the line of fire dye see youre asking for trouble mister langlie ill bear the risk sir gladly the young officer vowed then youre an idiot god help you women sir mine arse on a bandbox lewrie snorted oh go shove on a rope or something sir do shoo and quit that bloody beaming aye aye sir langlie said doffing his hat even making a wee bow in congй absurdly formal aboard ship and still grinning like the worst lunatick in bedlam but almost back to a professional bearing well its his poor arse lewrie decided to himself pacing aft to his quarterdeck hes been warned chapter thirty puerto rico lewrie thought eying the landmass that had risen from the sea a little after dawn quarters and the mona passage now what do we do northabout santo domingo or run back along the south shore close in out to the eastrd lay golden isles the storied cays that had featured in his youth the danish virgins and below them the beadsonanecklace of the leewards each a little gem and this morning almost presaged by how the sea glittered gold lapis and sunsilvered are they poxed too he asked himself now its fever season is there a safe lee shore anywhere in the west indies lewrie hung in the larboard mizen shrouds just at the beginning of the catharpings coat hat and neckstock off and savouring a cool morning breeze the scent of salt and iodine and a faint fishy tang of shorelines up to the noreast he lowered his telescope and gazed down and inboard to proteuss gangways and gundeck where sailors crowded round in untidy knots some still licking their chops after a breakfast remnant as they formed up by guncrews a bit before the call was piped for drill on the artillery for a miraculous change they looked healthy and fit again the last ravages of the fevers left astern and ashore there were formerly halfdead men who now strode about and joshed with their fellows there were those who had never been infected no matter how often theyd gone ashore or slept on deck for coolness when anchored there were the local lads who might have suffered malaria or the yellow jack when babies and now were immune as was he with a word lewrie could order the ship to beat up through the mona passage round the eastern tip of hispaniola and reenter her old patrol grounds to the north with the fresh noreast trades blowing so strong that feverish miasmas would always lie alee and no one else might fall ill with a word he could put proteus about turn his back on those golden isles of the leewards and the virgins though he had a yen for a glimpse of them once more and then the trades would brush across the island of hispaniola wafting god only knew what nastiness right down on them at sea with the deck and bulwark railings pitching and tossing they could not employ mr durants tarandcitron pots to counteract the foul miasmas that brought disease with sweet ones surely some who had not yet succumbed ran the risk of another exposure those debilitated the first time might not survive a second lewrie slowly collapsed the tubes of his telescope each click of the tubes seating a step towards a decision he turned his body to peer forward past the spread of the main and fore courses and the upthrust bow sprit and jibboom and the anchor catheads a day more on this course to the soueast would take proteus deep into the waters between saint thomas and saint croix where privateers and smugglers were twoapenny during the revolution in his green days though some could call it poaching lewrie told himself with a wry grin the royal navy squadrons based out of english harbour down at antigua prowled those seas when they could spare vessels from the blockade oн troublesome guadeloupe whilst he and his frigate were beholden to kingston and the west indies station ostensibly every british warship answered to admiral parker and his headquarters at kingston from the bahama banks to trinidad from the antilles to the shoal waters of the spanish possessions far to the west such as new spain and the isthmus of panama so would trolling a touch more eastrd really be poaching it could be excused couldnt it the leewards were a tempting lure and not just for him alone the rare dutch merchant ships still at sea would try to succour their colonies if they threaded past the blockade in european waters thats where they would first strike the west indies the supposedly neutral danes and those pesky swedes would be up to their old games of shipping contraband goods and arms turning a blind eye to ships from belligerent nations in their harbours merchantmen privateers and the odd ship of war that came calling american vessels despite the undeclared war against france still traded with the danes the dutch and the spanish and probably with the french isles as well for they were a mercenary lot for all their protestations and losses to french privateers puerto rico well in sight now and the danish virgins would be a grand place for smugglers and contrabanders to break their passages refit and resupply perhaps take a little joy of shore liberty before their long jogs home or put in for shelter from storm winds in those marvelous natural harbours and bays that yawned so emptily and so covertly the perfect hideyholes for nefarious doings with the telescope now shortened and safely slung over his left shoulder lewrie faced the shrouds and took several cautious steps upward on the ratlines up where the futtock shrouds of the mizen top intersected the sidestays until the futtocks almost brushed his bared scalp where a man would have to make a choice either take the seamanly ascent outboard by hanging from the futtock shrouds or confess his lubberliness and snake between to follow the sidestays easier ladder to the mizen top platform through the lubbers hole the arms theyd recovered yankeemade arms american ships trading along the spanish main at tampico vera cruz cartagena caracas and portofspain the dutch isles of curacao would mostlike take the most direct route back north using the mona or the windward passage or they could go roundabout skirting the lee side of the antilles what had that captain wilder of bantam and kershaw of the uss hancock frigate told him that they would make a rendezvous point to form american convoys in the lee of st kitts as far to the eastrd as well up to windward of the trades as possible leaving half an ocean of searoom alee til entering the old bahama channel or passing west of new providence yet east of andros through the bahamas on theirway home then should they meet contrary winds they wouldnt end up wrecked on a lee shore lewrie realised that a guilty yankee trader could sell all the arms and munitions he wished pick up an innocent cargo for the return voyage and then lumber along in convoy with other ships protected by the guns of his spankingnew and uncurious navy laughin all the way lewrie sourly thought bugger it it aint like we re chained like a guard dog we re not even on a long leash the staffcaptains written orders when theyd come aboard at last had prettymuch instructed him to toddle off and make a nuisance of himself til hell froze over on their enemies for a change he had an openended roving brief to chase his own tail if of a mind in any body of water under admiral parkers writjust as long as proteus was not in sight to plague his seniors sensitive humours lewrie squirmed about carefully shifting feet and handholds to peer norwesterly hispaniola was under the horizon saint dominque most likely an ocean of gore by now as old grudges were avenged upon the losers and spanish santo domingo could most likely now be aflame as louverture led his ragtag armies over the border to liberate all the island santo domingo had never amounted to much really it was the windward end of hispaniola too dryed by the trades for plantation agriculture and bereft of mineral wealth there were his advisories had informed him vast ranches raising cattle pigs and goats enough grains grown for domestic use but little for export and most of that land but sparsely populated its grandees rather shabby in the main and most of its people and slaves living handtomouth boucanieros those who cooked salted and jerkied meat along the coast were mostly leftover pirates descendants still living and dressing in skins off their goats barbecana their product was two words introduced into english as buccaneers and outdoor roasting parties becoming popular in the united states cashman had told him barbecues well that problem as far as proteus was concerned was over and done with for now a trifle to be isolated and left to fester or expire on its own and the small tenders cutters and schooners of the west indies squadron would manage that chore to turn north and race down either the north or south shore would probably be fruitless he turned again just as carefully to face forrud taking one hand to swipe his unruly hair back into a brief semblance of neatness nuisance they wish then its a nuisance theyll get lewrie whispered to himself under the flutterdrum of the winds and suddenly feeling much happier just like goodyers pig never well but when in mischief he chuckled in his minds eye he could already see the abyssal royalblue seas of the virgins and the leewards could almost feel the thuds and thumps up through the stays to his fingers and boot soles of a vessel crossing those square waves that could blow up on brisk days where the chop could be four feet high with barely six feet between crests and the rockygold islets and cays breezed past in constant parade their beaches the palest new parchment colour and the shoals the palest glass green the steep slopes the palms and palmettoes the rounded pastures and cane fields the balds with the pretty pastel windmills slowly rotating and waving in greeting drawing him on he closed his eyes drew a deep pleasing breath of ocean scent and nodded as he made his decision if nothing else it would be like a homecoming and did it prove fruitless or he got caught poaching a quick run back downwind to his own kennel was possible chapter thirtyone hms proteus hauled her wind and bore away sousoueast to cut below the western tip of saint croix then take an easy hillgentled cruise along that islands southern shore in its lee bowing to full winds past the eastern end she stood on for fifteen nautical miles before coming about to starboard tack to clear the shoals of the langs bank then headed norwest in deep water roughly aimed for the salt island passage into sir francis drakes channel the winds were a tad perverse though backing a point so by dusk she was nearer the small and rocky isles of norman and peter island where she fetchedto for the night just before full sunset cocked up to the night winds as she was she would make a slow and quiet sternway back out to deep and safe waters to the souwest the skies were clear and strewn with stars the winds soughing softly and the motion of her hull easy a slow and stately rocking to and fro the slightest measured pitch and toss as the dark abandoned bulks of slightly larger peter island and lower norman island wafted rightward off the larboard bows it was such a rare event that some of the hands begged for line and hooks using saltjunk as bait and soon were hauling up catch after catch whooping with delight to land fish without battering them to bloody rags whilst the ship was underway bonito red snapper even a small shark came thrashing up over the bulwarks and their new black cook gideon called for more firewood and lit off the grills expertly gutting heading and slicing them into steaks pausing only to spit tobacco juice from his everpresent quid as he sprinkled salt pepper and lime juice over the sizzling slabs though there was saltpork in the steeptubs already the fish would augment the usual rations quite nicely he assured everyone easily enlisting help among the crew gon eat good boys gideon boasted de fish he eat sweet what de white folk sometime call surf an turf dey have beef wif a fish woll we havin surf an styl mo firewood heah cut me a mess o dose lemons too noble mistah morley ya done wif at pompano fo de capums table woll hand dem steaks heah fo he perish o de hungries lewries nostrils twitched and his stomach rumbled with anticipation as the heady fumes flowed aft from the galley funnel a sweet dark whiff of rum on the wind caught his senses as well the senior hands and mates always found a way to cache smuggled rum it appeared that some of it was being used to flavour the fish his nose wrinkled as he caught the other scent the musksweet and oily reek of mr durants miasma pots along the windward side set in hollows delved into the tubs of sand kept for gun crews traction firefighting and deck scrubbing well look as lit up as a whaler with her trypots goin he groused to lt langlie as he watched durant and hodson proceed aft in dodderers crouches bent over with prepared pots and burning punks in their hands so much for anonymity or hiding our presence not that weve seen anything more than fishing boats and local traders as of yet sir langlie counseled fredericksted harbour on the west end is little used according to mister winwood and christiansted on saint croix s north shore is shallow and rocky the only good commercial entrepфt is charlotte amalie yonder on saint thomas so ahmollyah lewrie corrected the locals say ahmollyah not amahlee mister langlie aye it was a right pirates hole in the old days smugglers privateers slavers only saw it from off shore but perhaps tomorrow im told its a pretty little town we arent at war with denmark we might even request a pilot and anchor for a day and night our old sailing master once told me that above the town on the islands spine theres a vista where one may sit and look east all the way down drakes channel drakes seat said he sat up there himself like a king on his throne the old buccaneer id rather like tdo that myself see all the isles all the way out to virgin gorda and anegada prettiest view in the whole caribbean ive heard tell what heaven must seem for sailors for those few of us wholl be admitted through the pearly gate sir langlie softly joshed massaging his middle as his stomach emitted a genteel growling in the dark lewrie could feel him wince at his unthinking words having put his foot in it again more than youd imagine mister langlie lewrie said after a brief pause and a short snort of amusement mostly at langlies wary shadowdancing around him ive always held that sailors aint great sinners in the main their needs and wants are simple and their sins are minor and venal not outright wicked or cruel their lives and livelihoods are too precarious and the seas too big for them to go off tyrannical or murderous oceans keep the fear o god on em and keep em looking over their shoulders superstition perhaps fear of the lord perhaps as well who knows there lies your true evil sir your true wickedness lewrie concluded pointing at the faint loom of light roughly where charlotte amalie lay on the norwest horizon so shores the trouble sir and what little time a tarpaulin man spends there is langlie puzzled out respite sir lewrie snickered mocking his own pretensions to philosophy respite and langlie chuckled with him easier and honestly this time the stinkpots may help sir langlie said of a sudden as an almost companionable silence extended perhaps a bit too long with the ship lit up like a whaler as you said whod imagine were a ship of war whales might be taken in these waters if they swim through the turks passage a bit north and west of here as you told me sir accidental camouflage as the french would say pray god its a fortuitous choice captain langlie answered in all seriousness scuse me capum mister langlie sir aspinall said as he appeared at their side on the quarterdeck but that gideon fellas got yer supper ready big slab o pompano pease puddin boiled tatties and some o that cornmeal sweet bread o his and toulon s goin nigh frantic tclaw the dish cover off best come quick beggin yer pardon else hell have it all there wasnt a portion for him lewrie hooted with mirth aye there was sir and not a morsel left gone quickern a wink and still lustin after yours aspinall warned him it appears i must go below or go hungry mister langlie do you have a good supper of your own aye sir goodnight and well see what fortune the morning brings langlie said doffing his hat surely itll be good mister langlie lewrie paused to say returning the salute since weve already managed the miracle of the loaves and fishes hms proteus hauled her wind sutherly and got underway one hour before dawn quarters would normally be stood with only a cursory try at scrubbing decks to perfect cleanness she stood soueasthalf south for awhile to gather speed and clear any shoals until she was roughly even with the salt island passage then tacked about to take the winds on her starboard quarter and under reduced sail loped westerly to prowl close to the southern coast of saint john for a peek into coral bay before angling off toward saint thomas to look into the pillsbury sound which separated the islands and held several tempting hurricane holes where privateers and smugglers could lurk saint john lewrie recalled as he loafed by the windward rails with a spyglass had been a productive island with many plantations of sugar cane before a slave rebellion had slaughtered most of the white owners and driven the rest away with british and french help back in a rare example of tween wars cooperation the slaves had been massacred but not before the fields had been burned to stubble the houses presses barns and mills destroyed as symbols of cruel subjugation a renascence had never occurred and saint john brooded in a sleepy funeral silence with most of the arable land going back to jungles and left alone as if accursed perhaps it was lewrie speculated coral bay between narrow headlands on her soueast corner was one of the great but unused natural harbours in the world and were the virgins in british hands would have supplanted kingston for navy use ages ago since it lay so much further up to windward of the main passages to the west indies and once out of the main channel coral bay funneled out into narrow leads to north and norwest into hurricane holes the worst winds and storm surges blocked by headlands and narrow but high peninsulas if not there sir theres pillsbury sound mr winwood was saying pointing at a carefully tacked down chart theres eleven to fifteen fathom right up it where it splits round grass and mingo congo and lovango cays theres a windward passage narrow but practicable for inbound vessels of the same depths a middle passage to the west of grass cay and a long narrow but useable channel between thatch cay and the north shore of saint thomas great escape routes aye lewrie commented after returning to the binnacle cabinet and the traverse board that lastun leads out to deep water past hans lollick and little lollick i see what about red hook bay here at the east end of saint thomas and saint james bay these little inlets very shoal sir and exposed to the noreast trades but with decent holding ground hard sand bottom winwood opined but a wee privateer or a small trading schooner might be able to put in there pity we dont have something similar as a tender to explore sir there are anywhere from four to nine fathom for anchoring but so very many shifting sand shoals well well just have to stand in close as we dare but keep our heads wont we mister winwood lewrie tried to tease the man somewhat close sir winwood mournfully lowed their sailing master was an impossible sobersides and would not recognise a jape if it kicked him in the crutch and there is the matter of danish sovereignty captain within the threemile limit inside which we at this very moment stand we have no jurisdiction does denmark have a frigate in these waters sir lewrie shot back any forts outside charlotte amalie with more than a corporals guard to man a few rusty guns i have not heard of such reinforcements sir then bugger em lewrie decided ah were nigh to the west end of norman island well be able to see deep into coral bay within a minute or two sail ho deck there a foremast lookout cried dancing with delight on the narrow crosstrees cross the point two sail standin outta the bay two points off the starboard bows lewrie sprang forward along the starboard gangway to the break of the forecastle in his eagerness his expression joyous and wolfish creating excitement in the hands he passed in those clustered below on the gundeck perhaps it was uncaptainly to show feelings exciting people for nothing especially if he could not deliver but he could not help himself he raised his glass it was that magical dim time of the dawn before the sun was truly up and everything was soft twilight the sea and clouds and sky pearly bluegrey the isles and cays muted and dark against that background two dark hulls stood out starkly their sails ghostly white before sunrise revealed them to be a weary and stained tan there was a large schooner and a chunkier dowdier brig or snow both bound souwest just clear of leduck island and headed out as if to pass ram head and not three miles off and their flags one was french the schooner the brig was a yankee first out of his mouth was a loud whoop followed by orders he shouted back to the quarterdeck through cupped hands mister langlie hands aloft to set tgallants and shake out the reefs in the courses mister winwood steer direct for ram head and cut them off he whirled back to face the two suspicious vessels again experience juggling courses and possible speeds the schooner and brig had the initial advantage almost completely exposed to the noreast trade wind but were deep up the bay was proteus partially masked from the full force of the morning winds she could deploy thousands more square feet of sail more quickly and her waterline was longer slower to accelerate but once she had a bone in her teeth shed be the fastest off the wind the american brig bore the same limitations of all squarerigged ships she would find it hard to go to windward to point as high as a foreandaft rigged vessel like the schooner so the only way she had to escape would be to run like a scalded cat for charlotte amalie and throw herself on the mercy of the danish authorities she could round ram head and surge up pillsbury sound with the winds abeam or just a bit abaft and go for the middle passage or the leeward passage lewrie looked aloft at the commissioning pendant streaming from the mainmast truck the trades were weak as they always were in good weather round dawn weak but steady from the noreast so he thought a try up the middle passage from pillsbury sound abeam the winds out of the question it would be too slow no he thought if she tried that she would head for the incredibly narrow and treacherous leeward passage he stowed that thought away as improbable the schooner though was much more manoeuvrable and it was not out of the question for her to spin about almost in her own length and try to run soueast abeam the trades and pass astern of proteus at a rate of knots hoping that the brig would be considered the most valuable prize with her greater speed she might dare the risk of broadsides hurriedly ranged and fired the schooner might dodge right past before a gun could hurt her and show them a clean pair of heels dont think of that dont think of that lewrie muttered on his way back aft pacing sideways to keep his eyes on the brig and the schooner just panic and run you bastards courses topsls and tgallants all set sir lt langlie reported as lewrie gained the quarterdeck outer flying jib the inner and the fore topmast staysl set as well lewrie looked aloft for confirmation also noting that the main and mizen tgallant staysls filled the spaces between the masts as they had since theyd come about off salt island passage to make best use of the weak predawn trades without showing too much aloft for an enemy to espy and be warned off were they smart theyd turn and run back up the bay and get ashore catterall commented still coatless and fiddling with his neckstock wed get the ships if they dont fire them but the crews would escape us lewrie spun on his heel to glare at him freezing catterall in midtoilette then let us pray our chases are bereft of your great experience sir lets pray theyre bumbling idiots sir catterall gulped and shrugged into himself as his hammockman held out his coat to don and he slipped into it as if it were armour everyone down from aloft mister langlie good lewrie said now beat to quarters mister catterall sir the hapless second officer replied now dressed but still trying to shrink away tell off an armed boat crew with six or eight marines and be ready to board one of the prizes should we be fortunate aye aye sir mister towpenny a boat brought up from towing astern to short stays lewrie turned back to their chases relieved to see that they were still mindlessly intent on fleeing holding their course aiming to get round ram head into deeper water and run almost due west with the schooner ahead of course and steering a bit further out from the land almost as if she would challenge proteus and protect her consort the french tricouleur stood out boldly from her gaff swung by the wind to lay against her mainsail but proteus was hitting her stride now and beginning to surge forward with a purposeful bustle the apparent wind keener and brisker and her stout hull talking to him in groans and swashings as she parted the rather calm seas like a broad farmers plough through rich loam gunports were hinging up and out of the way on the schooners larboard side at least five that lewrie could see and she was coming a point lower to intersect their course her gaffhung sails arcing away from them into mere slivers to cup more stern wind i make the range as under a mile sir langlie said the schooner was most likely a french privateer lewrie thought judging her lines more critically as fine and lean as she appeared she couldnt bear the weight of more than eight or ten guns and those could not be much more than pounders mans a bloody lunatick he grunted mister langlie ill thank you to shoot his grandiose dreams to flinders very good sir mister catterall mister adair on the uproll and open upon her langlie shouted down to the gundeck the schooner opened first wreathing herself in a sudden bank of sulfurous fumes the sound of her artillery a muffled stutter five guns as lewrie had surmised and terriersharp by the sound of thempounders or more likely pounders shot shrieked overhead a splash was raised far out to starboard and the ball skipped high enough to chew a small segment of a bulwark railing and strew stowed hammocks in the racks like wakened worms on the uproll catterall could be heard yelling fire the air was moist and cool with sea mist proteuss guns roared and reeled back inboard almost as one making not only a deep bank of gun smoke but an instant fog of tortured air each guns eruption standing for a moment as a horizontal seaspout from the muzzles and making thirteen distinct smokeandfog rings that quickly merged into a cloud that only slowly drifted away to larboard and alee as proteus sailed beyond it leaving a semiopaque surfacelevel cumulus astern hit hit langlie was noting striving for professional detachment though almost dancing on tiptoes three four six there is a nasty shoal sir mr winwood muttered coming to lewries left rear eagle shoal tis called almost dead ahead by our charts theyre coming to us so a turn away will not increase the gunrange aye lewrie said quickly with only a slight turn of his head to acknowledge him two points alee and keep us clear he only had eyes for their targets now the schooner had taken the worst of their exchange with holes punched in both her sails and sections of her bulwark torn open a low deckhouse afore her wheel shot up and her inner jib flying loose of both controlling sheet and halliard his hands took time to cheer as they swabbed out thumbstalled vents and began to wave the powder monkeys forward with fresh charges borne in flashresistant leather cylinders the brig still flying an american flag was hugging closer to the shore of saint john as if to shave ram head by a boathooks reach urgent signals were now flying from her lee mainmast shell pass inside the shoal mister winwood lewrie queried the brig aye sir the schooner though winwood replied with a wince as if watching an imminent coach accident schooners bearing away langlie noted ready down there guncaptains waved their hands clear of the guns catterall had his sword poised on high nodding eagerly on the uproll fire shes standing directly onto the shoal sir winwood said the brig displays this months coded signals sir midshipman elwes suddenly cautioned with some alarm hes a lying dog then lewrie snapped between explosions from their guns but sir really theyre this months signals elwes protested eyes wide in fear of error we aint firin on her mister elwes lewrie took the patience to say to him direct do you recall our first encounter with yankee merchantmen if shes innocent whats she doin in company with that frog privateer once our smoke clears hoist a signal for her to heave to and prepare to be boarded if she obeys fine if she doesnt then we will fire into her aye aye sir elwes said doffing his hat before dashing off aft to his flag lockers and halliards once again both the schooner and hms proteus had mounded the sea with ragged thunderheads of smoke and fogroil from their guns a moment later the schooner sailed clear of hers presenting her lines sideon her hull pocked with pounder impacts and the upper gaff of her foresail hanging limp and the sail bagged out alee then she struck the shoal jerking to a complete stop her mastheads swaying forward gaffs and booms swinging forward abruptly running rigging snapped heavy lower booms ploughed through shrouds and ripped them loose from the deadeyes ripped deadeyes from the chain platforms her bow rose up as if cresting a boisterous wave but remained at that angle her bow sprit and jibboom almost vertical proteuss crew groaned aloud making ooohh sounds as if in fellow sailors sympathy before recalling that the ship over there was french after all and began to jeer and catcall someone send for mister durant lewrie chortled loudly and ask him how one says oops oh shit in french do you still wish her boarded sir langlie asked after the hilarity had faded and the quarterdeck people had returned to duties aye i do mister langlie lewrie decided after a long moment to think it over weighing risk to his sailors against the need for a confirming document as a privateer send two boats with mister catterall and a larger boarding party hes to capture her captain or a mate if possible with her letter of marque and reprisal does the rest of the crew get ashore so be it and let em be the danes problem do they not fire her as they abandon have our people do it instruct him to menace them but not get into a melee do you think he may manage that mister langlie hes an energetic simpleminded brute sir so i expect that he may langlie chirped back with a wry grin on his features very well lewrie announced lets fetchto and despatch our boarding party quick as we can mister elwes what answer did we get from the brig cant really make it out sir its all higgledypiggledy the boy replied dashing from aft to a skidding stop at his summons hes a liar and a conspirator as i suspected then thankee mister elwes keep fetchto aloft and think of a way to make that insistent carry on sir proteus didnt wish to drown any of her boarders by proceeding at full tilt when they scrambled down into the boats surfing along at the end of short painters barely held in check by straining coxswains and bowmen with boathooks she would have to slow down and take in sail steering more for ram head with the wind abeam to make a lee so the sailors and marines could disembark down her larboard side lets make it fast mister langlie lewrie said scandalise her and clew up sail in spanish reefs brace in yards abeam aye aye sir lewrie swung his telescope up and extended the tubes the brig was almost to the tip of ram head standing off not a cables distance from the shoals how much water would she have that close inshore lewrie asked his sailing master i make it about fifteen fathom sir near the point winwood answered as proteus swung her bows nornorwest and the yard parrels cried as they were swung about to point the weather arms directly into the wind the sails now flogging helplessly as they were clewed up at the centres leaving untidy thrashing bags suspended like ancient teats at the outer ends with only jibs staysls and the spanker still keeping way on her damn lewrie griped shell get a lead on us ah sunrise sir win wood pointed out pulling his watch from a waistcoat pocket as if to confirm dawns predicted timeliness and heaving a smug satisfied sigh of approval very good sir lewrie said with a grateful smile thinking though such an easy man to please just give him exactitude scant minutes later proteus was once more under full sail and under way thrashing back toward her previous speed in pursuit of the american brig which was now flying stunsls in addition to her royals and tgallants lewrie and winwood stood close together by the double wheel and binnacle cabinet ticking off landmarks on a chart as the seamarks almost raced past to starboard as the chase spun out westward for the shelter of charlotte amafie cabrithorn point lameshur bay and white point then the wide shallow expanse of reef bay dittlif point rose up along the southern shore of st john then rendezvous bay beyond that long arrowing peninsula and bovocoap point looming up with the brig dashing along as close as she could inshore with proteus standing further out to seaward just a tantalising bit out of gunrange from her pounder bowchasers almost but not quite yet she is steering deadon for passage below the dog rocks and little saint james island it seems sir winwood cautiously opined toying with his waistcoat buttons there is a long shoal parallel to the shore below dog rocks with a narrow pass of thirteen fathom between however her captain knows these waters well we must infer wants tbrush us off lewrie sourly grunted aye sir once beyond dog rocks though does she intend the direct route inside of buck island before taking a slant into harbour there are even more shoals which would force us out alee of yonder buck island and out of any hope of overtaking if we continue on this course aye sir winwood gloomily reiterated though i cannot find any indications that the shoals are particularly shallow the charts show some soundings of six or seven fathom deepladen ships would go well clear of the shoals but that may be sign of too much caution on their captains parts with our maximum laden draught of three fathom aft by the keel and rudder skeg it makes no sense for him to think that wed be completely daunted perhaps he knows more than our chart may tell us the location of an old wreck perhaps he learned his lore of the local waters in very large deepdraught ships mister winwood lewrie said trying to put a good face on it despite his qualms of running aground under one of those cautious captains of yours shes down to her draught waterline same as us and she cant draw more than twelve or fourteen feet show me your rocks and shoals lets deck there a lookout screeched chase is changin course turnin away norwest shes only a bit beyond bovocoap point mr winwood protested in a splutter thatd take her into pillsbury sound mister winwood lewrie snapped maybe this jonathon captain doesnt think hed keep enough lead on us to enter charlotte amalie before we caught him if he really knows these waters he must think he holds a high card over us but theres no way out of the sound sir the winds wrong to weather the middle passage leaving that leeward passage past thatch cay winwood gawped narrow as a town creek it is the soundings uncertain well follow her mister winwood lewrie told him we will not let her get away that easily once past the point yonder shape course nornorwest and follow her wherever she goes chapter thirtytwo sir im bound to point out that this is risky winwood said in a mortified whisper as they bent over the chart pinned to the traverse board once proteus had come about and was now deadastern from the american brig perhaps a mileandahalf behind my duty as i know mister winwood lewrie said cutting him off quickly eyes intent on the chart and the pair of brass dividers in his hand pillsbury sounds deep sir twelve to eighteen fathoms all the way to the islets and cays and nice and wide for the most part til you are forced to choose a passage out of it the windward passage is out and does she try the middle passage shell be fullandby sailing at the ragged edge of this mornings wind without her stunsls spread thankee jesus which means well drive right up her transom long before she can get to it your leeward passage is narrow but not more than a quarter of a seamilebout two cables wide twixt thatch cay and the north shore of saint thomas bags of room mr winwood uttered a soft complaint that sounded mightily like a cross between a moan and a wellmuffled belch does she wish tkeep her stunsls rigged out for speed shell have tuse the leeward passage mister winwood lewrie chuckled the narrows though sir here about threequarters of a mile due north of cabes point halfway between coki point and the southeastern tip of thatch cay there lay an indistinct indication of a shoal stippled to show sand which meant extremely shallow on the scale chart they were perusing a man could have mistaken it for a thumb smudge of ink a tea stain from previous use the vague extent of the shoal didnt leave much north of it and there was another fanlike shoal round thatch cays extremest tip and that did have a soundingonehalf fathoma scant three feet hell go south of the shoal mister winwood where there are soundings of seven to ten fathoms between the shoal and coki point lewrie insisted keeping well off the wind under stunsls hugging thatch cay a tad once round your shoal and giving little to loord does he get past the shoal sir but then its his bottom thats ripped open not ours and well do all we can to save her people obeying the law of the sea does he know of a wreck in there though sir the suns barely up behind us sir lewrie countered quickly the very best time of the day to see underwater obstacles ahead long before we run afoul of em and with the extreme clarity of the seas hereabouts really mister winwood one could read a newspaper at six fathoms down does our yankee captain yonder know of a wreck in the channel then let him use his forefoot to dredge for it save us a deal o gunpowder it would wrecks shift over time very well sir mr winwood finally agreed though not without a premonitory shiver though i have expressed my reservations the fault will be mine sir lewrie told him with a grim nod of his head before laying down the dividers and standing back up i will so note it in the log speaking of mister elwes cast the log if you please mister pendarves hands to the forechains with the short leads and two hands on the bowsprit to keep watch for any shoals or obstructions lewrie walked back to the stern and raised his glass the privateer and their boats were now out of sight and there was no smoke visible had either the french or their own people set her afire he pursed his mouth and chewed at its lining in worry of all that could have gone wrong even alee of the stranded schooner they were too far away to hear the pops of muskets and pistols only cannon on the schooners decks might rumble over the sound of the wind which would be a bad sign no news is good news lewrie told himself turning forward spotting the three other midshipmen standing idle without duty he put grace larkin and burns to work taking bearings on seamarks to either hand and employing their scant knowledge of trigonometry for a range to them eight and threequarter knots sir midshipman elwes reported thankee mister elwes i see youve hoisted immediate above fetchtovery good i doubt shell respond any time soon so keep at it with the knotlog about every ten minutes or so lewrie bade him i do believe weve gained a touch on that brig already aye aye sir elwes yelped with joy dashing aft again full of importance over his assigned task from the windward rails it looked as if they had drawn closer to the chase more details could be made out that were indistinct before or maybe it was simply full daylight that made him wish it so proteus was surging along her wake bonewhite atop the light green sea of pillsbury sound heeling a bit to larboard and leeward masts raked forward a touch and groaning over it sailing almost downwind the pace wasnt as apparent as it would be working closer to weather the ship was sailing just as fast as the wind could blow so there was no exhilarating rush and bustle that plucked at hats clothing and flesh no bursting showers of saltspray booming over the fore rails but proteus was moving quite well gracefully and almost effortlessly a touch on her lee shoulder lewrie deemed her but mister langlie run out the starboard battery and run in the larboard to the recoil ringbolts lets get her flatter on her keel he decided of a sudden theres just enough wind for that to make a difference a quarterknot more perhaps at once sir langlie agreed pacing forward to the quarterdeck railings with his brass speakingtrumpet in his hands on very light winds sometimes doing the opposite helped lewrie had learned from better men than he force the lee hull downward off of upright and a ship would angle her masts and sails more horizontal and ghost on a scant breeze that would leave her luffing and boxing the compass else especially along a near shore eightandahalf knots sir elwes shouted from the taffrail very good mister elwes lewrie shouted back allowing himself a small grin damme he thought but they beat it into you you hang about ships long enough youre bound tlearn a little something even are you a lazy toad and half a fraud i do believe were within range to random shot sir langlie said as they drew level with cabrita point on st thomas shall we pester her with the bowchasers he asked eager for action no not yet mister langlie lewrie finally decided do we open on her at extreme range well appear desperate make them think theyre ahead of the game dye see and were firing before we haul our wind and let em escape now do we hold fire til were right up her stern when shes nervous about getting round the shoal in the middle of the channel thats something else keeps em lookin aft and chewin their nails we look implacable thatll give em a pause or two then theyre halfbeaten oh i see sir langlie puzzled frowning over it we are nemesis the inescapable old greek god and them mere prey more like a dangerous duellist whose fearsome reputation precedes him mister langlie lewrie snickered back always one to prefer a cruder simile one smirky grin at his opponent cross the grass and the other poor bastard collapses with the farting faints onward they stood pressing closer and closer to the brig now at threequarters of a mile range well past cabrita point and nearing coki point the brig now committed to the leeward passage too far down to the west to tack and stand for the middle passage for a time the frigate had the best of the winds from the noreast beginning to post nine knots at the last casts twothirds of a seamile deck there chase bears off to loord spreadin stunsls again a foremast lookout cried shes nearing the narrows mr winwood said bearing off to the south channel before the shoals open upon her now sir langlie pressed aye mister langlie keep em busy lewrie assented the pounders up forward barked and recoiled the spent powder smoke winging off westward as a solid blot again far off one ball raised a great splash near the brigs larboard quarters the other one whipping cross her decks and deflating her spanker for a moment as it tore a neat hole right through it mark you well where she turned mister winwood lewrie bade where our first shot struck short surely theres deep water there aye sir winwood mournfully fretted lewrie raised his glass again as the pounders heaved back in from their second tries the brigs spanker now seemed to be in twain as if a major seam had split wide open leaving the upper half hanging properly from the gaffboom but with the loosefooted bottom forced open and flagging as if ripped from one boltrope edge to the other and that wouldnt help her steering another pounder roundshot struck quite near her larboard quarter again caroming far enough this time to raise a tiny smudge of engrained dirt and splinters from her just afore her quarter galleries the second was too high but it clipped her right in the starboard mainstays and futtock shrouds below the maintop platform sending a visible shiver up her upper masts like a tuning fork those shrouds would be weak that mast in danger of falling sooner or later halfmile i make her now sir langue crowed enthused ready to put the ship two points alee mister langlie once we are above coki point lewrie cautioned a third salvo from the bowchasers was spoton the lee cannon scoring her third direct hit that chewed away some of the brigs larboard bulwark near the break between her quarterdeck and her gangway the starboard cannon was still firing high which error one of their quartergunners was correcting loudly and foully but that roundshot ploughed through the brigs main topsl and shot a stunsl boom and sail clean away and that would slow the brig down right smartly eight fathom eight fathom tthis line the starboard hand in the forechains called out coki points abeam now sir winwood warned them helm aweather mister langlie and bear off lewrie barked two points no more trim for a fair wind course westnorwest there was some disturbance at the channel narrows a perturbation of silted water over the shoal the knuckle that the brig left as she wore off perhaps from the splashes of their gunfire proteus was turning well before it though easing the set of her sails and yards to run with the wind a bit more astern still fairly flat on her keel with her batteries still run out or run in bless me were right astern within a halfmile of her mr winwood rejoiced and well shy of the shoal it appears lewrie tried hard not to mock him making his face stern busy with his telescope now pepper her steady mister langlie keep us pinched a tad closer to thatch cay too nothing to loord aye sir quartermaster half a point to weather and nothing to loord langlie parroted as the pounders erupted again the brig was trying to pinch up too but not succeeding since she sat heavyladen and heeled a bit more to leeward than the frigate twelve fathom twelve fathom tthis line a leadsman cried lewrie heaved a large but wellconcealed whoosh of relief at that news though thatch cay and st thomas felt close enough to hit with a wellflung rock before the channel began to widen they were past the highest ground of thatch cay the tall hill at its easternmost tip where the large fringe of sand shoals lay so the winds could gust across more directly without flukey diversions and proteus began to sing striding up the brigs stern relentlessly quartermile range sir we could try the carronades next langlie hooted do so sir grapeshot her masts and sails lewrie agreed with his glass he could espy her afterguard officers and mates gathered on her small quarterdeck looking aft gawping and pointing at him two gunports were open in her taffrail bulwark and men sweated and heaved to ready a pair of sternchasers whilst others gesticulated and mostlike sworea great many mouths were open and a fair number of fists were being shaken at them at any rate the brigs guns fired at last before his own bowchasers and starboard carronadethe one not blocked by jibscould roundshot came keening down the deck to starboard sending everyone on the gangways flat on their faces the second ball thrummed past the hull to larboard almost close enough to peel paint but struck far astern in a series of skipsplashes as you bear fire the pounders with quoins jammed well in yelped and the carronade aimed higher let out a stentorian belch of smoke and flames two roundshot ravaged the brigs stern shattering transom boards and windows while the grapeshot in the carronade struck higher shredding the spanker gaffboom and the bare crojack yard above it tearing chunks from the maintop making those alreadyweakened starboard ratlines and shrouds ripple as sinuously as a crawling snake her upper topmast canting to leeward of a sudden under a cable now sir midshipman grace crowed hopping on his toes in glee mister devereux lewrie said one file of marines and sharpshooters to the forecastle and clear her quarterdeck by fire when you think you have the range by god if they werent sailing right up her stern almost ready to jab their jibboom over her helmsmens heads the westernmost spit of thatch cay passed abeam to starboard from a quick peek at the chart still pinned to the traverse board lewrie could see that the safe channel bent due west for a time then sharply north mandai point on saint thomas loomed upwards feet in the air with shoals at its feet churning soapywhite foam where tide current and scend collided long before the prettier breakers along the narrow beach the brig must bear up for hans lollick island and deep water though now without her spanker to balance her helm she could not did she try to closereach shed wallow and dither near the wind then off like a wounded lizards deathcrawls instead proteus steered up windward while the brig sagged to leeward the range closing even more to within musketshot proteuss larboard broadside upwind of her on her starboard quarter mister langlie lewrie shouted open the larboard ports and stand by to load the gun crews the bulk of them frustrated til now leapt for the tackles and tompions as the port lids hinged upward baring inner paint in a row of stark red squares above her gunwale marine sharpshooters and sailors with good eyes continued a spatter of musketry at the enemys decks making her helmsmen steer by squatting down below the bulwarks and craning up to steer by pendant and sailset instead of by compass making the rest of her crew drop from sight a white cooks apron appeared over her starboard side waved frantically men stood and waved arms and hats shouting as loud as they could for mercy as those brutal pounders iron muzzles were trundled up to the ports to dip rise and slew left or right in aiming before a full broadside we strike damn you we strike dont fire please someone in a cocked hat was howling hold fire and well lower our colours for gods sake hold two or three cowering members of the afterguard rose up above the quarterdeck bulwarks and cut the halliard for the flag that came fluttering down to trail in the water even as others dared after a moment or two without musket fire to free braces and sheets spilling the last wind from the brigs sails fetchto mister langlie and get the last boat led round from astern you will take the boarding party lewrie said take mister pendarves the bosun with you and the rest of mister devereuxs men aye sir cargo manifests ships papers and correspondence before all else sir lewrie urged inspect the holds later quickly man before they ditch em or set em afire a fair mornings work captain mr winwood was saying now that the folderol and danger was past two prizes before breakfast and a passage through shoal waters thatll make them sit up and cheer back in london well see sir well see lewrie cautioned though he did feel rather joysome himself chapter thirtythree a present for you captain lewrie lt devereux said after he had returned aboard and had taken the salute from the sideparty he held out a knitted wool sack that covered something long and narrow and over four feet long he was beaming with secret delight what the devil lewrie muttered aloud as he took hold of it and felt the hidden objects hardness and leanness imagining that he knew what it might be he stripped off the woolen cover as quick as a child might rip open a birthday present oh dear lord how lovely it was a pennsylvania rifle octagonalbarreled fitted at butt barrelbands and firelock plates with shining brass the hinged cover to the patchbox in the buttstock also bright brass and the stock all of a highly polished ripplystriped birds eye maple it was indeed lovely one of the finest examples of the gunmakers art that he had ever seen outside of a set of custom duelling pistols even the plates were engraved so finely that he suspected only a magnifying glass could reveal the detailing fresh from philadelphia sir devereux said proudly and the work of a master craftsman youve one for yourself mister devereux lewrie asked lifting the piece to aim at the sky and sight down the long barrel noting the silver bead on the muzzles top and the cutsteel notch sights at the rear near the firelock was this the only one id understand envious as all hell but one for myself too sir near its twin devereux confessed with a little laugh and one of lesser quality for every officer and midshipman as private hunting weapons ha ha two dozen in all personal possessions of yon brigs mates lewrie frowned no looting of a prize sir part of her cargo withheld as uhm evidence for the prize court devereux snickered by god we have corrupted you lewrie laughed but this is magnificent i must own find yourself some coehorn mortars too no sir but thosell come ah heres mister langlie coming aboard with even better news ill let him tell the rest lewrie almost pounced on langlie primed to eagerness shes the sycamore sir out of philadelphia lt langlie reported after hed taken the salute doffed his hat and had been given his own covered rifle up from the boat below the entryport a native tree i spose or the name of an indian tribe her master was wounded and is still aboard rather panicked by the thought of expiring sir so he was open to questions between prayers and pleas for his last will and testament to be taken down that is will he live lewrie asked his wounds are more fearful than mortal sir mister durant is of the opinion that hes more likely to pass over from fret than shot langlie chuckled he openly confessed that hes been smuggling to the french for some time with most of their overseas trade curtailed tis a lucrative endeavour i gather he also admitted hes run arms to louverture on saint domingue now his country is all but at war any large cargoes or arms and powder would have been suspicious and expensive with the united states navy the best customer so he made arrangements through french agents in philadelphia to meet the privateer and transfer her arms aboard his innocent ship whats his cargo then lewrie asked absently stroking his new rifle two thousand stand of arms charleville muskets with leather accoutrements two thousand pairs of boots and shoes langlie intoned as he read from a list he pulled from a coat pocket one hundred and twenty thousand premade cartridges and twist paper shot and powder for half a million more four sixpounder gribeauval pattern pieces of artillery with caissons limbers harness and the essentials for a battery forgewaggon blankets sloptrousers crossbelts shakoes and other uniform items bayonets infantry hangers and officers quality swords most of it recently snuck into guadeloupe aboard a frog frigate sailing enflute sir a real treasure trove turning up in kingston with that brig astern and the british flag flying over the american would represent a treasure a golden shower of prize money lewrie was mortalcertain theres also an innocent cargo of molasses and sugar captain langlie went on saint domingue coffee tea and cocoa would have put sycamore far ahead of the game once theyd unloaded the arms just their bad luck but to our good this is documented we have them by the nutmegs about this for certain lewrie demanded every bit of it on paper sir even the captains private log it was well hidden but not destroyed mister neale our masteratarms was part of my boarding party and he and his ships corporals burton and ragster are old hands at knowing where sailors hide things and what they made off with god only knows or cares with all this on our plate lewrie chortled and the rifles were part of the cargo ordered specifically sir louvertures people are mad for em yours sir do you look close youll find it engraved with toussaint louvertures name sir it was to be a present to one of his generals a man named dessalines god almighty we also found three men aboard whose certificates are colourable sir langlie told him as english as bow bells and with so obvious a set of frauds they were pathetic should we press em sir but of course lewrie said with a sly grin ill not turn up my nose at volunteers willing or no muster em on the gundeck and ill have a word with em were making sternway onto the shores of saint thomas and need to haul off the winds veered half a point northrd and were on a lee shore might have to sail all the way to the western end of the island then beat back to pick up catterall and our boarding party excuse me sir mr winwood suggested coming to his side and looking to lieutenant devereux expectantly with the wind veered so it would be possible to stand back down this leeward passage here with the wind almost abeam and be off ram head in less than two hours i uhm i must say mister devereux those are dashed handsome rifles you are welcome to take your pick from the lot mister winwood as a private personal hunting weapon devereux assured him and a handsome gesture too winwood actually enthused come over all amort with greedy pleasure our prize is secure and in good order mister langlie lewrie asked him no troubles from her crew or mates secure sir and ready to proceed the crew disarmed and our bosun mister pendarves and trusted hands to back him up in guarding them langlie confidently stated very little real damage done very well gentlemen lets get under way back down the leeward passage we know it now and i know when ive stretched my luck in unfamiliar waters for the day better the devil you know hey and not an inch to loord this time hmmm stern kedge anchors readied for dropping just in case this pass holds a last surprise right lewrie reluctantly surrendered possession of his new rifle into andrewss care then went down the starboard ladder to the waist where three seamen stood hangdog awaiting their fate lewrie put his hands in the small of his back and faced them one the youngest hopefully a teenaged topman stared back fearfully eyes blared and swallowing in shuddery gulps one stouter older fellow dared glare back at him in a sneer the third a lankylean man in his middle thirties couldnt meet his eyes but darted his glance about or found the grain of wood deck planks intriguing his flat tarred hat pulled low over his brow well lads youre caught fair and square lewrie told them false certificates so badly done if you paid moren a shilling each for em you got swindled what names you use your own or aliases the young one at least perked up to that statement glancing at the sneering man in alarm for a second dont signify lewrie went on naming himself and his frigate youre runnin from debtors prison termagant wives or whatever i dont care weve had fevers and were shorthanded youre british no matter how you protest it you all wish to be john bull or billy pitt so be it cause ive more need of you than the authorities back home tis becoming a tradition aboard for people to take new names when they sign on the pays less than merchant service but the rations are fair measure and decent quality we dont flog unless youre a total bastard and as youve seen this morning were lucky with prize money a man a boy could do worse how much is that yankee captain owing you nnigh on twelve pounds sir the youngest said in a shy voice merchant captains were infamous for crimping off their crews near the end of a voyage when met by a royal navy vessel in soundings of home waters theyd gladly give up all but the merest few required to work into port and pocket their paysometimes with connivance with officers of impress service tenders ill screw it out of him and its yours lad lewrie vowed and pay a willing volunteer the joining bounty no matter which name he puts down in ships books oh itll go to pay for what kit you dont have but well fetch your seachests aboard so youll have most of what you need already and save a bit with our purser mister coote hes a fair man can you believe that of a nip cheese so whats it to be volunteer and make the best of it or be pressed and begrudge me to the end of your days willy toffett sir and ill volunteer then the teen said with a relieved smile main topman i was and you sir lewrie asked the second who still glared but with a resigned and bitter air of helplessness press me and bedamned he gravelled halfway surrendering to fate but determined to go game and put me down as toby jugg with two gees he almost snarled but with a sardonic smile to excuse it your choice then lewrie allowed rating twas an able seaman aboard sycamore then able youll be rated here with the extra pay that goes with it lewrie promised though that did nothing to mollify the man had a woman and girlchild on barbados toby jugg groaned never see em again now poor as churchmice and your joining bounty could be sent on to them lewrie hinted with tears beginning to well in his eyes at the thought of not seeing his woman and daughter for years his face clouded and taut he nodded his assent still unable or unwilling to accept his lot a man who might have been pressed before lewrie suspected unwilling to give his right name for fear of punishment for desertion and you sir lewrie asked the third who still could not meet his eyes except in brief darting glances ships is ships i reckon the man said with a defeated sound aye ill sign on volunteer me names george gamble and i was an ordinary seaman he muttered in a midlands mumbletonian accent landsman ya were toby jugg snorted in derision and cackhanded at that ya lubber gamble raised his head and hat brim high enough to glare daggers at his shipmate for a second damn captain cheated me he did im rated ordinary and well ya know it just coz he already had all the seamen he needed and too cheap tpay me due ratin was the reason coulda signed aboard another ship jugg quibbled as if lewrie wasnt there oh aye an me broke as a convict and all me pitiful advance gone tpay off me crimpin landlord for his rathole lodgins some other time lewrie interrupted well try you as an ordinary seaman gamble im landsmanpoor at the moment do you have any certificates from past captains to show your rating uh nossir lost em tween ships or somone stole em whilst i was sleepin ashore sold em for drink more like jugg scoffed enough lewrie snapped youll volunteer gamble aye sir spose ill haveta the man replied ducking his head again very well then once weve a way on her see the first lieutenant mister langlie and hell enter your names in our ships books then draw your issues from the purser lewrie told them pleased that all but one of them seemed docile he suspected that gamble might be a kings bad bargain and nothing better than a landsman after all from the sound of his former shipmate and the simpery grin on the young willy toffets face as they had their little tiff he suspected that gamble might end up making more enemies than friends among the crew by shirking duty but bosun pendarves and his mates with their starters could light a fire under his shifty idle arse he returned to the quarterdeck as proteus began to pay off from fetchedto to larboard tack and began to gather way for a reach down the leeward passage to pillsbury sound lt langlie had reduced sail since there was no more need for dash to catch a prize the winds were cooperating too veered to noreastbynorth and weakening as the morning warmed there might be two or three hours more of gentle sailing before the tropic heat created stronger gusts and fresh veers or backings by then they could be back off ram head and beyond in deep water and miles from any shores or shoals deck there a lookout called down as proteus neared the mouth of pillsbury sound smoke round the headland four point off the weather bows small boats under sail too dye hear there the smoke was as thin as a pipesmokers for a minute or so then quickly became a belching gush of darker thicker smoke on the far side of ram head flamedriven upwards by a catching conflagration lewrie began to worry and fret about the safety of his boarding party it had been too long for the french to have fired the ship to prevent seizure but hours too late for catterall to have done it he thought two boats sir under lugsails langlie prompted turning his attention closer in ours i do believe a point of lee helm and close them then mister langlie aye sir quartermaster helm alee one point within half an hour lewrie could feel a true sense of relief and one of accomplishment too for the boats were theirs and in the ocular of his glass he could make out faces and put names to them in quick inventory realising that every man jack hed disembarked would return safe and sound and with no sign oн blood or bandages to mark any wounded either lieutenant catterall was standing up in the sternsheets of his boat whooping and hollering waving exuberantly as proteus and her prize brig fetchedto once more catterall pointed astern threw out his chest proudly and polished his fingernails on the white facings of his uniform coat beaming fit to bust his boat swung round to the starboard lee entryport where he was first up the manropes and boardingbattens to give his report taking the salute due him from the sideparty offhandedly and almost swaggering as he doffed his hat a frog privateer right enough sir catterall boasted the incendiare she was called quite apt now shes lit up like a pile of winter deadfall haha crew of ninety all told before she struck the shoal and mounted eight sixpounders he related the important facts of her demise for captured privateers the best most crews would receive from a prize court would be head and gun money mere shillings paid out for each crewman and each piece of artillery no prisoners sorry tsay captain she was well and truly stuck on the rocks til the final trump and nigh awash aft when we gained her the frogs had departed in their own boats for the island but they were in such a rush they abandoned all her paperwork not her letter of marque sorry but her box of correspondence in her masters cabin theres more than enough proof of her being a privateer why it took me so long before we lit her off and headed back to sea dye see sir since i can make out french rather well oh aye langlie muttered under his breath rolling his eyes well i do anthony catterall objected though i dont say it well as i read it i decided that goin over her with a finetooth comb for documentsd be best glean some insight into what the frogs are intending where they operate and such exactly as i would have mister catterall lewrie praised him good quick thinking that lets get your party back aboard first get the boats atow aft then well discuss what gems you may have discovered enough of import to please admiral sir hyde parker and his staffcaptain one would hope er aye sir catterall replied taken all aback for a moment to be the object of praise instead of the odd grudging grunt of acceptance and a muttered carry on no hope of salvage though lewrie had to ask smashed all to pieces up forrud sir her keel snapped in two abaft her forecastle and half her knee timbers and planking spraddled or gone to amidships just hangin on the shoal she was sir sorry no need shes out of business and her crews marooned ashore on a rarely visited island lewrie said with a shrug they can sail over to charlotte amalie and be interned but itll be months before an exchange can be arranged through the local french consul the prize we took more than makes up for it and do you talk sweetly to lieutenant devereux perhaps hell gift you with one of the items he captured off her tis something youll drool over trust me oh ah well sir catterall said beaming at a good days work and glancing about greedily for a sight of the marine officer the boarding party was coming aboard then sailors and marines tramping the starboard gangway and the after ladder to the waist with their arms removed from bandoliers and baldrics ready to be put back in the arms chests they were crowing over their own deeds getting chaffered by those whod stayed aboard as to who had had the best adventure or had accomplished the greater deed you new men lieutenant langlie ordered assist mister towpenny at leading the boats aft to their towing painters lewrie was standing by the rails and nettings overlooking the waist just about to clap his hands together with satisfaction when he glanced down one of his recently volunteered hands the one who went by george gamble looked up aghast his mouth dropping open and his tanned face paling in shock darting a look at mr towpenny who stood on the inner edge of the starboard gangway over his head still burdened with cutlass pistol and musket as part of the boarding party hennidge mr towpenny exclaimed of a sudden just as aghast martin hennidge he added this time scowling the name spat out in loathing his musket came up quickly lewrie jerked his head back to look at gamble who started like a deer at a dogs barking quickly lashing out to seize a musket from a seaman whod been idling with a messmate the butt on the deck and one forearm draped casually over the muzzle as a hiking stick gamble scampered forward musket at portarms and using it as a bludgeon to either hand to clear his way mutineer sir mr towpenny cried putting his musket to his shoulder as if to aim one of the hermiones knew him years ago i did know him anywhere proteuses seize that man lewrie barked keep back the fugitive sailor shrieked spinning to face the crew and levelling his musket to point at them from his hip leave me be or by christ ill shoot at least one o ye keep back i say he swung the muzzle back and forth frantically daunting the few hands who had obeyed lewries order he climbed the larboard companionway ladder near the focsle belfry to the gangway near the larboard anchor catheads sir the seaman who had lost his musket called up sir at musket aint loaded mister catterall wouldnt let us back aboard wif one lewrie tipped the sailor a wink drew his sword and took off at a quick trot down the larboard gangway give it up gamble or whatever your name is he forced himself to look stern and menacing sure that the joke would soon be on their armed mutineer hennidge looked down to his piece used one hand to make sure it was at full cock again and raised it aiming at lewries heart wont be taken i wont back ya tyrant or ill kill you if its the last thing ever i do hennidge cried murder another officer would you lewrie snarled sword extended and almost within reach of the muzzle there were ten slaughtered aboard hermione in their beds those not enough for you hennidge thrown overside still alive but bleeding even the wee midshipmen who pleaded for their lives have a hand in that did you did you you traitor an all of em torturin devils the man shot back jabbing at lewrie as if his musket had a bayonet to keep him back out of reach of his swords tip they all deserved what they got and more officers god above youre all monsters navy merchant the spaniards didnt treat ya right lewrie taunted parrying with his hanger forcing the sailor backwards no shower o gold for handin em a british frigate no commission in their navy no reward for you drop that musket now its over nowhere to go he grazed his sword blade down the musket barrel and forestock threatening to slash the mans left wrist and fingers if he kept proper hold of it forcing him back against the bulwarks with no place to escape sure that this made a great rareeshow give up he roared in the mans face leap and lunge left hand round the muzzle to lever it up and away right fist smashing his hangers hilt and curved handguard into hennidges nose making it explode in crimson eyes crossed in pain left knee into the crutch as he bulled forward for good measure give before ya get lewrie snickered to himself as hennidge dropped to his knees lewrie stepped back a pace and yanked hard to tear the useless musket away hennidge found breath to howl right hand still clawing to keep his weapon by the firelock and one finger inside the brass triggerguard and blam holy shit lewrie screeched flinging away the hot muzzle from his left hand you bastaren he added raising his sword and bringing the hard pommel down atop the mans head for sheer spite as the spent powder smoke wreathed round his head and shoulders from sheer terror lewrie coshed him on the head again sailors and marines were beside him in an eyeblink to take hold of the mutineer and drag him toward the companionway to the gundeck fat lot of help you shits were lewrie fumed gasping fit to a swoon and his bowels dangerously loose unloaded hey mine arse on a bandbox why he couldve killed me aye make a great show now hes out cold pitch in and look organised if not brave ill have that sonofabitch in irons double irons at once mister catterall lewrie roared once hed got his breath back picking on the first officer he spotted within easy reach someone check my cabins for the list of descriptions of hermione mutineers we were told to look out for see mister padgett my clerk quickly now no need sir mr towpenny assured him from the gundeck i knew him you peel off his shirt here youll find two tattoos he had one on his left upper arm a killick anchor atop a heart seen it often enough when we were in queen charlotte tgether sir over his right shoulder blade there should be a saint paul s cross in green ink protection gainst drownin the tattoo man in plymouth told him sir hes martin hennidge sure enough ill swear a bible oath to it at a court capum and admire tsee him hang for his sins padgett came forward with the list quickly raked out of the desk drawers aft in his cabins and the written description including tattoos fit gamblehennidge to a tee lewrie sheathed his hanger and stepped down to the gundeck as hennidge was sluiced with a bucket of seawater and awakened spluttering and moaning already fettered and shackled to a pounder shot sling his sorry arse below on the orlop lewrie ordered in a mellower mood bread and water only mister langlie here sir our prisoner and his return to justice is more important than continuing our cruise lewrie instructed once well soueast of the island yonder shape course for kingston aye sir langlie replied a foolish expression of awe mixed with both relief and joy on his face beg pardon sir but that deed was just about the boldest damnedest thing ever i did see you went for him without a blink a thought for your safety lewrie made the appropriate and expected deprecating gestures and clucking sounds as if it was really nothing much though all the while thinking s posed tbe safe as houses unthinking is the word for it damme there must be easier ways tkeep a good name got to get aftfore i squit my breeches dont quite know myself mister langlie lewrie said with a shake of his head as if puzzled heading sternward along the gangway thank god for mister towpenny or wed have had this man aboard for years all unknowing thought his story was queer but lewrie shrugged again id admire to shake your hand sir langlie earnestly cried well if you must mister langlie lewrie answered trying on a humble chuckle as he took hands with him keeping a pleasant grin on his face though he was by gastric necessity rather impatient three cheers for the captain lads lt catterall yelled not to be outdone hip hip hms proteus trembled with the strength of their enthusiasm the cheers almost feral in their intensity and lewrie caused a further outburst when he drew out his pocket watch noted the time and said that after such a strenuous and rewarding mornings work once theyd shaped course for jamaica the rum cask would be got up and everyone would splice the mainbrace with full and honest measure for all he did not stay on deck to share rum with them though he got the retrieved musket from a marine private and stepped down to the gundeck to return it to ordinary seaman fawcett who had lost it not loaded was it he hissed almost in the lads ear as he leaned close not charged or primed hey oh gawd sir im sorry fawcett gulped eyes abrim with tears and shaking like a leaf i thought twas oh jesus youre an idiot fawcett the blitherin sort yessir the sailor cringed in dread and sorrow oh for gods sake lewrie relented stepping back his urgent needs denying him a good and proper rant go get your rum and well say no more about it but by god youll never ever fetched a loaded weapon back aboard again will you he went up the ladder to the quarterdeck stifflegged and his buttocks pinched struck a captainly pose for a second hands behind his back then ducked aft quickly bounding down the stern ladder to his cabins he stripped off hat coat waistcoat sword and belt and dashed into his private quartergallery slamming the door on aspinall and a welcoming brandy even so he barely made it fear belated or not worked its way on him better than an enema from mr durants clysters so loose rank and gaseous that he had to fan the air after a moment or two though he had to laugh out loud god people get knighted for less and captain alan lewrie rn wheezed biting on a fist to keep from braying for all the world to hear dont know how fame and glory strike other people he giggled but by god they have an effect on me hee hee out in a bit puss mewl toulon cried pawing the door chapter thirtyfour lewrie had lieutenant langlie and lieutenant catterall in for a working supper with mr durant to aid in the translations they had captured a brace of hogs from the brig sycamores manger quickly run over to proteus in the cutter and done to a crackly turn by their new ships cook being a yankee brig shed also carried several sacks of cornmeal which had gone into skillets to bake sweet chewy muffins or pone bread for all hands to replace hard ships biscuit for a day or two mushy peas with melted cheese sauce and breaded and fried onion accompanied the tender pork roast making a fine victory feast with promise of a pipinghot apple dowdy to come it was only after a round oн port with some biscuit and cheese that the papers from the french privateer incendiare were fetched out for study the bulk of it was dry boresome and innocuous lists of needs and expenses for cordage spars canvas and tar shot powder and cartridge flannel all pleasingly hard to come by on guadeloupe at present they noted and the problems among her crew the everyday life of a working ship much more interesting were the former captains letters from at least three ladies of guadeloupe all dated within days of each other of a bluehot ardent and salacious nature which had them all guffawing along with the former captains attempts at draft letters that tried to keep them sorted out without repeating himself even racier was an unfinished and forlorn missive to his wife in bordeau practically weeping blue ink over missing her so grievously a good supper fresh bread of a sort and the promise of prize money to come had them all in an expansive mood lewrie noted even mr durant seemed to have laid aside his disenchantment over hudsons place as the senior surgeons mate for the nonce and joined in the mirth holding up his end of the table conversation and putting down a fair and manly share of wine even cracking droll jests before they got down to the business at hand and in that business letters that incendiare s captain had received provided bright gems of interest thisn from his wife sir lt catterall said holding up a page for better light from the fourlanthorn chandelier that swivelled and swayed over lewries glossy dining table she writes that things are hotting up in the mediterranean an admiral de brueyssounds as if her family knows hishas taken command of a threedecker by the name of locean and a large number of lineofbattle ships uhm accompanied by over an hundred transports for an expedition bound for somewhere durant hid a snicker behind his port glass it was true then that catterall could read french but couldnt pronounce it worth a tinkers damn as he tried to expand eruditely after two bottles worth he should have known better lewrie thought in his journal zere is similar mention mr durant stated setting down his glass and opening a saltstained book of ruled pages ah he speculates about zis armada sirs he is certain zat some tremendous victory will be won and rumour gained from guadeloupe officials about one possible aim being ze island of malta damme thatd cut the mediterranean in half langlie said he refilled his port glass from the decanter that circled larboardly round the table as he spoke and with no help from the neutral and beaten italian states and austria out of things thatd leave admiral jervis where he was two years ago chased back to gibraltar or lisbon he regrets zey do not come to ze west indies sirs mister durant read on and retake martinique or other former colonies ah apparently a general bonaparte is in charge and has a grander scheme in mind he writes that perhaps the balkans are the aim bonaparte lewrie grumbled slapping the table why ive met the little bastard in ran me out of the adriatic too when he invaded italy in and beat the austrians and piedmontese like a dusty rug almost bagged me on the genoese coast once too hes a dangerous man i tell you never trust the dwarfish gentlemen hes no bigger than a minute but slippry as an eel it need not be said that lewrie was by then most cheerily in his cups since hedby godearned it and was damned grateful to have breath in his body for use between sips unloaded jesus well if hes busy conquering someplace dagoish well not be plagued by him this summer at least catterall snickered only a wee bit sozzled his robust constitution came with a hollowleg no ships to spare to oppose us good langlie contributed and with their atlantic ports blockaded so close where elsed the monsieurs get frigates or corvettes with their toulon fleet busy catterall snorted so the west indiesll be safe til our liners come back from halifax at the end of hurricane season lewrie reasoned out uhm he expresses worry about american frigates sirs mr durant continued flipping through the private journal he was pursued by one off dominica he was run one hundred miles in a day recent catterall demanded eyes beginning to unfocus after all and starting to sound bullhorned drunk recently yes mister catterall durant replied mustve been that hancock then catterall said with a grunt idve run too lewrie jokingly confessed whether she was oversparred and unhandy overgunned or crank shes a fearsome and fast beast privateers stand no chance on ze coast of america now mr durant paraphrased zey return to caribbean waters uhm he suspects more american frigates ah here is something sirs after ze break in relations paris determines to reenforce zeir navy here what ships zey may spare from brest and lorient bringing fresh troops and arms durant made a shrug and a moue he rejoices for louvertures victory over general maitland durant cautiously said he congratulates ze noirs of saint domingue and writes of hopes zat zey may be directed west to an invasion of jamaica rather zan east against spanish santo domingo but he does not trust zem sirs nor does he like zem if zey go east spanish harbours might be closed to privateers be a good thing catterall huffed tallyho toussaint a mission diplomatique is to be sent to louverture soon as i read zis durant cried making them all sit up and take notice of such news important officials who will ask louverture to reconcile with general rigaud in south province so zeir armies may combine to attack jamaica and ask for a time of rest so zey may build up his supplies first and assemble suitable transports we must get this news to kingston at once lewrie declared then rash right back and hunt the delegation ship pipe dreams sir langue sadly said their hopes for a try at jamaica that is thatd take lots of ships not a gaggle of potty little fishing boats nor all their privateers as escort cant be done without proper ships of war even with our ships of the line away til october or november unless bonaparte really means to hit the indies not something in the mediterranean lewrie objected i told you he was devious as the devil look at the way he gammoned half a dozen brilliant austrian generals by sayin one thing demonstratin one thing but doin quite another fifty miles away anything more on that line mister durant zere is another entry quite recent capitaine durant said after wetting a finger to turn the pages before he sails north to rendezvous with ze brig we capture uhm many privateer capitaines meet with an officer sent from paris on the frigate zat delivers ze arms we take a capitaine de vaisseau a postcaptain he is under the governorgeneral hugues to coordinate he writes if united states have turned belli gиrent prey upon their merchantmen those of useful burthen and capture sufficient transport for future expeditionary use then as reenforcements arrive under escort by ships from the atlantic squadrons both french and noir forces will combine for a descent upon islands now occupied by albion that is to say us gentlemen the capitaine of incendiare describes the new arrival as a most energetic and inspiring man zough he expresses a troubling fear of him due to his monstrous appearance and his reputation as an ardent and ruthless chasseur of royalists and seditionists during ze terror he names him le hideux durant said turning the book about so they could see the entry for themselves huh beg pardon lewrie stammered wishing that his senses were not quite so foxed or his eyes so mutinous at focusing le hideux did he call him he felt a cold fey dread invade his body no cant be he quailed inside ikilled the dog didnt i oui le hideux capitaine durant blithely continued reading from the journal apparently zis officer is deformed by many cruel wounds he wears a black mask over ze right half of his face and his eye to cover a blinding and a livid scar it is rumoured he has a bad limp and must wear an iron brace over his boot to stand and uses a cane which must be awkward for him since his right arm is gone at ze shoulder his name he notes durant paused mon dieu guillaume choundas lewrie spat mine arse on a bandbox you know of him aussi capitaine durant asked shivering i killed him lewrie whispered swear tchrist i thought i did back in he stared blank and pale at the far partitions sir langlie gawped eldritchstruck by such a reaction from his captain by such an ominous rabbitacrossonesgrave dread did you say you killed him sir then who is the bastard then sir catterall asked impervious to superstition nigh impervious to anything by then a fiend from hells deepest pits mister catterall lewrie at last managed to say after mastering himself a fiend who just wont die no matter ive had my whacks at him two or three times an evil clever murderin bastardly gullion of a malouin corsair who thinks he has some breton ancient celtic destiny since julius caesar conquered the veneti mad as a march hare but clever oh so clever lewrie told them shaking his head in queasy wonder and pouring himself more port a brimming bumper with hands that barely shook despite his shock paris couldnt have picked a better foe to send us dangerous as a crate o cobras and not a jot o mercy in his thricedamned soul he puts a squadron together in these waters and hell raise mayhem as sure as im born sew your arses shut and keep yer backs to a wall he felt another sinking feeling in his innards and knew that it was not the result of indigestion or a tropical fever you gentlemen will i pray excuse me for a moment he bade tossing off his glass of port at one go then shoving his chair back so hard that it nearly tipped over its feet catching at the painted canvas deck cover they rose in kind as he headed aft for his quartergallery again whew lt catterall softly marvelled clawing for the bottle to charge his glass never heard the like if this what was he this choundas is that bad and his presence in the west indies upsets the captain so well he must be satan incarnate you asked if captain lewrie had heard of him too did you not mister durant langlie enquired more sombrely but also in a mutter that would not carry far aft what do you know of him rumours of him before my family and i escape toulon in mister langlie durant fretfully informed them frowning hard and what he did to zose who could not flee ze rйpublicains when toulon fell six thousand guillotined shot or bayoneted in ze surf wading out and pleading for just one more boat guillaume choundas was one of those who purged ze toulon fleet and ze city he loves ze guillotine ze torture poor helpless women and especially little girls in terror of him he slaughter his way south from paris to every naval port an enthusiastic agent of ze terror i had not thought of him in years grace б dieu but now pardons gentlemen but i fear it will be a very bad zing for him to appear but surely langlie protested in a splutter that sounded half bemused now hes but one man in charge of a pack of tagragandbobtail privateers thats like herding cats no insult meant toulon catterall grumped winking at lewries pet who was hunkered on all fours with his tail tucked about his front paws on the sideboard his eyes half slit in the dim lanthorn light as eerily as a witchs familiar hed meant to jape but the atmosphere had gotten to him too charge oн nothing langlie persisted sterner now he might get the use of a frigate or two thats all and weve what seventy or more ships out here and weve captain lewrie as brave and smart a scrapper as ever trod a quarterdeck and weve proteus surely the finest frigate in the whole royal navy well settle this choundas got old lir catterall whispered dont forget the tales of seals and selkies the old seagods favour and all and the uncanny good fortune that follows the captain from ship to ship what did for our first commanding officer at chatham what did for that mutineer rolston the night we transferred him after we escaped the nore no lads dont forget weve luck on our side why the captains taken the man half apart already shot off his arm by the sound of it probably did the carvin on his phyz too i shouldnt wonder maybe was the one who lamed the bastard as well one more encounter with captain lewrie and this choundasll have tsign his name with his prick like that buckinger feller does all the stunts at the raree shows thout arms or legs hey and keeps mistress buckinger a happy woman tis said catterall chortled more loudly than necessary he dont scare me this guillaume choundas or howsomever ya say it bring him on i say hear hear langlie cheered drumming the tabletop and m sieurs durant slyly commented tapping the side of his head after so many disasters to his person who is to say that he choundas just may be in dread of rencontre with ze capitaine nestce past hear hear langlie chirped merry once again hastening to top their glasses the captain gets one more shot at him and it will be finis for choundas after this morning i doubt that theres anything on earth thatd daunt our captain for moren a second toast toast catterall cried staggering to his feet in the sudden silence though as foxed wits tried to dredge up the proper sentiments there came a sound from the quartergallery in the stern not quite unlike a prolonged stentorian belch nor being in a heroworshiping and charitable humour could the assembly term it as resembling a daylong fluttery fart either way though it didnt sound particularly heroic epilogue mind th paint yer honour sor landman furfy cautioned as lewries gig bumped against their frigates hull below the entryport you do the same furfy lewrie cheerfully called back taking in how much ended up on furfy rather than the gunwale else the only thing tclean you would be neat rum or turpentine prefer th rum sor bathin in it ah th wonder furfy replied pausing on the halfawash work catamaran platform on which he stood standing back to salute with his paintbrush as lewrie ascended the battens to the starboard gangway pipes trilled boots clomped in unison hands slapped shiny linseeded musket stocks and sailors took pause in their labours to doff their hats the highjump was it sir bosun pendarves asked once lewrie had turned aft to the quarterdeck guilty on all counts and to be hung at dawn tomorrow lewrie told the hawknosed older man with a satisfied nod a foregone conclusion really chained tarred and caged til his bones fall away then buried off the palisades at low tide god knows when we can see it from here sir bosun pendarves chuckled glad for a bit of amusement public hangings did that to people even the primmest id admire tsee hennidge get scragged i would all ships in harbour to send witness parties mister pendarves and all crews to muster facing execution dock lewrie said you get first thwart in the boat then choose the rest for me best turnout mind oh aye sir pendarves beamed rubbing his calloused hands with gleeful anticipation ill see to it lewrie didnt tell him that hed send a midshipman with him in nominal charge of the shore party he thought that mr elwes was tough enough and blooded by longer service not to shame proteus by casting up his accounts to neptune at the sight he took another look about the ship before going below and it was amazing what martin hennidges appearance at kingston had done for his frigates repute canvas cordage tar and oilspaintso spitefully and stingily denied before had appeared in liberal squanderous amounts since admiral sir hyde parker had been effusive with praise and had done him the honour of supplying him a copy of a flatteringly fulsome report he would send to admiralty anent the capture of a hermione mutineer which report lavishly nigh luridly recounted his personal seizure and disarming of martin hennidge with but a hanger against a loaded and cocked musket even the staffcaptain sir edward charles had simpered with outwardly sincere congratulations sycamore s capture with proof of yankee doodle collusion with the french admittedly had caused a problem with the american consul and could still result in a chilly rift with their frigates in future but the burning of a french privateer the scotching of an arms delivery and most especially the intelligences he had gained had offset thatas far as lewrie and proteus were concerned at any rate the matter of his pressing three men from sycamore and one of them a mutineeras if the united states had deliberately sheltered himwas not a matter for discussion from the local american representative too bloody embarassing all round so perhaps for the moment he could afford to feel smug but for the admirals parting comment as hed left the courtmartial that hed count on proteus to put paid to that ogre choundas as if it was to be his quest and no one elses lewrie allowed himself a disbelieving shiver as he gained his greatcabins and divested himself of his best uniform and donned one of his older shirts without neckstock and slop trousers he went to the desk to give toulon an affectionate stroking of his belly in the heat of a caribbean summer the ramcat had taken to sleeping on his back with all four paws limply stuck in the air his best response to a petting was a sleepy urrmph and a thump and swish of his stout tail on the desktop toulon was down for the day mostlike to contemplate shedding lewrie went aft to the transom settee and splayed himself slackspined on the cushions his head resting on the sashwindow sill for a cool breeze choundas by god he thought cant the bastard find anything better to do than follow me round the world ive taken my best shots at him surely someoned call me out and send in another batsman to finish him off thankee id rather not this time but do keep me posted bet thatd go down well damme if fame an glory aint a cursed buggery do one thing flashy and they never give you a rest he shut his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest trying to recall the bastard from the description mr durant had read hed hit choundass arm not the chest hed aimed for two hundred yards even with a ferguson rifle was an iffy shot their swordfight on a beach at balabac in the s hacking that hateful face into ruin with a lastsecond blind slash to save his very life hamstringing him and forcing that legbrace and mask on him making choundas stump and limp with a cane evermore by now choundas should be a shambling ogre the stuff of childrens nightmares an implacable nemesis tracking him down a beast to fear but lewrie found himself grinning a bit seeing him not as his doom but as a crippled clown not as quick as he used tbe ill warrant lewrie thought as he fanned the front of his shirt for coolness it cant be his sword and mine crossed this time he order others no matter how well he chooses his minions could never measure up to him it also struck lewrie that choundas wasnt part of that massive french fleet not part of general bonapartes or of admiral de brueys grand aspirations either whod want a man that gruesome in ones entourage lewrie felt like giggling hed put people off their feed damme has choundas had a comedown tsktsk the french revolution had a habit of eating its own condemning and executing its early firebrands who were too crude radical and brutal to present on the world stage too identified with the terror and its excesses and slaughters they had a habit of turning on each other too denouncing and guillotining both leaders and followers of losing factions in their evershifting grasps for absolute power and guillaume choundas was surely one of the last of the judicial murderers whod purged the aristocrats from his own navy then purged the suspect who didnt give the revolution their entire soul more than enough reasons to shuffle him off out of sight his foul repute his buttugly appearance his continual embarassment to the glittering polished new men choundass appearance in the caribbean lewrie thought was an exile a last chance to redeem himself at best a callous dismissal to the deadly fever isles where he could die unwanted and unloved at the worst hell be desperate lewrie surmised with sudden joy hell take more risks than hed usually dare to vindicate his ugly self vulnerable lewrie whispered aloud drawing out the word syllable by syllable to savour its import third times the charm by god he jerked to his feet ready to scrabble to the quarterdeck to shout this revelation to the world chest swelling with eagerness for the meeting with his arch foe eager to shout his suddenly discovered sense of courage when before he might have trembled in his boots with dread choundas and his machinations would be the devil one knows knew too well for terror if he felt the slightest check on his emotions it was wariness he could face choundas clearheaded not swooning with anxiety in future a shambling limping crippled clown marvellous he muttered joyously aflame to speak to someone write someone about this sudden change of heart but whom caroline no hed told her about his early adventures and of encounters with choundas she knew him too well or thought that she did hed been breezy about the man swaggering as a proper hero must to express to confess that hed always feared him would be weakness and to blather on about no longer being fearful would be even worse a frenchmans insouciant gasconading boasts there was no way to rejustify himself in her eyes even did she break the seals and read his letter instead of using it for fireplace tinder theoni connor again no she had always seen him as heroic and any admission of past dreads would demean him with her he could explain just who this bкtenoir was at least lay out the odds of the possible future confrontation now they were due to cross each others hawse but maybe weaning himself of theoni connor was the better course it was three years before proteus sailed home to pay off and at least two months each way for letters he could write his father baldly stating by the by that dog we chased in asia is now here and we hunt each other the weather is fine that might be best he thought surely his father would be able to put a flea in sophies ear and that would get back to his own household in short order reawakening concern for him in carolines heart again that was two months mail packet passage before the news could affect anyone for good or ill cashman he felt like telling somebody cashman though was hipdeep in selling up his plantation was too distracted with his ongoing feud with ledyard beauman and his gleeful cackling preparations for that duel he was an old friend a man a seasoned soldier so surely he d understand did a respected courageous officer relate a few twinges of worry over an old foes reappearance and how he had found a way to deal with him over a few bottles of champagne perhaps the next time he was ashore visiting kit though that was an unbearably long time to sit on the matter and when ashore their time would mostly be spent on the duel since cashman meant to hold him to his promise to second him and the overformal punctilio of the code duello would prove exacting the curse of command lewrie sourly realised deflating from a brief moment of exuberance good tidings or shiverin shits theres not a single soul you can tell the public masque ya wear in society yer good odour as a hero wont allow it ashore either he thought with a selfdeprecating scoff over hero no he would have to play the imperturbable royal navy stock character as seen on stage saving his innermost feelings only for a good woman after all that was what a lifes helpmeet was for the role in life as stock characters for good women or baduns who dont parley any english lewrie told himself with a smirk to unburden oneself just might be an active verb there in more ways than one aspinall how are we set for something cold to drink lewrie asked the empty greatcabins and his manservant popped his head from his small pantry where hed been doing some sennetwork napkin rings pitcher o cool tea with lemon an sugar comin up sir lewrie went to the desk and ruffled toulon s belly fur tickling him under the chin the cat awoke in a trice and after a brief yawn and stifflegged stretch he began to wriggle and writhe about eager for some play tail whisking again and his eyes wide you poor old puss lewrie said with a sigh fingers escaping quickly snapped jaws and batting paws for another attack upon belly fur that put toulon into a fit of flipping from side to side may not know it but youre my onliest audience toulon youve the only ears i can whisper into cause youre the only one who cant blab mmmrrph toulon replied trapping a hand and rasping tongue on a finger i love you too you rascal afterword perhaps its not a good omen for alan lewrie but the captains and admirals who participated in the battle of camperdown had no luck at all too tainted perhaps with the worst part of the nore mutiny in the spring of their ships crews the worst and most threatening to naval and social order see kings captain for lewries part in it none of them even after winning a victory and eliminating a threat of joint francodutch invasion of england itself none of them prospered and one the captain of agincourt was cashiered for cowardice the way the dutch fought closeup and courageous shattered as many british ships as they lost none of the royal navy ships served for very long after being extensively repaired nor were any of their hardwon prizes taken at camperdown worth anything either they were bought in also given extensive repairs but five or six years later most of them ended up as nonsailing hulks or harbour receiving ships by the way those purists who might object to the orangespruit frigate being there sure i knew she was a very old warship in and was probably a hulk by the time of the battle but she was a gunner and the name was very dutch and since i know little of holland beyond tulips windmills cheeses and beers well ill not steal a victory from a real captain and his capture and ill not name a ship edam or gouda either lewrie will get his share of prize money from her taking and thats all he cares about thankee very much many thanks to the us naval institute press and michael a palmer for stodderts war regarding the rebirth of the us navy and its operations during the quasi war with france in the caribbean and thanks to ty martin usn ret and former skipper of constitution for a list of proposed ship names of american frigates that werent used so i could borrow one for the uss hancock i suspect we will run into hancock and captain kershaw again mr martins book a most fortunate ship details constitution and her operations in the caribbean during the quasi war as well as her later illustrious career by the way the founding of washington city and the district of columbia where president george washington laid the cornerstone of the capitol in was a neat little boondoggle with government money and some socalled upright characters made themselves a shower o tin buying up swampland for a song and selling it for scandalous profits my my how things never change thanks also go to bosun bob scappini and his rowdy crew up in rhode island who wore themselves out reenacting a revolutionary war artillery unit til after shifting battery eleven times one day under a broiling sun they found one of my books and decided that becoming the landing party off the american sloop of war providence might just be a lot cooler and not involve so much heavy lifting they also sent me a tape and lyric book theyd made of sailing chanteys and pulleyhauleys from which the words to nottingham ale came may the ships company landing party splice the mainbrace and beat the middies from annapolis next longboat race thanks also again to bob endone for the yearlong loan of a set of books about the royal navy and the era from his vast collection and for attempts to dig up some information about haiti and the slave revolt haiti or saint domingue well ask three haitians about it and youll get five differing opinions and a lot of shiftyeyed looks even now its an uneasy subject how their ancestors founded the first independent black nation anywhere in the world and a poorly represented topic too i had to order research material mostly reprinted in genericbland trade paperback form done by order from digitized storage one of which was one of the worst historical novels i had ever read and which shall remain nameless and authorless a brief history of the caribbean by jan rogozinksi meridian books was very helpful and explains the background from columbus s arrival the massacre of the arawak and carib indians the introduction of sugar cane and necessity of slavery along with the resultant uprisings and revolts the black jacobins by clr james is one of the few informative texts i found about haiti s history and the amazing toussaint louverture who would eventually be called the black napoleon for his military skill it was written in and revised in and good luck finding one in a bookstore james was an admitted communist who wished all africa to emulate haiti for those interested it is from vintage books a division of random house the mutiny aboard hms hermione wherein her captain hugh pigot one of admiral sir hyde parkers favourites which tells you a thing or two about parker and all his officers senior mates and most of his midshipmen were murdered the deed done in part by his own pets hed brought from a previous command outraged the royal navy and all of british society coming as it did so soon after the spithead and nore mutinies pigot was a vengeful petty inconsistent painloving beast who turned an adequate crew into maddened desperadoes it took over twenty years but about a third of the true culprits and leaders were hunted down with implacable untiring zeal by the royal navy i found the black ship by dudley pope most informative on this mattere lets belabour the obviousslavery sucks as christopher cashman tells us it brutalises both the victims and the victimizer in the end why it is still tolerated in sudan and other african countries today is beyond me just cause its blacks enslaving blacks does that make it too politically correct to deal with would we be dissing some group whom we must not only tolerate but embrace according to the rules of diversity and multiculturalism if we spoke out against it heaven forfend brutality down sooner or later engenders brutality up as in a comeuppance and the record of horrors and atrocities commited during haiti s war of the skin are a sickening litany of evil no matter how modernists wish to justify it by claiming that extremism in the pursuit of fill in the blank is no vice or that the white masters got what they deserved thinking like that merits only scorn and derision from rational and realistic people lets also remember that louverture and henri christophe his follower reinstituted slavery to prop up a shattered economy and get the unskilled field blacks back on the land where they would not be a perpetually rebellious unemployed and illiterate underclass too dark to rub shoulders with the lighterskinned upperclass leaders plantations in a broken economy were the only rewards they could give out and what goods a plantation if you dont have people to work it and reap you a profit hmmm though louverture has kicked the british out after years of occupation were not done with saint domingue yet not by a long chalk theres still general rigaud and other dissidents vying for power so the arms smuggling and piracy will continue theres still the frogs who wish to conquer the place themselves and restore the old order of things once napoleon bonaparte became first consul then emperor of the french he sent one army after another to haitisaint domingue to subjugate the place and louverture ended up betrayed and imprisoned in the icy maritime alps in europe there to perish from hunger and cold that though lies in the future and for now saint domingue is still a bugabear for british interests in the caribbean a place to be blockaded before their revolution spreads and that will keep our boy alan lewrie busy and dame but dont he just have enough on his plate his happy marriage relatively speaking o course has gone as titsup as a dynamited bass his sweet wife is out for blood andor money whichever comes firstand he still doesnt know whom to shoot whos sending all those dear friend letters his volunteer crew is still a problem should anyone ever recognise them as runaway stolen slaves he did need em perishingbad though and forgery as any careful reader of the earlier books knows does run in the family theres cashmans duel to arrange ledyard beaumans deserved bloody end to manage if for no other reason than to remove him from the british gene pool so the ministry of silly walks wont get funded til the уs and whatll be the upshot o that anent lewrie and his relationships with the other beaumans and god above theres guillaume choundas to face once more a right shower o bastards all by himself does he discover that he and lewrie are in the same ocean trust me he will then all sorts of mayhem could break loose and trust me such will hey i didnt nickname the series sex swords and sailing ships for nothing dont ye know why theres even toulon s love life that hasnt been touched upon yet and oops thatd be telling for now in good ol downhome southern parlance well leave the latchstring out for ya and as granny clamped always said yall come back now ya hear
