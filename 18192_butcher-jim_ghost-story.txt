ghost story book in the dresden files series a novel by jim butcher to air for introducing me to mab by onioncolored light acknowledgments as always there are too many people to thank and only a little bit of space to thank them in this time around i must especially thank my editor anne for putting up with my delays in writing im sure i gave her along with several of the folks trying to schedule things at penguin headaches my agent jenn was invaluable in getting everything straightened out as well as in helping me through the bumpy bits and i owe her my thanks as well i would apologize to you all abjectly if i were sure it would never happen again seems sort of insincere to do it otherwise all things considered so ill just thank you for your patience and understanding to the inhabitants of the beta asylum many more thanks than usual are owed especially for everyone who sacrificed so much of their time and focus in the last few weeks before the revised deadline your feedback support and advice were particularly invaluable to my dear patrons the readers i can only thank you for your patience after leaving the last novel the way i did then making everyone wait another three months past the usual delay while i made sure this book was ready to go enjoy and technically guys changes did not end in a cliffhanger seriously and to shannon who had to live with me during this morefranticthanusual period of insanity im almost certain ill be sane again at some point in the reasonably near future ill try to make it up to you chapter one life is hard dyings easy so many things must align in order to create life it has to happen in a place that supports life something approximately as rare as hens teeth from the perspective of the universe parents in whatever form have to come together for it to begin from conception to birth any number of hazards can end a life and thats to say nothing of all the attention and energy required to care for a new life until it is old enough to look after itself life is full of toil sacrifice and pain and from the time we stop growing we know that weve begun dying we watch helplessly as year by year our bodies age and fail while our survival instincts compel us to keep on goingwhich means living with the terrifying knowledge that ultimately death is inescapable it takes enormous effort to create and maintain a life and the process is full of pitfalls and unexpected complications ending a life by comparison is simple easy even it can be done with a relatively minor effort a single microbe a sharp edge a heavy weight or a few ounces of lead so difficult to bring about so easy to destroy youd think we would hold life in greater value than we do i died in the water i dont know if i bled to death from the gunshot wound or drowned for being the ultimate terror of the human experience once its over the details of your death are unimportant it isnt scary anymore you know that tunnel with the light at the end of it that people report in neardeath experiences been there done that granted i never heard of anyone rushing toward the light and suddenly hearing the howling blare of a trains horn i became dimly aware that i could feel my feet beneath me standing on what seemed to be a set of tracks i knew because i could feel the approaching train making them shake and buzz against the bottoms of my feet my heart sped up too for crying out loud did i just say that death isnt scary anymore tell that to my glands i put my hands on my hips and just glared at the oncoming train in disgust id had a long long day battling the forces of evil utterly destroying the red court rescuing my daughter and murdering her motheroh and getting shot to death that kind of thing i was supposed to be at peace or merging with the holy light or in line for my next turn on the roller coaster or maybe burning in an oven equipped with a stereo that played nothing but manilow thats what happens when you die right you meet your reward you get to find out the answer to the big questions of life you do not get run over by trains i said crossly i folded my arms planted my feet and thrust out my jaw belligerently as the train came thundering my way whats wrong with you bellowed a mans voice and then a heavy strong hand wrapped around my right biceps and hauled me off the track by main force dont you see the damned train said train roared by like a living thing a furious beast that howled and wailed in disappointment as i was taken from its path the wind of its passage raked at me with sharp hot fingers actually pulling my body a couple of inches toward the edge of the platform after a subjective eternity it passed and i lay on flat ground for a moment panting my heart beating along licketysplit when it finally began to slow down i took stock of my surroundings i was sprawled on a platform of clean but worn concrete and suddenly found myself under fluorescent lights as at many train stations in the chicago area i looked around the platform but though it felt familiar i couldnt exactly place it there were no other commuters no flyers or other advertisements just an empty clean featureless building and a pair of polished wing tip shoes i looked up a rather modest length of cheap trousers and cheap suit and found a man of maybe thirty years looking back at me he was built like a fireplug and managed to give the impression that if you backed a car into him hed dent your fender his eyes were dark and glittered very brightly hinting at a lively intellect his hairline had withdrawn considerably from where it must have been at one point and while he wasnt exactly goodlooking it was the kind of face you could trust southbound trains are running pretty quick lately he said looking down at me i figured you probably didnt want to hook up with that one mister man i just stared up at him i mentally added twenty years and forty pounds to the man standing in front of me subtracted more hair and realized that i knew him c i stammered ccc say it with me he said and enunciated carmichael but youre you know i said dead he snorted whoa buddy we got us a real genyoowine detective with us now we got us the awesome wizardly intellect of mister man himself he offered me his hand grinning and said look whos talking dresden i reached up dazed and took the hand of sergeant ron carmichael formerly of the chicago police departments special investigations division hed been murphys partner and hed given his life to save her from a rampaging loupgarou that had been hells bells more than ten years ago i saw him die once i was standing i stared down at him for a moment shaking my head i was a lot taller than he was you i said you look great funny what being dead can do for you he said widening his eyes dramatically and i tried weight watchers and everything he checked his watch this is fun and all but wed better get moving uh i said warily get moving where exactly carmichael stuck a toothpick in his mouth and drawled the office come on i followed him out of the station where an old goldcolored mustang was waiting he went around to the drivers side and got in it was dark it was raining the city lights were on but the place looked deserted except for the two of us i still couldnt tell exactly where in chicago we were which was damned odd i know my town i hesitated for a moment looking around trying to place myself by spotting the usual landmarks carmichael pushed open the door dont bother kid out therere all the buildings that coulda been as well as the ones that are youll give yourself a headache if you keep thinking at it i looked around once more and got into the old mustang i shut the door carmichael pulled sedately into the empty streets this isnt chicago i said genius he said amiably then where are we between between what i asked between what he said between who between where between when i frowned at him you left out why he shook his head and grinned naw kid were real fond of why around here were big fans of why i frowned at that for a moment then i said why am i here you never even heard of foreplay didja carmichael said cut straight to the big stuff why am i here as opposed toyou knowwherever it is im supposed to be maybe youre having a neardeath experience carmichael said maybe youre drowning and this is the illusion your mind is creating for you to hide you from the truth of death being here with you ive met my subconscious and hes not that sick carmichael laughed it was a warm genuine sound but that could be what is happening here and thats the point i dont understand at all and thats the point too he said i glowered he kept on smiling and said kid youre allowed to see as much as you can handle right now were someplace that looks a lot like chicago driving along in the rain in my old mustang because thats what your limits are any more wouldhe paused considering his wordswould obviate certain options and we aint big on that around here i thought about that for a moment then i said you just used obviate and aint in the same sentence i got me one of them wordaday calendars he said dont be obstreperous you kidding i said settling back in the seat i live to be obstreperous carmichael snorted and his eyes narrowed yeah well well see chapter two carmichael stopped the mustang in front of a building that reminded me of old episodes of dragnet he parked on the empty street and we walked toward the entrance so where are we going told you the office i frowned dont suppose you could be more specific he looked around his eyes narrowed not here we arent in safe territory ears everywhere i stopped on the completely empty sidewalk and looked up and down the motionless vacant street and saw nothing but lonely streetlamps traffic signals and windows unmarred by light or curtains staring more blankly than the empty eyes of a corpse yeah i said real hotbed of intrigue around here carmichael stopped at the door and looked over his shoulder he didnt say anything for a few seconds then he spoke quietly without a trace of affectation in his voice there are things out here dresden and some things are worse than death its best if you get inside i rolled my eyes at him but something about the emptiness around me was suddenly extremely nerveracking i stuck my hands in my pockets and tried to saunter inside the effect may have been slightly sabotaged by my desire to get some solid building between that emptiness and me carmichael used a key to open the door and let me in before coming in behind me his face directed back toward the street until he had shut the door and locked it he nodded to a guard a beat cop in dress uniform who stood just to one side of an elevator his back in an entirely rigid position of atease his hands clasped behind him the guards uniform was literally perfect perfectly clean the creases perfectly sharp his gloves perfectly white he wore a silverplated engraved service revolver in a gleaming black holster at his hip his features went with the uniformutterly symmetrical strong steady i stopped for a second frowning at the guard and then reached for my sight professional wizards like me have access to all kinds of wild things one of the wildest is the sight which has been described in various times and cultures as the second sight the third eye the evil eye and a host of other things it allows a wizard to look at the true nature of things around him to see the unseen world of energy and power flowing around him its dangerous once you see something with your sight you never forget it and it never fades with time take a look at the wrong thing and you can kiss your sanity goodbye but this entire scene was so rod serling i had to find something about it that i could pin down something familiar something that wasnt being spoonfed to me by a person who looked like a younger thinner carmichael i decided to try to identify the single object that was most likely to tell me something about the people around mea source of power i focused on the guards gun for a second absolutely nothing happened and then the black and silver of the gleaming weapon changed shifted the holster elongated trailing down the length of the guards leg and the pearlhandled revolver changed as well the grip straightening the silver of the barrel and chamber became the pommel handle and hilt of a cruciform sword light gleamed from the weapon not reflected from the illumination in the entry hall of the building but generated by the weapon itself the guards blue eyes shifted to me at once he lifted a hand and said in a gentle voice no and as suddenly as a door slamming into my face my sight vanished and the weapon was just a gun again the guard nodded at me my apologies for being abrupt you might have harmed yourself i looked his name tag read amitiel uh sure i said quietly lifting empty hands no problem man ive got no problem with you carmichael nodded respectfully to the guard and jammed a thumb down on the button to summon the elevator it opened at once come on mister man times awasting officer amitiel seemed to find the statement humorous he smiled as he touched two fingers to the brim of his cap in a casual salute to carmichael then he went back to his relaxed stance as a guardian calmly facing the emptiness that had unnerved me the elevator doors closed and the car rattled a little before it started moving so i said now that weve got at least one guardian angel between us and whatever it is you were nervous about can you tell me where were going carmichaels eyes crinkled at the corners he grunted im pretty much a tour guide at the moment dresden you need to talk to the captain carmichael took me through a precinct room the kind with a lot of unenclosed desks as opposed to cubicles where cops worked it looked a lot like the special investigations headquarters in chicago there were several men and women at the desks reading through files talking on phones and otherwise looking like cops at work all of them were about carmichaels apparent ageright at the line where youthful energy and wisdomcreating life experience were reaching a state of balance i didnt recognize any of them though carmichael gave and received nods from a couple he marched over to the only other door in the room leading to a private office and knocked in said a clear quiet baritone carmichael opened the door and led me into the room it was a small wellused office there were old filing cabinets an old wooden desk some battered wooden chairs the desk had an inbox an outbox and a message spike along with a rotary telephone there was no computer instead on a table next to the desk sat an old electric typewriter the man behind the desk was also more or less carmichaels age and he looked like a professional boxer there was scar tissue here and there around his eyes and his nose had been frequently broken he had hung his suit jacket over the back of his chair and his shoulders and biceps strained the fabric of his white shirtsleeves he had them rolled up to the elbows revealing forearms that were approximately as thick as wooden telephone poles and looked every bit as strong his hair was blond his eyes blue and his jawline was heavy enough to make me think of a bulldog he looked familiar somehow jack carmichael said this is dresden jack looked me up and down but he didnt get up he didnt say anything either hes always this way before hes had his cup of coffee carmichael told me dont take it personal hey coffee i said into the silence that followed that sounds good jack eyed me for a moment then he said in that same mellifluous voice dresden are you hungry no thirsty i thought about it no thats because youre dead jack said his smile was brief and not particularly reassuring you dont need to drink you dont need to eat theres no coffee i eyed carmichael i stand by my statement said carmichael he looked at jack and hooked a thumb at the door i should get back to that rakshasa thing jack said go carmichael slapped my arm and said good luck kid have fun and he strode out moving like a man on a mission that left me sharing an awkward silence with jack this isnt what i expected out of the afterlife i said thats because it isnt he said i frowned well you said i was dead ergo afterlife youre dead jack said this is between i frowned what like purgatory jack shrugged if that works for you call it that but you arent here because you need to cleanse yourself youre here because there was an irregularity with your death i got shot or drowned aint exactly rare jack lifted a big square hand and waggled it back and forth it isnt about the physical its about the spiritual i frowned spiritual the opposition jack said you died because they cheated wait what opposition the angel standing guard at the elevator is what we cops think of as a clue you need me to draw you some pictures um hell you mean like actual fallen angels not exactly but if you want to think of it that way it works sort of what you need to know is that theyre the bad guys thats why im here i said because they broke some sort of cosmic rule you were getting in their way they wanted you gone they broke the law to make it happen that makes you my problem i frowned at him and looked down at myself i noticed idly that i was wearing jeans a plain black tshirt and my black leather dusterwhich had been torn to shreds and consigned to the waters of the lake an hour or three before i got shot i mean my duster had died but i was wearing it whole and good as new which was when it really really hit me i was dead i was dead chicago the white council my enemies my friends my daughter they were all gone obsolete and i had no idea whatsoever what was going to happen to me next the room felt like it started spinning my legs started shaking i sat down on a chair opposite jacks seat i felt his steady regard on me and after a moment he said quietly son it happens to all of us its hard to face but you gotta relax and focus or theres nothing i can do for you i took some deep breaths with my eyes closedand noticed for the first time how absolutely incredible i felt physically i felt like i had when i was a kid when i was full of energy and the need to expend it doing something enjoyable my limbs felt stronger quicker lighter i looked at my left hand and saw that it was no longer covered in scar tissue from the burns id received years ago it was whole as if it had never been harmed i expanded the logic and realized that i didnt actually feel all that incrediblei was simply missing an entire catalog of injuries and trauma the faded yearsold scar id given myself on my right forearm when my knife had slipped while cleaning the fish my grandfather and i had caught was missing also the constant slowly growing level of aches and pains of the body was simply gone which made sense enough since my body was gone too the pain had stopped i mopped at my face with my hand and said sorry its just a lot to take in the smile appeared again heh just wait i felt irritated at his tone it was something to hang on to and i planted my metaphoric heels and dragged the spinning room to a stop so who are you i asked and how can you help me you want to call me something call me captain or jack or sparrow i asked jack looked at me with a cop face that showed nothing but the vague hint of disapproval he reached across the desk and slid a file folder to the blotter in front of him he opened it and scanned the contents look kid youre stuck here you arent going anywhere until we get this discrepancy sorted out why not because what comes after isnt for people who are rubbernecking over their shoulders or bitching about how unfair they had it jack said his expression frank so we sort out how you got screwed over then you get to move on to whats next i thought of being trapped in the hollow shell of the city outside and shuddered okay how do we fix it you go back jack said and you catch the scum who did you back i said back to earth yeah jack said chicago he closed the folder and dropped it into his outbox you gotta find out who killed you i arched an eyebrow at him youre kidding he stared at me his expression as jovial as a mountain crag i rolled my eyes you want me to solve my own murder he shrugged you want a job here instead i can set you up augh i said shuddering again no okay he said any questions uh i said what do you mean when you say youre sending me back i mean back to my body or nah he said isnt available isnt how it works you go back as you are i frowned at him and then down at myself as a spirit i said he spread his hands as if i had just comprehended some vast and weighty truth dont hang around for sunrise watch out for thresholds you know the drill yeah i said disturbed but without my body wont have much magic most people cant see you hear you wont be able to touch things i stared at him how am i supposed to find anything out like that i asked jack lifted both hands kid i dont make the law i make sure it gets observed he squinted at me besides i thought you were a detective i clenched my jaw and glared at him my glare isnt bad but he wasnt impressed i exhaled slowly and then said solve my own murder he nodded anger rose from my chest and entered my voice i guess it isnt enough that i spent my adult life trying to help and protect people theres something else i have to do before going off to meet saint peter jack shrugged dont be so certain about that with your record son you might just as easily find yourself on a southbound train hell i spat you know what hell is captain sparrow hell is staring at your daughter and knowing that youll never get to touch her again never get to speak to her never get to help her or protect her bring on the lake of fire it wouldnt come close in point of fact jack said calmly i do know what hell is you arent the only dead guy with a daughter dresden i sank back into my chair frowning at him and then turned my head to stare past him to a simple landscape painting on the wall if it makes any difference jack said three of the people you love will come to great harm unless you find your murderer what do you mean harm i asked maimed changed broken which three people i asked cant tell you that he said yeah i muttered i bet you cant i thought about it maybe i was dead but i was sure as hell not ready to go i had to make sure the people whod helped me take on the red king were taken care of my apprentice molly had been badly wounded in the battle but that wasnt her biggest problem now that i was dead there was nothing standing between her and a summary beheading at the hands of the white council of wizards and my daughter little maggie was still back there id deprived her of a mother just as someone else had deprived her of a father i had to make sure she was taken care of i needed to tell my grandfather goodbye and karrin god what had karrin found when she came back to the boat to pick me up a giant splatter of blood my corpse she was misguided and stubborn enough that i was sure she would blame herself for whatever had happened shed tear herself apart i had to reach her somehow and i couldnt do that from this spiritual siberia could they be the ones the captain was talking about or was it someone else dammit my self might have felt full of energy and life but my mind was weary almost beyond measure hadnt i done enough hadnt i helped enough people rescued enough prisoners defeated enough monsters id made enemies of some of the deadliest and most evil things on the planet and fought them time and again and one of them had killed me for it rest in peace it says on all those tombstones id fought against the rising tide until it had literally killed me so where the hell was my rest my peace three of the people you love will come to great harm unless you find your murderer my imagination conjured scenes filled with the anguish of the people i cared most about which pretty much settled things i couldnt allow something like that to happen besides there was one more thing that made me certain that i wanted to go back at the end of the day some son of a bitch had freaking killed me thats not the kind of thing you can just let stand and if it would let me get out of this place and let me move on to wherever it was i was supposed to go that was a nice bonus okay i said quietly how does it work he slid a pad and a piece of paper across the desk at me along with a pencil you get to go to an address in chicago he said you write it there driver will drop you off i took the pad and paper and frowned at it trying to work out where to go i mean it wasnt like i could show up just anywhere if i was going in as a pure spirit it would be futile to contact any of my usual allies it takes some serious talent to see a spirit that hasnt manifested itself the way a ghost can occasionally appear to the physical eye my friends wouldnt even know i was there out of curiosity i said what happens if i dont catch the killer his expression turned sober and his voice became quieter youll be trapped there maybe forever unable to touch unable to speak watching things happen in the world with no ability whatsoever to affect them hell i said quietly hell thats cheerful youre dead son jack said cheer is contraindicated i nodded i was looking at one hellbadumpbumpchingof a risk i mean fitting in here in chicagotory might not be fun but it probably wouldnt be torture either judging from what carmichael and jack had said and from the way they went about their business they were able to act in some fashion maybe even do some good they didnt look particularly thrilled to be doing what they were doing but they carried that sense of professional purpose with them a ghost trapped on the mortal coil that would be far worse always present always watching and always impotent i never really developed my dontgetinvolved skills id go crazy in a year and wind up one more pathetic insane trapped spirit haunting the town id spent my adult life protecting screw it i said and started writing on the paper if my friends need me i have to try jack took the pad back with a nod of what might have been approval then he stood up and pulled on his suit coat car keys rattled in his hand he was only medium height but he moved with a confidence and a tightly leashed energy that once more made him seem familiar somehow lets go several of the copsbecause i was sure they were cops or at least were doing something so similar that the word fitnodded to jack as he went by hey called someone from behind us murphy jack stopped and turned around a guy wearing a suit that would have looked at home in the historic pinkerton detective agency came over to jack with a clipboard and held it out along with a pen jack scanned what was on it signed off and passed the clipboard back to the man jack resumed his walking speed i stuck my hands in my duster pockets and stalked along beside him captain collin j murphy i asked quietly he grunted youre karrins dad used to run the black cat case files he didnt say anything we went down the elevator past the guard angel and out to the street where an old blue buick skylark one with tail fins and a convertible roof sat waiting by the curb he went around to the drivers side and we both got in the rain drummed on the roof of the car he sat behind the wheel for a moment his eyes distant then he said yeah shes talked about you he nodded i hear youve looked out for my karrie karrie i tried to imagine the person who would call murphy that to her face rawlins had done it once but only once and not only was he her partner but hed also worked with her dad when she was a little girl rawlins was practically family anyone else would need to be a terminator from krypton sometimes i said she doesnt need much in the way of protection everyone needs someone then he started the car the engine coming to life with a satisfying throaty purr jack ran his hand over the steering wheel thoughtfully and looked out at the rain you can back out of this if you want son until you get out of this car once you do that youve chosen your pathand whatever comes with it yep i said and nodded firmly the sooner i get started the sooner i get done his mouth quirked up at one corner and he nodded making a grunting sound of approval he peered at the pad read the address id written and grunted why here because thats where ill find the one person in chicago im sure can help me i said captain murphy nodded okay he said lets go chapter three captain murphys old skylark stopped in a residential area up in harwood heights a place that still looked as empty and hollow as the rest of the city it was an odd home for chicagoa white stucco number with a red tile roof that looked like it had been transplanted from southern california in the steady rain and the mournful grey light of the streetlamps it stood cold lonely and empty of purpose among the more traditional homes that surrounded it the buicks windshield wipers thumped rhythmically once you get out said captain murphy theres no coming back youre on your own been there done that i said i offered him my hand thank you captain he traded grips with me i didnt try to outcrush him he didnt try to crush me the men who can really handle themselves rarely do i wished captain murphy had lived long enough for me to meet him in the real world i had a feeling hed have made one hell of an ally i might be in touch with karrin i said no messages ive done her enough harm he said almost before i had finished speaking his voice carried a tone of unquestionable finality he nodded toward the house but you can tell the big fellow over there that i sent you it might help i nodded then i took a deep breath opened the door of the car and stepped out into i was more impressed with what i hadnt stepped into for a moment because when my feet hit the ground and the car door shut behind me i wasnt standing in chicagos rainy abandoned corpse instead i was on a city street on a cold clear evening no rain fell the stars and moon burned bright overhead and the ambient city light combined with a fairly fresh and heavy snowfall to make it nearly as bright as daylight outside sounds rushed all around me traffic distant horns the thumping beat of music from a large stereo a jets passage left a hollow roar behind iti was standing only a few miles from ohare i turned to look behind me but captain murphys car had vanished back into chicago between presumably i stood there alone i sighed then i turned and walked onto the property of mortimer lindquist ectomancer once upon a time morty had covered his lawn with decorations meant to be intimidating and spooky headstones a wroughtiron fence with a big metal gate eerie lighting the overall impression could be scary if you were gullible enough and the lighting was low but mostly it had looked like cheap halloween decorations outside a crack house times had changed morty had gotten rid of all the cheap junk except for the fence hed turned his front yard into a japanese garden there were a few hedges and a koi pond complete with a little wooden bridge that spanned it raised planters everywhere contained bonsai all of them trees native to north america it was a little unnerving to see what looked like an adult oak treeonly fifteen inches high and complete with miniature leaves there werent a lot of people in chicago doing that for money which implied that it was mortys own handiwork if so it had taken him a lot of effort and patience to create those i walked forward calmly reaching out to open the gate my hand went right through it yeah i know i was essentially a ghost but id never gotten much practice with intangibility i was used to reaching out for objects and being able to touch them now my hand simply tingled as if waking up after id taken a nap and used it as a pillow i pushed my arm a little farther forward leaning to one side and saw my fingertips emerge from the metal of the gate i waggled my fingers just to be sure okay i said no help for it then i took a deep breath and held it as if i were about to jump into deep water then i hunched my shoulders and rushed forward anticlimax as i went through the gate i was subjected to a swift intense tingling sensation then i was on the other side i walked up a little stone path leading to mortys front door but it wasnt until i had gone over the bridge that i saw the man standing in the shadows on the front porch he was huge not built like a weight lifter or anything just a naturally bigboned brawny man standing almost as tall as i his dark hair was gathered at the nape of his neck with a bit of ribbon a long dark blue coat fell to his calves its sleeves marked with gold braid beneath that he wore a uniforma tightfitting blue jacket white shirt white pants and high black boots he carried some kind of longhandled ax over one shoulder and as i came to a halt he was already drawing a flintlock pistol from his belt with his free hand he leveled it just a little bit to one side of me and called out halt identify yourself scoundrel or begone scoundrel i asked putting my fingers on my chest as if distressed at the accusation thats a little unfair yeve the look of a scoundrel boomed the man and a dandysprat and a ragamuffin though ill admit for all that ye could yet be a congressman i could see the white flash of his teeth in the dark as he smiled give me a name man harry dresden i said in a clear tone the barrel of the gun wavered a few more degrees away from me the wizard the late wizard i replied then gestured down at myself the late harry dresden really zounds the man said he frowned for a moment as if in thought it didnt look natural on him if you lie he said slowly i can see no veritable reason for doing so and i am inclined to shoot you yet if you tell the truth your presence here draws mischief to my friends house and i am inclined to shoot you repeatedly he nodded firmly and settled the guns barrel on me either way he was about to shoot i didnt know if it would rekill me or not but given what i had experienced of the universe it might at the very least i figured it would probably hurt like a son of a bitch i had to keep this bozo from bringing the hammer down assuming his period outfit was authentic that might be simple little rude isnt it to shoot me i asked him im unarmed and ive offered no violence or insult to you introduced myself even whereas you havent even told me your name the man in the blue coat looked suddenly abashed and the pistol dropped slightly once more ah yes um please excuse me societal graces were imperfectly instilled in me in my youth and that sad fact tends to be reflected in my more temperate afterlife he straightened and literally clicked his heels together without ever moving the gun far from me and gave me a slight bow the late captain sir stuart winchester of the colonial marines i arched an eyebrow sir stuart of the colonial marines he shrugged it is a protracted and complex tale well stu i said with all due respect my business here is not with you its with mr lindquist i hardly think so stu sniffed have you an invitation i gave him a blank look for a moment and then said im new to the whole ghost thing but im damned sure you dont just send out envelopes through the us ghostal service yed be surprised how many postal workers leave a shade behind stu countered the routine methinks is what keeps them making their rounds the poor things dont even realize anythings changed dont change the subject i said i need to talk to mort i am sorry sir stu said but the standing order regarding the visit of any uninvited ghosts is to deny them entry and you have to follow morts orders it isnt as though you could cross his threshold uninvited in any case man he said right i said you have to follow his orders we are not compelled stu said at once and severely we aid him out of friendship and respect and he sighed and added and boredom ye gods but this city pales after but half a century and ive lingered here more than four times that i found myself grinning at the ghost stu let me make you a promise maybe even an oath i come to ask morts help not to harm himand im reasonably sure my presence will not contribute to your ongoing sense of ennui stu let out a rolling belly laugh and began to speak but the sound died off and he stared at me thoughtfully tapping a fingertip against the pistol if it makes any difference i said jack murphy was the one who dropped me off here told me to mention his name stus eyebrows shot up i could see the thoughts racing behind his eyes they werent going to win any sprints but they seemed good for the long haul aye he pursed his lips a good fellow for an irishman i snorted if hes ever around youd better smile when you say a flood of intangible cold pressed against my back as suddenly as if id been standing in front of an industrial freezer door when it opened i turned to see a humanoid grey form floating just above the ground maybe five yards away from me and drifting closer the details were obscure the proportions slightly off as if i were looking at a badly molded plastic doll there were no real features on it just hollow gaping eye sockets within a sunken nearly skulllike face and a wide empty mouth that hung open as if the tendons attaching the lower jaw had stretched out like old elastic bands it moved with a kind of shuffling grace as if it had no real weight and needed only to touch the ground to propel itself forward with its toes it made a sound as it came a hollow rattling muted gasp it was the sound of an agonized scream that had long since run out of breath to propel itbut tried to continue anyway it got closer to me and i felt colder as it did get back i snapped i mean it the creature came forward with another little touch of its toes to the earth as mindless and graceful as a hungry jellyfish and a hell of a lot creepier i took a pair of quick steps back and said fine be that way i lifted my right hand drew in my will and snarled fuego and nothingnothing at allhappened there was no stirring of forces deep inside me there was no current of equal parts giddy excitement vibrating tension and raw lightning flashing through my thoughts there was no flash of whitehot flame that would have incinerated the apparition coming toward me there was no magic there was no magic oh crap i choked and reeled back as the things fingers raked at me with deathly grace the sound of its strangled scream growing higher pitched its fingers didnt end in nails they just sort of trailed off into drifting shreds that were surrounded by deadly cold behind me there was a mechanical sound clickclack of a large halfcocked trigger being pulled fully back and ready to fire i whirled my head around in time to see stus enormous old gun snap up to aim directly at the end of my nose im sure its barrel wasnt actually as big as a train tunnel but at the moment it sure as hell looked like it i felt the wave of cold intensify against my back and by the time stu shouted get down i was already halfway to the ground i hit hardapparently being insubstantial didnt free me from the laws of gravity or the discomfort of its unwavering enforcementat the same time that stus pistol went off everything happened in dreamtime slowly enough for me to see every detail but so swiftly that i felt that no matter how fast i moved i would not be able to keep up i was expecting the crack of a pistol round or even the hollow whump of a largebore blackpowder weapon what i got was a roar that sounded like it had been distorted by a dozen different djs and a mile of train tunnel the standard plume of blackpowder smoke didnt emerge from the barrel instead expanding concentric rings of pastel mist puffed out swirling at their center as if pulled into following the contrail of the bullet the bullet itself was no lump of lead it was a sphere of multicolored light that looked nearly big enough to be a golf ball it went by a couple of feet over my head and i swear it felt like id gotten a mild sunburn just from being close to it a deep tone like the thrumming of an amplified bassguitar string emanated from the sphere vibrating through my flesh and against my bones i turned my head in time to see the sphere smash against the chest of the attacking apparition the notbullet plunged into its body tearing a hole the size of my fist in its chest a cloud of something that looked like steam poured out of the creature light kindled within it almost like an old movie projector playing upon the vapor and i suddenly saw a flicker of shadowy images all of them dim warped twisted as if someone had made a clips reel from the random strips of celluloid from the cuttingroom floor the images grew steadily dimmer until there was nothing left but a thinning cloud of mist it wasnt until then that i saw that the grey form was gradually sagging like a waterskin being slowly emptied the mists vanished all that was left of the grey creature was an ugly colorless lump on the ground firm bootsteps came down the walkway from the porch and stu placed himself between me and the thing whatever it had been though his hands were reloading the pistol complete with powder horn and a short ramrod his eyes swept up and down the street around us what the hell was that i asked wraith he said quietly with a certain professional detachment in his voice a ghost like you or me who gave in to despair and gave up his sense of selfreason dangerous extremely so stu said he turned to look down at me especially to someone like you like me a fresh shade youve a paucity of experience in learning to defend yourself here and it is all but impossible for a fresh shade such as yourself to hide there is a sense of life that clings to you he frowned to you especially because im a wizard maybe stu nodded likely likely what would have happened if i gestured at the wraiths remains it would have devoured your memories stu said calmly i considered that for a moment and studied the remains almost wistfully i dont know ive got some i wouldnt mind losing stu slid his readied pistol back into his belt for shades memories are life sustenance and power we are memories now wizard the images in the mist i said when it was was dying they were its memories aye what was left of them stu moved forward and crouched over the remains he held out his hand palm down over them and took a deep breath after a few heartbeats glowing mist began to rise from the wraiths remains it snaked through the air and into stus chest flowing into him like water into a pool when it was complete he stood again and let out a sigh whatever had struck the wraith it had evidently been made of the same substance as sir stuart if ghosts then were memories the bullet i said you made it out of a memory naturally he said his expression filled with a gentle distant sorrow a strong one ill make it into another bullet at some point thank you i said for helping me i must admit i did not put the poor brute down exclusively for your sake wizard you represent a feast for any wraith fresh from the world of the living still with a touch of vitality upon you and full to bursting with fresh unfaded memories the wraith that ate you would become powerfula dire fell creature indeed one that could threaten the world of the living as easily as it could the world of spirit i wont have that oh i said thanks anyway stu nodded and offered me his hand i took it rose and said i need to talk to mort even as i spoke i saw two more wraiths appear from the darkness i checked behind me and saw more coming drifting with effortless motions and deceptive speed if you get me inside morts threshold ill be safe from them i said nodding to the wraiths i dont know how to defend myself against them theyll kill me and if that happens youll have that monster wraith on your hands not if i kill you first stu said calmly tapping a finger on the handle of his pistol i turned my head slightly to one side eyeing him studying his face nah i said wont happen how would you know spook he asked in a flat voice but he couldnt keep the smile out of his eyes im a wizard i said infusing my voice with portentous undertones we have our ways he remained silent expression stern but his eyes danced i sobered and those wraiths are getting closer man stu snorted and said the wraiths are always getting closer then he drew his pistol and pointed it at my chest i hereby take you prisoner late wizard keep your hands in plain sight follow all my verbal instructions and well do splendidly i showed him my hands oh uh okay stu nodded sharply about face then lets go talk to the little bald man chapter four i followed stu through the front door dammit tingle ouch and paused on the other side to consider that fact for a moment only a member of the households family could issue an invitation that would let an immaterial entity past the homes threshold so sir stuart was practically family around morts place unless he was literal family hauntings after all have historically been known to remain with a specific family lineage could stu be one of morts ancestors here to watch out for his familial posterity or had the little ectomancer always possessed an odd sort of family one i had never known about interesting it would be wise to keep my eyes open the house looked much different what had been a cheesily staged séance room had become a living room with a sofa love seat and comfortable chairs id seen only part of the rest of the house but as i walked with sir stuart i could see that the dismal little den of a house had been renovated redecorated and otherwise made more beautiful stu guided me to a room that was part library part office with a fire crackling in the fireplace mortimer lindquist seemed to have finally given in to the inevitable id seen him with a bad toupee and with an even worse combover but this was the first time id seen him sporting a fullon charles xavier the unbroken shine of his pate looked a lot better than the partial coverage hed lost weight too since last id seen him i mean he wasnt going to be modeling for abercrombie fitch or anything but hed definitely dropped from selfdestructively obese down to merely stout he was in his early fifties under five and a half feet tall and dressed in black slacks and a grey silk shirt and he wore little squarerimmed spectacles he sat at his table a deck of playing cards spread out in front of him in what could be either a fortunetelling through the cards or a game of solitairethey tended to have about the same amount of significance in my experience did i hear a shot sir stuart mort asked absently staring intently at the cards then his hands froze in the act of dealing another and he shot to his feet whirling to face me oh perfect hiya morty i said this is not happening mort said promptly getting up from the table and walking quickly toward another room this just cant be happening no one is this unlucky i hurried forward trying to keep up and followed him into a hallway i need to talk to i dont care mort said his arms crossing each other in a slashing pushingaway gesture never stopping i do not see you i am not listening to you dresden its not enough that you have to keep dragging me into things in life so now your stupid ghost shows up to do it too no whatever it is no we entered a kitchen where i found sir stuart already present his arms folded leaning back against a wall with a quiet smile as he watched mort went to a large cookie jar opened it and took out a single oreo before replacing the lid morty come on its never been like that i said ive come to ask your help a couple of times because youre a capable professional and bullshit mort snapped spinning to face me his eyes flashing dresden came to me when he was so desperate he might as well try any old loser i winced his summation of our relationship was partially true but not entirely morty please morty what he snapped back youve got to be kidding me i am not getting involved in whatever international crisis you mean to perpetrate next its not like ive got a lot of choice in the matter man its you or no one please just hear me out he barked out an incredulous little laugh no you hear me out shade no means no it isnt happening it isnt ever going to happen i said no and then he slammed the door to the next room in my face dammit morty i snarled and braced myself for the plunge through his door after him dresden st sir stuart said too late i slammed my nose and face into the door and fell backward onto my ass like a perfect idiot my face began to throb immediately swelling with pain that felt precisely normal identical to that of any dummy who walked into a solid oak door op sir stuart finished he sighed and offered me a hand up i took it and he hauled me to my feet ghost dust mixed into the paint inside the room he explained no spirit can pass through it im familiar with it i muttered and felt annoyed that i hadnt thought of the idea before as an additional protection against hostile spirits at my own apartment to the beings of the immaterial ghost dust was incontrovertible solidity thrown directly at a ghost it would cause tremendous pain and paralyze it for a little while as if the spook had been suddenly loaded down with an incredible and unexpected weight if id put it all over my walls it would have turned them into a solid obstacle to ghosts and their ilk shutting them out with obdurate immobility of course my recipe had used depleted uranium dust which would have made it just a tad silly to spread around the interior of my apartment not that it mattered my apartment was gone taken when a molotov cocktail hurled by a vampire assassin had burned the boardinghouse to the ground along with most of my worldly possessions only a few had been left hidden away god knew where they were now i suppose i couldnt really count that as a loss all things considered material possessions arent much use to a dead man i lifted a hand to my nose wincing and expecting to find it rebroken no such thing had happened though a glob of some kind of runny transparent gelatinous liquid smeared the back of my hand hells bells im bleeding ectoplasm that drew a smile from the late marine ghosts generally do youll have to forgive him dresden he can be very slow to understand things at times i dont have time to wait for him to catch on i said i need his help sir stuart grinned some more you arent going to get it by standing there repeating yourself like a broken record repeating yourself like a broken record repeating yourself like a broken haha i said without enthusiasm people who cared about me are going to get hurt if i cant act sir stuart pursed his lips it seems to me that if your demise was to leave someone vulnerable something would have happened to them already its been six months after all i felt my jaw drop open wwhat six months the ghost nodded today is the ninth of may to be precise i stared at him flabbergasted then i turned put my back against mortys impenetrable door and used it to stay upright as i sank to the ground six months yes thats not i knew i was just gabbling my stream of thought but i couldnt seem to stop myself from talking thats not right it cant be right i was dead for less than a freaking hour what kind of rip van winkle bullshit is this sir stuart watched me his expression serious and untroubled time has little meaning to us now dresden and its very easy to become unattached to it i once lost five years listening to a pink floyd album there is snow a foot and a half deep on the ground i said pointing in a random direction in may his voice turned dry the television station mortimer watches theorizes that it is due to personmade global climate change i was going to say something insulting maybe even offensive but just then the rippling sound of metallic wind chimes tinkled through the air they were joined seconds later by more and more of the same until the noise was considerable whats that i asked sir stuart turned and walked back the way wed come and i hurried to follow in the next room over a dozen sets of wind chimes hung from the ceiling all of them were astir whispering and singing even though there was no air moving through the room sir stuarts hand went to his ax and i suddenly understood what i was looking at it was an alarm system whats happening i asked him another assault he said we have less than thirty seconds come with me chapter five to arms bellowed sir stuart theyre coming at us again lads the ringing of the alarm chimes doubled as figures immediately exploded from the very walls and floor of the ectomancers house appearing as suddenly as well as ghosts duh one second the only figures in sight were me and sir stuart the next we were striding at the head of a veritable armed mob the figures didnt have the same kind of sharpedged reality that sir stuart did they were wispier foggier though i could see sir stuart with simple clarity viewing the others was like watching someone walk by on the opposite side of the street during a particularly heavy rain there was no specific theme to the spirits defending morts house the appearance of each was eclectic to such an extent that they looked like the assembled costumed staff from some kind of museum of american history soldiers in the multicolored uniforms of regulars from the revolutionary war walked beside buckskinclad woodsmen trappers and native americans from the wars preceding the revolution farmers from the civil war era stood with shopkeepers from the turn of the twentieth century men in suits some armed with shotguns others with tommy guns moved toward the attack the bitter divisions of the era of prohibition apparently forgotten doughboys marched with a squad of buffalo soldiers followed by half a dozen genuine sixguntoting cowboys in long canvas coats and a group of grunts whose uniforms placed them as vietnamera us army infantry huh i said now theres something you dont see every day sir stuart drew his gun from his belt as he strode forward checking the old weapon ive seen a great many years in this city many many nights until recently i would have agreed with you i looked back at sir stuarts little army as we reached the front door and passed through it iglah dammit that feels strangeguess that means youre seeing a pattern this is the fifth night running that theyve come at us sir stuart replied as we went out onto the porch stay behind me dresden and well clear of my ax arm he came to a halt a step later and i stood behind him a bit and on his left side sir stuart who had been a giant for his day was only a couple of inches shorter than me i had to strain to see over him the street was crowded with silent figures i just stared out at them for a moment struggling to understand what i was looking at out on the road were scores maybe even a couple of hundred wraiths like the one sir stuart had dispatched earlier they were flabby somehow hollow and squishylooking like balloons that hadnt been filled with enough gassad frightening humanoid figures their eyes and mouths gaping too large too dark and too empty to seem real but instead of advancing toward us they simply stood there in even ranks leaning forward slightly their arms held vaguely upward as if yearning toward the house though their hands seemed limp and devoid of strength their fingers trailing into shapeless shreds the horrible sound of hundreds of nearly silent moans of pain emanated from the block of wraiths along with a slowly building edge of tension tell me wizard sir stuart said what do you see a crapton of wraiths i breathed quietly which i do not know how to fight none of them had the deadly focused look of sir stuart and his crew but there were a lot of them out there something is getting them worked up ah he said he glanced back over his shoulder at me his eyes narrowed i thought your folk had clear sight i frowned at him and then out at the small sea of wraiths i stared and stared bringing the focus of concentration id learned over endless hours of practice in my studiesand suddenly saw them dark slithering shapes moving up and down the ranks of wraiths at the backs of their lines they looked vaguely like folk covered in dark enveloping cloaks and robes but they glided through the air with a silent effortless grace that made me think of sharks who had scented blood in the water and were closing in to feed four five six of them i said in the back ranks good said sir stuart nodding his approval thats the real foe lad these poor wraiths are just their dogs it had been a long long time since id felt quite this lost uh what are they lemurs he said with the latin pronunciation laymoors shades who have set themselves against providence and have given themselves over to malice and rage they do not know pity nor restraint nor fear i guessed they always never know fear sir stuart glanced over his shoulder and bounced his longhandled ax against his palm his mouth turned up into an edged wolfish grin nay lad perhaps they were innocent of it once but they proved quick learners when they raised their hands against this house he turned back to face the street and called out positions the spirits who had come along behind us flowed around and over us andthough i twitched when i saw itbeneath us within seconds they were spread into a defensive line in the shape of a half dome between the house and the gathered wraiths and lemurs then those silent forms stood steady whether their feet were planted on the ground or in thin air or somewhere just below the ground and faced the small horde with their weapons in hand the tension continued to build and the seething agonized gasps of the wraiths grew louder um i said as my heart started picking up the pace what do i do nothing sir stuart replied his attention now focused forward just stay near me and out of my way but i can see you were a fighter boy stuart said his voice harsh but now youre a child youve neither the knowledge nor the tools you need to survive he turned and gave me a ferocious glare and an unseen force literally pushed my feet back across five or six inches of porch holy crap stuart might not be a wizard but obviously i had a thing or two to learn about how a formidable will translated to power on the spooky side of the street stay close to me the marine said and shut it i swallowed and sir stuart turned back to the front you dont have to be a dick about it i muttered very quietly it bothered me that he was right without sir stuarts intervention id have been dead again already thats rightyou heard me dead again already i mean come on how screwed up is your life after or otherwise when you find yourself needing phrases like that i indulged myself in half a second of disgust that once again the universe seemed to be making an extraspecial effort to align itself against me but it was my pride that was in critical condition i was accustomed to being the guy who did the fighting and protecting fear had been fuel for the fire meat and potatoes when i was the one calling the shots but now this was terror of an alien vintage i was helpless without warning the air filled with whistling and earslashing shrieks and the horde of wraiths washed toward us in a flash flood of strangled moans give it to them lads sir stuart bellowed his voice rising above the cacophony of screams with the silvery clarity of a trumpet spectral gunfire roared out at once from the weapons of the hovering defenders again clouds of powder smoke were replaced with bursts of colored mist bullets had been switched out for streaking spheres of violent radiance instead of the explosions of propellant and projectiles breaking the sound barrier hammering bassnote thrums filled the air and echoed on long after a gunshot would have faded a tide of destruction swept over the assaulting wraiths distorted light and sound tearing great ragged holes in them filling the air with faded warped shadowimages as their feeble memories bled into wisps of cloud that were swallowed by the night they fell by the dozensand there were still plenty more wraiths left to go around wraiths closed in with the lindquist historical home defense societyand it still wasnt fair sir stuarts troops reacted like the fighting men they had once been swords and sabers appeared along with stilettos and brass knuckles and bowie knives the wraiths came at them with a slow graceful terrible momentum and were hacked stabbed punched clubbed and otherwise brokenbut there were a lot of wraiths i heard a hollow scream that sounded as if it had come from a couple of blocks away and lifted my eyes to see half a dozen wraiths who had all attacked together swarm over a phantom doughboy a scrawny young man in a baggy uniform though one of the things was literally opened from one side to the other by a slash of the ghost soldiers bayonet the other five just fastened onto him first by a single fingertip which was then blindly followed by others another wraith expired when the young soldier drew his knife but then all those tattered fingers began winding and winding around him lengthening impossibly until within a few seconds he looked like nothing so much as a massive burn victim covered in heavy dirty bandages the wraiths pressed closer and closer their flabby bodies compressing until they hardly resembled human forms at all and then with a sudden scream they darted away in four different directions as more solid lethallooking shapes leaving behind the translucent outline of a young man screaming in agony i watched my stomach twisting as even that image faded within seconds it was gone damn their empty eyes sir stuart said his teeth clenched damn them hells bells i breathed why didnt couldnt you have stopped them the lemurs he spat i cant give them the chance to get by me into the house i blinked but the threshold they cant they did the first night he said still dont know how i cant leave the porch or theyll get through now be quiet his fingers flexed and settled on the haft of his ax heres where we come to it as the wraiths continued to assault and entangle the houses defenders sir stuart moved to the top of the little stairs leading up to the porch and planted his feet out at the street the shadowy forms of the lemurs had all gone still each of them hunched down in a crouch predators preparing to spring when it came it came fast not fast like the rush of a mountain lion upon a deer and not even fast like a runaway automobile they were fast like bullets one second the lemurs were at the street and the next they were in the air before the porch seemingly without crossing the space between i didnt have time to do more than yelp and go into a fullbody twitch of pure startled reaction but sir stuart was faster the first lemur to charge met the butt of sir stuarts ax a blow that sent it into a fluttering backward tailspin the second and third lemurs charged at almost exactly the same moment and sir stuarts ax swept out in a scything arc slashing them both and sending them reeling with highpitched horrible screams the fourth lemur drove a bonywristed punch across sir stuarts jaw staggering the marine and driving him to one knee but when the lemur tried to follow up the attack stuart produced a gleaming knife from his belt and it flashed in opalescent colors as he swept it in a treacherous diagonal slash over the things midsection the fifth lemur hesitated seeming to abort its instantaneous rush about halfway across the yard stuart let out a bellow and threw the knife it struck home and the lemur frantically twisted in upon itself howling like the others until the knife tumbled free of its ghostly flesh and fell to the snowy ground five wounded lemurs fled from sir stuart screaming the sixth crouched on the sidewalk frozen in indecision coward stuart snarled if you cant finish dont start all things considered i thought stuart might be being a little hard on the thing it wasnt cowardly to not rush a juggernaut when youd just seen your buddies get thrashed by it maybe the thing was just smarter than the others i never got a chance to find out in the space of an instant sir stuart crossed the lawn to the final lemur only his rush ended not in front of his foe but six feet past it the lemur jerked in the twisting surprised reaction i had just engaged in a moment before then its head fell from its shoulders hood and all dissolving into flickering memory embers as it went its headless body went mad somehow letting out a scream thrashing and kicking and falling to the ground where greyandwhite fire poured from its truncated neck a shout of triumph went up from the homes defenders as they continued their own fight and the suddenly listless wraiths began to be torn apart in earnest the tide of battle shifting rapidly sir stuart lifted his ax above his head in response and turned to almost casually step up behind a wraith and take its head from its shoulders with the ax then in the street about ten feet behind him a figure one every bit as solid and real as sir stuart himself appeared out of nowhere a form shrouded in a nebulous grey cloak with eyes of greenwhite fire it lifted what looked like a clawed hand and sent a bolt of lightning sizzling into sir stuarts back sir stuart cried out in sudden agony his body tightening helplessly muscles convulsing just as they would on an electrocuted human being the bolt of lightning seemed to attach itself to his spine then burned a line down to his right hip bone burning and searing and blowing bits of the tattered flaming substance of his ghostly flesh into the air no i screamed as he fell i started running toward him the marine rolled when he hit the ground and came up with that ridiculously huge old horse pistol in his hand he leveled it at the grey ghost and fired and once again his gun sent out a plume of ethereal color and a tiny bright sun of destruction but the cloudy grey figure lifted its hand and the bullet bounced off the air in front of it smoothly catching a luckless wounded wraith who had been attempting to retreat the wraith immediately dissolved as the first one hadand sir stuart stared up at the grey ghost with his mouth open in shock magic the grey ghost was using magic even as i ran forward i could feel the humming energy of it in the air smell it on the cold breeze coming off the lake i didnt move at ghostly superspeed i mostly just ran across the hard ground hurdled the little fence went right through a car parked on the street ow grrrrrr and threw my best haymaker of a right cross at a point i nominated to be the grey ghosts chin my fist connected with what felt like solid flesh a refreshingly familiar smackthump of impact that immediately flashed red pain through my wrist to the elbow the grey ghost reeled and i didnt let up i put a couple of left hooks into its midsection gave it one hell of an uppercut with my right hand and drove a hard reverse punch into its neck i am not a skilled martial artist but i know a little picked up in training with murphy and some of the other si cops over the years at dough joes hurricane gym real fighting is only slightly about form and technique mostly its about timing and about being willing to hurt somebody if you know more or less when to close the distance and throw the punch youre most of the way there but having the right mindset is even more important all the technique in the world isnt going to help you if you come to the fight without the will to wreak havoc on the other guy the grey ghost staggered back and i kicked one leg out from under it as it went it fell i started kicking it as hard as i could screaming driving my toe into its ribs and back then switching to move in and stomp at its head with the heel of my heavy hiking boot i did not let up not even for a second if this thing could pull out more magic it would deal with me as easily as it had sir stuart so i focused on trying to crush the enemys skull and kept kicking help me snarled the grey ghost there was a flash of blue light and what felt like a wrecking ball made from foamrubber mattresses smashed into my chest it threw me back completely through the car again hells bells ow and i landed on my back with stars in front of my eyes unable to remember how to inhale a nearby wraith turned its emptyeyed head toward me and a surge of fear sent me scrambling to my feet i got up in time to see the grey ghost rising as well and those burning greenwhite eyes met mine in the air behind the ghost floated a skull a skull with cold blue flames flickering in its empty eye sockets youve got to be kidding me i whispered bob you the ghost hissed its hands formed into arching clawlike shapes and it hissed in rageand in fear clickclack went the hammer of sir stuarts gun the grey ghost let out a scream of frustration and simply flew apart into thousands of tiny wisps of mist taking the floating skull along with it the wisps swarmed together into a vortex like a miniature tornado and streaked down the road and out of sight leaving a hundred voices screaming a hundred curses in its wake i looked around the lasts of the wraiths were dying or had fled the houses defenders most of them wounded and bleeding pale ectoplasm and flickering memory were still in their positions sir stuart was holding one hand to his side and with the other held the pistol pointed at the empty air where the grey ghost had been ahhhh he said sagging once it became clear that the fight was over bloody hell thats going to leave a mark i moved to his side are you okay man aye lad aye what the hell were you trying to do get yourself killed i glowered at him and said youre welcome glad i could help you nearly got yourself destroyed he replied another second and that creature would have blasted you to bits another second and youd have put a bullet in its head i said sir stuart idly pointed the gun at me and pulled the trigger the hammer fell with a flash of sparks as flint struck steel and nothing happened you were bluffing i asked aye sir stuart said tis a muzzleloading pistol boy you have to reload them like a proper weapon idly he reached out a hand toward the last remnants of a deceased wraith and flickers of light and memory flowed across the intervening space and into his fingertips when he had it all back sir stuart sighed and shook his head seeming to recover a measure of strength very well then lad help me up i did so sir stuarts midsection on the right side was considerably more translucent than before and he moved as if it pained him when will they be back i asked him tomorrow night by my reckoning he said with more last night they had four lemurs along tonight it was six and that seventh he shook his head and started reloading the pistol from the powder horn he carried on a baldric at his side i knew something stronger had to be gathering all those shades together but i never considered a sorcerer he finished reloading the weapon put the ramrod back into its holder and said pass me my ax boy i got it for him and handed it over he slipped its handle through a ring on his belt and nodded thank you a thumping sound made me turn my eyes back toward the house a man burly wearing a dark hooded sweater and old jeans was holding a longhandled crowbar in big blocky hands he shoved one hand into the space between the door and the frame and with a practiced powerful motion popped the door from its frame and sent it swinging open without an instants hesitation sir stuart fired so did the houses spectral defenders a hurricane of ghostly power hurtled down upon the manand passed harmlessly through him hell the guy looked like he hadnt noticed anything at all a mortal sir stuart breathed he took a step forward let out a sound of pain and clutched at his side his teeth were clenched his jaw muscles standing out sharply dresden he gasped i cannot stop a mortal man there is nothing i can do the hooded intruder took the crowbar into his left hand and drew a stubby revolver from his sweater with his right go stuart said warn mortimer help him i blinked mortimer had made it clear that he didnt want to get involved with meand some childish part of my nature wanted to snap that turnabout was fair play but a wiser more rational part of me reminded my inner child that without mort i might never be able to get in touch with anyone else in town i might never find my own killer i might never be able to protect my friends and besides you dont just let people kick down other peoples doors and murder them in their own home you just dont i clapped stuart on the shoulder and sprinted back toward the little house and its little owner chapter six the gunman had a big lead on me but i had an advantage he didnt id already been inside the house i knew the layout and i knew where mort was holed up oh plus i could run through freaking walls granted i think it would have been more fun to be colossus than shadowcat but you take what you can get and any day youve merely got the powers of an xman cant be all that bad right i gritted my teeth and plunged through the wall into morts kitchen and ran for the study several steps ahead of the gunman mort i shouted mort they brought a hitter with them this time theres a gunman running around your house what demanded morts voice from the far side of the ghostdusted door wheres stuart dammit mort hes hurt i called there was a brief pause and then mort said as if baffled how did that happen i was getting impatient focus mort did you hear me theres a frigging gunman loose in your house real alarm entered his voice for the first time a what the gunman had heard mort shouting at me he came toward the door to the study moving lightly for a big man i got a better look at him and noted that his clothing was ragged and unwashed and so was he he stank enough that it carried through to me even given my condition and his eyes were wide and wild rolling around like those of a junkie who is hopped up on something that makes him pay too much attention to his surroundings that didnt seem to have affected his gun hand though the semiautomatic he clutched in one big fist seemed steady enough to get the job done mort i called hes coming toward your study door right now look just get your weapon and aim at the door and ill tell you when to shoot i dont have one mort screamed i blinked you dont what i am an ectomancer not an action hero i heard him moving around in the office for a moment and then he said um they cut the phone the gunman let out a low rumbling chuckle you are wanted little man his voice sounded rotted clotted like something that hadnt been alive in a long time it is commanded you can come with me and it wont hurt or you can stay in there and it will dresden mort called what do i do oh now you want to talk to me i said youre the one who knows about this mayhem bullshit mort shrieked gonna count little man said the gunman five surviving mayhem is about being prepared i shouted back little things like having a gun ill get one in the morning four mort theres gotta be something you can do i said hells bells every time ive run into a ghost its tried to rip my lungs out youre telling me none of your spooks can do something theyre sane mort shouted back its crazy for a ghost to interact with the physical world sane ghosts dont go around acting crazy three chanted the gunman go away mort shouted at him theres gotta be something i can do i yelled i dont make the rules okay mort said the only way a ghost can manifest is if its insane two the gunman screamed his voice rising to an excited pitch i jumped in front of the lunatic and shrieked boo i flapped my hands in his face as if trying to slap him left and right on the cheeks nothing happened guess that was too much to hope for huh mort called lamely one the gunman purred then he leaned back and drove a heavy boot at the door it took him three kicks to crack the frame and send the door flying inward mort was waiting on the other side of the door a golf club in hand he swung it at the gunmans head without any preamble a grimly practical motion the gunman put an arm up but the wooden head of the club got at least partly around it and he reeled back a pace this is your fault dresden mort snarled swinging the club again as he spoke he hit the gunman fullon in the chest and then again in one big arm the gunman caught the next blow on his forearm and swung wildly at mort he connected and mort got knocked on his can the gunman pressed one hand to a bleeding wound on his head and screamed a howl of agony that was somehow completely out of proportion with the actual injury his wild eyes rolled again and he lifted the gun to aim at the little man i moved on instinct throwing myself uselessly between the weapon and the ectomancer i tripped on a fragment of the ghostdustpainted door and wound up falling in a heap on top of mort and sunk into him the world suddenly hit me in full technicolor it was so dark in here the gunman an enormous threatening shadow standing over me his voice was hideous and so loud that my ears ached the stenchunwashed body and worse thingswas enough to turn my stomach filling my nose like hideous packing peanuts i saw the gunmans hand tighten on the trigger and i threw my arm up my blackclad thick rather short arm defendarius i barked faux latin the old defense spell id first learned from justin dumorne my first teacher i felt the magic surge into me down through my arm out into the air just as the gun went off over and over as some kind of restraint in the gunmans head snapped sparks flew up from a shimmering blue plane that formed in front of my outspread fingers bullets and fragments of bullets shattering and bouncing around the room one of them stayed more or less in one piece and smacked into the gunmans calf and he pitched abruptly to one side still jerking the trigger until the weapon was clicking on empty i felt my mouth move as morts voicea voice that rang with a resonance and authority i had seldom encountered before said get off of me if id been hurtled from a catapult i dont think id have been thrown away any faster i flew off at an upward angleand slammed painfully into the ghostdustpainted ceiling of the study i bounced off it and fell to the equally hard floor i lay there stunned for a second the gunman got to his feet breathing hard and fast slobber shooting out from slack lips as he did he picked up the golf club that had fallen from morts fingers and took a step toward him mort fixed hard eyes on the intruder and spoke his voice ringing with that same unalterable authority to me i felt the tug of some sudden force as subtle and inarguable as gravity and i had to lean against it to stop myself from sliding across the floor toward him other spirits appeared drawn in through the shattered door as if sucked into a tornado half a dozen native american shades flew into mort and as the gunman swung the golf club he let out a little yipping shout ducked the swing more nimbly than any man his age and condition should have been able to caught the gunmans wrist and rolled backward dragging the man with him he planted his heels in the gunmans midsection and heaved a classic fighting technique of the american tribes and sent the man crashing into a wall the gunman rose seething eyes entirely wild but not before mort had crossed the room and taken an ancient wornlooking ax down from a rack attached to one wall it took my stunned brain a second to register that the weapon looked exactly like the one sir stuart had wielded give or take a couple of centuries stuart mort called and his voice rang in my chest as if it had come from a bassamplified megaphone there was a flicker of motion and then sir stuarts form flew in through the doorway as if propelled by a vast wind overlaying itself briefly onto morts far smaller body the gunman swung the club but mort caught it with a deft twisting move of the axs haft the gunman leaned into it using his far greater weight and strength in an attempt to simply overbear the smaller man and push him to the floor but he couldnt mort held him off as if hed had the strength of a much larger much younger much healthier man or maybe men he held the startled intruder stonestill for the space of five or six seconds then heaved twisting with the full power of his shoulders hips and legs and used the axs head to rip the club from the intruders paws the gunman threw an enraged punch at his face but mort blocked it with the flat of the axs head and then snapped the blunt upper edge of the ax into the gunmans face with an almost contemptuous precision the intruder reeled back stunned and mort followed up with the instincts and will of a dangerous trained fighting man he struck the intruders knee with the weapons haft sending a sharp crackling pop into the air and swung the flat of the blade into the intruders jaw as the bigger man began to fall the blow struck home with a meaty thunk and another crackling noise of impact and the gunman dropped like a proverbial stone mortimer lindquist ectomancer stood over the fallen madman in a wary crouch his eyes focusing on nothing as he turned his head left and right scanning the room around him then he sighed and exhaled the steel head of the weapon came down to thump gently against the floor shapes departed him the guardian spirits easing free of him most of them fading from view within a few seconds the only shades present were me and an exhaustedlooking sir stuart mort sat down on the floor heavily his head bowed his chest heaving for breath the veins on his bald pate stuck out hells bells i breathed he looked up at me his expression weary and gave me an exhausted shrug dont have a gun he panted never really felt like i needed one been a while since you did that mortimer sir stuart said from where he sat beside the wall his body supported by the ghostdusted paint thought youd forgotten how mort gave the wounded spirit a faint smile i thought i had too i frowned and shook my head was that was that a possession just now when the ghosts took over sir stuart snorted nay lad if anything the opposite give me at least a little credit dresden mort said his tone sour im an ectomancer sometimes i need to borrow from what a spirit knows or what it can do but i control spiritsthey dont control me howd you handle the gun stuart asked a certain craftsmanlike professionalism entering his tone i mort shook his head and looked at me magic i said quietly my bell was still ringing a little but i was able to form complete sentences i sort of bumped into him and called up a shield sir stuart lifted his eyebrows and said huh i needed to borrow your skills for a moment mort said somewhat stiffly appreciate it think nothing of it i said just give me a few hours of your time well be square mort stared at me for a while then he said youre here twenty minutes and i nearly get killed dresden jesus dont you get it he leaned forward i am not a crusader i am not the sheriff of chicago i am not a goddamned death wishembracing don quixote he shook his head im a coward and im very comfortable with that its served me well i just saved your life man i said he sighed yeah but like i said coward i cant help you go find someone else to be your panza i sat there for a moment feeling very very tired when i looked up sir stuart was staring intently at me then he cleared his throat and said in a diffident tone far be it from me to bring up the past but i cant help but note that your lot in life has improved significantly since dresden first came to you morts bald head started turning red what sir stuart spread his hands his expression mild i only mean to say that you have grown in strength and character in that time when you first interacted with dresden you were bilking people out of their money withpoorlyfalsified séances and you had lost your power to contact any spirit other than me mort glowered ferociously at sir stuart hey gramps when i want your opinion ill give it to you sir stuarts smile widened of course i help spirits find peace mort said i dont do things that are going to get me taken to pieces im a ghost whisperer and thats all look mort i said if you want to get technical im not actually a ghost per se he rolled his eyes again oh god if i had a nickel for every ghost who had ever come to me explaining to me how he wasnt really a ghost how his case was special well sure i said but he rolled his eyes but if you arent just a ghost how come i could channel you like that how come i could force you out of me huh that hit me my stomach may have been insubstantial but it could still writhe uneasily ghosts were not the people they resembled any more than a footprint left in the ground was the being that made it they had similar features but ultimately a ghost was simply a remainder a reminder an impression of the person who died they might share similar personalities emotions memories but they werent the same being when a person died and left a ghost behind it was as if some portion of his dying life energy was spun out creating a new being entirelythough in the creators exact mental and often physical image of course that also meant that they were subject to many of the same frailties as mortals obsession hatred madness if what mort said about ghosts interacting with the material world was true then it was when some poor spirit snapped or was simply created insane that you got your really good ghost stories by a vast majority most ghosts were simply insubstantial and a bit sad never really interacting with the material world but i couldnt be one of those selfdeluded shades could i i glanced at sir stuart he shrugged most shades arent willing to admit that they arent actually the same being whose memories they possess he said gently and thats assuming they can face the fact that they are ghosts at all selfdeluded shades are by an order of magnitude more common than those that are not so what youre saying is i pushed my fingers back through my hair youre saying that i only think i did the whole tunneloflight sentbackonamission thing that im in denial about being a ghost the ghost marine waggled one hand in an ambivalent gesture and his british accent rolled out mellow vowels and crisp consonants as he answered im simply saying that it is very much possmission what mission what are you talking about i eyed him for a moment while he looked at me blankly then i said im gonna guess youve never seen star wars sir stuart shrugged i find motion pictures to be grossly exaggerated and intrusive leaving the audience little to consider or ponder for themselves thats what i thought i sighed you were about two words away from being called threepio from here on out he blinked what god i said now were transitioning into a monty python skit i turned back to morty mort jack murphy met me on the other side and sent me back to find out who murdered me there was a lot of talk but it mostly amounted to we arent gonna tell you diddly so just do it already mort watched me warily for a moment staring hard at my insubstantial form then he said you think youre telling the truth no i said annoyed i am telling the truth im sure you think that mort said i felt my temper flare if i didnt go right through you i would totally pop you in the nose right now mort bristled his jaw muscles clenching oh yeah bring it tootall ill kick your bodiless ass sir stuart coughed significantly a longsuffering expression on his face mortimer dresden just fought beside us to defend this homeand rushed in here to save your life then it hit me and i eyed sir stuart you could have come inside i said you could have helped mortimer against the shooter but you wanted to see where i stood when i was under pressure it was a test sir stuart smiled somewhat aye i wouldnt have let you harm mortimer of course and i was there to help him the instant he called but it didnt hurt to know a little more about you he turned to mortimer i like this lad and jack murphy sent him both mortimer and i glared at sir stuart and then settled slowly back from the confrontation head detective of the black cats a generation ago stuart continued killed himself at his desk sometimes new shades show up claiming theyve had a runin with him and that he brought them back from the hereafter and you know that he is no deluded fool mort didnt meet sir stuarts eyes he grunted a sound that wasnt exactly agreement or maybe jack murphys shade is simply more deluded than most and has a talent for nurturing the delusions of other new shades hells bells morty i said next youll be telling me that i didnt even meet his shade that i deluded myself into deluding myself into deluding him into deluding me that i made the whole thing up sir stuart snorted through his nose a fair point it doesnt matter mort said theres no real way to know incorrect sir stuart interrupted summon him that shouldnt be difficultif he is just one more deluded shade mort didnt look up but he said very quietly i wont do that to jack he looked up and seemed to recover some of his composure but even if captain murphy is genuine that doesnt mean dresdens shade is legit or sane consider the possibility sir stuart said there is something unusual about this one mort perked up his metaphorical ears unusual an energy a vitality sir stuart shrugged it might be nothing but even if it is mort let out a long sigh and eyed the shade you wont let this rest will you i have no plans for the next fifty or sixty years sir stuart said affably it would give me something to do every half an hour or so mort pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes oh god sir stuart grinned theres another aspect to consider too oh the attack was larger tonight it cost us more defenders and the creature behind it revealed itself he gestured at his stilltranslucent midsection i cant keep holding them off forever mortimer and the presence of a mortal pawn tells us two things i nodded one the grey ghost is bad enough to have its way with mortals two sir stuart said the creature is after you personally mort swallowed i rose and shuffled over to look down at the stillunconscious intruder the man let out a low groan it is a good time to make friends stuart said his expression serious dresdens one reason youll live the night and he had allies in this citypeople who could help you if they had a reason to youre fine mort said his tone uncertain youve survived worse sir stuart sighed perhaps but the enemy isnt going to give me time to recover before he attacks again you need dresdens help hes asking for yours his expression hardened and so am i the intruder groaned again and stirred morts forehead broke out in a sudden sweat he looked at the fallen man and then rather hurriedly heaved himself to his feet he bowed his head then he turned to me and said fine dresden ill help and in return i expect you to get your allies to look out for me deal i said i looked at sir stuart thank you one hour mort said you get one hour okay i said okay mort echoed evidently speaking mostly to himself i mean its not like im trying to join the council or anything its one hour just one little hour what could happen in one hour and thats how i knew that mort was telling the whole truth when he said he wasnt a hero heroes know better than to hand the universe lines like that chapter seven mort drove one of those little hybrid cars that when not running on gasoline was fueled by idealism it was made out of crepe paper and duct tape and boasted a computer system that looked like it could have run the nyse and norad with enough attention left over to play tictactoe or possibly global thermonuclear war kinda glad im dead i muttered getting into the car by the simple expedient of stepping through the passengers door as if it had been open if i were still breathing id feel like i was taking my life into my hands here this things an egg and not one of those nice safe hardboiled eggs a crispy one says the guy who drove herbies trailerpark cousin around for more than ten years mort sniped back gentlemen stuart said settling rather gingerly into the tiny backseat is there a particular reason we should be disagreeable with one another or do you both take some sort of infantile pleasure in being insufferably rude now that the fighting was done sir stuarts mannerisms were reverting to something more formal i made a mental note of the fact the colonial marine hadnt started off a member of proper society wherever hed been the rather staid formal archaic phrasing and patterns of speech were all something hed acquired as a learned habitone that apparently deserted him under the pressure of combat okay dresden mort said where to he opened his garage door and peered out at the snow it was coming down even more thickly than earlier in the night chicago is pretty good about keeping its streets cleared in winter weather but it was freaking may from the deep piles of old snow that had apparently been there for a number of weeks i deduced that the city must have become increasingly beleaguered by the unseasonable weather the streets were covered in several inches of fresh powder no plow had been by morts house in hours if we hit a patch of ice that heavy crunchy little hybrid was going to skitter like a puppy on a tile floor thinking i referenced a mental map of the city i felt a little bad making mort come out into weather like thisi mean given that he wasnt dead and all i was going to feel like crap if something bad happened to him and it wouldnt be a kindness to ask him to go farther than he absolutely had to besides with the weather worsening his onehour time limit seemed to put further constraints on my options murphys place i said quietly i gave him the address mort grunted the excop i nodded murph had gotten herself fired by showing up to help me one too many times shed known what she was doing and shed made her own choices but i still felt bad about it dying hadnt changed that shes a pretty sharp lady better able than most in this town to look out for you mort grunted again and pulled out into the snow driving slowly and carefully he was careful to keep his expression blank as he did it mort i said what arent you telling me driving over here he said i made a rude sound then i looked back over my shoulder at sir stuart well sir stuart reached into his coat and drew out what looked like a briar pipe he tapped something from a pouch into it struck an old wooden match and puffed it to life the smoke rose until it touched the ceiling of the car where it congealed into a thin coating of shining ectoplasmthe residue of the spiritual when it becomes the physical to hear him tell it he said finally indicating mort the worlds gone to hell the past few months though ive got to admit it doesnt seem much different to me everythings been madness since those computers showed up i snorted whats changed the scuttlebutt says that you killed the whole red court of vampires said sir stuart any truth to that they abducted my daughter i said i tried for a neutral tone but it came out clipped and hard i hadnt even known maggie existed until susan rodriguez had shown up out of nowhere after years overseas and begged for my help in recovering our daughter id set out to get her back by any means necessary i shivered id done things to get the child away from the monstrous hands of the red court things i wasnt proud of things i would never have dreamed i would be willing to do i could still remember the hot flash of red from a cut throat beneath my fingers and i had to bow my head for a moment in an effort to keep the memory from surging into my thoughts in all its hideous splendor maggie chichén itzá the red king susan susans blood everywhere i forced myself to speak to sir stuart i dont know what you heard but i went and got my girl back and put her in good hands her mother and a whole lot of vampires died before it was over all of them sir stuart pressed i was quiet for a moment before i nodded maybe yeah i mean i couldnt exactly take a census the spell could have missed some of the very youngest depending on the details of how it was set up but every single one of the bastards nearby me died and the spell was meant to wipe the world clean of whoever it targeted mort made a choking sound couldnt i mean wouldnt the white council get upset about that killing with magic i mean i shrugged the red king was about to use the spell on an eightyearold girl if the council doesnt like how i stopped that from happening they can kiss my immaterial ass i found myself chuckling besides i killed vampires not mortals with that magic and what are they gonna do anyway chop my head off im dead already i saw mort trade a look with sir stuart in the rearview mirror why are you so angry at them harry mort asked me i frowned at him and then at stuart why do i feel like i should be lying on a couch somewhere a shade is formed when something significant is left incomplete sir stuart said part of what we do is work out whats causing you to hold on to your life so hard that means asking questions what so i can go on my way or something otherwise known as leaving me alone mort muttered something like that sir stuart said quickly before i could fire back at mort we just want to help i gave sir stuart the eye and then mort thats what you do lay spirits to rest mort shrugged if someone didnt this town would run out of cemetery space pretty fast i thought about that for a moment then i said so how come you havent laid sir stuart to rest mort said nothing his silence was a barbed stony thing sir stuart leaned forward to put a hand on morts shoulder seemed to squeeze it a little and let go then he said to me some things cant be mended lad not by all the kings horses or all the kings men youre trapped here i said quietly were i trapped it would indicate that i am the original sir stuart i am not i am but his shade one could think of it that way nonetheless i suppose he said but i prefer to consider it differently i regard myself as someone who was truly created with a specific purpose for his existence i have a reason to be who and what and where i am how many fleshandblood folk can say as much i scowled as i watched the snowy road ahead of us and whats your purpose looking out after this loser hey im sitting right here mort complained i help other lost spirits sir stuart said help them find some sort of resolution help teach them how to stay sane if it is their destiny to become a mane and if they become a lemur i help introduce them to oblivion i turned to frown at sir stuart thats kinda cutanddried some things assuredly are he replied placidly so youre a mane eh like the old roman ancestral ghost it isnt such a simple matter dresden your own white council is a famous bunch of namers he said their history is i have heard rooted in old rome yeah i said he nodded and like the romans they love to name and classify and outline facts to the smallest permanently inflexible setinstone detail the truth however is that the world of remnant spirits is not easily cataloged or defined he shrugged i dwell in chicago i defend mortimers home i am what i am i grunted after a few moments i asked you teach new spirits of course then can i ask you some questions by all means mort muttered here we go okay i said im a ghost and all now and i can go through just about anythinglike i went through this car door to get inside yes sir stuart said a faint smile outlining his mouth so how come my ass doesnt go through the seat when i sit down on i was rudely interrupted by the tingling sensation of passing through solid matter beginning at my butt and moving rapidly up my spine cold snow started slamming into my rear end and i let out a yelp of pure surprise sir stuart had evidently known what was coming he reached over grabbed me by the front of my leather duster and unceremoniously dragged me back up into the car and sat me on the seat beside him back in the passenger compartment i clutched at the door handle and the seat in front of me for stability only to have my hands go right through them i pitched forward spinning as if i were floating in water and this time it was my face plunging toward the icy street sir stuart hauled me back again and said in a faintly annoyed tone mortimer mort didnt say anything but when i was once again sitting down i didnt fall right through the bottom of the car he smirked at me in the rearview mirror you dont fall through the bottom of the car because on some deep instinctual level you regard it as a given of existence here sir stuart said you are entirely convinced that illusions such as gravity and solidity are real there is no spoon i said sir stuart looked at me blankly i sighed if i believe in an illusory reality so much then how come i can walk through walls i asked because you are convinced on the same level that ghosts can do precisely that i felt my eyebrows trying to meet as i frowned so youre saying i dont fall through the ground because i dont think i should say instead that it is because you assume that you will not he replied which is why once you actively considered the notion you did fall through the floor i shook my head slowly how do i keep from doing it again mortimer is preventing it for the time being my advice to you is not to think about too much sir stuart said his tone serious just go about your business you cant not think about something i said quick dont think about a purple elephant i dare you sir stuart let out a broad laugh but stopped and clutched at his wounded flank i could tell it hurt him but he still wore the smile the laugh had brought on it usually takes them longer to recognize that fact he said youre right of course and there will be times when you feel like you have no control whatsoever over such things why i asked feeling somewhat exasperated sir stuart wasnt rattled by my tone its something every new shade goes through it will pass huh i said i thought about it for a minute and said well it beats the hell out of acne from the front seat mort let out an explosive little snicker stars and stones i hate being the new guy chapter eight murphy inherited her house from her grandmother and it was at least a century old grandma murphy had been a notorious rose gardener murphy didnt have a green thumb herself she hired a service to take care of her grandmothers legacy the flower garden in front would have fit a house four times as large but it was a withered dreary little place when covered in heavy snow bare thorny branches trimmed the previous fall stood up from the blanket of white in skeletal silence the house itself was a compact colonial single story square solid and neatlooking it had been built in a day when a tenbyten bedroom was considered a master suite and when beds were routinely used by several children at a time murphy had upgraded it with vinyl siding new windows and a layer of modern insulation when she moved in and the little house looked as if it could last another hundred years no problem there was a sleek expensive black town car parked on the street outside murphys home its tires on the curbside resting in several inches of snow it couldnt have looked more out of place in the middleclass neighborhood if it had been a saint patricks day parade float complete with prancing leprechauns sir stuart looked at me and then out at our surroundings frowning what is it dresden that car shouldnt be there i said mort glanced at me and i pointed out the black town car he studied it for a moment before he said yeah kind of odd on a block like this why asked sir stuart it is an automatic coach is it not an expensive one i said you dont park those on the street in weather like this the saltandplow truck comes by and youre looking at damage to the finish and paint keep going by morty circle the block yeah yeah mort said his tone annoyed im not an idiot stay with him i told sir stuart then i took a deep breath remembered that i was an incorporeal spirit and put my feet down through the floorboards of the car i dug in my heels on the snowy street as the solid matter of the vehicle passed through me in a cloud of uncomfortable tingles id meant to simply remain behind standing when the car had passed completely through me i hadnt thought about things like momentum and velocity and instead i went into a tumble that ended with me making a whump sound as i hit a soft snowbank beside the home next to murphys it hurt and i pushed myself out of the snowbank my teeth chattering my body blanketed in cold nnno hharry i told myself firmly squeezing my eyes shut ththats an illusion your mind created it to match what it knows but you didnt hit the snowbank you cant and you cant be covered in snow and therefore you cant be wet and cold i focused on the words putting my will behind them in the same way i would have to attract the attention of a ghost or spirit i opened my eyes the snow clinging to my body and clothes was gone i was standing dry and wrapped in my leather duster beside the snowbank okay i said thats bordering on cool i stuck my hands in my pockets ignored the snow and the steady gentle northern wind and trudged across grandma murphys rose garden to murphys door i raised my hand and knocked as id done so often before a couple of things happened first my hand stopped above the door close enough that you could have slid one or two pieces of paper between my knuckles and the wood but definitely not three there was a dull low thud of solid impact even though i hadnt touched the door itself second light flashed and something like a current of electricity swarmed up my arm and down my spine throwing my body into a convulsion that left me lying on the ground stunned i just lay there on the snow for a moment i tried the whole there is no spoon thing again but apparently there was perception of reality and then there was hardcore undeniable real reality it took me several seconds to recover and sit up again and several more seconds to realize that i had been hit by something specifically engineered to stop intruding spirits murphys house had been warded its natural defensive threshold used as a foundation for further more aggressive defenses and while i was only a shade of my former self i was still wizard enough to recognize my own damned wardsor at least wards that were virtually identical to my own the door opened and murphy appeared in it she was a woman of well below average height but built of spring steel her golden hair had been cut into a short brush over her scalp and the stark style showed off the lines of muscles and tendons in her neck and the pugnacious stubborn set of her jawline she wore jeans and a plaid shirt over a blue tee and held her sig in her right hand something stabbed me in the guts and twisted upon seeing her a rush of memories flooded over me starting with our first meeting on a missingpersons case years ago when id still been doing my time as an apprentice pi and murphy had been a uniform cop working a beat every argument every bit of banter and repartee every moment of revelation and trust that had been built up between us came hammering into me like a thousand majorleague fastballs the last memory and the sharpest was of facing each other in the hold of my brothers boat trembling on the edge of a line we hadnt ever allowed ourselves to cross before karrin i tried to say it came out a whisper murphys brow furrowed and she stood still in the doorway despite the cold wind and falling snow her eyes scanning left and right her eyes moved over me past me through me without stopping she didnt see me she couldnt hear me we werent a part of the same world anymore it was a surprisingly painful moment of realization before i could get my thoughts clear of it murphy still frowning closed the door i heard her close several locks easy lad said sir stuart in a gentle quiet voice he hunkered down to put a hand on my shoulder there is no need to rush regaining your feet it hurts i know yeah i said quietly i swallowed and blinked away tears that couldnt really be real why as i told you lad memories are life here life and power seeing the people you care for most again is going to trigger memories much more strongly than they would in a mere mortal it can take time to grow accustomed to it i wrapped my arms around my knees and rested my chin on my kneecap how long generally sir stuart said very softly until those loved ones pass on themselves i shuddered yeah i said well i dont have time for that you have nothing but time dresden but three of my people dont i said my voice harsh theyre going to get hurt if i dont make things right if i dont find my killer i closed my eyes and took several deep breaths i wasnt actually breathing air i didnt need to breathe habit wheres mort waiting around the corner sir stuart said hell come in once weve given him the all clear what im the little chickens personal secret service now i grumbled i pushed myself up to my feet and eyed murphys house do you see anything threatening around here not at the moment sir stuart said other than the allegedly suspicious auto coach well the house is warded im not sure if the defenses are purely against insubstantial intruders or if they might also attack a living intruder tell him not to touch the house with anything he wants to keep sir stuart nodded and said im going to circle the place ill return with mortimer i grunted absently reaching out a hand to feel the wards around the place again they were powerful but flawed somehow my wards were all built into the same solid barrier of energy these wards had solidity but it was a piecemeal thing i felt like i was looking at a twelvefoot wall built from lego blocks if someone with enough mystic muscle hit it right the ward would shatter at its weakest seams of course that would probably punch a hole in the barrier but not a catastrophic one if one portion of my wards lost integrity the whole thing would come down and whatever remained of the energy that had broken it would come through if someone knocked out a bit of these wards it would send a bunch of legos flyingprobably soaking up all of the energy by dividing it among lots of little piecesbut the rest of the barrier would stand that might offer several advantages on the minorleague end of the power scale the modular wards would be easy to repair compared to classic integral wards so that even if something smashed through the wards could be closed again in a brief time god knows the ingredients for the spell were probably a lot cheaperand you wouldnt need a bigtime white council wizard to put them up but they had a downside too there were a lot of things that could smash throughand if you got killed after they came inside the ease of repair wouldnt matter much to your cooling corpse still it was a hell of a lot better than nothing the basic profile was my design just implemented differently who the hell would have done this to murphys place and why i turned and stepped off the porch to peer in a window feeling vaguely voyeuristic as i did so but i wasnt sure what else i was going to do until mort got here to do some speaking for me are you quite all right asked a mans voice from inside the house i blinked scowled in concentration and managed to stand up on some of the wispy shrubbery under the window until i could see over the chair back that blocked my view from where i was standing there was a man sitting on the couch of murphys living room he was wearing a black suit with a crisp white shirt and a black tie with a single stripe of maroon his skin was darkmore mediterranean than africanbut his short neat sweep of hair was dyed peroxide blond his eyes were an unsettling color somewhere between dark honey and poison ivy and the sharp angularity of his nose made me think of a bird of prey fine said murphy she was on her feet her gun tucked into the waist of her jeans in front sig made a fine compact mm but it looked big dangerous and clumsy on murphys scale she folded her arms and stared at the man as if hed been found at the side of the highway gobbling up raw roadkill i told you not to show up early anymore childs a lifetime of habit childs said in reply honestly it isnt something to which i give any thought you know how things are out there murphy said jerking her chin toward the front of the house start thinking about it you catch me on a nervous evening and maybe i shoot you through the door childs folded his fingers on one knee he didnt look like a big guy he wasnt heavy with muscle neither are cobras there was plenty of room for a gun under that expensive suit jacket my relationship with my employer is relatively new but i have a sense that should such a tragedy occur the personal repercussions to you would be quite severe murphy shrugged a shoulder maybe on the other hand maybe we start killing his people until the price of doing business with us is too high and he breaks it off she smiled it was almost gleefully wintry i dont have a badge anymore childs but i do have friends special special friends between them there was a low charge of tension in the room the silent promise of violence murphys fingers were dangling casually less than two inches from her gun childss hands were still folded on his knee he abruptly smiled and dropped back into a more relaxed pose on the sofa weve coexisted well enough for the past six months i see no sense in letting frayed tempers put an end to that now murphys eyes narrowed to slits marcones top murderer childs lifted a hand please troubleshooter murphy continued as if he hadnt spoken doesnt back down that quickly regardless of how survival oriented he is thats why youre here early despite my request you want something so nice to know you eventually take note of the obvious childs replied yes my employer sent me with a question murphy frowned he didnt want the others to hear it being asked childs nodded he feared it might generate unintended negative consequences murphy stared at him for a moment then rolled her eyes well childs showed his teeth in a smile for the first time it made me think of skulls he wishes to know if you trust the ragged lady murphy straightened at the question her back going rigid she waited to take a deep breath and exhale before responding what do you mean odd things have begun happening near some of the locations she haunts things that no one can quite explain childs shrugged leaving his hands in plain sight resting comfortably on the sofa which part of the question is too difficult for you murphys shoulder twitched as if her hand had been thinking about grabbing the gun from her waistband but she took another breath before she spoke whats he offering for the answer northerly island and before you ask yes including the beach i blinked at that the island over by burnham park harbor wasnt exactly prime criminal territory being mostly parks fields and a beach a lot of families visitedbut gentleman john marcone kingpin of chicagos rackets and the only plainvanilla mortal to become a signatory of the unseelie accords simply did not surrender territory not for anything murphys eyes widened too and i watched her going through the same line of thought i had though to be perfectly fair i think she got to the end of that line before i did if i do agree to this she said her tone cautious it will have to pass our standard verification by monday childss face was a bland mask done murphy nodded and looked down at the floor for a moment evidently marshaling her thoughts then she said there isnt a simple answer there rarely is childs noted murphy passed a hand back over her brush cut and studied childs then she said when she was working with dresden id have said yes in a heartbeat without reservation childs nodded and now now dresdens gone and she came back from chichén itzá changed murphy said maybe posttraumatic stress maybe something more than that shes different childs tilted his head do you distrust her i dont drop my guard around her murphy said and thats my answer the bleachblond man considered her words for a few seconds and then nodded i will carry it to my employer the island will be clear of his interests by monday will you give me your word on that i already have childs stood up the motion a portrait of grace if he was a mortal he was deadly fast or a ballet dancer and somehow i didnt think he had some danskins stuffed in his suits pockets i will go please inform me if anything of relevance comes out of the meeting murphy nodded her hand near her gun and watched childs walk to the front door childs opened it and began to leave you should know murphy said quietly that my trust issues dont change the fact that shes one of mine if i think for a second that the outfit has done any harm to molly carpenter the arrangement is over and we segue directly to the ok corral starting with you childs turned smoothly on a heel smiling and lifted an empty hand to mime shooting murphy with his thumb and forefinger he completed the turn and left the house murphy came over to the window where i was standing and watched childs walk to the black town car and get in she didnt relax her vigilance until the car had pulled out into the snow and cruised slowly away then she bowed her head one hand against the window and rubbed at her face with her other hand i stretched my arm to put my hand out to mirror hers being careful not to touch the wards humming quietly around the houses threshold you could have fit two or three of murphys hand spans into one of mine i saw her shoulders shake once then she shook her head and straightened blinked her eyes rapidly a few times and schooled her expression into its usual cop mask of neutrality she turned away from me went to the rooms love seat and curled up on one side of it she looked tiny with her legs bunched up against her upper body barely more than a childif not for the care lines on her face there was a quiet motion and then a tiny grey mountain lion with a notched ear and a stump of a tail appeared and leapt smoothly up onto the love seat with murphy she reached out a hand and gathered the cats furry body against hers her fingers stroking tears blurred my eyes as i saw mister my cat when the vampire couple the eebs had burned my old apartment down i knew mister had escaped the flamesbut i didnt know what had happened to him after that id been killed before i could go round him up i remembered meeting the cat as a kitten scrambling in a trash bin skinny and near starvation hed been my roommate or possibly landlord ever since id come to chicago he was thirty pounds of feline arrogance he was always good about showing up when i was upset giving me the chance to lower my blood pressure by paying attention to him im sure he thought it a saintly gesture of generosity its a cat thing i dont know how long i stood there staring through the window but suddenly sir stuart was beside me dresden he said quietly there are several creatures approaching from the southeast you are not doing your lack of being named threepio any good whatsoever sir stuart he blinked at me several times then shook his head and recovered there are half a dozen of them as well as a number of cars okay keep mort in his car until i can identify them i said but i suspect hes in no danger no the shade asked know you these folk then dunno i said lets go see chapter nine ten minutes later i was humming under my breath and watching the gathering in murphys living room sir stuart stood beside me his expression interested curious beg pardon wizard he said but what is that tune youre trying to sing i belted out the opening trumpet fanfare of the main theme and then said in a deep and cheesy announcers voice in the great hall of the justice league there are assembled the worlds four greatest heroes created from the cosmic legends of the universe sir stuart frowned at me created from the cosmic legends of the universe i repeated in the same voice sir stuart narrowed his eyes and turned slightly away from me his shoulders tight that makes no sense none at all it did on saturday mornings in the seventies apparently i said i nodded at the room beyond the window and weve got something similar going on here though for a hall of the justice league it looks pretty small real estate wasnt as expensive back then i guess the guests assembled inside sir stuart asked do you know them most of them i said then i felt obliged to add or at least i knew them six months ago things had changed murphys buzz cut was just a start i started introducing sir stuart to the faces i knew will borden leaned against one wall slightly behind murphy his muscular arms folded he was a man of belowaverage height and wellaboveaverage build all of it was muscle i was used to seeing him mostly in afterwork businesscasual clothingwhenever he wasnt transformed into a huge dark wolf i mean today he was wearing sweats and a loose top the better for getting out of in a hurry if he wanted to change generally a quiet reliable intelligent man will was the leader of a local band of college kids now all grownup who had learned to take on the shape of wolves theyd called themselves the alphas for so long that the name had stopped sounding silly in my own head when i thought it i wasnt used to seeing will playing the heavy but he was clearly in that role his expression was locked into something just shy of a scowl and his dark eyes positively smoldered with pentup aggression he looked like a man who wanted a fight and who would gladly jump on the first opportunity to get into one on the couch not far from will the other alpha present was curled up into a ball in the corner her legs up to her chest she had straight hair the color of a mouses fur that hung to her chin in an even sheet all the way around and she looked as if a strong breeze might knock her to the floor she peered owlishly out through a pair of large eyeglasses and a curtain of hair and i got the impression that she saw the whole room at the same time i hadnt seen her in several years but shed been one of the original alphas and had gotten her degree and toddled off into the vanilla world her name was margie mercy marci right her name was marci next to marci sat a plump cheerfullooking woman with blond curly hair held sloppily in place with a couple of chopsticks who looked a couple of years shy of qualifying to be a television grandmother she wore a floralprint dress and on her lap she held a dog the approximate size of a bratwursta yorkshire terrier the dog was clearly on alert his bright dark eyes moving from person to person around the room but focused mostly on marci he was growling deep in his chest and obviously ready to defend his owner at an instants notice abby i told sir stuart her names abby the dog is toto she survived a white court vampire who was hunting down her social circle smalltime practitioners the little dog abruptly sprang out of abbys arms to throw itself toward will but the woman moved in remarkably quick reaction and caught toto except it hadnt been remarkably quickit had simply begun a half second before the little dog had jumped abby was a prescient she couldnt see far into the futureonly a few secondsbut that was enough talent to make me bet there werent many broken dishes in her kitchen will looked at toto as the little dog jumped and smiled abby shushed the yorkie and frowned at will before turning to the table to pick up a cup of tea in one hand still holding the dog with the other next to abby was a brawny young man in jeans work boots and a heavy flannel shirt he had dark untidy hair and intense grey eyes and i could have opened a bottle cap with the dimple in his chin it took me a second to recognize him because hed been a couple of inches shorter and maybe forty pounds lighter the last time id seen himdaniel carpenter the eldest of my apprentices younger brothers he looked as though he were seated on a hot stove rather than a comfortable couch like he might bounce up at any second boldly to do something ill conceived a large part of wills attention was i thought focused on daniel relax murphy told him have some cake daniel shook his head in a jerky negative no thank you ms murphy he said i just dont see the point in this i should go find molly if i leave right now i can be back before an hours up if molly isnt here well assume its because she has a good reason for it murphy said her tone calm and utterly implacable theres no sense in running all over town on a night like this besides will drawled wed find her faster daniel scowled from beneath his dark hair for a second but quickly looked away it gave me the sense that hed run afoul of will before and hadnt liked the outcome the younger man kept his mouth shut an older man sat in the chair beside the couch and he took the opportunity to lean over the table and pour hot tea from a china teapot into the cup in front of the young carpenter he added a lump of sugar to it and smiled at daniel there was nothing hostile impatient or demanding in his eyes which were the color of a robins eggsonly complete certainty that the younger man would accept the tea and settle down daniel eyed the man then dropped his eyes to the square of white cellulose at his collar and the crucifix hanging beneath it he took a deep breath then nodded and stirred his tea he took the cup in both hands and settled back to wait after a sip he appeared to forget he was holding itbut he stayed quiet and you ms murphy asked father forthill holding up the teapot its a cold night im sure a cup would do you good why not she said forthill filled another cup for murphy took it to her and pulled at his sweater vest as if trying to coax more warmth from the garment he turned and walked over to the window where sir stuart and i stood and held out both hands are you sure there isnt a draft i could swear i feel it i blinked and eyed sir stuart who shrugged and said hes one of the good ones good what ministers priests shamans whatever his expression seemed to be carefully neutral you spend your life caring for the souls of others you get a real sense of them sir stuart nodded at father forthill ghosts like us arent souls as such but we arent much different he feels us even if he isnt fully aware of it toto escaped abbys lap and came scrambling over the hardwood floor to put his paws up on the walls beneath the windows he yapped ferociously several times staring right at me and dogs sir stuart added maybe one in ten of them seem to have a talent for sensing us probably why theyre always barking what about cats i asked mister had fled the living room upon the arrival of other people and wasnt in sight of course cats sir stuart said his voice faintly amused as far as i can tell all cats but they arent terribly impressed with the fact that were dead and still present one rarely gets a reaction from them father forthill gently scooped toto from the floor the little dog wiggled energetically tail flailing in the air and kissed forthills hands soundly before the old priest passed him carefully back to abby smiling and nodding to her before refilling his own cup of tea and sitting down again who are they waiting on sir stuart asked this molly person maybe i said there was one more chair in the room it was closest to the doorand farthest from every other piece of furniture in the room practically every other seat in the room would have a clear line of fire to the last chair if it came to shooting maybe that was a coincidence but i dont think so there was a quick chirping sound and murphy picked up a radio smaller than a deck of cards murphy go ricemobile imminent said a quiet voice furry knockers is running a sweep will blew out a sudden snort of amused breath murphy smiled and shook her head before she spoke into the radio thanks eyes pull in as soon as shes done hot tea for you weathers just crazy right only in chicago eyes out that is just so wrong said daniel as murphy put the radio away thats a terrible radio handle it could cause mixed messages in a tactical situation murphy arched an eyebrow and spoke in a dry tone im trying to imagine the situation in which someone mistakenly being told to be alert for the enemy ends in disaster if someone on the team was juggling glass vials of a deadly virus will supplied promptly or nitroglycerin murphy nodded make a note discontinue use of radio in the event of a necessary nitroviro juggling mission noted will drawled daniel stiffened youve got a big mouth mr borden will never moved its not my mouth kid its your skin its too thin daniel narrowed his eyes but forthill put a hand on the brawny youths shoulder the old man couldnt possibly restrain daniel physically but his touch might as well have been a steel chain attached to a battleships anchor his move to rise became an adjustment of himself in his seat and he folded his arms scowling pasty face in five four three came from murphys radio backs tightened faces became masks several hands vanished from sight someones teacup clinked several times in rapid succession against a saucer before it settled i could see the front door from where i stood outside the window and a couple of seconds after the radio stopped counting aloud it opened upon a white court vampire she was maybe fivetwo with a dimpled smile and dark curly hair that fell to her waist she was wearing a white blouse with a long full white skirt and bright scarlet ballet slippers the first thought that went through my head was awww shes tiny and adorablefollowed closely by the notion that she would be fastidious when blood was everywhere i could just see her carefully lifting the hem of her pristine skirt so that only the scarlet slippers would touch it good evening everyone she said breezing through the door without an invitation speaking with a strong british accent i apologize for being a few moments late but whats a lady to do with weather like this tea lovely she minced over to the table and poured some hot tea into an empty cup her eyes fastened on daniel as she did and she bowed just low enough to draw the young mans eyes to her décolletage he flushed and looked away sternly after a second tough to blame the kid ive been a young man boobs are near the center of the universe until you turn twentyfive or so which is also when young mens auto insurance rates go down this is not a coincidence the vampire smirked a surprisingly predatory expression on her cupidsbow lips and glided back to the empty chair by the door seating herself in it like shirley temple on a movie set sure that she held the attention of everyone there gutsy i said quietly why do you say that sir stuart asked she came in without an invitation i said i thought vampires couldnt do that the reds cathat is they couldnt without being halfparalyzed the black court vampires cant cross a threshold period the whites can but it cripples their abilities makes it very difficult to draw on their hunger for strength and speed sir stuart shook his head ah yes shes a succubus well not exactly but the differences are academic the shade nodded im not exposing mortimer to that creature probably not a bad idea i agreed hes got access to way too much information theyd love to get someone like mort under their thumb hello felicia murphy said her tone cool and professional all right people mr childs wont be here tonight im holding his proxy felicia curled the fingers of both tiny hands around the teacup and sipped it the tea had been scalding when the others had first sipped it theyd been cautious the vampire took a mouthful as if it had been roomtemperature koolaid and swallowed it down with a little shiver of apparent pleasure how convenient for you shall we ever see the dapper gentleman again that will be up to marcone murphy replied abby toto was staring at felicia and standing with stiff legs on abbys lap if hed been capable of a threatening growl hed have been doing it instead there was just a steady squeaking sound coming from his general direction abby took a firmer grip on toto and looked down at a notebook in her lap the paranet continues to operate at better than seventyfive percent of its original capacity we actually regained contact with minnesota massachusetts and alabama this week she cleared her throat and blinked her eyes several times we lost contact with oregon seattle or tacoma murphy asked yes abby said quietly no one has heard from a member in either place there for the past three days forthill crossed himself and said something beneath his breath amen father felicia murmured someone got their roster daniel said his voice harsh will grunted and nodded do we know who um abby said giving will a brief apologetic smile we havent heard from anyone so no well have to send someone to investigate ugh murphy said shaking her head no if that many people have been taken it means one of the larger powers is at work if the fomor have come to oregon in strength wed just be throwing our scout into a snake pit if we move quickly enough abby disagreed firmly we might be able to save some of them murphys expression turned introspective true but theres nothing we can do from here she looked at forthill ill find out what i can through our channels he promised but i fear you will find little in the way of remedy there murphy nodded well kick this one up to the wardens daniel snorted at exactly the same time i did oh sure the white council the young man said theyre the answer to this because they care so much about the little guy and the immediate future theyll wander in right awaya mere year or two from now will gave daniel a flat look and the muscles along his jaw twitched murphy lifted a hand and said ill call ramirez and ask him to expedite ill ask elaine mallory to back me up elaine mallory when murphy said it the name cracked something in my head and a geyser of memories erupted from it elaine had been my first first friend first crush first lover first victimor so i had believed for years at any rate she somehow escaped the flames that consumed my old mentor justin dumorne about a million sensememories hit me all at once it was like trying to watch a warehouse wall lined with televisions all of them on different stations all of them blaring at maximum volume sunshine on skin smooth curve of slender waist and leanly muscled back as elaine dove into a moonlit swimming pool the blindingly gentle sensation of our first kiss slow and tentative and careful as it had been elaine who had been subverted into justins slave who hadnt been strong enough to defend herself when justin came to claim her mind who i failed to protect joy and pain came with those memories it was deliriously intense as disorienting and overwhelming as any drug hells bells i hate being the new guy i managed to push the memories off after a few moments in time to hear the vampire speak felicia cleared her throat and lifted a hand as it happens she said i know that we have some assets in the area its possible they might be able to find something its also possible that theyre responsible for the disappearances marci said mildly nonsense child felicia responded with a little toss of her head we hardly need to capture our prey and corral them where their thick numbers will make hunting simple she gave marci a sweetly dimpled smile we already have such pens theyre called cities we will be happy for any information the white court is willing to provide felicia murphy said her calm professional neutral tone expertly dulling the edges of the previous words what about chicago abby we lost two this week abby said nathan simpson and sunbeam monroe a ghoul took simpson will supplied at once we settled his account murphy glanced at will in approval have i met sunbeam abby nodded the college student from san jose murphy winced right tall girl hippieesque parents thats her she was accompanied to the el station and someone was waiting at her destination she never arrived murphy made a growling sound that more than made up for totos lack we know anything will looked at marci the stringy girl shook her head the snow is holding too many scents in place i couldnt find anything solid she looked down at her knees and added sorry murphy ignored that last bit she shouldnt have been traveling alone were going to have to stress the importance of partnering up how abby asked i mean its in every circular murphy nodded will will drummed his fingertips on his biceps and nodded ill see to it thank you abby blinked several times and then said karrin you cant possibly mean people are dying murphy said simply a good scare can do wonders to cure stupidity or we could try protecting them said daniel forthill lifted a hand again but the younger man ignored him rising to his feet daniels voice was a rich strong baritone all over the world dark things are rising up against mortals connected to the supernatural killing them or dragging them away into the dark creatures that havent been seen by mankind in the past two millennia are reappearing fighting mortals fighting one another the shadows are boiling over with death and terror and no one is doing anything about it the wardens went from fighting the vampire war to a new one against an enemy without a face or an identity the white council doesnt have wardens enough to handle everything thats happening anyway if a cry for help is sent up anywhere but a major city theres no chance at all of them showing up meanwhile what are we doing daniels voice filled with quiet scorn telling people to travel around in herds scaring them ourselves to make them do so as if there wasnt terror enough in the world already murphy stared steadily at him then she said her tone hard thats enough daniel ignored her planting his feet and squaring his shoulders you know you know what must be done ms murphy youre holding two of the greatest weapons against darkness that the world has ever known bring forth the swords a dead silence settled on the room into which sir stuart asked me conversationally which swords the swords of the cross i said quietly out of habiti could have sung it operatically without anyone there noticing the ones with the nails from the crucifixion worked into them excalibur durendal and kusanagi yes yes sir stuart said his tone a little impatient of course i know the swords of the cross and the little blond woman has two of them i just stared at the burly shade for a long second id found what amounted to a rumor that amoracchius was in fact the same sword given to king arthur but i hadnt ever heard anything about the other two despite some fairly exhaustive research over the years the shade had dropped their identities as if they were everyday knowledge sir stuart frowned at me and said what is it i just dont do you know how much research i i blew out an exasperated breath scowled and said i went to public school back inside murphy didnt break the silence she just stared at daniel for maybe two minutes then she directed a rather pointed glance at felicia and eyed daniel again the young man glanced at felicia and closed his eyes as his cheeks got redder and his passion swiftly deflated he muttered something under his breath and sat down again rather quickly the vampire sat in her chair staring at daniel over the rim of her teacup and smiling as if butter wouldnt melt in her mouth for all i knew it wouldnt i love young men she purred i just love them mr carpenter murphy said i assume you have divulged secrets enough to the enemies of humanity for one evening daniel said nothing then perhaps you can join eyes and fuzz in keeping watch outside he rose at once slipping into his heavy fleecelined blue denim coat it was an old wellused garment id seen his father wearing it but it was a little big on daniel without a word he left the living room for the kitchen and went out the back door silence was heavy when he left both swords felicia said her tone light her periwinkle eyes on murphy my my my she sipped at her tea and said of course youll have to kill me dear if you can the diminutive vampire looked casually at each person in the room i give you one chance in four i cant let the white court know about the swords murphy agreed her fingers hung near the handle of her gun will watched with sleepy eyes but sometime in the past few seconds he had managed to center his weight over his feet marci still crouched with her legs curled up to the rest of her but they were under her dress now within a heartbeat she could have it off and clear it from impeding her shapeshifting felicia was in exactly the same posture as several minutes before she looked entirely unconcerned with any possible danger i made a mental note never to play poker with her well darling if you intended to dance there would already be music so perhaps we should talk she smiled and her eyes glittered suddenly several shades lighter than before just us girls we can go for a walk murphy snorted she drew her gun from her belt and set it on the armrest of her chair she rested her hand over it not quite touching the trigger im not an idiot felicia youll stay right where you are as will i everyone else outside abby had risen before murphy finished speaking holding toto carefully as she left will frowned at murphy you sure father forthill rose frowning and said these old legs want to go for a little walk in any case good evening ms murphy william will literally growled and it came out sounding like no noise a human being ought to be able to make but then he nodded to murphy and turned toward the door marci hurried to her feet and went after him forthill stumped off after them i heard everyone leave the house by the back door probably to gather on the stonepaved patio just outside i like this felicia said into the silence smiling this charming little house feels so intimate dont you think she tilted her head are the swords on the premises i think you should name your price murphy responded felicia arched an eyebrow a sensual little smile bending one corner of her mouth into a smirk f murphy cleared her throat forget that it isnt happening the vampire turned her mouth down in a mocking little pout such a puritan work ethic business and pleasure can coexist you know this isnt business ms raith its blackmail tomaytoe tomahtoe felicia said with a shrug the point is karrin that you can hardly afford to be squeamish no no youre intelligent skilled and strongwilledquite formidable she smiled for a mortal but in the end you are a lone mortal and you are no longer beneath the aegis of city law enforcement or resident members of the white council murphy moved nothing but her lips meaning felicia sighed and said in a practical dispassionate tone the swords are valuable they could be traded for a great deal of influence should the white court learn of this and decide to take the swords they will take you they will ask you where they are they will force you to surrender them murphy might have twitched one shoulder in a shrug then she got up and walked toward felicia gripping her gun loosely in hand and what if i give you what you want youll stay quiet felicia nodded her eyelids lowering as she watched murphy approach for a few days at any rate by which time you will have been able to take measures to prevent them from being taken murphy said you want to feed on me felicia ran a very pink tongue over her upper lip her eyes growing paler i do very much murphy frowned and nodded then she whipped the pistol in a bonebreaking stroke smashing it into the vampires jaw yes i hissed clenching my hands into fists the vampire let out a short stunned gasping sound and rocked beneath the blow she slid out of the chair to her knees feebly trying to move away from murphy murph wasnt having any of it she grabbed felicia by the hair hauled her halfway to her feet and then with a furious shout and a contraction of her whole body murphy slammed the vampires face down onto the coffee table felicias head shattered the teapot and the platter beneath and struck the oak table with such force that a crack erupted from end to end in the wood murph slammed felicias head down with nearequal violence two more times then she turned and dragged felicia over to the front door of her house by the hair murphy let her go with a contemptuous shove stood over her and pointed a gun at the vampires head this is what happens murphy said in a very quiet hard voice you leave here alive you keep your fucking mouth shut and we never mention tonight ever again if the white court even blinks in the swords direction i am going to come find you felicia whatever happens to me in the end before i am taken i will find you felicia stared up at her wobbling and shaking clearly dazed murphy had broken the vampires nose and knocked out at least two teeth one of felicias high cheekbones was already swelling the broken teapot had left multiple cuts on her face and her skin had been scalded by the hot liquid still inside murphy leaned a little closer and put the barrel of the gun against felicias forehead then she whispered very quietly bang the vampire shuddered do what you think best felicia murph whispered then she straightened again slowly and spoke in a clear calm voice as she walked back to her chair now get out of my house felicia managed to stagger to her feet open the front door and limp haltingly to the white limousine idling on the snowy street outside the house murphy went to the window to watch felicia get into the limo and depart yeah i said deadpan the little blond woman has two of them oh my sir stuart said his voice muted with respect i can see why youd come to her for assistance damn skippy i agreed better go get morty while shes still in a good mood chapter ten i met morty and sir stuart on murphys front porch i guess it was a cold night morty stood with his entire body hunched against the wind his hands stuffed into his coat pockets his eyes darted around nervously he was shivering hit the bell i said and this is just my opinion but if i were you id keep my hands in plain sight thanks mort said sourly jabbing the doorbell have i told you how much brightness you bring to my world whenever you show up in it dresden all in a days work when youre created from the cosmic legends of the universe i replied be advised sir stuart said that there are wolves to the left and right i looked he was right one was huge and darkfurred the other smaller and lighter brown they were sitting in the shadows perfectly still where a casual glance would simply pass over them their wary stares were intense will and marci i said theyre cool theyre violent vigilantes mort replied through clenched teeth buck up little camper theyre not going to hurt you and you know it mort gave me a narroweyed glare and then murphy opened the door ms murphy morty said nodding to her lindquist isnt it murph asked the medium yes what do you want behind us sir stuart murmured i checked a slender male figure in heavy winter clothing was crossing the street toward us a third wolf this ones fur edged with auburn walked beside him im here to speak to you on behalf of someone you knew mort told murphy murphys blue eyes became chips of glacial ice who harry dresden mort said murphy clenched her right hand into a fist her knuckles made small popping sounds mort swallowed and took half a step back look i dont want to be here he said raising his hands and displaying his palms but you know how he was his shade is no less stubborn or annoying than dresden was in life youre a goddamned liar murphy snarled youre a known con artist and you are playing with fire mort stared at her for a long moment then he winced and said you you believed he was still alive he is alive murphy replied clenching her jaw they never found a body mort looked down pressing his lips together and ran his palm over his bald pate smearing away a few clinging snowflakes he blew out a long breath and said im sorry im sorry that this is difficult it isnt difficult murphy replied just annoying because hes still alive mort looked at me and spread his hands shes still in denial theres not much i can do here look ive done this a lot she needs more time no i said weve got to make her see tonight mort pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger it isnt like youre getting any older dresden murphy fixed morty with her cop glare it hadnt lost any of its intensity this is neither believable nor amusing lindquist i think youd better go now lindquist nodded holding up his hands in a gesture of placation i know im going please understand im just trying to help wait i snapped theres got to be something you can say mort glanced at me as he began walking back toward his car and lifted both of his hands palms up in a little helpless gesture i ground my teeth standing less than a foot away from murphy how the hell did i get her to believe it really was me by having morty talk about something only you could know dummy i said to myself morty he paused about halfway down the driveway and turned to look at me ask her this i said and spouted a question mort sighed then he turned toward murphy and said before i go dresden wants me to ask you if you ever found that reasonably healthy male murphy didnt move her face went white after maybe a minute she whispered what did you say i prompted mort dresden wants me to tell you that he hadnt intended to do anything dramatic it just sort of worked out that way the wolves and the man in the heavy coat had stepped closer listening murphy clenched and unclenched her fist several times then she said how many vampires did agent white and i have to kill before we escaped the fbi office last year i felt another surge of fierce triumph that was murph always thinking i told mort the answer he says he doesnt know who agent white is but that you and tilly took out one of them in a stairwell on your way out of the building mort tilted his head listening to me and then said and he also wonders if you still feel that taking up the sword of faith would represent a a rebound career murphys face by now was almost entirely bloodless i could almost visibly see her eyes becoming more sunken her features overtaken by a grey and weary sagging she leaned against the doorway to her house her arms sliding across her own stomach as if she were trying to prevent her innards from spilling out ms murphy mort said gently im terribly sorry to be the one to bear this particular news but dresdens shade says that he needs to talk to you that people are in danger yeah murphy said her voice numb thats new she looked up at mort and said bleed for me it was a common test among those savvy to the supernatural world but lacking any of its gifts there are a lot of inhuman things that can pretend to be humanbut relatively few of them have naturallooking blood it wasnt a perfect test by any means but it was a lot better than nothing mort nodded calmly and produced a straight pin from his coat pocket he hadnt even blinked at the request apparently in the current climate the test had become much more widely used i wondered if murphy had been responsible for it morty pricked the tip of his left thumb with the pin and it welled with a round drop of ruby blood he showed it to murphy who nodded its cold out here youd better come inside mr lindquist thank you mort said with a heavy exhalation meeting time kids murphy said to those outside i want this joker verified will please send someone to invite raggedy ann over i dont want to be any trouble mort began murphy gave him a chilly smile get your ass inside and sit down ill tell you when you can go and if you really are putting one over on us somehow you should know that i am not going to be a good sport about it mort swallowed but he went inside murphy will and father forthill spent the next half hour grilling morty and by extension me with abby and daniel looking on each of them asked a lot of questions mostly about private conversations id had with them morty had to relay my answers no father i just hadnt ever heard a priest use the phrase screw the pooch before will look i offered to pay for that the door is ajar thing the chlorofiend you killed it with a chain saw murph and so on and so forth until my bloodor maybe ectoplasmwas practically boiling this is getting ridiculous i snapped finally youre stalling why morty blinked at me in surprise sir stuart burst out into a short bark of laughter from where he lounged against a wall in the corner murphy looked at mort closely frowning what is it dresdens getting impatient mort said his tone of voice suggesting that it was something grossly inappropriate if not outright impolite he ah suspects that youre stalling and wants to know why im sorry spirits are almost never this stubbornly willful murphy suggested insistent mort finished his expression neutral murphy sat back in her chair and traded a look with father forthill well she said that sounds a great deal like dresden doesnt it im quite sure that only dresden knew several of those details he mentioned in passing forthill said gravely there are beings who could know such things regardless of whether or not they were actually present however very very dangerous beings murphy looked at mort and nodded so either hes both sincere and correct in that dresdens shade is there with him or someones been bamboozled and ive let something epic and nasty into my house essentially forthill agreed with a small tired smile for whatever its worth i sense no dark presence here just a draft thats dresdens shade father mort said respectfully mort a good catholic boy who knew where is dresden now murphy asked she didnt exactly sound enthusiastic about the question mort looked at me and sighed hes sort of looming over you a little to your left ms murphy hes got his arms crossed and hes tapping one foot and hes looking at his left wrist every few seconds even though he doesnt wear a watch do you have to make me sound so so childish i complained murphy snorted that sounds like him hey i said there was a familiar soft pattering of paws on the floor and mister sprinted into the room he went right across murphys hardwood floors and cannonballed into my shins mister is a lot of cat checking in at right around thirty pounds the impact staggered me and i rocked back and then quickly leaned down to run my hand over the cats fur he felt like he always did and his rumbling purr was loud and happy it took me a second to realize that i could touch mister i could feel the softness of his fur and the warmth of his body more to the point a large cat moving at a full run over a smooth hardwood floor had shoulderblocked empty air and had come to a complete halt doing it everyone was staring at mister with their mouths open i mean its one thing to know that the supernatural world exists and to interact with it on occasion in dark and spooky settings but the weird factor of the supernatural hits you hardest at home when you see it in simple everyday things a door standing open that shouldnt be a shadow on the floor with no source to cast it a cat purring and rubbing up against a favorite personwho isnt there oh murphy said staring her eyes welling up will let out a low whistle father forthill crossed himself a small smile lifting the corners of his mouth mort looked at the cat and sighed oh sure professional ectomancer with a national reputation as a medium tells you whats going on and nobody believes him but let a stumptailed furry critter come in and everyone goes all lifetime heh said sir stuart quietly amused what did i tell you cats murphy turned to me lifting her face toward mine her eyes were a little off focused to one side of my face i moved until i stood where she was looking her blue eyes intent harry im here i said god i feel stupid murphy muttered looking at mort he can hear me right and see you mort said she nodded and looked up againat a slightly different place i moved again i know it wouldnt matter to her but it mattered to me harry she said a lot of things have happened since since the last time we talked the big spell at chichén itzá didnt just destroy the red court who were there it killed them all every red court vampire in the world yeah i said and my voice sounded hard even to me that was the idea murphy blew out a breath butters says that maybe there were some it missed but they would have had to have been the very youngest and least powerful members of the least powerful bloodlines or else sheltered away in some kind of protected location but he says according to what he knows of magical theory it makes sense i shrugged and nodded yeah i guess so a lot depends on exactly how that rite was set up to work but the red court was dead the same way the black court was dead life would go on they were footnotes now when the red court fell murphy continued their territory was suddenly open there was a power vacuum do you understand oh god the red court had tried to murder my little girl and all that was left of my family and i wouldnt lose any sleep over what had happened to them assuming i would ever sleep again which seemed to be a real question but i hadnt thought past that single moment thought through the longterm consequences of wiping out the entire red court they were one of the major supernatural nations in the world they controlled a continent and changesouth and most of central americaand had holdings all over the world they owned property stocks corporations accounts they as much as owned some governments assets of every kind the value of what the red court had controlled was almost literally incalculable and i had thrown it all up in the air and declared one giant game of finders keepers oops i said things are bad murphy said not so much here in chicago weve repulsed the worst incursionsmostly from some gang of arrogant freaks called the fomor and the paranet has been a huge help its saved literally hundreds if not thousands of lives in my peripheral vision i saw abbys spine straighten and her eyes flash with a strength and surety i had never seen in her before south america has the worst of it by a long ways murphy said but every twobit power and secondrate organization in the supernatural world sees a chance to found an empire old grudges and jealousies are getting dusted off things are killing one another as well as mortals all over the world when one big fish shifts its power base to south america dozens of little fish left behind try to grow enough to fill the space so theres fighting everywhere the white council i hear is running its tubby ass off trying to hold things together and minimize the impact on regular folks but we havent seen them here apart from a couple of times when warden ramirez came by hunting for molly molly i said how is she i dimly heard mort relaying my words i noted that he was doing a credible job of mirroring my tone of voice i guess he really had done a lot of this kind of thing before shes still recovering from the wounds she took at chichén itzá murphy said she says they were as much psychic as physical and that hit to her leg was pretty bad i dont understand how your disappearance makes her a criminal to the white council but apparently it has ramirez has told us that the wardens are looking to pass sentence on herbut he didnt seem to be working his ass off to find her either i know what it looks like when a cop is slacking how is she i asked again murph its me hows she doing she looked down and swallowed she she isnt right harry what do you mean murphy looked up at me again her jaw set she talks to herself she sees things that arent there she has headaches she babbles sounds like me i said at approximately the same time will said sounds like harry this is different murphy said to will and you know it dresden was in control of it he used the weirdness to make him stronger were you ever afraid of him murphy asked outright afraid will frowned and looked down at his hands he could be scary but no i never thought hed hurt me by accident or otherwise how do you feel about molly coming over murphy asked i would like to leave will replied frankly the girl aint right apparently murphy continued turning back to me the presence of a wizard in a city any city all around the world is an enormous deterrent weird things are afraid of the council they know that the white council can come get you fast out of nowhere with overwhelming force most of the scarybad things around the ones with any brains at least avoid white council territory only with you gone and the white council having its hands full murphy shook her head god even the vanilla news is starting to notice the weirdness in town so molly wouldnt stay with anyone shes always moving but she got it into her head that chicago didnt need an actual white council wizard to help calm things downthe bad guys just had to think one was here so she started posting messages whenever she dealt with some wandering predator and called herself the ragged lady declaring chicago protected territory thats crazy i said what part of she isnt right didnt you understand murphy replied to morty her voice sharp she took a breath and calmed herself again the craziest part is that it worked at least partly a lot of bad things have decided to play elsewhere college towns out in the country are the worst but things have happened here she shivered violent things mostly to the bad guys but sometimes to humans gangers mostly the ragged ladys calling card is a piece of cloth she tears off and leaves on her enemies and there are lots and lots of pieces of cloth being found these days a lot of them on corpses i swallowed you think its molly we dont know murphy replied in her professionally neutral voice molly says she isnt going after anything but the supernatural threats and ive got no reason to disbelieve her but murphy showed her hands so when you said raggedy ann i said you meant molly shes like this battered stained tornup doll murphy said believe me it fits battered tornup scary doll will said quietly and you just let her be that way i demanded murphy ground her teeth no i talked to her half a dozen times we tried an intervention to get her off the street we shouldnt have will said what happened mort asked will apparently assumed it had been my question she hammered us like a row of nails on balsa wood is what happened he said lights sound images jesus ive got a picture in my head of being dragged off into the nevernever by monsters that i still cant get rid of when she gave it to me all i could do was curl up into a ball and scream wills description made me feel sick to my stomach which was ridiculous because it wasnt like i ate food anymorebut my innards hadnt gotten the memo i looked away grimacing tasting bitter bile in my mouth memories are weapons sir stuart said quietly sharp as knives murphy held up her hand to cut will off whether or not shes going too far shes the only one we have with a majorleague talent not that the ordo hasnt done well by us abby she added nodding toward the blond woman not at all abby replied undisturbed we arent all made the same size and shape are we abby looked at me more or less and said we built the wards around karrins house three hundred people from the paranet all working together she put a hand on an exterior wall where the power of the patchwork ward hummed steadily took us less than a day and two hundred pizzas murphy muttered and a citation and well worth it abby said arching an eyebrow that dared murphy to disagree murphy shook her head but i could see her holding off a smile the point is were waiting for molly to confirm your bona fides harry um morty said is is that safe ms murphy if the girl was his apprentice wont her reaction to his shade likely be somewhat emotional will snorted the way nitroglycerin is somewhat volatile he took a breath and then said karrin you sure about this murphy looked around the room slowly abbys eyes were on the floor but her usally rosy cheeks were pale and totos ears drooped unhappily wills expression was steady but his body language was that of a man who thinks he might need to dive through a closed window at any second forthill was watching the room at large exuding calm confidence but his brow was furrowed and the set of his mouth was slightly tense with the exception of forthill id seen them all react to direct danger they were all scared of molly murphy faced them she was the smallest person in the room her expression was as smooth and expressive as a sheet of ice her body posture steady she looked as though she felt she was ready for just about anything but ive been in more than one fur ball with murph and i saw through her outer shell to the fear that was driving her she didnt know if i was real for all she knew i might be some kind of boogeyman from the nightmare side of the street and that was unacceptable she had to know the problem was that no matter what answer she got it was going to hurt if molly pegged me as a bad guy the knowledge that the real harry dresden was still missing and presumed dead after the flash of contact mort had provided would be like a frozen blade in the guts and if she learned that it really was my shade it would be even worse molly will be fine murphy said we need her shell come through she passed her hand over her brush of hair her voice turned into something much smaller weighed down by pain no offense to mr lindquist no offense to mister but i we have to know paranoid probably but just because youre paranoid doesnt mean there isnt a wizards ghost standing beside you with tears in his eyes chapter eleven not long after something scratched at the front door and will opened it to admit a greybrownfurred wolf the wolf trotted over to where marcis dress lay folded on the sofa took it in her teeth and vanished into the kitchen marci appeared a few seconds later settling the dress around her slender form and said shell be here any moment i already told andi and eyes thank you marci murph looked at everyone and said settle down people you look like youre expecting hannibal lecter to come through the door i could handle hannibal will said this is different murphy put a fist on her hip and said will molly is one of us and you arent going to help her by looking nervous if you cant settle down and relax get out of here i dont want you upsetting her will grimaced then he went into the kitchen and a moment later a large wolf with fur the same color as wills hair padded back into the room he went to a corner turned around three times and settled down on the floor toto let out a sharp little bark of greeting and hopped down to hurry over to will the little dog sniffed will then turned around three times and settled down next to him their backs touching the big wolf took a deep breath and exhaled it into a very humansounding sigh of resignation thank you murphy said she glanced at mort theres a circle made out of copper wire in the kitchen if it gets hot in here you can run for it you know how to empower a circle yes of course he licked his lips and said though i cant imagine running for my life and stopping in the kitchen meaning no offense to your protective ability but ill stop when im home thank you god murphy said if only more people had as much sense as you murphys radio chirped and eyes started to say something his voice drowned an instant later in a burst of static that ratcheted more tension in everyone wizards and their major magical talent are tough on hardware the more complex a machine is the more disruptive a wizards presence becomes and electronics are nearly always the first to malfunction when a wizard is nearby the wonky radio warned us of mollys approach every bit as clearly as a sentry shouting who goes there huh i said mort glanced at me what the technology disruption a practitioner causes is relative to hisor herstrength i knew that actually mort said its why i have to keep replacing my cell phone so so molly was not a heavyweight in terms of raw power she had to be practically close enough to touch something to hex it down that fast i narrowed my eyes shes gotten stronger either that or shes already in the room mort said murphy looked up sharply at that what the house lights flickered for a second and then went out they werent gone longthe space of a heartbeat or two but when they came back up murphy had her gun in hand marci had become a wolf with a sundress hanging around her neck and a young woman wrapped in layers and layers of castoff clothing sat on the sofa between abby and mort not six inches away from either of them molly was tall and built like a pinup model with long long legs and curves that not even the layers of clothing could hide her face was lovely and devoid of makeup and her cheekbones pressed out harshly against her skin her hair was dirty stringy tangled and colored a shade of purple so dark as to be nearly indistinguishable from black a wooden cane stained the same color of deep purple leaned against her knees and an old militaryissue canvas knapsack covered with buttons and drawings in magic marker rested between her hiking boots from abbys and morts reactions it must have smelled like it had been at least several days since her last shower but it was her eyes that were the worst my apprentices blue eyes were sunken surrounded by shadows of stress and fatigue and an odd light glittered there in the glassy shine id seen mostly in people recovering from anesthesia its interesting that you would notice me molly said to mort as if shed been politely participating in the conversation all along the ectomancer twitched and i saw him fight off the desire to get up and sprint for his car molly nodded and looked around the rest of the room person by person until she got to murphy i hope were planning a civil discussion this time karrin murph put her gun away giving molly a mild glance by way of reprimand we were being civil last time were your friends molly and were worried about you my apprentice shrugged i dont want anyone like friends anywhere near me if you include yourself among them you should leave me the hell alone her voice had turned into a snarl by the end of the sentence and she paused to take a slow deliberate breath and calm down i dont have the patience or the time for a grouptherapy session what do you want murphy seemed to consider her answer for a moment she wound up going for brevity we need you to verify something for us do i look like a factchecker to you karrin you look like a homeless scarecrow murphy said her tone matteroffact you smell like a gutter i thought you used to be a detective molly said rolling her eyes see above regarding not wanting anyone around me its not all that hard to understand miss carpenter said father forthill in a sudden tone of gentle authority you are a guest in this womans home a woman who has put her own life in danger to save othersincluding you molly turned an absolutely arctic look onto father forthill then she said in a quiet flat monotone i dont particularly care to be spoken to as if i am still a child father if you wish to be respected as an adult you should comport yourself as one forthill replied which includes behaving with civility toward your peers and respect toward your elders molly glowered for a moment more but then turned back to murphy all things considered its stupid for me to be here and im a busy woman ms murphynothing but customers customers customers so im out the door in five seconds unless you give me a good reason to stay this is mort lindquist ectomancer murphy said promptly he says hes here to speak to us on behalf of harrys ghost who is with him molly absolutely froze in place her face blanched beneath the grime id like it if you could verify for us whether or not its true murphy said her voice gentle i need to know if hes really if its really his ghost molly stared at her for a second then shivered and looked down at her hands um murphy leaned a little closer to molly you could tell couldnt you molly shot her a wideeyed glance and looked down again she muttered something before she said yes but not with so many people in the room why not mollys voice turned into a bitter snarl do you want my help or not murphy folded her arms for a long moment then she said time for another stroll in the evening air people mr lindquist please stay everyone else out mort was trying very hard not to look like a man who wanted to run for the door and getting mixed results i of course ms murphy murphy had to urge the werewolves to leave and help marci get untangled from her dress forthill and abby looked at each other and left the room without a murmur molly sat completely still during this staring down at her folded hands you dont have clue one do you she asked murphy quietly you dont have any idea what youre asking me to go through if i could do it myself i would molly looked up sharply at that her smile was unpleasant bordering on creepy easy words she said easy words they leave little trails of slime on your lips when they pass them but it doesnt make them go down any more smoothly molly murphy sighed and sat down and spread her hands you wont let us help you you wont talk to us but this is something i literally cannot ask of anyone else you always asked him molly said her tone spiteful theres a boiler about to burst sir stuart murmured to me shut your mouth i said quietly coming automatically to her defense but he was right the kid was teetering on a cliff as i sat there looking at her i stared at molly and felt absolutely wretched she was my apprentice i was supposed to have taught her to survive without me granted i hadnt planned on taking a bullet in the chest but then who does or was her condition simply symptomatic of the world she lived in murphy regarded the younger woman for a long moment and then nodded yes i know enough to know when im out of my depth my instincts say mort isnt trying to con me but weve got to have more than just my intuition i need your help please molly shook her head very slowly shivering she wiped at her face with her grimy gloves and clean streaks appeared on her cheeks fine she lifted her head looked at mort and said calmly if youre running a con i will peel the skin off your brain the ectomancer spread his hands look dresdens shade came to me if it isnt him that aint my fault im operating in good faith here youre a roach molly said pleasantly runs and hides from any threat but you survive dont you yes mort said frankly maybe i should have been a roach too molly said it would be easier she took a slow deep breath and said where is he mort pointed a finger at me i took a few steps until i stood in the mouth of the hallway that led down to murphys bedrooms i gestured to sir stuart to stay back why he asked shes going to use her sight the less she has to look at the better sir stuart shrugged and stayed near mort he watched molly through narrowed eyes his fingertips on the handle of that monster pistol molly grabbed her cane and rose to her feet leaning on it taking the weight off the leg that had been shot at chichén itzá she straightened her back and shoulders turned toward me took a deep breath and opened her sight id never seen such a thing from this angle before it was as if a sudden light burning steady and unwavering kindled just between and above her eyebrows as it flooded out of her i felt it as a tangible sensation on my immaterial flesh it was blinding i lifted a hand for a moment to shield my eyes against it before i looked up to meet mollys gaze her lips parted she stared at me and tears blurred her vision she tried twice to speak before she said how do i know its you i could answer her its called the sight but it embraces the entire spectrum of human perception and then some i met her gaze and composed my face then i said in my very best alec guinness impersonation you will go to the dagobah system there you will learn from yoda the jedi master who instructed me molly sat down abruptly missed the couch and hit the floor instead ohmygod she breathed ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod harry i knelt to be on eye level with her yeah kid its me are are you really really gone i shrugged i dont know i guess i am im sorta new at this and they arent in danger of winning any exposition awards around here she nodded as more tears came but she didnt look away ddid you come to take me away she asked her voice very small no i said quietly molly no i was sent back here wwhy she whispered to find my murderer i said quietly people i care about are in danger if i dont get the job done molly began rocking back and forth where she sat i oh ive been trying the city has become so dark and i knew what you would expect of me but im not as strong as you i cant just ssmash things like you could molly i said in a calm clear tone her reddened exhausted blue eyes looked up at me you know who i want to know about dont you who i wouldnt want you to talk about in front of anyone i hadnt said my daughters name since returning to chicago hell id barely dared to think it as far as the rest of the world knew maggie had been engulfed in the conflagration that devoured the red court anyone who knew of her identity might well hold it against her i didnt want that not if i wasnt going to be there to protect her my throat felt tight because i thought it should i suppose you know who im asking about yes she said of course is that person safe and well as far as i know yes she said a small smile made her for an instant resemble the girl i remembered chewbacca is with her there was only one giant walking carpet to whom she could be referringmy dog mouse the beast was smarter than a lot of people and was probably the single best supernatural guardian any child could have had and he was huge and warm and fuzzy and perfectly content to be a blanket or pillowor a furious incarnation of preternatural strength and speed depending on which was needed at the moment hell maggie was only eight he was probably spending half his time pretending to be a pony i exhaled slowly and felt a little dizzy the memories i had of maggiewhat few there werewere hammering their way across my consciousness i mostly remembered holding her in the quiet after it was all over im not sure how long i sat there with her she had been a small sleepy warmth in my arms grateful for the comfort of being held we can go see her molly suggested i mean i know where she is i wanted to shout an agreement and leap at the chance but i couldnt so i didnt maybe after we take care of business i said all right molly said nodding better button up your sight kid i said quietly theres no reason to leave it open so long bad things could happen but i wont be able to see you or hear you which seems odd given that its called the sight it encompasses a lot i said loftily kid youve got a gift trust your instincts which in this case should suggest to you that what you need is the spiritviewing ointment we made off of rashids faeriesight recipe or something like it okay she said okay she frowned and bowed her head and i saw her sight being withdrawn the light at her forehead dwindling and finally winking out murphy was sitting at the very edge of her chair her back straight her hands in her lap miss carpenter molly turned to look at murphy it seemed to take her a second or two to focus her eyes yes its him he greeted me with a quote from the empire strikes back murphys mouth twitched at one corner him my apprentice nodded and didnt meet murphys eyes so murphy said hes really really gone that bullet killed him hes gone molly said the shade is its harry in every practical sense it will have his memories his personality but it isnt him molly shook her head i asked him about that once about what happens to a soul when a ghost is left behind what did he say that he had no idea and that he doubted anyone would ever get a straight answer molly the older woman said i know youre tired i would like it if you let me offer you some clothes a meal a shower some real sleep my house is protected id like to be able to tell your parents that i did at least that much for you the next time they call me to ask about you molly looked around the room for a moment biting her lip yes it she shivered but its better if i dont better for who everyone molly said she gathered herself and rose using the cane to get to her feet once again she grimaced in the process it was obvious that using her leg still caused her pain honestly ive been playing a lot of games and i dont want any of them to splash onto you she paused and then said tentatively im sorry about the detective remark karrin that was going too far murphy shrugged least said soonest mended my apprentice sighed and began pulling her tattered layers about herself a little more securely mr lindquist appears to be working in good faith ill come back tomorrow with something that might let you communicate with harrys shade a little more easily thank you murphy said while youre at it it might be smart to there was the sudden blaring of a pocketsized air horn from outside mort hopped up from his seat into a crouch ready either to run or to fling himself heroically to the floor what was that trouble murphy said unlimbering her gun get d she hadnt finished speaking when gunfire roared outside and bullets began ripping through the windows and the walls chapter twelve i did what any sane person would do in a situation like that i threw myself to the ground oh honestly dresden sir stuart snapped he sprinted toward the gunfire out through the wall of the house i actually saw the buildings wards flare up with spectral bluewhite light around him as he went through unimpeded right dummy i growled at myself youre already dead i got up and ran after the elder shade the living were all kissing hardwood floor as i plunged into the wall of the house i wasnt worried about the wards keeping me inno one ever designed their wards so that bad things couldnt leave only so that they couldnt enter besides id had an invitation to come in which technically made me a friendlybut i found out that friendly wards operated on much the same principle as friendly fire going out through the warded wall didnt just tingle unpleasantly i felt like id just plunged naked down a waterslide lined with steel wool aaaaaaaagh i screamed emerging from the wards and onto murphys front lawn chockfull of new insight as to why ghosts are always moaning or wailing when they come popping out of somebodys wall or floor not much mystery thereit freaking hurts i staggered for several steps and looked up in time to see the driveby still in progress they were in a pickup truck someone in the passengers compartment had the barrel of a shotgun sticking out the window and four figures in dark clothing crouched in the trucks cargo bed pointing what looked like assault weapons and submachine guns at murphys house they were cutting loose with them too flashes of thunder and lightning too bright and loud to be real seemingly magnified by the quiet still air between the snow and the streetlights these guys werent real pros id seen true professional gunmen in action and these jokers didnt look anything like them they just pointed the business end more or less in a general direction and sprayed bullets it wasnt the disciplined fire of true professionals but if you throw out enough bullets youre bound to hit something bullets went through me half a dozen flashes of tingling discomfort too brief to be more than an annoyance and i suddenly found myself sprinting toward the truck beside sir stuart exhilarated being bulletproof is kind of a rush what are we doing i shouted at him i mean what are we accomplishing here we cant do anything to them can we watch and learn lad sir stuart called his teeth bared in a wolfish grin on three be on the truck what uh i think dont think the shade shouted just do it let your instincts guide you be on the truck one two the shades feet struck the ground hard twice like a long jumper at the end of his approach i followed sir stuarts example on little more than reflex a sudden memory flashed into my heada school playground from my childhood where mock olympic games were being run students competing against one another the sun was hot above us making the petroleum smell of warm asphalt rise from the surface of the playground i had been competing in the running long jump and it hadnt been going well i forget exactly why i was so desperate to win but i was fixated on it as only a child could be i remembered willing myself to win to run faster to jump farther as i sprinted down the lane toward the pinkchalk jump line it was the first time i used magic i had no idea at the time naturally but i remembered the feeling of utter elation that flooded through me along with an invisible force that pushed against my back as i leapt and for just an instant i thought i had spontaneously learned to fly like superman reality reasserted itself in rapid order i fell out of control my arms spinning like a windmill i went down on the blacktop and left generous patches of skin on its surface i remember how much it hurtand how i didnt care because id won i broke the iowa state high school longjump record by more than a foot it didnt stick though they disqualified me i hadnt even gotten serious about puberty yet clearly something irregular had happened mistakes had been made and surely the best thing was to ignore the anomalous leap it was a vivid recollection silly and a little sadand it was my first time it was a powerful memory three sir stuart cried and leapt so did i my eyes and will locked on the retreating pickup full of gunmen there was a twisting dizzying sensation that reminded me very strongly of a potion bob had helped me mix up when id tangled with the shadowman it was that same experience a feeling of flying apart into zillions of pieces rushing forward at a speed too great to be measured only to abruptly coalesce again there was a sudden cold wind against my face and i staggered nearly falling off the roof of the pickup as it continued to slowly accelerate down the street holy crap i said as a huge smile stretched my face that was cool first shadowcat now nightcrawler i turned to find sir stuart standing on the bed of the truck looking up at me with a disapproving eyebrow lifted one of the shooters backs was in the same space as the shades right leg doesnt that hurt i asked him nodding to his leg hmmm sir stuart said he glanced down and saw what i was talking about oh i suppose yes i stopped noticing it after seventy or eighty years now if you dont mind dresden might we proceed to do what i asked to teach you what are obviously badly needed lessons sir stuart said and to stop these pirates he spat the last word with a startling amount of venom i frowned and eyed the gunmen who were all reloading having emptied their weapons in sheer nervous excitement they werent particularly good at reloading either hell one man with a handgun could take them all right now i said too bad neither of us has one we cannot touch flesh sir stuart said and while it is possible for a shade to for example move an object it is impractical with practice you could push a penny across a table over the course of a couple of minutes too bad neither of us has a penny i said he ignored me entirely thats because we can put forth only minuscule physical force you couldnt lift the coin into the air against the pull of gravity i frowned this sounded a lot like a basic lesson most young wizards received most of the time when you wanted to move something around you didnt have the kind of energy you needed stored inside you that didnt mean you couldnt move it though it just meant you had to get the energy to do so from another source but you can coopt energy from elsewhere the big man pointed an index finger at me a smile stretching his mouth excellent we cannot interact with something being moved by a living creature we cant even touch an object that is being carried too closely to a living body but he glanced up at me inviting me to finish the thought i blinked twice mind racing and said machines we can work with machines sir stuart nodded as long as they are in motion and there is an enormous amount of energy and motion passing through a nonliving mechanical engine without another word he paced forward through the back wall of the cab sat on the passengers seat and leaned to his left i couldnt see what he was doing so i dropped to all fours took a deep breath and stuck my face through the roof of the cab it tingled and hurt but i had literally spent a lifetime learning to cope with pain i pushed it to the back of my mind gritted my teeth and watched sir stuart had pushed his hand into the steering wheel of the truck he pushed the other forward leaning partly through the dashboard to do it and waited patiently watching the road ahead of us it didnt take long for the truck to hit a hummock in the ice coating the streets and the truck bounced shocks squealing just as it did the shades eyes fluttered closed and he gave a peculiar jerking twist of his arm the trucks air bag exploded out of the steering wheel it struck the driver smacking him back into the drivers seat and the man panicked his arms tightened in surprise as he was hit and he turned the steering wheel several degrees to one side then he broke the cardinal rule of driving on ice and stomped his foot on the brake the slight turn and the sudden braking motion put the car into a slide the driver was trying to push the air bag out of his face and he didnt compensate and turn into the slide the slide became a spin sir stuart watched in satisfaction looked up at me and said not much different from spooking a horse really the gunmen in the back were screaming in confusion as the car spun through three ponderous circles somehow putting forth the illusion of grace they bounced off the snow piled high on one side of the street and then slid into an intersection up over a sidewalk and through the front windows of a small grocery store the sounds of shattering glass and brick screaming metal crumpling through its zones and cracking snow and ice were shockingly loud the steadily ringing bell of the stores security alarm sounded like my old mickey mouse alarm clock in comparison the gunmen sat there doing nothing for a moment clearly stunned but then they began cursing and scrambling to get gone before the cops showed up sir stuart vanished and reappeared across the street i made the same effort of will i had while jumping to the truck reaching back for that memory once more again i flew apart and came back together reappearing standing next to sir stuart facing a brick wall next time turn around on the way he advised i snorted and looked back at the gunmen what about them what about them cant we i dont know possess them and make them bang their heads into a wall or something sir stuart barked out a harsh laugh we cannot enter unless the mortal is willing that is the purview of demons not shades i scowled so what we stand here and watch them walk he shrugged im not willing to leave mortimer alone for so much time you may also wish to consider dresden that dawn is not far away it will destroy you if you are not within a sanctum such as mortimers residence i frowned looking up at the sky city light had wiped away all but the brightest stars but the sky to the east held only a hint of blue low on the horizon dawn was hard on spirits and shades and magical spells alike not because one is inherently good and one inherently evil but because dawn is a time of new beginnings and the light of a new day tends to sweep away the supernatural litter from the day before for spirit beings to survive sunrise they had to be in a protected placea sanctum my trusty lab assistant bob had a sanctum in his case a specially enchanted skull designed to protect him from dawn and daylight and to provide a home a plain old threshold wouldnt get it done although my old apartment had probably qualified as a sanctum given how many layers and layers of defense id put up around it but i didnt have either of those things anymore go back to mort i said it was fun playing maximum overdrive with these chowderheads but that isnt going to protect the people we care about im going to follow the shooters back to their place and see what i can find out about them sir stuart frowned at me and said the dawn is not something to take chances with man i strongly advise against your doing so so noted i said but the only real weapon i have against them is knowledge someone needs to get it and im the only one who isnt susceptible to lead poisoning im the logical choice assume you get the information and manage to survive the dawn the shade said then what will you do i give it to murphy who uses it to rip the bad guys tongues out through their belly buttons sir stuart blinked that is certainly a vivid image its a gift i said modestly he shook his head and sighed i admire your spirit man but this is foolish yeah but ive gotta be me i said sir stuart put both hands behind his back and tapped a toe on the ground a few times then he gave me a resigned nod good hunting he said if you have a problem with wraiths again vanish they wont be able to keep up thank you i said and offered him my hand we traded grips and he turned on a heel and started marching back toward murphys place i watched him for a moment then turned around and hurried after the snowblurred forms of the gunmen wondering exactly how much time i had left before the sunrise obliterated me chapter thirteen the bad guys started hoofing it and i followed them over here said one of them he was youthfully scrawny his skin bronze enough to look native american though his tangled red hair and pug nose argued otherwise his eyes were an odd shade of brown so light as to be nearly golden what fitz one of the other gunmen said shut up fitz said give me your piece the other handed over his gun and fitz promptly removed the magazine ejected a round from the chamber and pitched it into the snowbank along with the weapon he was carrying what the fuck said the disarmed gunman and struck fitz lightly in the chest fitz slammed a fist into the other mans face with speed and violence enough to impress even meand ive seen some fast things in action the other gunman went to his ass in the snow and sat there hands lifted to cradle his freshly broken nose no time for stupid fitz said everyone give me your guns or do you want to explain to him why you tried to get us all thrown in jail the others didnt look happy about it but they passed over the weapons fitz unloaded them and threw them all into the snowbank then at his direction they started patting snow into the hole the weapons had made concealing them stupid man said one of the young men one of those wolves gets on our trail we got nothing to defend ourselves one of the wolves follows us back well have the rag lady on our asses and guns will be useless fitz snapped pack it in tighter smooth it then he turned to the man hed struck and piled some of the fresher snow into the mans hands put that on your nose stop it from bleeding you dont want to leave any blood behind if you have a choice the seated young man looked frightened and did as fitz told him what are we doing asked another of the gunmen he was smaller than the others and his tone wasnt challengingit was a question the trucks stolen they cant trace it to us fitz explained dusting snow off his hands even if the winter breaks tomorrow itll be days before this melts and they find the weapons with luck theyll never connect the two thats longterm the little one said i sort of want to survive the night fitz almost smiled you want to walk down the streets of fucking chicago with assault weapons in your hands we could keep them out of sight in the truck not out here the little guy nodded i can keep the knife right out of sight fitz said and lifted his head listening and frowning sirens were a common sound in nighttime chicago but they had shifted from background noise to something louder nearer get moving people fitz jammed his hands into the pockets of his rather light coat and started walking the others hurried to keep up with him i walked next to fitz studying him i was more impressed with the young man in the lousy attacks aftermath than i had been during the driveby any idiot can point a gun and squeeze a trigger not everyone can keep themselves calm and rational in the wake of an automobile collision weigh the liabilities of the situation and makeand enforcetheir decisions in the face of opposition though the attack had been amateurish it had not been stupid and fitzs actions in response to the sudden hitch sir stuart had thrown into his plans were probably as ideal as the situation allowed fitz was smart under pressure he was a natural leader and i had a bad feeling that he was the sort of person who never made the same mistake twice he had just done his best to kill several people i cared a great deal for brains plus resolve equals dangerous id have to see to it that he was neutralized at the first opportunity i followed them through cold i no longer felt and practiced vanishing id jump ahead of them behind them onto ledges above themall the while trying not to notice that the sky was getting lighter something bothered me about the redheaded kid with the cops on the way the store alarm ringing his associates bleeding and dazed around him why take a few extra vital seconds to empty the guns it had cost him about half a minute of time he certainly couldnt afford to lose why do it i asked myself why i might do something similar and the only answer i could come up with involved preventing whoever found the weapons from getting hurt fitz was willing to riddle a small chicago houseand potentially the houses behind it given the power of the weapons in questionwith bullets but he got all safety conscious when disposing of weapons it was a contradiction interesting even more interesting was the fact that id cared enough to notice generally if someone took a swing at my friends id cheerfully designate him a target and proceed to make his world a noisy and dangerous place until he wasnt a threat anymore i didnt lose a lot of sleep over it either but i couldnt just throw myself into the fight now dammit and unlike before those who threatened my friends could not also threaten me i was safe from fitz and his crew unless they planned to keep walking until sunrise and i was similarly no danger to them normally id be fuming at the presence of people who had tried to kill my friends but now we were absolutely no threat to one another that made it sort of hard to keep my inner kettle of outrage bubbling along at maximum boil fitz kept them all moving through the snowbound streets stopping only once to check on the bleeders nose packing it in snow had stopped the blood loss but the young man was disoriented from the wreck and the pain there were other small injuries among his crew and he stopped at a little convenience store emerging with a bottle of water and an economysized bottle of painkillers he passed them off to the short inquisitive kid and told him to doubledose everyoneand to keep moving it took them most of an hour of steady trudging through the cold to clear bucktown and head for the south side a lot of people think of the south side as a sort of economic desert crossed with a gangwarfare demilitarized zone it isnt like thator at least it isnt like that everywhere there are neighborhoods you dont want to walk through wearing certain colors or being a certain color but theyre more exception than rule the rest of the south side varies pretty widely with plenty of it zoned for industry and fitz and his group of battered pedestrians headed into an area on the fringe of an industrial park to a manufacturing facility that had been closed and abandoned for several years it took up a block all by itself a big building only a couple of stories high that covered acres of ground the plows had piled snow higher and higher around it like a fortress wall with no need to create an opening for the unoccupied building fitz and his crew went over the wall of snow at a spot that had evidently been worked with shovels to form narrow if slippery stairs there was a foot and a half of snow covering the buildings parking lot with a single pathway shoveled out of it they followed it in single file to doors that looked as if theyd been solidly chained shutbut fitz rattled the chains and nudged one of the doors open wide enough for the crew of youngsters all of them still skinny to squeeze through i went through the doors ghost style and tried to ignore the discomfort the way sir stuart did it hurt anywaynot enough to make me howl in agony or anything but way too much to simply lose track of maybe it just took time for your skin to toughen at least there hadnt been a threshold which would have stopped me cold this place had never been meant to be anyones home and evidently nobody who lived there thought of it as anything special the exact process that formed a threshold had never been fully explained or documented but it might be a good idea for me to get a better idea of the exact why and how given my circumstances no it is not a good idea focus dresden i muttered the idea is for you to take care of business so you never have to learn all about the environmental factors of longterm ghostosity fitz stopped long enough to do a head count out loud as the ragged troop of wouldbe gangsters moved deeper into the building it was an industrial structure and it had been built for economy not beauty there werent a lot of windows and it was definitely on the shady sideeven with dawn almost here and the lights of the city and sky reflecting from fresh snow cold too judging from the way the breath was congealing into fog every time the young men exhaled fitz broke out a camping light and flicked it on it was a red one and didnt so much light the way as clarify the difference between utter darkness and notquite darkness it was enough for them to move by i wonder i mused aloud after all i was immaterial ghosts and the material universe didnt seem to have a completely oneway relationship the way mortals and physics did i didnt actually have pupils to dilate anymore hell for that matter light apparently passed right through mehow else was i invisible to everyone otherwise which meant that whatever it might seem like i wasnt really seeing the world in the traditional sense my perceptions were something different something more than light reflecting onto a chemically sensitive surface in my eyes theres no real reason i should need the light to see is there i asked myself no i said no there isnt i closed my eyes for a few steps and focused on a simple memorywhen as a kid in a foster home id first found myself in a dark room when a storm knocked out the power it was a new place and i had fumbled around blindly searching for a flashlight or matches or a lighter or any other source of light for almost ten minutes before i found somethinga decorative snow globe commemorating the olympics at lake placid a small switch turned on a light that made the red white and blue snowflakes drifting in the liquid gleam in sudden brilliance the panic in my chest had eased as the room became something i could navigate safely again my fear fading i could see and when i opened my ghostly eyes i could see the hallway through which we walked with perfect clarity as plainly as if the longdead fluorescents overhead had been humming along at full glow a quick pleased laugh escaped me now i could see in the dark just like uhhh i cant think of an xman who im sure could see in the dark or was that a nightcrawler thing whatever its still another superpower there is no spoon i am completely spoonless over here fitz stopped in his tracks turning suddenly and lifted the camping light in my direction his eyes wide he suddenly sucked in a deep breath i stopped and blinked at him everyone around fitz had gone quiet and completely still reacting to his obvious fear with the instant instinctive stillness of someone who had good reason to fear predators fitz stared down the hall uncertainly moving the light as if it might help him see a few inches farther hells bells i said hey kid can you hear me fitz reacted his body twitching a little his head cocked to one side then the other as if trying to trace a faint whisper of sound fitz whispered the little kid with the knife quiet fitz said still staring i cupped my hands over my mouth and shouted hey kid can you hear me the color had already drained out of his face but the second call to him got another reaction he licked his lips turned away quickly and said thought i heard something thats all its nothing come on interestinger and interestinger i stuck my hands in the pockets of my duster and paced along beside fitz studying him he was maybe an inch under six feet tall but taller than all the others with him he couldnt have been seventeen but his eyes were decades older he must have been surviving on his own for a while to have had so much composure at his age and hed known at least a little about the way a practitioner could use blood to send all kinds of mischief and mayhem at his enemies he had scars at the corner of his left eye like a boxerexcept boxers collected them on both eyes and they were spread out scattered around these were all in a relatively tiny space someone righthanded had punched him in the same spot irregularly repeatedly id seen fitzs speed he hadnt tried to get out of the way hells bells wed just been hit by oliver twist it took fitz and the gang about five minutes to make it to what had once been a shop floor it was open to the thirtyfoot ceiling there were skylightstranslucent panels on the roof reallyand the place looked like something out of an apocalypse movie equipment sat neglected everywhere the motorized assembly line was still cobwebs stretched out covering everything coated in dust empty racks and shelves gave no clue as to what was made there but several steel half barrels were scattered around an open area halfway down the shop floor they had been filled with flammable scraps mostly doors trim and shelves that must have been scavenged from other parts of the building ragged old sleeping bags were scattered among the fire sources along with trash sacks of what i guessed were meager personal belongings one of the low barrels had a metal grate over ita makeshift grill there was a man crouched over it he was thin practically skeletal and wore only a pair of closefitting jeans his skin was pasty and white his smooth head was covered with crudelooking tattoossymbols of protection and concealment from multiple traditions of magical practice completely encircling his skull he needed to shave his patchy beard was growing out in uneven lumps of brown and black and grey there were several cans of beans and chili sitting on the grill presumably being prepared for fitzs gang who looked painfully interested in them the bald man didnt give any indication that he knew fitz had arrived until the group had been standing silently for a full five minutes then he asked is it done no fitz said and where are the guns we had to ditch them the bald mans shoulders clenched suddenly stiff excuse me fitz lifted a hand to touch his fingertips to his left eye a gesture that struck me as unconscious instinctive he lowered it again quickly there was an accident the police were coming we had to walk out and we couldnt carry the guns with us the bald man stood up and turned to face fitz his eyes were dark deepset and burning you lost the guns the guns i paid so much for the guns were already lost fitz said his eyes on the floor there wasnt any sense in all of us going to jail too the bald mans eyes blazed and a scream exploded from his chest there was a horrible rushing bassthrumming sound in the air and an invisible force struck fitz full in the chest knocking him back ten feet before he hit the concrete floor and tumbled another ten sense the bald man screamed sense you dont have any sense do you know what the consequences of your idiocy could be do you know how many groups precisely like this one have been wiped out by the fomor by the rag lady idiot fitz lay on the floor body curled defensively and didnt even try to lift his head he was staying down hoping not to provoke baldy any further his expression resigned to the fact that he was probably going to suffer more pain in short orderand that there was nothing he could do about it it was simple baldy continued stalking toward the young man i gave you a task that men with their veins and noses full of drugs execute routinely and it proved too great a challenge is that what you are telling me fitzs voice was too steady to be sincere he was used to hiding his fear his vulnerability im sorry the rag lady was there we couldnt have gotten any closer shed have taken us we had to hit them and run baldys rage vanished abruptly he stared down at the young man with no expression on his face and spoke in a gentle voice if there is some reason you believe you should be allowed to keep breathing you should share it with the class now fitz fitz had a good poker face but it had been a long night for him he started breathing jerkily the idea wasnt to kill them you told me the idea was to make sure that no one pushes us that we push back we showed them that we accomplished the mission baldy stared at him and did not move i saw a bead of sweat on his brow it isnt its not look i can get the guns back i can i marked where we buried them i can go get them baldy glowered down at the young man and kicked him in the belly the blow was offhand absentminded almost an afterthought he seemed to reach a conclusion and turned around to go back to the grill foods hot boys baldy said come eat up the gang moved forward nervously after a moment fitz began to rise being careful to make no sound there was a sudden puffing sigh of displaced air baldys shape blurred from the grill back over to fitz sending one of the young gunmen flying sideways baldy was suddenly slamming a hard right to fitzs head his fist moving almost too quickly to see the hit sent fitz to the ground i was close enough to see the scar tissue around his eye break open blood trickling rapidly down the young mans cheek not you fitz baldy said his voice gentle again i dont give food to dead men eat when you have corrected your error fitz nodded without looking up his hand pressed to his head yes sir good lad baldy said he wrinkled his nose as if there were a mild stench in the air and spat mostly on fitz then he turned to walk away the kid looked up at baldy with murder in his eye i dont mean that fitz looked angry you hear a lot about if looks could kill these days but there just arent many people who really know what it looks like killingor more accurately making the choice to killisnt something were good at lately ending the life of another living creature used to be part of the daily routine chickens were beheaded by the average farm wife for dinner fish were likewise caught cleaned and prepared for a meal slaughtering pigs or cattle was a regular event part of the turning of the seasons most people on earthfarmersworked and lived every single day with lives they knew they were going to choose to end eventually killings messy its frequently ugly and if something goes wrong it can be wretched seeing another being in mortal agony which means theres a certain amount of pressure involved in the act it isnt easy and thats just considering farm animals killing another human being magnifies the worry the ugliness and the pressure by orders of magnitude you dont make a choice like that lightly theres calculation to it consideration of the possible outcomes anyone can kill in a frenzy of fear or hatredyou arent making the choice to kill that way youre simply giving your emotions control of your actions i watched fitzs eyes as he calculated considered and made his choice his face went pale but his jaw was clenched his eyes steady i dont know what motivated me exactly but i leaned down near him and snapped dont the young man had begun to shift his weight to get his feet beneath him he froze in the act hes expecting it fitz i said in a harsh forceful tone he spat on you to drive you to it hes ready hell kill you before youve finished standing up fitz looked around him but his gaze went right through me he couldnt see me then huh ive been where you are kid i know this bald losers type dont be a sucker dont give him what he wants fitz closed his eyes very tightly for a moment then he exhaled slowly and his body relaxed wise baldy said make good on your claim and we might still have a way to work together fitz fitz swallowed and grimaced as if at a bitter taste in his mouth and said yes sir im going to check the perimeter an excellent idea baldy said id rather not see you for a while then he walked away from fitz leaning down to touch the shoulder of one of the young men and muttered softly fitz moved quickly and quietly getting off the shop floor and moving out into the hallway there he hugged himself tightly shivering and began walking rapidly down a hallway im not crazy he said im not crazy im not crazy well kinda i said keeping pace what are you doing working for an asshole like that you arent real fitz said the hell im not i replied i just cant figure out why it is that you can hear me talking im not crazy fitz snarled and put his hands over his ears im pretty sure that wont help you i noted i mean its your mind that perceives me i think you just happen to get it as uh one of those mv things instead of as a movie mp fitz corrected me automatically then he jerked his hands from his ears and looked around him eyes wide uh are you you actually there i am i confirmed though any halfway decent hallucination would tell you that fitz blinked um i dont want to piss you off or anything but what are you im a guy who doesnt like to see his friends getting shot at fitz i told him fitzs steps slowed he seemed to put his back against a wall out of reflex more than thought he was very still for a long moment then he said youre a um a spirit technically i said he swallowed you work for the rag lady hells bells the kid was terrified of molly and id known plenty of kids like fitz when i was growing up in the system i met them in foster homes in orphanages in schools and summer camps tough kids survivors people who knew that no one was looking out for them except themselves not everyone had the same experience in the system but portions of it were positively darwinian it created some hard cases fitz was one of them people like that arent stupid but they dont scare easily either fitz was terrified of molly my stomach quivered in an unpleasant manner no i told him i dont work for her im not a servitor he frowned then you work for the excop bi uh lady kid i said you have no idea who youre screwing around with you pointed weapons at the wrong people i know where you live now they will too he went white no he said look you dont know what its like here zero and the others they cant help it he doesnt let them do anything but what he wants baldy you mean i asked fitz let out a strained halfhysterical bark of laughter he calls himself aristedes hes got power power to push a bunch of kids around you dont know fitz said speaking quietly he tells you to do something and and you do it it never even occurs to you to do anything else and and he moves so fast im not i think he might not even be human hes human i said hes just another asshole a faint weary spark of humor showed in fitzs face then he said if thats true then how does he do it hes a sorcerer i said middleweight talent with a cult to make him feel bigger hes got some form of kinetomancy im not familiar with to move that fast and some really minor mind mojo if hes got to pick kids to do his dirty work for him you make him sound like a smalltime crook like a car thief or something in the greater scheme yeah i said hes a petty crook hes fagin fitz frowned from from that dickens book uh oliver twist i lifted my eyebrows the kid had read serious readers werent common in the system those who did read mostly seemed to focus on you know kids books not many of them rolled around to dickens unless they got unlucky in high school english i would have been willing to bet that fitz hadnt made it past his freshman year of high school at the very most he was someone who thought for himself and he had at least a little bit of magical talent that probably explained why hed been put in charge of the other boys aside from his evident good sense his company notwithstanding the kid had some innate magical talent of his own fitz had probably been slowly learning to shake off whatever magic it was that baldyaristedesused on him the bad guy operated in a cultleader mindset anyone who wasnt a slavish follower would be utilized as a handy lieutenant until such time as they could be disposed of productivelyor at least quietly i didnt like fitzs chances at all something like that i said fitz leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes i didnt want to hurt anyone he said i dont even know any of those people but he ordered it and they were all going to do it and i couldnt let them just just turn into murderers theyre the only theyre theyre yours i said quietly you look out for them someone has to fitz said streets werent ever easy about six months ago though they got hard real hard things came out you could see them at night sometimesshapes shadows he started shivering and his voice became a whisper theyd take people people who didnt have someone to protect them would just vanish so baldy i said quietly he killed one of them fitz whispered right in front of me i saw it it looked human but when he was done with it it just melted man he shook his head maybe i am crazy god it would almost be a relief you arent crazy i said but youre in a bad place the light went completely out of the kids eyes what else is new oy i muttered like i didnt have enough to do already what nothing look kid go back to the guns at eleven tonight that street will have gotten quieter by then ill meet you his dull eyes never flickered why because im going to help you crazy imaginary invisiblevoice hallucination guy fitz said hes going to help me yeah ive lost it there was the sudden burring metallic buzz of a bell much like youd hear in a high school or university hallway it echoed through the entire building time for class i asked no aristedes had us set it up on a timer says he needed the warning for his work it goes off about five minutes before sunrise i felt my back stiffen five minutes fitz shrugged or seven or two its in there somewhere hells bells i said turning it into a swearword stu was right time does get away from you be at the guns at eleven fitz he grunted and said in a tired monotone sure harvey whatever old books and old movies i had to help this kid i turned away from him and plunged through several walls and out the side of the building clenching my teeth over snarls of discomfort the sky had grown almost fully light red was swiftly brightening to orange on the eastern horizon out over lake michigan once yellow got here i was history five minutes or seven or two that was how long i had to find a safe spot i consulted my mental map of chicago looking for the nearest probable shelter and found the only spot i thought i could get to in a couple of minutes nightcrawler impersonation and all maybe i could get there and maybe it would protect me from the sunrise i gritted my teeth consulted the images in my memory and metaphorically speaking ran for it i just had to hope that it wasnt already too late chapter fourteen one of the things a lot of people dont understand about magic is that the rules of how it works arent hardandfast theyre fluid changing with time with the seasons with location and with the intent of a practitioner magic isnt alive in the sense of a corporeal sentient being but it does have a kind of anima all its own it grows swells wanes and changes some facets of magic are relatively steady like the way a person with a strong magical talent fouls up technologybut even that relative constant is one that has been slowly changing over the centuries three hundred years ago magical talents screwed up other thingslike causing candle flames to burn in strange colors and milk to instantly sour which had to be hell on any wizard who wanted to bake anything a couple of hundred years before that exposure to magic often had odd effects on a persons skin creating the famous blemishes that had become known as the devils mark centuries from now who knows maybe magic will have the side effect of making you really goodlooking and popular with the opposite sexbut im not holding my breath i mean you know i wouldnt be if i still had any anyway the point is that everyone thinks that the sunrise is all about abolishing evil its the light coming up out of the darkness right well yeah sometimes but mostly its just sunrise its a part of every day a steady mark of the passing of whirling objects in the void granted there isnt much black magic associated with the sun coming over the horizonin fact ive never even heard of any but it isnt a cleansing force of good and right it is however one hell of a cleansing force generally speaking therein lay my problem a spirit isnt meant to be hanging around in the mortal world unless its got a body to live in its supposed to be on carmichaels el train i guess or in paradise or hell or valhalla or something spirits are made of energytheyre made of percent pure delicious nutritious magic accept no substitute spirits and sunrise go together like germs and bleach respectively the renewing forces flowing through the world with the new day wash over the planet like a silent invisible tsunami a riptide of magic that will inevitably wear away at even the strongest of mortal spells giving them an effective shelf life if they arent maintained a wandering spirit caught out beneath the sunrise would be dissolved it isnt a question of standing in a shady spot any more than standing in your kitchen would protect you from an oncoming tsunami you have to get to somewhere that is actually safe that is somehow shielded sheltered or otherwise lifted above the renewing riptide of sunrise i was a ghost after all so i ran for the one place i thought might shelter me and that i could reach the quickest i ran for my grave i have my own grave headstone already in place the darned thing all dug out and open just ready to receive me it was a present from an enemy who in retrospect didnt seem nearly as scary as she had been at the time shed been making a grand gesture in front of the seamier side of the supernatural community at large delivering me a death threat while simultaneously demonstrating her ability to get me a grave in a boneyard with very exclusive access convincing its management that it ought to break city ordinances and leave a gaping hole in the earth at the foot of my headstone i dont know what shed bribed or threatened them with but it had stayed where it was yawning open in chicagos famous graceland cemetery for years and maybe it would finally be useful as something other than a set piece for brooding i pulled sir stuarts vanishing trick and realized that i couldnt jump much farther than maybe three hundred yards at a hop still i could do it a lot faster than running and it didnt seem to wear me out the way i would expect such a thing to do it became an exercise like running itselfrepeating the same process over and over to go from point a to point b i blinked through the front gate of graceland took a couple more hops trying to find the right spot by this big greek templelooking mausoleum and arrived in a baseball players slide at the gaping hole in the ground my incorporeal body slid neatly over the white snow that ran right up to the edge of the grave and i dropped into the cool shady trench that had been prepared for me sunlight washed over the world above a few heartbeats later i heard it felt it the way i had once felt a minor earthquake through the soles of my shoes in washington state there was a harsh clear silvery note that hung in the air for a moment like the aftertone of an enormous chime i closed my eyes and scrunched up against the side of the grave that felt most likely to let me avoid obliteration i waited for several seconds nothing happened it was dim and cool and quiet in my grave it was really quite restful i mean you see things on television and in movies about someone lying in a coffin or in a grave and its always this hideous terrifying experience id been to my grave before and it had disturbed me every time i guess maybe i was past all that death is only frightening from the near side i sat back against the wall of my grave stretching my legs out ahead of me leaning my head back against it and closed my eyes there was no sound but for a bit of wind in the cemeterys trees and the muted ambient music of the living breathing city cars horns distant music sirens trains construction a few birds that called graceland home i couldnt remember the last time id felt so peaceful content and free free to do nothing free to rest free to turn away from horrible black things in my memory to let go of burdens for a while i left my eyes closed for a time and let the contentment and the quiet fill me youre new said a quiet calm voice i opened my eyes vaguely annoyed that my rest had been interrupted after only a few momentsand looked up at a sky with only a hint of blue still in it violet twilight was coming on with the night i sat up away from the wall of my grave startled what the hell id been resting for only a minute or two hadnt i i blinked up at the sky several times and pushed myself slowly to my feet i felt heavy and it was harder to rise than it should have been as if id been covered in wet heavy blankets or one of those leadlined aprons they use around xray machines i always like seeing new things being born said the voicea childs voice you can guess what theyre going to become and then watch and see if it happens my grave was about six feet deep im considerably over six feet tall as i stood my eyes were a few inches above the top of half a foot of snow that covered the ground at that spot so it wasnt hard to see the little girl she might have been six years old and looked small even for her age she wore a nineteenthcentury outfit an almost ridiculously frilly ornate dress for a child who would probably have it splattered with dirt or food within the hour her shoes looked handmade and had little buckles on them over one shoulder she was carrying a tiny lacy parasol that matched her dress she was prettylike most childrenand had blond hair and bright green eyes hi i said hello she said with a little shirley temple curtsy it is a pleasure to meet you the late mr harry dresden i decided to be careful what were the odds she was really a little girl as she appeared how did you know my name she folded the little parasol closed and tapped it against the headstone it was made of white marble letters had been inscribed upon it in gold or at least something goldlike and it still gleamed despite about a decade of exposure it had a pentacle inscribed beneath its simple legend here lies harry dresden beneath the pentacle it continued he died doing the right thing for a moment there was a strange sweet taste in my mouth and the scent of pine needles and fresh greenery filled my nose a frisson rippled up and down my spine and i shivered then the taste and scent were both gone do you know me she asked im famous i squinted at her for a moment then i made an effort of will and vanished from the bottom of the grave reappearing beside the child i was facing the wrong direction again and i sighed as i turned to face her and then glanced around me in graceland theres a statue of a small girl a child known as inez its been there for going on two centuries and every few years stories circulate about how the statue will go missingand how visitors to the graveyard have reported encounters with a little girl in a period dress the statue was gone from its case youre inez i said famous ghost of graceland the little girl laughed and clapped her hands i have been called so i heard they debunked you a couple of years ago that the statue was just there as advertising for some sculptor or something she opened the parasol again and put it over a shoulder spinning it idly goodness people confused about things that happened hundreds of years before they were born who would have imagined she looked me up and down and said i like your coat thank you i said i like your parasol she beamed youre so courteous sometimes i think i shall never again meet anyone who is properly polite she looked at me intently and then said i think you shall beshe pursed her lips narrowed her eyes and nodded slowlya monster i frowned what all newborn things become something said inez im not a newborn but you are she said she nodded down at my grave you have entered a new world your old life is no more you cannot be a part of it any longer the wide universe stretches before you she looked around the cemetery calmly i have seen many many newborns mr dresden and i can see what they are going to become you young shade are quite simply a monster am not i said not at the moment perhaps she said but as time goes by as those you care about grow old and pass on as you stand helpless while greater events unfold you will be patience youre wrong her dimples deepened why are you so upset young shade i really dont see anything wrong with being a monster i do i said the monster part oh the girl said shaking her head dont be so simple people adore monsters they fill their songs and stories with them they define themselves in relation to them do you know what a monster is young shade power power and choice monsters make choices monsters shape the world monsters force us to become stronger smarter better they sift the weak from the strong and provide a forge for the steeling of souls even as we curse monsters we admire them seek to become them in some ways her eyes became distant there are far far worse things to be than a monster monsters hurt people i dont inez burst out in girlish giggles she turned in a circle parasol whirling and in a singsong voice said harry dresden hung upon a tree afraid to embrace his destiny she looked me up and down again her eyes dancing and nodded firmly monster theyll write books about you i opened my mouth but no words came out i didnt know what to say this little world is so small she continued so dull so dreary she gave me a warm smile you arent shackled here mr dresden why remain i shivered a cold feeling swelled up in the pit of my stomach it began to spread i said nothing ahh inez murmureda sound of satisfaction her eyes went to my gravestone and she tilted her head to one side did you she asked brightly i shook my head did i what did you die doing the right thing i thought about it for a moment and for a moment more then i said quietly i no i didnt she tilted her head the other way oh they had a little girl i said quietly it took me a moment to realize that i was speaking the words out loud and not just hearing them in my head they were going to hurt her and i pulled out all the stops to get her back i i suddenly felt sick again my mind flashed back to the image of susans death as her body fought to change into a monstrous form locking her away forever as a prisoner of her own blood thirst i felt her feverhot skin beneath my lips where i had kissed her forehead and i felt her blood spray as i cut her throat triggering the spell that wiped out every murdering red court son of a bitch on the same planet with my little girl it had been the only way i had no choice didnt i maybe not at that point but it was the choices id made up until that moment that had shaped the event i could have done things differently it might have changed everything it might have saved susans life i shuddered as another memory struck me complete lifeless numbness in my legs aching pains of the body the helpless fury id felt when i realized that a fall from a ladder had broken my spinethat i was paralyzed and helpless to do anything for my daughter i remembered realizing that i was going to have to do something i would never have considered before that point i crossed a line i said quietly lines plural i did things i shouldnt have done it wasnt right and i knew it but i wanted to help the little girl and i sinned she suggested her large eyes eerily serene chose the lefthand path fell from grace cast the world into madness whatever i said and you think you arent a monster calmly she folded the parasol again and trailed its tip in the snow humming a quiet little song that cold sick feeling swelled and began to spread even more i found myself shivering dear god she was right she was exactly right i hadnt meant any of it to hurt anyone but did that really matter i had made a decision to do something i knew was wrong i bargained my life away to queen mab promised her my service and loyalty though i knew that the darkness of the mantle of the winter knight would swallow me that my talents and strengths could be subsumed into wicked service for the queen of air and darkness my little girls life had been on the line when i made that choice when i had acquired power beyond the ken of most mortals i thought of the desperation in the eyes of fitz and his gang i thought of the petty malice of baldy and those like him of the violence in the streets how many other mens daughters had died because of my choice that thought that truth hit me like a landslide a flash of clarity and insight that erased every other thought the frantic and blurry activity of my recent efforts like it or not i had embraced the darkness the fact that i had died before i could have found myself used for destructive purposes meant nothing i had picked up a red lightsaber i had joined the brotherhood of evil mutants i had become what i always fought there was no denying it no chance to correct my mistake i suddenly wanted desperately to simply drop back into the grave and seek out the quiet and peace i had found there dammit but i wanted to rest i folded my arms and stared at inez my voice came out ragged and harsh you arent the ghost of a little girl her little face lit up with another smile if i am no ghost why do you look so haunted and then she was gone no sound no flash no nothing just gone if i were living then the headache i felt coming on would be typical of this kind of situation cryptic supernatural entities go with the territory in my line of work but man i hate it when they get in the last word an insufferable entity murmured a slow deep redolent basso voice behind me her soul is made of crooked lines i stiffened i hadnt sensed any kind of presence the way i had with inez and i knew exactly what could happen when you let someone sneak up behind you even though rule number one for dealing with supernatural beingsnever show fearis simple it sure as hell isnt easy i know the kinds of things that are out there i turned very calmly and slowly reminding myself that i didnt have a heart to pound wildly and that there wasnt really any sweat on my palms i didnt need to shiver from fear any more than i needed to shiver from cold my self apparently found its own assurances unreliable stupid self there was a tall and menacing figure floating in the air behind me maybe three feet off the ground it was swathed entirely in a rich cloak of patina its hood lifted creating an area of completely black shadow within you could see the dim suggestion of a face in the blackness it looked like the old images of the shadow who clouded the minds of men the cloak wavered and billowed slowly in a breeze with the approximate viscosity of a lava lamp um i said hi the figure drifted downward until its feet were resting atop the snow is this preferable arent we literal i said uh yes thats fine i peered at it youre eternal silence the statue on dexter gravess monument eternal silence just stood there in silence ill take that as a yes i said i guess you arent really just a local statue are you your assumption is correct eternal silence replied i nodded what do you want it drifted slowly closer the deep voiceand this guy made james earl jones sound like mickey mouserumbled out you must understand your path my path that before you that behind i sighed thats less than helpful it is more than necessary eternal silence said it is essential to survival survival i asked and i couldnt help myself i chuckled when youve faced off with enough grim reaper wannabes it gets kinda routine im already dead it said nothing okay i said after a minute survival of who it didnt answer for a long moment and i shook my head i began to think that i could probably spend all night talking to every lunatic spirit in this freaking place and never make sense of any of them and i didnt have all night to waste i had begun to focus my thoughts on another series of nightcrawler hops when that deep voice spokeand this time it wasnt something i heard it just resonated in my head in my thoughts a burst of pure meaning that slammed into my head as if inscribed on the front of a cruise missile everyone i staggered and clutched at my skull with my hands agh i stammered hells bells is it too much to ask you to turn down the volume unintentional mortal frailty insufficient understanding of vocalization preconsidered vocabulary exhausted i actually discorporated at this fullon assault of thought my freaking spirit body spread out into a giant puffy cloud of vaguely dresdencolored mist and it hurt i mean thats the only word i can think of that really applies it wasnt like any kind of pain id felt before and im a connoisseur when it comes to pain it wasnt pain of the body the way i had known it it was more like like the way your head feels when you hear or see an image or concept that flabbergasts you so hard that the only thing you can say about it is that is so wrong that times a million and not just in my head but full body it took a full minute for that feeling to fade and it was only then that i could see myself coming back together again dont explain i said almost desperately when i looked up to see eternal silence hovering a little closer to me dont that hurt it waited we have to keep this simple i stuttered thinking out loud or youre going to kill me again i pressed the heel of my hand against my forehead and said im going to ask yes or no questions i said for yes stay silent for no indicate otherwise agreed nothing eternal silence might not have even been there except that his cloak kept rolling and billowing lavalamp fashion is your cloak red the hood of the cloak twitched left and right once fantastic i muttered communication i mopped at my face with my hands and said okay when you say everyone are you talking like everyone i know twitch more than that silence um the whole city twitch whatmore silence so you mean like everyoneeveryone everyone the whole planet silence and me understanding my freaking path saves them silence twitch great i muttered next youll want me to take a pebble out of your hand twitch i wasnt being literal okay yeah you and i arent going to communicate well this way silence somehow emphatic i stopped and pondered for a moment then i said wait this is connected isnt it with what captain murphy sent me to do silence find my killer i asked him i dont get it how does finding my killer save the world the deep voice repeated earlier phrases you must understand your path it is more than necessary it is essential to survival theres a little irony in eternal silence being stuck on a looping sound bite i sighed a wraiths moan drifted into the air and i tensed looking around one of those raggedscarecrow shapes was rising from the earth of a grave like something being hauled up out of deep mud it moaned in mindless hunger its eyes vacant then there was another moan and another and another wraiths were coming up out of graves all around me i started breathing harder though i didnt need to yeah okay brilliant idea for a safe house harry its a freaking graveyard where else are ghosts going to be eternal silence only stared at me there was an amused quality to its silence i have to go i said is that all you had for me understand my path silence it lifted a greenshrouded limb in a gesture of farewell the first wraith finished with what was evidently its nightly routine of slogging out of the earth and moaning its empty eyes turned toward me and it began to drift my way immaterial toes dangling down through the snow screw this i said and vanished one two three hops and i was to the nearest brick wall of the cemetery i gritted my teeth and plunged into it and slammed my face into cold stone pain lanced through my nose and i snarled at my own stupidity dammit harry walls are built to keep things outbut walls around graveyards are built to keep things in id known that since i was a freaking kid i checked behind me the wraiths were drifting after me in a slow graceful horde adding members as they went they werent fast but there were dozens and dozens of them again i was reminded of documentaries id seen showing giant clouds of jellyfish i gritted my teeth and thought fast when walls are built they are intended as physical barriers as a result of that intention invested by dozens or scores of builders they took on a similar solidity when it came to the spiritual as well its why they held most ghosts inside graveyardsand it probably had something to do with the way a threshold formed around a home too but where human intention had created a barrier that same intention had also created an access point i turned and began vanishing in a line straight for the gates of the boneyard i dont know what i would have done if they had been closed shut gates and shut doors carry their own investment of intention just as the walls do but open gates are another matter entirely and the gates of graceland stood wideopen as i went through them i looked back at what seemed like a modestsized army of wraiths heading for the opening i had a lightbulb moment the gates of the cemetery were being left open and hordes of wraiths haunted the streets of chicago by night lately aha morty i said and now we know where theyre coming from someone someone alive was opening those gates at night that meant that we had a place to begin a trail we could attempt to follow to find out who was stirring up the citys spooks to use against mortyand why i had information i had something to trade mort for his ongoing help i suddenly felt like an investigator again hot diggity dog i said grinning the games afreakingfoot chapter fifteen i revved up the memory and started jumping it was a quick way to travel in the citythe ability to go over buildings and ignore traffic signals oneway streets and cars was a real plus it didnt take me long to get to mortimers house it was on fire there were fire trucks there lights blazing the firemen were moving quickly professionally but though the house was well ablaze they had only one hose up and running as i stood there staring two more started up but i knew it was a lost cause mortys place was burning even more swiftly and brightly than mine had or maybe the dark was just making it look that way a cop or two showed up as the firemen kept the blaze from spreading to the houses around itnot hard given the snow on the ground blue lights from the bubbles on the cop cars joined the red and yellow of the cfd people stood around watching the firein my experience they often do of course they didnt usually do it out in the cold and they didnt usually do it in six inches of snow and they tended to wander off when the fire began to subside and talk and blink and their clothing is generally from the current century the crowd of onlooking chicago civilians were ghosts i walked among them looking at faces they were much like any other group of folks apart from the period outfits i recognized a few from sir stuarts homedefense brigadebut only a few and they were the more recent shades the rest were just people men women and children a boy maybe ten years old was the only shade who seemed to notice me beside him stood a girl who must have been about seven when she died they were holding hands he looked up at me as i passed by and i stopped to stare down at him where do we go now he asked i dont know another place to go um i said i dont know either hey did you see what happened it came back again tonight then men came with fire they burned the house they took the little man away i stiffened the grey ghost took mort no men took him the boy said the girl said in a soft little voice we used to play with other children by the river but he brought us here he was always nice to us her facial expression never changed it was flat empty the boy sighed touched the little girls shoulder and turned back to stare at the dwindling flames i stood there watching them for a moment and could see them growing more visibly transparent i checked the other shades it was happening to them too to a greater or lesser degree hey i said to the boy do you know sir stuart the big man the soldier the boy said nodding hes in the garden behind the house thank you i said and went to look vanishing to the side of morts house and then jumping again to the garden morts backyard was like his frontsculpted carefully maintained decorated with japanese sensibilities spare and elegant there was what looked like a koi pond now filled with snow there were trees and more of the little bonsai pieces delicate and somehow vulnerable the fire had been close enough and hot enough to melt any coating of snow from their little branches what was left of sir stuart lay in a circle in the snow theyd used fire a perfect circle was melted in the show out toward the back of the yard theyd used gasoline it looked likethe snow was melted down all the way to the scorched grass alcohol burns about three times as hot as gas and faster and it melts the snow fast enough for water to drown the flame someone had used the fire as part of a circle trappretty standard for dealing with spirits and other heavily supernatural entities once trapped in a circle a spirit was effectively helpless unable to leave and unable to exercise power through its barrier the devilish part of the trap was the fire fires real even to spirits and brings pain to the immaterial as fast as it does to fleshandblood creatures thats one huge reason i always used fire in my mortal career fire burns period even practically invulnerable things dont like dealing with fire there was maybe half of sir stuart left most of his upper body was there and part of his right arm his legs were mostly gone there wasnt any blood what was left of him looked like a roll of papers rescued from a fire the edges were blackened and crumbling slowly away the horrible part was that i knew he was still alive or what passed for being alive among ghosts otherwise he would simply be gone did he feel pain i knew that if i were in his condition i would sure maybe i knew that there was no spoon but when it came down to it i wasnt sure i could deny that much apparent reality or maybe the memory of pain wasnt an issue maybe the weird form of pain eternal silence had showed me had some sort of spiritual analogue or maybe fire being fire he was just in very real very familiar agony i shuddered not that i could do anything about it the circle that trapped him would keep me out as easily as it kept him in in theory i could take it down but only if i could physically move something across it to break its continuity i looked around quickly and spotted a twig standing out of the snow a few feet away all i would need to do was move it about three feet it was like trying to eat broth with a fork i just couldnt get hold of the stick my hand went through it time and time again no matter what i tried i couldnt even get the damned thing to wiggle i wasnt ghost enough to help sir stuart not like that anyway sir stuart i asked quietly i could see only one of his eyes it half opened hmmmm i squatted down on my heels next to the circle its harry dresden dresden he slurred and his mouth turned up in a faint smile pardon me if i dont rise perhaps it was something i ate of course i said what happened i was a fool he said our attacker came at the same time every night i made the mistake of assuming that was true because it was as soon as the attacker could assemble his forces the grey ghost i said sir stuart grunted arrived at dusk sooner than i would have dared the open air no mob of spirits this time it came with half a dozen mortals and they set the house on fire i was able to get mortimer out of the house in time but theyd set a trap for me in the backyard one hand gestured at the circle within which he lay he was taken at the command of the grey ghost i frowned these mortals they could hear the grey ghost aye sir stuart said stars and stones i growled i could barely get two people in chicago to hear me this joker has half a dozen how sir stuart shook his head faintly would that i knew well find morty i said let me figure out how to get you out of there and then well go find him he opened his eyes fully and focused on me for the first time no he said in a gentle voice i wont come on i said dont talk like that well get you patched up sir stuart let out a small laugh nay wizard too much of me has been lost ive only held together this long so that i could speak to you what happened to our world being mutable in time with our expectations isnt that still true to a degree sir stuart said affably weakly ive been injured before small hurts are restored simply enough he gestured at his broken body but this ill be like the others when i restore myself the others the warriors who defended mortimers home he said they faded over time forgetting little by little about their mortal lives i thought about the soldiers id seen battling the enemy shades and wraithssilent severe seemingly disconnected from the world around them theyd fought loyally and ably enough but i was willing to bet that they couldnt remember why they did so or who they were fighting i imagined sir stuart like the rest of thema translucent outline his empty eyes focused on something else entirely always faithful always silent i shivered it could happen to me too listen to me boy sir stuart said we didnt trust you we assumed you were mixed up in whatever it is the grey ghost wanted like hell i said you dont know that sir stuart said flatly for all we knew you could have been directed by that creature without your own knowledge for that matter you dont have the feel of a normal ghost it could have created you whole from the spirit world i scowled and began to argueand couldnt ive been faced with the odd and unusual and had drawn incorrect conclusions too many times when people are scared they dont think straight mort had been terrified do you still think that i asked no reason for you to be here if you were sir stuart said the worst has happened were you a plant you would not have come though i suppose you might still be a dupe thanks i said wryly he softened the words with another smile but dupe or not it may be that ye can help mortimer and it is critical that you do so without his influence this city will be in terrible danger yeah you arent exactly increasing the tension by telling me that i said were already sort of playing for maximum stakes i know not what you mean sir stuart replied but i tell you this those shades standing around the house one and all are murderers i blinked and looked back at the stillsmoldering house and at the enormous circle of spirits around it each and every one of them sir stuart said mortimer gave them something they needed to turn aside from their madness a home if you do not restore him to freedom so that he may care for these poor souls they will kill again as sure as the sun rises they wont be able to help themselves he exhaled wearily and closed his eyes fifty years of maddened shades unleashed upon the city all at once preying on mortals blood will run in buckets i stared at him for a moment then i said how am i supposed to do that ive not the foggiest sir stuart replied he fumbled at his belt and drew that monster pistol he paused for a moment grimacing then he tossed it weakly at my feet it tumbled through the circle with a flicker of energies and landed atop the snow without sinking into itthe apparition of a weapon i stared for a second a spirit couldnt project its power across a circleand i was sure that power was exactly what the gun represented so if it had crossed the circles barrier it meant that it was power that no longer belonged to sir stuart on several levels what he had just done was a violent act of selfmutilationlike chopping off your own hand he gestured weakly toward the gun and said take it i picked it up gingerly it weighed a ton what am i going to do with this help mortimer he replied his shape began to flicker and fade at the edges im sorry that i couldnt do more couldnt teach you more he opened his eyes again and leaned toward me his expression intent memories dresden theyre power theyre weapons make from your memory a weapon against them his voice lost its strength and his eyes sagged closed three centuries of playing guardian but ive failed my trust redeem my promise please help mortimer yes i said quietly i will that faint smile appeared again and sir stuart nodded once then he let out his breath in a sigh he faded even more and as i watched his limbs simply renewed themselves appearing as his shape became more translucent the damage reversed itself before my eyes a moment later he sat up he looked around his gaze passing right through me then he paused and stared at the ruined house his brow furrowed in puzzled concentrationan expression mirrored on the faces of most of the spirits present sir stuart was nowhere to be seen in the shades hollow eyes i bowed my head and clenched my teeth cursing i had liked the guy just like i had liked morty whatever insults i may have offered him i was angry about what had happened to him and i was angry about the position he had put me in now i was the one responsible for somehow finding and helping morty when i could barely communicate with anyone without him all while the bad guy whatever the hell it was apparently got to chat it up with its own flunkies at will i couldnt touch anything i couldnt make anything happen my magic was gone and now not only was i to track down my own murderer but i had to rescue mort lindquist as well fabulous maybe i should make it my new slogan harry dresdeni take responsibility for more impossible situations in the first twentyfour hours of being dead than most people do all day more snow was beginning to fall eventually it would break the circle that had trapped what was left of sir stuart though i didnt know where he would go to take shelter from the sunrise maybe he would just know the way i had seemed tosome kind of postdeath survival instinct or maybe he wouldnt either way it didnt seem like there was much i could do about it and i hated that fact with a burning passion sir stuart and the other spirits needed morty lindquist before i died i might have been harry dresden wizard at large now i was harry dresden immaterial messenger boy persuader and wheedler i desperately wanted to blow something into tiny tiny piecesand then disintegrate the pieces all things considered it was probably not the best frame of mind in which to handle a confrontation in a rational diplomatic manner ah said a whispery oily voice behind me she was right the tall one returns look at him said another voice higherpitched and inhuman he will make such a meal our orders are orders said a third voice filled with scorn she is not here we shall share him the three of us and none shall be the wiser agreed said the second voice eagerly after a pause the first voice said agreed i turned and saw three of the darkrobed forms from the night before during the attack on casa lindquist lemurs their clothing stirred with lazy aquatic fluidity at the touch of an immaterial wind from this close i could see the faint images of pale faces inside their hoods and the sheen of gleaming hungry eyes take him said the first lemur and three of the hungriest old ghosts of chicago blurred toward the new guy chapter sixteen the lemurs pounced and i vanished straight up i stood in empty air a hundred feet above them furious and called down you mooks picked a really lousy time to start up with me hooded heads searched upward but i was an indistinct shape in a darkened sky already blurred by snow while they were sharp outlines against a field of white i started throwing a punch vanished again and reappeared right behind lemur number one my fist drove into the base of his neck just as i shouted bamf there isnt much honor in a rabbit punch but its a pretty darned good way to down an opponent whatever rules governed the world of spirit there must have been some kind of analogue to a human nervous system the lemur let out a choking gasp and fell to the ground as the other two panicked at the sudden assault and vanished i kicked the downed guy in the head and neck a few times to help him on his way to analogueconcussion land screaming in pure and incoherent rage all the while i had a fraction of a seconds warning a cold breath on the back of my neck a rippling wave of ethereal pressure against my back i vanished to reappear five feet behind my original positionand this time i meant to be facing the same way when i arrived i got there in time to see one of the other lemurs swing a freaking hatchet at the space my skull had recently vacated he stumbled off balance from the miss and i kicked his assliterally i leaned my upper body back a bit and pretended i was using my heel to stomp an aluminum can flat its a powerful kick especially with my full body weight behind it and the lemur flew forward and into the snow whos the man i screamed at the sprawled lemurs fear and anger and excitement pitching my voice about an octave higher than usual whos the man the hood had fallen from the face of the second and an unremarkable man of middle age goggled at me in complete incomprehensionwhich made sense who knew how many decades of pop culture the lemurs had missed out on theyd probably never even heard of will smith i am completely unappreciated in my time i muttered i am also apparently no wizard when it comes to simple mathematics while i was will smithing lemur number three appeared out of nowhere and smashed a baseball bat against the side of my neck the pain was something incrediblemore than merely the reaction of physical trauma that i would have expected from such a blow it also encompassed an almost olympian sense of nausea combined with a forcefive storm of whirling confusion i felt myself note idly that i guessed egos literally could be bruised it took me another second or two after that to realize that i was floating drifting sideways and slightly upward my body at a fortyfivedegree diagonal to the ground there was a roaring sound in my head an eerie cry of triumph and hunger pealed through the night then the lemurs came for me i felt bitterly cold fingers seize me clamping down like steel claws i was hauled out to horizontal by frigid steely hands i was still disorientedi was barely able to turn my head enough to see the third lemur approach her hood had fallen back she was a young woman of unexceptional appearance neither beautiful nor displeasing her eyes though were dark and hollow and a hideous emptiness lay behind them she stared intently at me for a long beat her body quivering in some kind of dark rapture then she let out a slow hiss sank her fingers into the flesh of my left biceps and ripped off a handful of meat ectoplasmic blood flew my blood it scattered through the air in lazy globules that once they were a few feet from me fell like raindrops to the surface of the snow it hurt i screamed all three lemurs screamed with me as if triggered into a response by my own cries the female lemur lifted the gobbet of flesh aloft in triumph then held it over her open mouth and squeezed more blood pattered out onto her lips and tongue and she let out a gasp of unadulterated ecstasy before shoving the raw flesh into her mouth as though she hadnt eaten in weeks her eyes rolled back into her head she shuddered oh she breathed pain hes felt so much pain and rage and joy oh this one lived here said the second lemur come take his legs my turn the female bared her bloodied teeth at him and tore another smaller piece from my arm she snapped it up and then leaned on my legs pinning them the second lemur looked me over like a man perusing a side of beef then he ripped a handful of flesh from my right thigh it went like that for several minutes with the three of them taking turns ripping meat from my body i wont bore you with the details i dont like to think about it they were stronger than me better than me more experienced than me when it came to spiritual conflict they got me the monsters got me and it hurt until footsteps crunched toward us through the snow the lemurs never took notice i was in too much agony to care very much but i wasnt exactly busy either i looked up and saw a lone figure slogging my way through the thick snow he wasnt very big and he was dressed in a white parka and white ski pants with one of those ninja capmask things also white covering his face in his right hand he carried a big oldstyle heavy portable spotlight the kind with a plastic carrying handle on top its twin incandescent bulbs shone a garish orange over the snow i sniggered to myself he was a person he sank into the snow with every step he wouldnt be able to see what was happening right in front of him no wonder the lemurs paid him no mind but ten feet away from me he abruptly froze in his tracks and blurted holy crap he reached up and ripped off the ninja hood revealing the thin fine features of a man of somewhere near forty his hair was dark curly and mussed from the hood he had glasses perched askew on his beak of a nose and his dark eyes were wide with shock harry i stared at him and said through the blood butters stop them butters hissed save him i release you for this task on it sahib shouted another voice a cloud of campfire sparks poured out of the two sources of light in the spotlight rushing out by the millions and congealed into a massive manlike shape it let out a lions roar and blurred toward the lemurs two of them were sharp enough to realize something dangerous was coming and they promptly vanished the third the young woman was in the middle of another biteand she didnt look up until it was too late the light form hit the lemur and simply disintegrated it as i watched skin and clothing and flesh were ripped away from the evil spirit as swiftly and savagely as if peeled off with a sandblaster a heartbeat later there was nothing left but a gently drifting cloud of sparks speckled here and there with the floating shapes of somewhat larger prismatic gemstones the light being looked up and then promptly split into two parts each one becoming a comet that hurtled into the night sky there was an explosion almost at onceand the raining bits and pieces of a second lemur came drifting lazily down through the night air along with more multicolored gems there was a terrible howling sound in the night sky above i heard the flap of heavy robes snapping with rapid motion the second comet of light darted back and forth evidently engaged in some kind of aerial combat and then lemur and comet both came hurtling back down they struck earth with a thunder that shook the ground while leaving the snow untouched the orange lights flowed together into a manlike shape again this time straddling the lemurs prone form the being of light rained blows down on the lemurs head over and over striking with the speed and power of a motors pistons within ten or twelve seconds the head of the lemur had been crushed into ectoplasmic guck and his sparkles of lighthis memoriesand the same odd tiny gems began to well up from his broken form the light being rose from the form of the fallen lemur and scanned the area around us his featureless face turning in a slow alert scan what the hell butters said his eyes wide i mean what the hell was that man relax sahib said a young mans voice it was coming from the fiery figure which nodded and made handdusting motions of unmistakable satisfaction just taking out the trash scum like that are all over these old mortal cities part of the posthuman condition you might say i just watched i didnt feel like doing anything else yeah yeah butters said but hes safe now for now the being said and as far as i know butters crunched through the snow and stared down at me the little guy was one of chicagos small number of medical examiners a forensic investigator who analyzed corpses and found out all sorts of details about them a few years ago hed analyzed corpses of vampires that had burned to death in a big fire someone started hed asserted that they obviously were not human hed been packed off to an institution for half a year in response now he treaded carefully in his careeror at least he had when i was last alive is it really him butters asked the being of light scanned me with unseen eyes i cant spot anything that would suggest he was anything else he said cautiously which aint the same as saying its harrys ghost it has more something than other ghosts ive encountered butters frowned more what something the being said meaning im not sure what something im not expert in clearly the uh the ghost butters said its hurt quite severely the being said but its easily mendedif you wish to do it butters blinked at him what yes yes of course i wish it very good sahib the being said and then it whipped and darted through the night air gathering up all the floating glittering gems from the vanishing remains of the lemurs it brought them together into a single mass and then knelt down next to my head bob i said quietly bob the skull formerly my personal assistant and confidant hesitated beside me as i said his name once again i became aware of his intense regard but if he saw anything it didnt register on his featureless face harry he said open up you need to restore these memories to your essence restore what i asked eat em bob said firmly open your mouth i was tired and confused so it was easier to just do as he said i closed my eyes as he dropped the mass of gems into my open mouth but instead of feeling hard gems fresh cool water flowed into my mouth swirling over my parched tongue and throat as i eagerly swallowed it down pain vanished instantly the disorientation began to fade and disappear my confusion and weariness followed those others within a moment and a deep breath later i was sitting up in place feeling more or less as sane and together as i had been when i had woken up that evening bob offered me a hand and i took it he pulled me to my feet as if id weighed less than nothing well he said at least you dont seem to be a bad copy i was halfafraid youd be some kind of demented winter knight wannabe with an eye patch and a goatee or something um i said thank you de nada bob said bob butters said in a firm voice youve fulfilled your task bob the skull sighed and turned to bow in a florid gesture of courtesy toward butters before dissolving into a cloud of orange sparks again and flowing back toward the flashlight i saw then that the spotlight casing hadnt contained lightbulbs and batteries and suchjust bobs skull a humanbone artifact of a longdead enchanter who had built it as a haven that could harbor the essence of a spiritual being hey bob i said could you relay my voice to butters dont have to former boss bob said cheerfully on account of the fact that butters is a whole heck of a lot more talented at magical theory than you i frowned what oh he doesnt have a lick of magical talent bob assured me but hes got a brain which lets face it hasnt always been your most salient feature bob butters said in a scolding tone then he fumbled in his parkas pocket and produced a small old radio here see i had bob go over your notes from the nightmare case harry bob said you created a radio that he could communicate through so i refrained from hitting my own head with the heel of my hand but just barely so it wasnt much of a trick to turn it into a baby monitor you just needed an old crystal radio butters listened with his head tilted toward the radio and nodded i explained the concept to molly this morning and she put it together in an hour he waved the spotlight housing bobs skull and i can see spooks by the light of the spirits form so i can see and hear you hi i stared at the skinny man and didnt know if i wanted to break out into laughter or wild sobs butters you you figured this all out on your own well no i mean i had a tutor he bobbled the spotlight meaningfully ack dont make me puke bob warned him you wont like me when i puke hush bob said butters and i in exactly the same tone at exactly the same time we both turned to eye each other for a moment he might have tucked the skull close to his side in a protective gesture of possession you shouldnt stay here with all the official types around i said just thinking the same thing butters said come with me sure i said uh where headquarters he said from butterss other pocket there was a hiss and a squawk from what proved to be a longrange walkietalkie he picked it up looked at something on its little display and said eyes here weve got nothing at his old place said murphys tired voice what about you eyes hes standing right here talking to me butters said and not without a trace of pride it looked good on him outstanding eyes murphy said her voice brightening with genuine pleasure im sending you some shadows bring him in right away wilco butters said out he put the radio away beaming to himself eyes i asked him daniel kind of gave me the nickname he said they kept putting me on watch and he wanted to know why they kept making the foureyed guy our lookout it stuck as my handle except we have six eyes bob the skull said i tried to get him to get me a pair of glasses and then wed have eight like spiders i nodded suddenly understanding you still work for the morgue butters smiled there are plenty of people listening to our transmissions murphy wouldnt let me use my name murphy is smart i said extremely butters said nodding agreement she gave bob to you she did he said you being dead and all she wanted to keep it needtoknow it doesnt upset me i said even though it sort of did i entrusted those things to her judgment oh hey great segue speaking of judgment youd better come with me i can do that i said and fell into pace beside him where are we going the batcave he said headquarters headquarters of what i asked he blinked at me the alliance of course the chicago alliance i lifted my eyebrows what chicago alliance the one he organized to help defend the city from the fomor butters replied he i asked fomor what he he who im sorry harry he said he bit his lip and looked down i figured you knew marcone baron john marcone chapter seventeen i found stus pistol on the ground where id dropped it during the struggle then i followed butters to his caran old plymouth road runner it looked almost worse than my old vw beetle had the last time id seen it dents and dings covered its allsteel frame and some of them looked suspiciously like theyd been raked into the metal with a twopronged clawbut its engine throbbed with impressive harmonious power its license plates read meepmeep i kinda traded in my old one butters told me as i got in going straight through the door i didnt make any noise about the discomfort not in front of butters it would totally blow my ghostly cool for another old one i said my voice issued out of the radio he slipped into a clip attached to the cars sun visor i like steel better than fiberglass he said the fomor and the faeries are apparently related neither one of them likes the touch of any metal with iron in it bobs skull rested in a container that had been custom mounted on the road runners dasha wooden frame set on a plate that made the skull wobble back and forth like a bobblehead doll lot of interbreeding there bob said back in the old old old days before the sidhe wars i lifted my eyebrows i havent heard much about it crazy stuff bob said with tremendous enthusiasm even before my time but ive heard all kinds of stories the daoine sidhe the tuatha the fomor the tylwyth teg the shen epic alliances epic betrayals epic battles epic weddings epic sex epic sex i sputtered by what standards precisely is sex judged to be epic and tons and tons of mortal simps like you used as pawns bob sighed happily ignoring my question there are no words it was like the lord of the rings and all my children made a baby with the macho man randy savage and a whacamole machine butters sputtered at that image but i mean hells bells who wouldnt anyway he choked out a moment later the fomor have a lot of faerie blood in their makeup i like having detroit steel around me when i drive murphy said something about the fomor last night i said i take it theyve been moving in on the town his face grew more remote bigtime ive been busy he exhaled a slow breath um look man its really you whats left of me i said tiredly yeah he nodded um theres a problem with molly i saw i said you didnt see he said i mean i heard that murphy told you she was a couple bubbles off plumb last night but theres more than that like what i asked seventeen people murdered in the past three months he replied in a steady voice i didnt say anything for a couple of blocks then i said who scum he said candidly mostly a cop who was maybe raping a prostitute petty criminals muggers she doesnt even try to avoid being seen shes gone totally dark knight witnesses left and right have reported a tall woman dressed in layers and layers of ragged castoff clothing took the papers about two weeks to name her the rag lady people call her various versions to make fun to show her they arent afraid but a lot of people get killed in this town i said doesnt mean its molly harry butters stopped at a light and gave me a direct look ive examined twelve of the victims different manner of death for each of them but i found them all with a scrap of torn cloth stuffed in their mouths so i demanded i matched the cloth its the same as what was left of the clothes you wore to chichén itzá they had some of it in evidence when they investigated the scene of your your murder only someone got in there without being seen by anyone or any camera and took it right out memory flashed at me hard the silent stone ziggurats in the night the hiss and rasp of inhuman voices the stale reptilian scent of vampires my faerie godmother yes im serious i have one and she is freaking terrifying had transformed my clothes into protective armor that had probably saved my life half a dozen times that night without my even being aware of it when they had turned back into my coat my shirt and my jeans there had been little left of them but tatters and scraps sort of like me someone who had major issues with my death was killing people in my town could it be my apprentice she had a thing for me according to practically every woman i knew i didnt have a thing back yes she was gorgeous intelligent quickwitted brave thoughtful and competent but id known her when her bra had been a formality back when id begun working with her father one of the very few men in the world i hold in genuine respect there was darkness in molly id soulgazed her id seen it in more than one of her possible futures id felt it in the black magic she had worked with the best of intentions on fragile mortal minds but though shed fought tooth and nail at chichén itzá beside the rest of us she wasnt a killer not molly was she people could be driven to extremes by the right events the right stakes id bargained away my future and my soul when i had needed to do it to save my daughter and i was mollys teacher her mentor her example had she let herself be driven to extremes at my loss the way i had been to the potential loss of my daughter had she turned aside from everything id tried to teach her and let herself slide down into the violent exercise of power why shouldnt she have done so moron i heard my own voice say in the dark of my thoughts you showed her how it worked shes always been an able student worse molly was a sensitive a wizard whose supernatural senses were so acute that surges of powerful magic or the emotions that accompanied lifeanddeath situations were something that caused her psychic and physical pain it was something i had barely even considered when i dragged her along to chichén itzá with me for the largest most savage and deadliest brawl i had ever personally participated in had the pain of participating in the battle done something to my apprentice had it left her with permanent mental damage just as the gunshot wound shed received must have left her a permanent scar hell it didnt require any supernatural elements at all for warand that was what chichén itzá was make no mistaketo screw up young soldiers who found themselves struggling to stay alive throw in all the mystic menace on top of it and it started to seem a little bit miraculous that id gotten as far as i had while remaining mostly sane i didnt want to admit it or think about it but i couldnt deny that it was possible that my apprentice hadnt been as lucky as i had hey butters said quietly harry you all right thats kinda subjective all things considered i answered he nodded no one wanted to be the one to tell you the details but murphys pretty sure she says that if she was still working as a cop shed be convinced and digging as hard as she could to turn up enough evidence to let her put the perp away yeah i said quietly i get what she means by that i swallowed why hasnt she we need molly butters said shes made the difference between happily ever after and everyone dying in two raids against the fomor i rubbed my eyes okay its something ill start processing but im not saying that i believe it not until i talk to her about it see her reaction with my own eyes right butters said his voice gentle i eyed him murphy wouldnt want you telling me this he shrugged murphys not full all the way to the brim herself some days what shes been doing its been hard on her shes gotten more and more guarded i can imagine butters nodded but ive always been kind of a trustmyinstincts guy and i think you need to know this stuff thanks i said weve got some other problems too his tired worried face lifted into a sudden grin of course we do harry dresden is in town whats that i put sir stuarts pistol into the voluminous pocket of my duster and said a cannon someone gave it to me huh his voice turned casual could something like that hurt me i grinned and shook my head nah ghostonghost action only assuming im able to make it work in the first place the snow had stopped falling and butters turned off his windshield wipers whats it like what is what like being you know dead he shrugged a shoulder betraying his discomfort a ghost i thought about my answer for a moment everything in my body that used to hurt all the time got better i dont feel hungry or thirsty other than that it feels a lot like being alive except my magic is gone and you know hardly anyone can see me or hear me so so the world is the same he asked i shivered no its chockfull of all sorts of weird stuff you wouldnt believe how many ghosts are running around this place even as i spoke i turned my head to watch two wraiths glide down the sidewalk as the car passed them i frowned including one of you bob bob the skull snorted im not mortal i dont have a soul the only thing waiting for me when i cease to be is entropy i cant leave a ghost then how come i saw a floating skull with blue eyelights helping attack mort lindquists place last night the skull just stared for a moment then he suggested lamely you were high i snorted cant be many things like that running around i said what do you know i have to think about this bob said in a rushed tone and his orange eyelights winked out butters and i both stared at the skull huh butters said ive never seen anyone make him shut up before i grunted then i said quietly scared the hell out of me seeing that thought something had happened to him hes fine butters said best roommate i ever had im glad youre taking care of him i said he wouldnt do well alone its not a big deal right what isnt a big deal if theres an evil bob out there he said i mean itll just be another nerd like this one right only with a black hat the orange eyelights winked back on and bob said hey butters bob is spooky strong i said quietly knowledge is power man bob has a lot of it when i accidentally flipped his switch to black hat a few years ago he nearly killed me in the first sixty seconds butters blinked several times he tried to talk for a few seconds swallowed and then said in a small voice oh he eyed bob sideways i dont like to make a big thing of it sahib bob said easily not really my bag to do that kind of thing anyway i nodded he was created to be an assistant and counselor i said its unprofessional to treat him as anything else which sahib doesnt bob noted due to complete ignorance but he doesnt oh butters said again then he asked how do i make sure not to set him on black hat you cant bob said harry ordered me to forget that part of me and never to bring it out again so i lopped it off it was my turn to blink you what hey bob said you told me never to bring it out again you said never as long as i was with you that wouldnt be an issuebut the next guy could order me to do it and it would still happen so i made sure it couldnt happen again no big whoop dresden oy but you are such a little girl sometimes i blinked several more times oy my mother calls me twice a week butters explained he listens in shes right you know sahib bob said brightly if youd just do something with your hair and wear nicer clothes youd find a woman youre a doctor after all what woman doesnt want to marry a doctor did he just get a little yiddish accent i asked butters i get it twice a week already bob butters growled i dont need it from you too well you need it from somewhere bob said i mean look at your hair butters ground his teeth anyway harry bob began i know i said the thing i saw with the grey ghost must be the piece that you cut off right he said got it in one your offspring one might say the skull shuddered which added a lot of motion to the bobblehead thing if one was coming from a dementedly limited mortal viewpoint i guess so its a part of you but not all of you its less powerful bobs eyelights narrowed in thought maybe but the whole of any given being is not always equal to the sum of its parts case in point you you arent working with a lot of horsepower in the brains department yet you manage to get to the bottom of things sooner than most i gave the skull a flat look is it stronger than you or not i dont know bob said i dont know what it knows i dont know what it can do that was sort of the whole point in amputating it theres a big hole where it used to be i grunted how big bob rolled his eyes do you want me to tell you in archaic measurements or metric ballpark it um a hundred years worth of knowledge maybe damn i said quietly i knew that bob had once been owned by a necromancer named kemmler kemmler had fought the entire white council in an allout war twice they killed him seven times over the course of both wars but it didnt take until number seven generally remembered as the most powerful renegade wizard of the second millennium kemmler had at some point acquired a skull inhabited by a spirit of intellect which had served as his assistant eventually when kemmler was finally thrown down the skull had been smuggled away from the scene by a warden named justin dumornethe same justin who had adopted me and trained me to grow up into a monster and who had eventually decided i wasnt tractable enough and attempted to kill me it didnt go as he planned i killed him and burned down his house around his smoldering corpse instead and id taken the same skull hidden it away from the wardens and company and named it bob is that bad butters asked a bad guy had the skull for a while i said bigtime dark mojo so those memories bob lost are probably everything he learned serving as the assistant to a guy who was almost certainly the strongest wizard on the planetstrong enough to openly defy the white council for decades meaning he learned a lot there butters said probably bob said cheerfully but its probably limited to pretty much destructive poisonous dangerous stuff nothing important thats not important butters squeaked destroying things is easy bob said hell all you really have to do to destroy something is wait creation now thats hard bob would you be willing to take on evil bob bobs eyes darted nervously id prefer not to id really really prefer not to you have no idea that me was crazy and buff he worked out i sighed one more thing to worry about then and meanwhile i still dont know a damned thing about my murder butters brought the road runner to a stop and set the parking break you dont he said but we do were here come on chapter eighteen i gritted my teeth and got out of butterss car then paused to look at my surroundings the piled snow was deep and the mounds on either side of the street were like giantsized versions of the snow ramparts that appeared every year in the carpenters backyard they changed the outlines of everythingbut something was familiar i stopped and took at least half a minute to turn in a slow circle as i did i noticed a pair of fleeting shadows moving easily over the snowwolves murphys comment about sending shadows to escort butters home made more sense in context i watched one of the wolves vanish into the darkness between a pair of halffamiliar pines and only then did i recognize where we stood by then butters had taken bob from his holder in the car and was carrying him in the handheld spotlight case again he shone the light around for a moment until he spotted me then asked harry this is my house i said after a moment i mean where my house was things had changed a new building had been put up where my old boardinghousemy homehad been the new place was four stories tall and oddly cubical in appearance the walls fell even farther out onto the lawn than those in the old building had encasing it in a strip of yard only slightly wider than my stride i moved close enough to touch the wall and pushed my hand inside it hurt but the hurt never varied as i pushed in farther this was no facade it was made of stone im not kidding freaking stone basalt maybe im no stonemason it was dark grey with veins and threads of green and silver running through it but i could only see them from up close the windows were narrowmaybe nine inches wideand deep there were bars on the outside i could see more bars on the inside and there was at least a foot between them the roof was lined with a staggered row of blocksreal bygod crenellation as the pièce de résistance gargoyles crouched at the corners and at the midpoint of each wall starting up at the second floor and moving in three rows of increasingly ugly statuary toward the roof someone had turned the ruin of my home into a freaking fortress a plaque hung over what had to be the main entrance it read simply brighter future society butters followed my gaze to the plaque ah he said yeah we named it that because if we didnt do something there wasnt going to be much of a future for this town i wanted brighter future group actually for the initialism but i got voted down hells bells i said i did some math to build on the ruins of the boardinghouse construction would have had to start practically the same day that i died actual stone is expensive to build with because its difficult and timeconsuming this place was as big as a small castle it should have taken months and months and months to build it had gone up in six probably significantly less given the weather this place cost a damned fortune meh butters said and walked to the front door hang around a bit and youll take it for granted like the rest of us he entered a sequence of numbers on the keypad beside the door they made a little mechanical clicking sound that reminded me of a manual typewriter he put his hands back into his pockets and waited a moment later a heavily accented basso voice emerged from a crackling speaker box who goes there butters he said with dresdens shade hi sven the speaker made a rumbling sound waldo it said pronouncing it valdo the night is dangerous one day you will stumble across a fox and it will eat you roars of laughter erupted from the speakersevidently several other men were with the door guard butters didnt laugh but he did grin ill just get stuck in his throat until you can haul your walrus ass over to him and save me sven louder laughter erupted from the speaker and a voice halfchoked with it said something in a language that had come from somewhere in northern europe there was a click and butters opened the door i started to follow him inand remembered in time to put my hand out and check the doorway first my hand moved smoothly past the twelve inches of stone but then hit something as solid as a brick wall where the doorway opened up into the entry hall uh butters i said he smacked the heel of his hand against his forehead right sorry please come in the invisible wall vanished and i shook my head its got a threshold people live here bunch of em butters confirmed and we went inside lot of paranetters come through for a little while when they dont have a safe place to sleep uh visiting netters who are passing through town venatori when they meet with us that kind of thing i felt anger stirring in me irrational but no less real my home is a supernatural flophouse and armory and jail bob said enthusiastically ghosts can sputter in outrage jail and day care bob continued i stopped in my tracks and threw my hands up day care day care people have kids man and they have jobs butters said in a gentle voice the fomor arent above using children to get what they want highrisk kids come here on workdays now shut up bob and get off your high horse harry people need this place i turned my gaze to butters and studied him for a minute the little guy had come a long way from the somewhat timid insecure man id first met years before that butters would never have said anything like that to me or maybe he was the same guy butters went right to the wall for the sake of the truth even when it cost him his job and got him locked up in a nuthouse he was a man of principles and he was probably right this wasnt my home anymore we passed the guard station after we got buzzed through a security gate four of the biggest toughestlooking men id ever seen were stationed there they wore biker leathersand swords their muscles swelled tight against their skin their beards bristled and their uniformly pale eyes watched us pass with calm attention einherjaren butters said quietly soldiers of valhalla if theyre telling the truth they are i replied just as quietly where did we get them marcone they arent cheap him again butters shrugged i dont like the guy either harry but hes smart enough to realize that if the fomor take control of the streets theyre going to get rid of him as a matter of course too simple i said too easy hes running some kind of game on you we went through another door and then up some stairs which opened onto the second floor the place was one enormous chamber almost entirely free of interior walls there was a small gym complete with shower rooms and a boxing ring inside the ring murphy wearing her street clothes stood facing a man who had inherited a portion of his dna from a rhinocerosand not many generations ago he was huge and heavily muscled his dark hair and beard in long braids he wore an old pair of jeans and nothing else his upper body was coated with more dark hair not like a werewolf or circus freak or anything just at the top end of the hirsute bell curve a real hair ball butters froze in place waiting murphy stared steadily at the big man for several moments her body relaxed her eyes never blinking he returned a blank stare of his own then they both moved i couldnt tell who went first but murphys fist streaked toward the big guys groin he twisted his hip deflecting the blow and when he returned it to balance his leg scythed up in an arc that clipped the tip of murphys chin she spun away and went down hair ball did not hesitate for so much as a second he moved toward her fast for someone so large and stomped his heel down toward her head murphy rolled and dodged the blow but he followed up and she had to keep rolling to stay ahead of his sledgehammer heels she hit the edge of the boxing ring then abruptly reversed her roll moving toward him instead of away she slipped the next stomp scissored his knee with her legs twisted her whole body and brought him down hair ball fell like a tree huge and slow the boxing ring ropes shook when he landed murphy came up onto all fours scrambled a bit to one side and then swept her foot at hair balls head he dodged but her kick shifted direction her leg moving up then straight down bringing her heel down like a hatchet onto the hand hair ball was using to support his weight bones snapped hair ball howled scrambled to his feet and started swinging wildly at her murphy dodged and slipped one blow after another and at one point abruptly turned and drove her heel into hair balls solar plexus the blow rocked him back a step but murphy followed it too closely too recklessly hair ball recovered from the kick almost instantly slapped a blow aside and seized her arm he turned and flung her onehanded over the top rope of the ring and into the nearest wall she hit it with a yell and bounced off onto the floor dead i snarled my fists clenched i started forward and took three or four whole steps before i realized that i wasnt going to be able to hit the guy or blow him up or send him on a vacation to another reality hell i couldnt even sneak up on him and shout boo harry wait butters hissed its okay murphy picked herself up from the floor moving slowly as she did the giant hair ball came over to the nearest side of the ring holding his right hand in his left murphy brushed some dust from her clothing and turned to face him her blue eyes were steady and cold her mouth set in a small smile her teeth were white and rich red blood quivered on her lower lip where the impact had split it open she wiped the blood off on her sleeve without looking away from hair ball three she asked broke all four he said moving his right hand a little by way of demonstration took out my best sword hand good if you hadnt gotten greedy for the kill maybe youd have taken this round murphy snorted youve been drinking bad mead skaldi skjeldson that made hair ball smile sword tomorrow murphy nodded the two of them stared at each other for a moment as if each expected the other to suddenly charge the second the other turned his back then with no detectable signal passing between them they simultaneously nodded again and turned away from each other relaxing butters rumbled skaldi hair ball if he really had broken fingers it didnt look like they were bothering him much when are you going to get in this ring and train like a man about five minutes after i get a functional lightsaber butters replied easily much to hair balls amusement then the little medical examiner nodded to murphy and said can we talk in the conference room sure she said she walked by the ring and bumped left fists with skaldi then she led butters and me out of the gym down another hallway and into a long narrow conference room she shut the door behind us and butters popped bobs flashlight onto the table his eyelights winked on again and i saw murphy react visibly when that light revealed my presence she stiffened a little looking at me and her eyes showed a sudden weariness and pain she took a deep breath through her nose and closed her eyes for a second then she took off her jacket moving gingerly and said hi harry butters put the radio on the table and i said hi murph she was wearing thin light padding under the jacketlike the stuff id seen on stuntmen on a case id done not long after id gone into business so her fullcontact practice hadnt been as vicious as it had looked shed be covered in bruises but the impact with the wall hadnt actually been likely to break her back her skull maybe but not her back you okay she rolled one shoulder with a grimace of discomfort i will be big guy like that going to town on you i growled someone needs to push his face in her eyes glittered as she gave me a sharp look dresden when exactly am i going to fight someone my size and strength um if you want to wrestle hostile mooses moose butters corrected absently singular and plural same word gorillas murphy continued hardly breaking stride then the best way to train for it is by wrestling slightly less hostile gorillas skaldis two hundred pounds heavier than me almost two feet taller and he has going on two millennium millennia butters said millennium is the singular murphy pushed a breath out through her nose and said millennia of experience in breaking the backs of annoying little doctors with annoying little grammar fetishes butters grinned im not going to beat him harry ever that isnt the point she looked away and her voice became quiet the point is that the world isnt getting any kinder a girls got to take care of herself the expression on her face it hurt hearing the words that went with it felt like a knife peeling back layers of skin i didnt say anything i didnt let it show murphy would have been offended at the notion that she needed my protection and if she thought i felt guilty for not being there to protect her to help her shed be downright angry dont get me wrong i didnt think murphy was a princess in a tower but at the end of the day she was just one person standing in defiance of powers that would regard her with the same indifference as might an oncoming tsunami volcanic eruption or earthquake life is precious fragile fleetingand murphys life was one of my favorites okay harry murphy said where do we get started i felt awkward standing there while she and butters sat at the table but it wasnt like i could pull out a chair um maybe we get started with what you know about my my shooting she nodded and pulled on her cop faceher expression professionally calm detached analytical we dont have much officially speaking she said i came to pick you up and found the blood and a single bullet hole there wasnt quite enough to declare it a murder scene because the vic because you were on the boat and it was in motion there was no way to extrapolate precisely where the bullet came from probably a nearby rooftop because the bullet apparently began to tumble as it passed through your body it left asymmetric holes in the walls of the boat but forensics thinks it was something between a assaultrifle round and a magnumrifle round more likely the latter than the former i never got into rifles what does that mean it means a sniper rifle or a deer rifle butters clarified not necessarily military there are plenty of civilian weapons that fire rounds in those calibers we never found the bullet murphy said she took a deep breath or the body i noticed that both murph and butters were staring at me very intently uh i said i sort of did that whole tunneloflight thingwhich is a crock by the way i bit down on a mention of murphys father um i was sent back to solve the murder which sort of implies a death and they said my body wasnt available so murphy looked down and nodded huh butters said frowning why send you back i shrugged said what came next wasnt for whiners or rubberneckers murphy snorted sounds like something my father would say yeah i said heh butters arched an eyebrow his dark eyes flickered between me and murphy and thoughtful lines appeared on his face anyway i said thats what you know officially right so what else do you know i know it wasnt marcone murphy said all of his troubleshooters have alibis that check out so do he and gard and hendricks i know which building the shot probably came from and it wasnt an easy one four hundred and fifty yards butters said which means it was probably a professional gunman there are amateurs who can shoot that well murphy said as a rule they dont do it from buildings at their fellow americans butters replied look if we assume its an amateur it could be anyone but if we assume it was a professionalwhich is way more likely in any casethen it gives us the beginning of an identity and could lead us back to whomever he works for even if we do assume that murphy said i dont have the access to information that i used to wed need to review tsa video records security camerasall kinds of things i cant get to anymore your brotherinlaw can i said dick can richard she corrected me he hates that nickname dick who butters asked looking between us i said her brotherinlaw at the same time she said my exhusband butterss brow arched even farther and he shook his head man catholics murphy gave him a gimlet look richard runs by the book he wont help a civilian come on murph i said you were married to the guy youve got to have some dirt on him she shook her head it isnt a crime to be an asshole harry if it was id have put him away for life butters cleared his throat we could ask no murphy and i said at the same time and continued speaking over each other the day i ask for that bastards help will be the day i told you before over and over that just because hes reasonable doesnt mean hes a murderer and a drug dealer and a pimp and just because chicagos corrupt government cant put him away doesnt mean you were smarter than that murphy finished butters lifted his hands mildly okay okay i was on board at no no going to marcone for help he paused and looked around the room as if hed never seen it before because that would be unprecedented wally murphy said one eyebrow arching dangerously he held up his hands again uncle i dont understand your reasoning but okay you think marcone was behind it harry murphy asked i shrugged last time i saw him he said he didnt need to kill me that id get myself killed without any help from him murphy frowned it made her lip hurt and she winced reaching up the wince made it hurt worse apparently because fresh blood appeared dammit well you can take that a couple of different ways cant you like how murphy looked at me like maybe marcone knew something was happening already and thats why he said he didnt need to kill you it wasnt him but it was still something he was aware of i grunted marcone ran chicago like his own personal clubhouse he had legions of employees allies and flunkies his awareness of what happened in his city wasnt supernatural it was better than that he was rational intelligent and more prepared for a crisis than any man id ever seen if the eagle scouts had some sort of sith equivalent marcone was it if someones wetwork specialist had come to town marcone was very likely to have learned of it he and his underworld network missed little dammit murphy said evidently coming to the same conclusions i had now i have to talk to the scum she got out her little notepad and scribbled on it butters you said that lindquists house had burned down bigtime said butters i nodded according to the ghosts hanging around it the grey ghost showed upi didnt tell you about the grey ghost did i mr lindquist filled us in after the shooting butters said oh right anyway it showed up with several mortals and snatched him weve got to get him back murphy nodded still writing what happens if we dont a bunch of serial killertype ghosts start wandering around chicago looking for a good time ghosts like that can manifestmake themselves the nextbest thing to real murph like the nightmare people will get hurt a lot of them murphys mouth thinned into a line she wrote on her notepad well do triage in a minute what else i found the gang who shot up your house last night i said the tip of murphys pencil snapped against the notepad she looked up at me and her eyes were cold furious she spoke in a very quiet voice oh yeah i said i paused for a moment to think about what i was going to say murphys temper was not a force to be invoked lightly i dont think youre going to have to worry about them anymore why she asked in her cop voice did you kill them thered been a little too much intensity in that question wow murphy was clearly only too ready to go after these guys the minute she knew where they were i glanced at butters who looked like someone sitting near an armed explosive no i said working out my words carefully if murphys fuse was really as short as it seemed i didnt want her charging off to deal with fitz and his poor crew in true viking tradition but they dont have the resources they had before i dont think theyre going to hurt anybody in the immediate future thats your professional opinion is it yes she stared at me for a minute then said abby was standing on my patio last night when they came by she took a round in the belly during that attack she didnt get down fast enough they dont know if shes going to live or not i thought of the plump cheerful little woman and swallowed i i didnt know murph im sorry she continued speaking as if i hadnt said anything there was a retiree living in the house behind mine he used to give me tomatoes he grew in his garden every summer he wasnt as lucky as abby the bullet hit him in the neck while he was sleeping in bed he had enough time to wake up terrified and knock the handset of his phone out of its cradle before he bled out hells bells that put a different spin on things i mean i had been hoping to go for a noharm nofoul argument with murphy but if blood had been spilled and lives lost well i knew murphy whether or not she was a cop anymore she wasnt going to back away where are they she asked this is not a time to kick down doors i told her please hear me out her hand tightened into a fist but she visibly took control of her anger took a deep breath and then nodded go ahead i told her about fitz and his gang i told her about aristedes i notice harry she said that you didnt tell me where they are yeah i said i uh i sorta told the kid i would help him that you would help him murphy narrowed her eyes you did what theyre kids murph i said in over their heads they need help theyve killed at least one person maybe more murphy said there are still laws in this town dresden send the cops in and itll get ugly im not sure how much juice their boss has but even if he cant shoot hed be a nightmare for the policeeven si murphy frowned how sure are you about that guys like him use fear and violence as daily tools he wont think twice about hurting a cop murphy nodded then ill deal with him murph i know you can handle yourself but dresden ive dealt with two men since you since the shooting who were skilled enough for carlos to call them the nextbest thing to full councilquality warlocks ive handled several lesser talents too the fomor like to use them as officers and commanders i know what im doing youve killed them i said quietly thats what you mean isnt it she looked away it was a moment before she answered with someone that powerful theres not really a choice if you try to take them alive they have plenty of time to kill you i winced in sympathy for her she might not be a cop anymore but it was where her heart laywith the law she believed in it truly believed that the law was meant to serve and protect the people of chicago when she was a cop it had always been her job to make sure that those laws worked toward that purpose in whatever way she could manage she loved serving her city under the rule of law and that meant judges and juries got to do their job before the executioner stepped in if murphy had dispensed with that belief regardless of how practical and necessary it had been regardless if doing so had saved lives butters had said that she was under stress i now knew the nature of that stress guilt it would be ripping away steadily at her insides at her conscience scraping them both raw they were all killers she said though i dont think she was talking to me killers and kidnappers and the law couldnt touch them someone had to do something yeah i said someone always does the point is she continued that the way you deal with this kind of problem is to hit it with absolutely everything youve got and to do it immediately before those spellcasting yahoos have enough time to fort up bend peoples minds into defending them or to start coming after you or someone you care about she looked up at me i need the address you dont i said ill bring the kids to you once you get them away from aristedes hes out of help and vulnerable then you can help fitz and company fitz and company she said in a flat tone are murderers but no harry dont give me any rap about how they didnt mean it they opened fire with deadly weapons in a residential neighborhood in the eyes of the law and anyone the least bit reasonable it was an accident is unconvincing they knew what could happen their intentions are irrelevant i know i said but these arent bad kids theyre just scared it drove them to a bad choice youve just described most of the gang members in this town harry they dont join the gang because theyre bad kids they do it because theyre frightened they want to feel like they belong somewhere safe she shook her head it doesnt matter if they started out as good kids life changes them makes them something they werent what do you want to do take a team to their hideout deal with the sorcerer well make every effort to avoid harming the others youre going to open fire with deadly weapons on their home maybe you dont want to hurt the kids but you know what could happen if you wind up with bodies on the floor your intentions would be irrelevant is that what youre telling me her eyes flashed with sudden anger you havent been here the past six months you dont know what its been like you she pressed her lips together then she looked at me and stared clearly waiting i said very quietly no she shook her head several times then she said the real dresden wouldnt hesitate the real dresden would never have gotten a chance to see them to talk to them hed just skip to the fight she flipped her notepad closed with a snap of her wrist and stood then weve covered what needs doing theres nothing more to discuss murphy got up and left the room without a word her steps smooth and purposeful butters rose and collected bob and the little spirit radio i uh i usually follow along after her when shes setting up something take care of the details excuse me sure i said quietly thanks for your help butters anytime he said you too bob i said de nada the skull replied butters hurried out i was left standing in the conference room alone chapter nineteen i stood there for several minutes doing nothing not even breathing doing nothing is difficult once you arent busy your head starts chewing things over dark bleak thoughts appear you start to think about what your life means if youre a ghost you start to think about what your death means murphy was being slowly devoured from within by a guilty conscience i had known her a long time i knew how she thought i knew what she held dear i knew what it looked like when she was in pain i had no doubt that i made the right call on that one but i also knew that she was a woman who wouldnt kill another human even if he were overthehillandaroundthebend crazy unless it was absolutely necessary no killing is easy for anyone of consciencebut murphy had been facing that demon for a long time granted shed been hurt by my death and let me tell you how furiously frustrated it made me that i was powerless to have changed that but why would her conscience start catching up to her now why develop a sudden case of the damsels when id asked her to get more information from her exhusband brick walls didnt stop the woman when she had a mind to walk somewhere i noticed something too when we had been talking about the shot that had killed me and the shooters location and gathering more information about potential assassins murphy hadnt said muchbut shed not said a whole hell of a lot more she had never not once mentioned kincaid kincaid was a partially inhuman mercenary who worked for the scariest little girl on gods green earth he was centuries old and he was a phenomenon in a fight he had somehow overcome the negative aspects of the human nervous system at least as it applied to firing a weapon under pressure id never seen him miss not once and it was he who had told me that if he wanted to kill me hed do it from at least half a mile away with a heavyduty rifle round murphy knew as well as i did that the opinion of an assassin with centuries of experience would be invaluable in the investigation initially i hadnt suggested it because murph had kinda been dating the guy for a while and seemed to care for him so it seemed more appropriate to let her bring it up but she hadnt shed never mentioned him at all shed run the meeting too rapidly and was ready to fight with me over something anything the entire argument about fitz and his crew had been a smoke screen the only question was for whose benefit it had been mine so that a possibly crazy ghost wouldnt go storming off for vengeance of some kind or had it been a veil of fog for her own benefit because she couldnt reconcile her view of kincaid with that of the faceless person who had killed me that felt right that she knew it in her heart and without realizing it was frantically scrambling to find a less painful truth with her head my reasoning was based on my knowledge of human nature and of murphys personality and on my intuitionbut id spent a lifetime trusting my instincts i thought they were probably right i played through the possibilities in my head i imagined murphy distraught and falling to pieces on the inside in the days after my murder we never got to find out if wed be anything together wed missed it by moments i knew that when there had been enough time for her rage to abate the sorrow would begin to pile up i imagined her in the next month or so no longer a cop her world in shambles word of my death would have gotten around fastnot only among the wizards of the white council but among the remaining vampire court over the paranet and from there to the rest of the supernatural world kincaid probably heard about it within a day or two as soon as someone filed a report about me the archive the supernatural recorder of all written knowledge that dwelled within a child named ivy would have known and i was probably one of the only people in the world she thought of as a friend she was what twelve thirteen news of my death would shatter ivy kincaid would i think have gone to murphy to offer what comfort he could not the hotchocolateandfluffyrobe brand of comfort he was more likely to bring bottles of whiskey and a sexmusic cd especially if he was already right here in town a dark nasty part of me whispered in my head i imagined murphy taking shelter where she could and bidding him farewell when he leftand then over the next few weeks slowly lining up facts and reaching conclusions all the while repeating to herself that she was probably wrong that it couldnt be what it looked like frustration pain denial yeah that would be enough to draw rage out of anybody rage she would be carrying with her like a slowly growing tumor becoming more and more of a burden it was the sort of thing that might push someone to kill another person even when maybe it wasnt necessary that death would cause more guilt more frustration which would cause more rage which would cause more violence which would add to guilt again a literal vicious cycle murphy didnt want to get shots from airport and trainstation security cameras because she didnt want to find out that the man shed been sleeping with had killed one of her friends when drawn close to that plausibility she reacted in anger pushing away the source of illumination about to fall on what she didnt want to see she probably wasnt even aware of the clash of needs in her head when youre griefstricken all kinds of irrational stuff flies around in there detective work isnt always about logicnot when youre dealing with people people are likely to do the most ridiculously illogical things for the most incomprehensible of reasons i had no logic to aim at kincaid but the theory fit a whole lot of pieces together if it was correct it explained a lot it was only a theory but it was enough to make me want to start digging for more evidence where i might not otherwise have looked but how how was i going to start digging into jared kincaid the hellhound the closest thing to a father ivy had ever hadand do it without murphys help for that matter id have to find some way to do it without her knowledge and that seemed like something that would be more than a little slimy to do to a friend augh better maybe to focus on the immediate problems first i had to find morty whose plight had clearly been low on murphs priority list i had to help fitz and the rest of his clueless teenage pals and for all of it i needed the help of someone i could trust i took a deep breath and nodded then i walked until i had passed through an exterior wall of the bright future house and set off to find my apprentice before the night got any deeper chapter twenty i always considered myself a loner i mean not like a poorme byronesque ishouldhavebroughtaswimmingbuddy loner i mean the sort of person who doesnt feel too upset about the prospect of a weekend spent seeing no one and reading good books on the couch it wasnt like i was a people hater or anything i enjoyed activities and the company of friends but they were a side dish i always thought i would also be happy without them i walked the streets of a city of nearly three million people and for the first time there was nothing that connected me to any of them i couldnt speak to them i couldnt touch them i couldnt get in an argument over a parking space or flip the bird to a careless driver who ran a light while i was crossing i couldnt buy anything in one of the stores making polite chitchat with the clerk while paying couldnt pick up a newspaper couldnt recommend a good book to someone browsing the shelves three million souls went about their lives around me and i was alone now i understood captain murphys shadow chicago the actual town had already begun to feel like the shadow version with enough time would the real city look that way to me too dark empty devoid of purpose and vaguely threatening id been here for barely a day what would i be like if i was here for a year ten years a hundred years i was starting to get why so many ghosts seemed to be a couple of french fries short of a happy meal i had to wonder too if maybe sir stuart and morty were right about me what if i really was the deluded spirit they thought i was not the true harry dresden just his image in death doing what the lunatic had always done setting out to help his friends and get the bad guy i didnt feel like a deluded spirit but then i wouldnt would i the mad rarely know that they are mad its the rest of the world i think that seems insane to them god knew it had always seemed fairly insane to me was there any way i could be sure i was anything other than what sir stuart and mort thought more to the point mort was the freaking expert on ghosts i mean i knew my way around the block but mort had been a specialist normally on purely technical matters regarding spirits and shades i would give his opinion significant weight probably a little more than i would my own morty had never been a paragon of courage and strength but he was smart and clearly tough enough to survive a long career that had been a lot more dangerous than i thought hell for all i knew while i had been busy saving chicago from things no one knew were there mort might have been saving me from things i never knew were there funny world isnt it i stopped in my tracks and shook my head as if to clear water from my eyes dresden have your personal existential crisis later the bad guys are obviously working hard get your ass in gear good advice that the question was how normally i would have tracked molly down with a fairly simple piece of thaumaturgy id done a thousand times after her unplanned vacation to arctis tor in faerie i had always been sure to keep a fairly recent lock of her hair handy and more recently id found i could get a fix on all the energy patterns she used to make her first few independent magical toolslike the hair they were something specific and unique to her and her alone a signature i could be pretty sure to find her when i needed to do so hell for that matter id spent so much time around her that she had become almost like family i could generally tell by pure intuition when she was nearby as long as she wasnt actively trying to hide herself that of course had all been when i had magic now i didnt which was upon thinking about it probably another bit of evidence in favor of stuart and morts theory and against mine you cant take magic away from a person its a part of who and what they are they can abandon it if they work at it hard enough but you cant strip it out of them if my ghost had truly been me it would have had power just as that bastard leonid kravoss ghost had right or maybe not maybe id been making more assumptions without ever questioning them i had already assumed that matter was solid when it wasnt that i could get cold which i couldnt and that i was still beholden to the laws of gravity which i wasnt maybe id made the same assumptions about magic i mean after all i had thrown a solid shield spell during the first attack on morts place when i had been sharing space with the ectomancer that would seem to show that my talent was still there still real i just had to figure out how to access it memories are power i dug into my dusters pocket and drew out the massive pistol sir stuart had given me blackpowder weaponry isnt my thing but i made sure there was nothing in the priming pan before turning it barrel down and shaking it i had to give it several hard thumps with the heel of my hand to get the ball wad and powder to spill out into my palm the ball the bullet gleamed as if newly molded upon closer look fine swirls on the surface of the metal took on the shapes of a simple pastoral scene a colonialstyle home in the middle of a little green valley surrounded by apple trees clean neat cropland and a pasture dotted with white sheep just looking at it seemed to give the scene life wind stirred the crops apples stood out like specks of bright green against the darker leaves lambs gamboled among adult members of the flock playing for the pure joy of it the door to the house opened and a tall straightbacked woman with hair blacker than a ravens wing emerged from the house trailing a small cloud of children clearly giving calm instructions with the sight a flood of emotions coursed through me a fierce and jealous pride of possessionnot pride that i owned such a beautiful home but that the home was beautiful because i owned it because i had made it so mixed with that was an oceandeep surge of love for the woman and her children raw happiness at seeing themand a heavy entirely pleasurable surge of desire for the woman whom i had not held in far too long i suddenly felt that i had intruded upon something personal and intimate i closed my eyes and looked away from the scene memories i realized these were all things from sir stuarts mortal memories this memory was what he had cast forth against that wraith the first time i met him he hadnt used memories of destruction as his weapon but those of identity of the reasons he was willing to fight that was why as a ghost he still used that ax this pistol far more modern weapons were available to copy but his memories were of himself using those weapons and so they were the source of his power the embodiment of his will to change what was around him they were sir stuarts identity they were also his magic memories equaled power for a moment i thought it couldnt be that simple but a lot of magic is actually disgustingly simplewhich is not to be confused with easy there was only one way to find out the first spell id ever done had been during that longago class olympicsbut that was spontaneous accidental magic hardly worthy of the term the first conscious spell id knowingly worked fully planned fully visualized fully realized had been calling forth a burst of fire justin dumorne had shown me how it worked i plunged into the memory i dont understand i complained rubbing at my aching temples it didnt work the first fifty times it isnt going to work now fortysix times justin corrected me his voice very precise like always he had an accent but i couldnt figure out which kind it was i hadnt heard one like it on tv not that justin had a tv i had to sneak out on friday nights to watch it in the store at the mall or else face the real risk that id miss knight rider altogether harry justin said okay i sighed my head hurts its natural youre blazing new trails in your mind once more please couldnt i blaze the trails somewhere else justin looked up at me from where he sat at his desk we were in his office which was what he called the spare bedroom in the little house about twenty miles outside des moines he was dressed in black pants and a dark grey shirt like on most days his beard was short precisely trimmed he had very long slender fingers but his hands could make fists that were hard as rocks he was taller than me which most grownups were and he never called me anything mean when he got mad which most of the foster parents id been with did if i angered justin he just went from saying please to using his fists he never swung at me while screaming or shook me which other caretakers had done when he hit me it was really quick and precise and then it was over like when bruce lee hit a guy only justin never made the silly noises i ducked my head looking away from him and then stared at the empty fireplace i was sitting in front of it with my legs crossed there were logs and tinder ready to go there was a faint smell of smoke and a bit of waddedup newspaper had turned black at one corner but otherwise there was no evidence of a fire in my peripheral vision i saw justin turn back to his book once more if you please i sighed then i closed my eyes and started focusing again you started with steadying your breathing then once you were relaxed and ready you gathered energy justin had told me to picture it as a ball of light at the center of my chest slowly growing brighter and brighter but that was a load of crap when the silver surfer did it energy gathered around his hands and his eyes green lantern gathered it around his ring iron fist had glowing fists which was pretty much as cool as you could get i guess iron man had the glowing thing in the middle of his chest but he was like the only one and he didnt really have superpowers anyway i pictured gathering my energy together around my right hand so there i pictured it glowing brighter and brighter surrounded by a red aura like iron fists i felt the power making tingling sensations up and down my arms making my hairs stand up on end and when i was ready i leaned forward thrusting my hand into the fireplace released the energy and said clearly sedjet and as i spoke i flicked the starter on the bic lighter i had palmed in my right hand the little lighter immediately set the newspaper alight from right next to me justin said put it out i twitched and dropped the lighter in pure surprise my heart started beating about a zillion times a minute his fingers closed into a fist i dont like to repeat myself i swallowed and reached into the fireplace to drag the burning paper out from under the wood it singed me a little but not enough to cry about or anything i slapped the fire out with my hands my cheeks turning bright red as i did give me the lighter justin said his voice calm i bit my lip and did he took the lighter and bounced it a couple of times in his palm a faint smile was on his lips harry i believe you will find that such ingenuity may be of great service to you as an adult the smile vanished but you are not an adult boy you are a student this sort of underhanded behavior will not do at all he closed his fist and hissed sedjet his hand exploded into a sphere of scarletandblue flamewhich pretty much made iron fists powers look a little bit pastel i stared and swallowed my heart beat even faster justin rotated his hand a few times contemplating it and making sure that i saw his whole fist and armthat i could see it wasnt sleight of hand it was completely surrounded in fire and it wasnt burning justin held his fist right next to my face until the heat was beginning to make me uncomfortable but he never flinched and his flesh remained unharmed if you choose it this is what you may one day manage he said calmly mastery of the elements and more important mastery of yourself um i said what humans are inherently weak boy he continued in that same steady voice that weakness expresses itself in a great many ways for instance right now you wish to stop practicing and go outside even though you know that what you learn here is absolutely critical still your impulse is to put play first study later he opened his hand suddenly and dropped the lighter in my lap i flinched away as it struck my leg and let out a little yell but the red plastic lighter simply lay on the floor unmarked by any heat i touched it with a nervous fingertip but the lighter was quite cool right now justin said you are making a choice it may not seem like a large and terrible choice but in the long term it may well be you are choosing whether you will be the master of your own fate with the power to create what you will from the worldor whether you will simply flick your bic and get by unremarkable complacent his mouth twisted and his voice turned bitter mediocre mediocrity is a terrible fate harry my hand hovered over the lighter but i didnt pick it up i thought about what he had said then i said what you mean is that if i cant do it youll send me back success or failure of the spell is not the issue he said what matters is the success or failure of your will your will to overcome human weakness your will to work to learn i will have no shirkers here boy he settled down onto the floor next to me and nodded toward the fireplace again if you please i stared at him for a moment then down at my hand at the discarded lighter no one had ever told me i was special before but justin had no one had ever taken so much time to do anything with me ever justin had i thought of going back into the state systemto the homes the shelters the orphanages and suddenly i truly wanted to succeed i wanted it more than i wanted dinner more even than i wanted to watch knight rider i wanted justin to be proud of me i left the lighter where it was and focused on my breathing i built up the spell again slowly slowly focusing on it more intently than on anything id ever done in my life and i was nearly thirteen so that was really saying something the energy swelled until i felt like someone had started a trash fire in my belly and then i willed it out through my empty outstretched right hand and as i did instead of using the egyptian phrase i said flickum bicus and the remaining tinder under the logs burst into bright little flames i didnt think id ever seen anything more beautiful i sagged and almost fell over even though i was already sitting on the floor my body suddenly ached with hunger and weariness like this one time when all us orphans had gotten to go to a water park i wanted to eat a bucket of macaroni and cheese and then go to sleep a strong longfingered hand caught my shoulder and steadied me i looked up to see justin regarding me his dark eyes flickering with warmth that wasnt wholly the reflection of the small but growing fire in the hearth flickum bicus he asked i nodded and felt myself blushing again you know cause the mediocrity he tilted his head back and let out a rolling laugh he ruffled my hair with one hand and said welldone harry welldone my chest swelled up so much i thought i was going to bounce off the ceiling justin held up a finger went to his desk and returned with a brown paper package he offered it to me whats this i asked yours he said youve done the work after all i blinked and then tore the package open inside was a wilson baseball mitt i stared for several seconds no one had ever given me a present beforenot one that was meant for me and not just some random charitydonated christmas package with a label that said for boy and it was an excellent glove george brett had one just like it id been to two kansas city royals baseball games on field trips when i was little and they were awesome so was brett thank you i said quietly oh come on now i was gonna cry sometimes i thought i was kinda goofy justin produced a baseball a brandnew one that was still all white and held it up smiling if youre up for it we can go outside right now i felt really tired and hungry but i had a brandnew glove i shoved my hand into it until i figured out where all my fingers were supposed to go yes i said pushing myself up lets do it justin bounced the ball up and down in his hand a couple of times and grinned at me good when all is done i think youll find baseball a rewarding experience i followed him outside it didnt matter that i was tired i was practically floating i opened my eyes standing on a random chicago sidewalk immaterial and unseen i turned my right hand palm up and focused upon that sudden kindling of light and hope crystallized by the memory of that moment of triumph and joy flickum bicus i whispered the fire was every bit as beautiful as i remembered chapter twentyone it took me a couple of hours to work out how to make my trusty tracking spell function i easily found several memories that i could use to power the spell it was figuring out how to create the link to molly that was hard usually i would use one of the trusty traditional methods for directing thaumaturgya lock of hair a fresh drop of blood fingernail clippings et cetera that wasnt going to work obviously i couldnt touch them even if i had them so instead of tracking molly with physical links i tried using memories of her in their place it workedsort of the first tracking spell led me to the hotel that had once hosted a horror convention known as splattercon it was closed now and deserted i guess maybe all the deaths at splattercon had taken a toll on the hotel in the civilcourt cases that followed the phobophage attacks i took a quick spin through the place hardly even flinching before i stomped through one wall after another except for a few transients who had broken into the building and were squatting there i found nothing i went back over my work the memory id used was one that had stuck in my head for some reason of molly here in this building that must have thrown off the spell it had homed in on this place because it had been part of the memory i used to create the link i tried again this time omitting the background and picturing only molly against an empty field of black this second attempt took me to a police station from which i had once posted bail for mollys boyfriend i figured id bungled the spell somehow but took a quick look around anyway just in case no molly okay smart guy i said to myself so what if the memoryimage youre using is too old youre tracking her memoryself to a memorylocation which means you have to think of her as she is now to find where she is now right theoretically i said to myself right so test the theory well obviously although discussing a problem with yourself is almost never a good way to secure a divergent viewpoint in fact talking to yourself is often considered a sign of impending insanity i noted aloud which hardly seemed encouraging i shook off the unsettling thought and worked the tracking spell again this time instead of using one of my earlier memories of molly i used my most recent one i pictured her in her castoff clothing and rags as shed been at murphys place forming a memory into an image that would support the energy required for a spell isnt as simple as closing your eyes and daydreaming you have to produce it in exact even fanatical detail until it is as real in your mind as any actual object it takes a lot of practice and energy to do thatand it is why people use props when they set out to do magic a prop can be used as an anchor saving the spellcaster the effort of creating not just one but multiple mental constructs and supporting them all in a state of perfect focus and concentration i had learned how to do magic the hard way firstall of it in my head only after id proved i could do it without the aid of props did justin tell me that it was even possible to use them over the years id practiced fairly complex thaumaturgic spells without props maybe once a season keeping my concentration and imagination sharp it was a damned good thing i had working magic as a ghost was all about doing it au naturel i reached into my memory to produce the construct id need to stand in for molly in the tracking spell at the time id been handed a lot to process and i hadnt really taken stock of exactly what kind of shape molly was in id seen that she was under strain but upon closely reviewing the memory i was somewhat shocked at how gaunt and weary she looked molly had always been the sort of young person who almost glowed with good health after six months on her own she looked like an escapee from a gulag scrawny tough and beaten down if not broken i added more than that to the image i imagined her cheery goodwill the selfloathing she still sometimes felt for the pain shed caused her friends in the days before i agreed to teach her i thought of her precise orderly approach to her studies so much different from my own her diligence and the occasional arrogance that pretty much every young wizard has until theyve walked into enough walls to know better i thought of the most powerful force in her life a deep and abiding love for her family and added in the desolation she must be feeling to be separated from them eager beautiful dangerous molly i held that image of my apprentice in mind drew together my will and tapped into the recollection of one of my more memorable tracking spells all at the same time i established the pattern of the modified version of the spell id had to cobble together walked chewed bubble gum and released the spell with a murmured word the power surged out through me and a precise powerful force spun me into a pirouette i extended my left arm index finger pointing and felt a sharp tug against it each time it passed an easterly point of the compass within a couple of seconds i stopped spinning rotated a little past the point and then settled back slightly in the opposite direction my index finger pointed straight at the heart of the city crombie i said eat your heart out i followed the spell to molly i pulled my vanishing act and went zipping downtown a few hundred yards at a time i paused to check the spell twice more and correct my course though by the third check i was starting to feel like a human weather vane i had to stop more frequently as i got closer to make sure i was moving in the right direction and the trail took me down into the great towers within the loop where the buildings rose high enough to form what felt like the walls of a deep ravine a manmade canyon of glass steel and stone i wasnt terribly surprised when the spell led me to the lower streets some of the streets downtown have two or even three levels one is up on the surface with the others stacked below it a lot of the buildings have upper and lower entrances and parking as well doubling the amount of access to the buildings within those blocks there were also plenty of empty spaces pseudoalleyways walkways and crawl spaces here and there abandoned chambers in the basements and subbasements of the buildings above sat in silent darkness waiting to be remade into something new the commuter tunnels could connect down there and there were several entrances to the insane deadly labyrinth beneath the city known as undertown chicago cops patrolled the lower streets on a regular basis things came slinking out of undertown to prowl the darkness traffic would blaze through on the actual streets which were occasionally only separated from the sidewalks by a stripe of faded paint all in all its not the sort of place a sane person will casually wander through i found molly standing in one of the narrow alleyways snow had fallen through a grate twenty feet overhead and covered the ground she was dressed in the same rags id seen the night before with her arms clenched around her stomach shivering in the cold there was a fresh purpling bruise on her cheek she was breathing heavily again said a cool calm womans voice from farther down the alley out of sight im tttired molly said i havent eeaten in a day and a half poor darling im sure death will understand and agree to return another time there was a sharp hissing sound and molly threw up her left hand fingers spread she spat out a word or two and flickering sparkles of defensive energy spread from her fingertips into a flat plane molly simply didnt have a talent for defensive magicbut this was the best shield id ever seen the grasshopper pull off a hurtling white sphere hit the shield it should have bounced off but instead it zipped through the shield its course barely bent the sphere struck molly in the left shoulder and exploded into diamondglitter shards of ice she let out a short harsh grunt of pain and staggered focus said the calm womans voice use the pain make the shield real with your will know that it will protect you again molly looked up with her teeth clenched but instead of talking she raised her left hand once more and another ball of ice flew at her this one hit the shield and went throughbut its path was attenuated more significantly than the last it flew past her barely clipping one arm she gasped and sank to one knee panting magic taxes the endurance of anyone who uses itand if you use magic you arent particularly skilled with you get worn down even faster i shivered to see molly like that i knew how she felt when justin began teaching me how to create protective shields he threw baseballs at me at top speed when i failed i was hit with a fastball moving at more than eighty miles an hour justin said pain was an excellent motivator and that the activity was good training when i had been teaching molly how to shield i hadnt used anything more painful than fluffy snowballs and rotten fruit that will do for now said the womans voice tomorrow we will move up to knives molly shuddered and looked down the speaker came walking calmly down the alley to stand over molly it was my faerie godmother the leanansidhe lea was beautiful beyond the loveliness of mere humanity but it was a stark hungry dangerous beauty that always reminded me of a hunting cat she was tall and pale her hair the color of autumn leaves at sunset her ears were very slightly pointed though i wasnt sure she hadnt done that to herself in order to conform to mortal expectations she wore a long gown of green silk wholly unsuitable to the task of protecting a mortal from the weather but as she was one of the most powerful sidhe of the winter court i doubted she even noticed the cold she reached out a hand and touched mollys hair with her fingertips why molly asked her voice barely more than a whisper why are you doing this to me obligation child lea replied favors owed and loyalties given you owed it to harry to do this to me molly asked nay child not me but my queen is committed to him through ancient law and custom she dispatched me to continue your training in the artand pain is an excellent teaching tool harry didnt believe that molly said her voice brittle he never hurt me the leanansidhe stooped and seized mollys chin jerking my apprentices face up to meet her inhuman gaze then he wronged you badly child lea replied enunciating each word sharply he cheated you of the legacy he livedand suffered to acquire i am not teaching you how to tie knots in rope or to bake pastries i am making you ready to face battle and emerge alive i have faced battle molly said in which you were shot of all things by a mere mortal foot soldier lea said contempt flavoring her words you nearly died which would have been greatly humiliating to your mentor and by extension to my queen what does it matter to mab molly said her voice bitter hes dead lea sighed mortals can be so obsessed with useless detail it grows tiresome i dont understand molly said your mentor took an oath of fealty to my queen such oaths are not to be made lightlyand they place mutual obligations on both parties minor details do not excuse either party from its responsibilities his death is a minor detail as these things go lea said of course it is youre all mortals even the life length of a wizard is something brief and transitory to an immortal similarly extending her hand to the assistance of those her vassal knew in life is a minor detail if you live another three centuries it is little more than a long season to the queen of air and darkness molly closed her eyes he made her promise to take care of me lea blinked at her politely baffled no of course not child he took an oath of fealty she is one of the sidhe the oath binds her as tightly as it does him just as when i waslea shiveredunable to perform my duties to young dresden mab assumed those responsibilities until i could be restored to them thus does she now do for you through me molly wiped a hand over her eyes she shook her head and rose to her feet moving slowly did he know i mean did he know mab would do this i should have i said quietly if id stopped to think about it for two minutes i should have known but neither of them heard me i knew the boy well lea said better than ever he realized many a night did i watch over him protecting him and he none the wiser but i was not privy to his mind or his heart molly nodded slowly she looked at lea for a long moment my godmother simply watched her waiting until molly nodded to herself and said his shade is in town looking for the person who killed him the leanansidhes pale redgold eyebrows flew up it was one of the most drastic reactions id ever seen from her that seems unlikely molly shrugged i used my sight its his ghost all right a construct couldnt have hidden from me six months after his death the leanansidhe murmured it is rare for a shade to arise after the season in which it was madeand he was slain last autumn her eyes narrowed interesting she tilted her head studying molly what is your condition molly blinked dully once before she said i need to curl into a ball and sleep for a week im starving im cold i think im getting a cold i hurt everywhere i would molly paused and eyed lea why do you ask the sidhe only smiled in answer bootsteps sounded heavy and quick and a small crowd appeared at the far end of the alley they were all roughlooking men carrying an assortment of guns blades clubs and axes they dressed exclusively in black to the extent that it looked like they all shopped in the same store they were also wearing turtlenecksevery single one of them talk about weird molly let out a hiss servitors how did they find me here i told them where to look lea said calmly molly whirled to her you what i didnt share your location with the fomor themselves child just with some of their guard dogs they think that if they catch you and return you to the fomor they will gain great honorand i did not give them enough time to contact their masters for instructions she smiled showing daintily pointed canines initiative in an underling can be such a troubling thing molly made a disgusted sound i dont believe this twenty armed thugs kept striding forward exuding the calm that comes only from professionals who are not hurrying keeping their spacing smooth they were all glaring at molly lea smirked already fading out of sight it is good training child she vanished cheshire cat style only she left her voice behind instead of her smile let us see what you have learned chapter twentytwo what ive learned molly muttered mostly under her breath so help me one of these days ill show you what ive learned you skinny bitch then she focused on the enemy took a breath just as id taught her to do under stress and calmed herself she began to withdraw calmly slowly one pace at a time that was smart had she turned and sprinted it would have provoked immediate pursuit instead the guys in turtlenecks kept their professional cool moving steadily forward in a solid block of muscles and weapons all of them ready to kill a lone exhausted young woman scum no way in hell that was happening to my apprentice i hadnt yet tried any true evocation magic the fastanddirty side of violent wizardry but i thought i had the basic concept down so i tuned in to a memory of a particularly powerful evocation when i had blown a rampaging loupgarou straight through the brick wall of one building and entirely through the building across the street i left out all the details except for the energy blast itself vanished and reappeared in front of the oncoming servitors and snarled fuego a blast of flame and raw kinetic force exploded from my outflung right hand it hit the front of the enemy formation like a blazing locomotive and washed completely through them having no effect whatsoever i didnt even ruffle their clothes oh come on i shouted that is just not fair i still couldnt act couldnt touch couldnt help molly faced the men alone she kept walking back until she emerged from the alley into a small parking lot contained within concrete walls and open to the sky there were only a handful of cars in it along with a motorcycle and a couple of mounds of piled snow there were doors fitted with those magnetic cardswipe locks on two of the lots wallsemployee or executive parking obviously the fourth opening led out to the lower avenue where dull yellow lights cast a feeble gleam molly walked to the middle of the little lot looked around her and nodded well boys she said aloud i dont suppose theres any chance we could talk about this over a cup of coffee at dennys im starving one of the turtlenecks presumably their leader said submit yourself to the will of the masters your pain will be much shortened right molly said she rolled her neck as if to loosen it up and nodded at the speaker youre my huckleberry the turtleneck tilted his head to one side frowning molly blew him a kiss a gust of wind channeled through the lower street rushed by tugging at her ragged clothes pulling her long coattails out like a flag beside herand then she exploded it happened so fast that i could barely understand what was happening much less anticipate what would come next where my apprentice had been standing suddenly became half a dozen identical leanly ragged figures darting in every direction one molly flew sideways both arms extended in front of her firing a pair of colts their hammering whamwhamwham as recognizable as familiar music another flipped into a cartwheel and tumbled out of sight behind a parked car two more ran to each door virtually mirror images of each other swiping a card key and slamming into the buildings a fifth molly ducked behind a mound of snow and emerged with a shotgun which she began emptying at the turtlenecks the sixth ran to the motorcycle picked it up as if it had been a plastic toy and flung it toward her attackers my jaw dropped open i mean i had known the kid was good with illusions but hells bells i might have been able to do one of the illusions molly had just wrought once i had managed two under all kinds of mortal pressure she had just thrown out six simultaneously and at the drop of a hat to boot my gast was pretty well flabbered the turtlenecks clearly didnt know how to react either the ones with guns returned fire and they all scattered for cover the motorcycle didnt hit anyone as it tumbled past the group though the crashing sound it made when it landed was so convincing that it made me doubt my suchastheywere senses the guns barked several times as the illusionary mollys all sought cover behind the snow mounds and cars i gritted my teeth you arent one of the rubes dresden youve got a backstage pass i bent my head touched my fingers to my forehead for a moment and opened up my own sight the scene changed colors wildly going from a dull winter monochrome to an abstract done in smearing interweaving watercolor the blurs of magic in the air were responsible for all the tintingmolly had unleashed a hell of a lot of energy in very little time and shed done so from the point of exhaustion id been there enough times to know the look now i could see the illusions for what they werewhich was the single largest reason why the wizards of the white council didnt put much stock in illusion magic it could be easily nullified by anyone with the sight which was the same thing as saying anyone on the council but against this band of hipster emo mooklosers it worked just fine molly behind an almost perfect magical veil was standing precisely where she had been at the beginning of the altercation she hadnt moved a muscle her hands were extended at her sides fingers twitching and her face was still and expressionless her eyes shifted out of focus she was running a puppet show and the illusions were her marionettes dancing on strings of thought and will the illusionary versions of molly were very slightly transparent and grainy like i remembered movies being when i was a kid the motorcycle had never moved from where it was parkedan illusion had flown through the air and a shortterm veil was now hiding the bike the turtlenecks though werent going to be shut down by half a dozen young women even if they had just appeared out of nowhere and apparently were possessed of weapons and superhuman strength at barked orders from their leader they came bounding over parked cars and mounds of snow in teams of five moving with the light lithe grace rarely seen outside of the olympics and martial arts movies they advanced with the kind of frighteningly focused purpose you see only in veterans these men knew how to survive a battle kill before you are killed if even one of them closed in on molly it was over i thought of what it might be like to watch my apprentice die with my sight open and almost started gibbering if that happened if i saw that horror with eyes that would make sure i could never ever forget it or distance myself from it there wouldnt be anything left of me except guilt and rage i shut away my sight it must be difficult said my godmother standing suddenly beside me to watch something like this without being able to affect the outcome glah i said or something close to it jumping a few inches to one side out of sheer nerves stars and stones lea i said between my gritted teeth a moment later you can see me but of course sir knight she replied green eyes sparkling my duty to oversee my godsons spiritual growth and development would be entirely futile could i not perceive and speak to a spirit such as thee you knew i was there a moment ago didnt you her laugh was a bright wicked sound your grasp of the obvious remains substantialeven though you do not a curtain of greenblue fire about seven feet high sprang up and swept rapidly across the width of the parking lot between the position of the various mollys and the turtlenecks the flames emitted eerie shrieking sounds and the faces of hideous beings danced about inside them i just blinked holy crap i hadnt taught the kid that tsk lea said watching the scene she has an able mind but she is filled with the passions of youth she rushes to her finale without building anything like the tension required for something so overt to prove effective i wasnt sure what my godmother was talking about but i didnt have time to try to pry an explanation out of her except that i did i mean what else was i going to do right whatever do you mean i replied in a polite tone i almost managed not to grit my teeth such anher mouth twisted in distasteovert and vulgar display as that wall of fire is worthy only of frightening children or appearing in something produced by hollywood it might yield a shortlived panic reaction if built up and timed properly but it is otherwise useless and of course in very bad taste she shook her head in disapproval true terror is much more subtle i gave my godmother a sharp look what veils are of limited utility with snow upon the ground she explained the footprints you see its quite difficult to hide so many individual disruptions of the environment thus she must work in another medium to survive stop this youre going to get her killed i said oh child the leanansidhe said smiling ive been doing this for a very long time all teaching involves an element of risk yeah i said and look at what happened to your last student her eyes glinted yes from nothing more than a terrified child in a mere score of years he grew into a weapon that all but utterly destroyed a world power the red court lies in ruins because of my student and it was in part my hand that shaped him i clenched my teeth harder and you want to do the same thing to molly potentially she has a talent for verisimilomancy versa what illusion child lea clarified she has a talent but i despair of her ever truly understanding what it is to cause terror thats what shes learning from you fear in essence you arent teaching her godmother teachers dont do that what is teaching but the art of planting and nurturing power lea replied mortals prattle on about lonely impulses of delight and the gift of knowledge and think that teaching is a trade like metalsmithing or healing or telling lies on television it is not it is the dissemination of power unto a new generation and nothing less for her as for you lessons demand real risk in order to attain their true rewards i wont let you turn her into a weapon godmother lea arched a redgold eyebrow showing her teeth again you should have thought of that before dying child what precisely will you do to stop me i closed my hands into impotent fists the turtlenecks had been briefly stymied but not stopped by the wall of flame it wasnt high enough i saw three of them moving together two of them linked their hands while a third backed off then sprinted toward the other two the runner planted his foot on the linked hands of his supporters and then both men lifted while the runner leapt they flung him a good twenty feet up and over the wall of flame the runner flipped neatly at the top of his arc and landed in a crouch holding a machete in his right hand a pistol in his left he calmly put two rounds directly into the shotgunwielding molly and two more into the pistolpacking version before the last shot rang out a second turtleneck had gone over the wall and landed beside the firstthe leader i noted he carried no obvious weaponry though his belt had been hung with several seashells in a manner that suggested they were dangerous equipment he remained in a crouch when he landed looking around with sharp steady eyes while his partner covered him shotgun molly crumpled slowly to the ground still fumbling at a pocket for more shells for the weapon while scarlet blood stained the fresh layer of thin snow twogun mollys head snapped back as a dark hole appeared in her forehead and her body dropped to the snow like a rag doll motorcyclechucking molly screamed and snatched up her fallen sisters guns the turtleneck on lookout raised his weapon but captain turtleneck moved his hand in a sharp negative gesture and the man lowered the weapon again both did nothing as the newly armed molly aimed the guns and began to fire puffs of snow flitted up from the ground a couple of times but neither was hit captain turtleneck nodded to himself and smiled crap hed figured it out coordinated squads of bad guys are one thing coordinated squads of bad guys being led by someone who remained observant and cool in the middle of combat chaos were far far worse ah disbelief lea murmured once the mark begins to suspect illusion is at work theres little point in continuing stop them i said to lea godmother please stop this she turned to blink at me and why should i captain turtleneck scanned the ground and i saw his eyes trace the line of footsteps molly had made when she had backed into the center of parking lot when the confrontation had begun his eyes flicked around and i could practically see the thoughts going through his head a trail of messy backward tracks suddenly ended in two clear boot prints the only molly in sight had proven to be an illusionand therefore the real molly must be nearby supporting the stillactive illusions around him where would she be standing that last set of boot prints seemed a logical place to look captain turtleneck drew one of the seashells from his belt murmured something to it and gave it an expert effortless flick it sailed through the air and landed only inches from my invisible apprentices toes oh lea said setting her mouth into a pouting moue pity she had such potential i gave my godmother my most furious glare and sprinted forward the shell began to glow with a urinecolored light it had worked for morty maybe it would work again i flung myself at molly focusing on protecting her and i felt myself slide into her merging and mingling from the soles of my feet to the crown of my head which hardly made sense given how much taller i was than sheone more example of the way physics doesnt necessarily apply to spirits i suddenly felt utterly exhausted frightened and at the same time in a state of euphoric exultation i could feel the various illusions dancing upon threads of my will demanding complete focus and concentration my legs and feet ached my ribs ached my face and shoulder hurt and then i felt myself choke then wonder what the hell was happening to me its me kid i thought as loudly as i could dont fight me i didnt know what the seashell would do but there wasnt much time to get particular i extended my left hand along with my will and murmured defendarius blue energy suddenly blazed up around molly and me in a sparkling sphere the seashell shone brighter and exploded into a sphere of pure white fire as hot and fierce as a microscopic nuclear warhead it lashed against the blue sphere like a bat hitting a baseball the sphere went flying taking us with it i braced my arms and legs against the sides of the sphere straining to hold it together without my shield bracelet i wasnt sure how long i could keep it up the sphere struck a car and bounded off it into the wall of the building its path had us careening tail over teakettle but our braced arms and legs kept us from smashing our head against the spheres interior we wobbled and rolled into a corner of the lot and i realized dully as i looked around that mollys illusions had vanished my bad the strength of the shield had cut her off from them and ended her ability to keep them going i looked up to find the turtlenecks advancing on us in a crowd and i dismissed the sphere landing in a crouch i gathered more of my will together and swept my arm from left to right with a murmured word and a second curtain of blue fire sprang up between me and the oncoming bad guys one of them gave the wall of flame a disdainful snort and calmly walked into it like i said im not much when it comes to illusions i am however reasonably good with fire the turtleneck didnt scream he didnt have time when fire is hot enough you never really feel the heat your nerves get fried away and all you feel is the lack of signal from themyou feel cold he died in the fire and he died cold the cinder that fell backward out of the fire could never have been casually identified as human now that got their attention i stood there holding the fire against the remaining turtlenecks the heat scorching away the thin layer of snow on the asphalt then making it bubble and quiver changing it into my own personal moat of boilinghot tar it was hard work to keep it going but ive never been afraid of that harry i need some room came a thought from molly hardly able to be heard over the blaze of concentration necessary for maintaining the fire i gritted my teeth it was like trying to hold an immensely heavy door open while half a dozen friends squeezed in around me i felt an odd sensation and increased weariness and blocked them both away i needed to focus to hold the turtlenecks away from molly once again the bad guys impressed me they knew that an intense magical effort could be sustained for only a limited amount of time they didnt risk losing more men to the fire instead they played it smart they just waited the fire blazed for another minute then two and as my control over it began to get shaky something attracted my attention flashing blue lights out on the lower avenue a cpd prowler had stopped across the entrance to the parking lot and a pair of cops guys id seen before got out and walked quickly into the lot flashlights up it took them about half a second to see that something odd was going on and then they had both guns and flashlights up before the turtlenecks could turn their guns on the police the officers had retreated to the cover offered by their car out of direct line of sight from the parking lot i could clearly hear one of them calling for backup swat and firefighters his voice tense and tight with fear i felt myself giggling with exhaustion and amusement as i grinned at captain turtleneck bad boys bad boys i sang offkey whatcha gonna do that made molly cough up a chittering belly laugh which shouldered my awareness aside and came bubbling out of our mouth captain turtleneck stared at me without expression for a moment he looked at the fire the moat and then at the police then he grimaced and made a single gesture the turtlenecks began to move as a single body retreating rapidly back the way they had come once i was sure they were gone i dropped the wall and slumped to the ground i sat there for a second dazzled by the discomfort and the weariness which i had rapidly grown accustomed to missing apparently the smell of hot asphalt a strangely summertime smell mingled with the scent of charred turtleneck i shivered then i made a gentle effort and withdrew from the same space molly occupied the weariness and pain vanished again so did the vibrant scents the grasshopper looked up and around sensing the change then she said hold on harry and fumbled at her pockets she produced a small silver tuning fork struck it once against the ground and then said i can hear you with this you can yeah no big deal she said her voice slurred with fatigue see you too if i line it up right and its easier to carry around than a bunch of enchanted vaseline weve got to get out of here i said before the cops show up theyd try to lock you up for a long time molly shook her head kid i know youre tired but we have to move no she said no cops i arched an eyebrow at her what never were any cops molly said i blinked looked at the empty entrance to the parking lot and then found myself slowly smiling they were another illusion and you sold it to the turtlenecks because they thought youd already blown your wad on the flashy stuff excellent purred lea appearing at my side again i flinched again man i hate that suddenappearance stuff an unorthodox but effective improvisation miss carpenter she continued adding complexity on the meta level of the deception was inspiredespecially against wellinformed adversaries uhhuh im a rock star molly said her voice listless lesson over the leanansidhe glanced at me and then back to molly still smiling indeed both of them chapter twentythree which only goes to prove that youre never too old too jaded too wiseor too deadto be hoodwinked by one of the fae you set her up i snarled for my benefit as a lesson for me child lea said of course not it was entwined with her own lesson as well molly smiled very slightly oh yes i feel i have grown tremendously from my experience of nearly being incinerated you saw that your survival depended on the protection of another my godmother responded her voice sharp without help from my godsons spirit you would have died there are a lot of people who can say something like that molly said theres no shame in being one of them lea looked from molly to me and then said children so emotionaland so rarely grateful i will leave you to consider the value of what i have this evening shown unto you both hold it i said you arent going yet lea looked at me with a flat expression oh no youre giving molly money first why would i do such a thing because shes hungry shes tired she survived your lesson and she needs to eat lea shrugged a shoulder what is that to me i scowled if youre her mentor your support of her physical needs while she learns is implicit in the relationship and since youre filling in for me anyway and since my choice right now would be to get food into her if you dont do it youll be failing in your duty the leanansidhe rolled her eyes and murmured with a trace of amusement now is when you choose to begin paying attention to proper protocol child apparently i said stop being cheap cough up the dough her green eyes narrowed dangerously i do not care for your tone child im through being intimidated by you i replied and to my surprise it came out in a calm and reasonable tone rather than a defiant one youre the one with an obligation im not being unreasonable pay up the leanansidhe turned to face me fully those feline eyes all but glowing with either anger or pleasure or maybe both molly ordered the moons over my hammy and hot chocolate i sat across the table from her at dennys my elbow on its surface my chin resting on the heel of my hand the table could support my elbow because i had decided it should her tuning fork sat upright on the table humming slightly directly between us shed said she could see me if i didnt move too far to the left or right molly tore into the food with a voracious appetite werent you the one always trying to get me to eat healthier i mused bite me she mumbled through a mouthful of food freaking ice age out there gotta have fats proteins carbs just to get my furnace going keep my body temperature up you know what else would keep it up i asked her being indoors she snorted and ignored me for several minutes venting a ravenous appetite onto the food i watched her and found it oddly fulfilling id been looking out for the grasshopper for a while it made me feel good to see her hunger being satisfied because of something i had done i guess ghosts have to take pleasure in the little victoriesjust like everyone else i waited until she was cleaning up the remains to ask so whats with the ophelia act in front of murphy and company she froze for a second then continued moving bits and pieces around her plate with somewhat less enthusiasm it isnt she exhaled slowly and her eyes moved around the room restlessly theres more than one reason im listening i said well who says its an act she flipped a couple of bits of hash brown onto her fork and then into her mouth look at me im sitting here talking to my dead mentor and half the restaurant is worried about it i looked around she was getting covert stares all right yeah but theres hardly anyone here she laughed a bit harshly that makes me feel better she put her cup of hot chocolate to her lips and just held it there trails of steam curling up around her blue eyes so youve finally been inside me i feel like i should be offering you a cigarette i choked and had to clear my throat um it wasnt like that kid of course it wasnt she said an edge in her voice it never was not for you i rubbed at the back of my neck molly when i met you i was a child who didnt need a bra she said its about your father too i said michael is the uncle you never had she said her voice still calm but crisp youve always wanted his approval because hes a good man and if he approves of you you cant be a total wreck i scowled at her ive never said that i said she looked at me through wisps of steam and said but its true all the same i had that worked out by the time i was about seventeen you were afraid that if you touched me youd be losing his approval that it would make you some kind of monster i was afraid that id be losing my approval of me i responded and not a monster molly just an asshole when i was a child she said still speaking very quietly youd have been right im in my midtwenties harry im not a child dont remind i paused then i said i was going to make an oldage joke i looked down at my immaterial self but all things considered she let out enough of a snort to stir the steam she took a slow drink of hot chocolate little inappropriate even if you were still alive but funnier i said youre not the one who is going to watch her entire family grow old and die harry she said it without malice not just my parents my brothers and sisters all of them im going to be beginning to get respect from other wizards about the same time hope and little harry are dying of old age maybe youll get lucky and someone will kill you first she shrugged leas been doing what she could about that if it happens it happens as long as theres a reason for it that kind of death wouldnt bother me i shivered just from the emotionless tone of her voice except for the dead part everyone dies harry she said theres no use whining about it i waited for a couple of beats and then said heres where you talk about how what you do with your life is whats truly important her head fell back and she let out a belly laugh it sounded warm and natural her eyes were just too wide though her smile too strained yeah exactly she shook her head and looked at me intently is that what its always like for you throwing fire that way i blinked and tried to change mental gears i didnt do it as smoothly as she had someone uncharitable or unbiased might note that it could be because molly had stripped said gears um oh back at the fight with the fomor guys they werent the fomor molly corrected me they were humans the fomor have altered theyre called turtlenecks i said she arched an eyebrow you and murphy both no theyre known as servitors the fomor muck around with them install things gills extra muscles organs for sonar nightvision eyes i whistled all kinds of fun she nodded the odd bits kind of turn to jelly when they die police are calling them transients i nodded and tried to keep the conversation casual a lot of them dying around here its chicago she said theres always someone dying around here and you should see what these these animals do harry they take people right out of their beds grab children waiting for the school bus theyve tortured people to death for fun as she spoke the calm in her voice had begun to fracture it wasnt dramatic just a break of her voice an inhalation between sentences that was a little too harsh you cant stand around doing nothing i said nodding no she said theyll come and scream at you in your sleep if you try so so molly was silent i didnt push five minutes went by before she closed her eyes and whispered its easy it shouldnt be so easy technically i didnt have a heart anymore it couldnt twist it couldnt break it did anyway the first one was paying off a cop gold coins he stood there with a little girl in a gym bag and paid the cop to look the other way she swallowed god if i could be like you have so much power to pour out like water from a hydrant but ive just got a squirt gun not even a super soaker just one of the little ones she opened her eyes and met mine but it was enough they didnt even know i was there molly i said gently what did you do an illusion a simple one i made the bag of gold look like a gun the cop drew his weapon and shot him but the servitor lived long enough to break the cops neck she held up a pair of fingers twofer for one little illusion i swallowed i couldnt speak her voice slowly gained volume there have been others like that i mean god they make it simple you just need an opportunity and the right little nudge at the right time green traffic light instead of a red one put a knife in someones hand or a wedding ring on one finger add a spot of blood to someones collar theyre animals they tear into one another like animals molly i said gently i started leaving the bits of rag on them she said it hurt at first being near that kind of experience it still hurts but i have to do it you dont know harry what you did for this town what do you mean you dont know how many things just didnt come here before because they were afraid afraid of what she looked at me as if her heart was breaking of you harry you could find anything in this town but you never even noticed the shadow you cast her eyes overflowed and she slashed at them angrily with one hand every time you defied someone every time you came out on top against things you couldnt possibly have beaten your name grew and they feared that name there were other cities to prey oncities that didnt have the mad wizard dresden defending them they feared you i finally understood the rag lady sometimes me molly said sometimes its lea shes like a kid on recess when she takes a shift im building a new name creating something else for them to fear i cant do what you did harry her eyes red and blue flashed with something dangerous deadly and she slammed the heel of her hand onto the table as she leaned toward me but i can do that i can kill them i can make the fuckers afraid she stared at me her breathing heavy it took her several seconds to look slowly around the room every eye in the place was locked on molly a waitress stood with wide eyes and a telephone against her ear molly looked around at them for a moment and then said god you people have it good you dont know you wouldnt know if one of them walked up to you and tore the thoughts out of your skull she rose grabbed the tuning fork and left a pile of wadded bills on the table she pointed at the waitress and said put the phone down or you wont get a tip the telephone dropped from the womans fingers and clattered on the floor see she said glancing back in my general direction its what i do its what im good for i sat there stunned and heartbroken unable to think of anything to say or do to help molly i watched my mad apprentice stalk out of the silent restaurant and into the frozen night chapter twentyfour i walked the shadowy streets thinking or at least trying to think when id been alive walking was something i did when i needed to chew something over engage the body in effort and activity and the purely physical manifestations of a mental problem stop being distractions i didnt have a body anymore but i didnt know how else to cope with so many overwhelming troubles so i walked silent and invisible my head down and i thought furiously as i went a single fact glared out at me blazing in front of my minds eye in stark reality illuminated by all the lives that were on fire around me in the end when it had mattered most id blown it i grew up an orphan with nothing but a few vague memories of my father before hed died my childhood hadnt been the kind of thing id wish on anyone i had run into some bad people justin was the worsta true monster when i was sixteen or seventeen still agonized by his betrayal and certain that i would never know anything like a home friends or family i made myself a promise i would never allow a child of mine to grow up as i haddriven from home to home an easy victim with no protector never stable never certain never when susan had asked me to help her recover maggie i went allin without a second thought the child was my daughter it didnt matter that i hadnt known about her or that i had never seen her with my own eyes there was a child of my blood who needed my help and protection i was her father i would die to protect her if need be end of story i may have had good reasons i may have had the best of intentions but intentions arent enough no matter how good they are intentions can lead you to a place where youre able to make a choice its the choice that counts to get my daughter back id crossed a line not just crossed it id sprinted at it and taken a flying freaking leap over it i made a pact with the queen of air and darkness giving away my free will my very self to mab in exchange for power enough to challenge the red king and his monstrous court that was stupid id had excuses at the time my back had been against the wall actually it had been broken and against a wall all the help id been able to call upon all the allies and tricks and techniques in my arsenal had not been enough my home had been destroyed so had my car i couldnt even get up and walk much less fight and the forces arrayed against me had been greatso great that even the white council of wizards was terrified of confronting them in that bleak hour i had chosen to sell my soul and after that i had led my closest friends and allies out on what i knew was practically a suicide mission id known that such a battle would put a savage strain on mollys psychic senses and that even if she did manage to survive she might never be the same id risked the two irreplaceable swords of the cross in my keeping sending them into the battle even though i knew that if we fell some of the worlds mightiest weapons for good would be captured and lost and when i saw that the sacrificial blood rite the red king had intended to destroy me could be turned back on the red court i had used it without hesitation i murdered susan rodriguez on a stone altar in chichén itzá and wiped out the red court i saved my little girl i created a perfect situation for chaos to engulf the supernatural world the sudden absence of the red court might have removed thousands of monsters from the world but it meant only that tens of thousands of other monsters were suddenly free to rise to expand into the vacuum id created i shuddered as i wondered how many other mens little girls had been hurt and killed as a result and god help me i would do it again it wasnt right it wasnt noble it wasnt good id spent less than three hours in the company of my daughterand so help me if it meant keeping her safe i would do it again maybe the white council needed an eighth law of magic the law of unintended consequences how do you measure one life against another can thousands of deaths be balanced by a single life even if mab had not had time to fully take possession of me how could i be sure that the very act of choosing to cross that line had not changed me into something monstrous i found myself stopped standing on the michigan avenue bridge over the chicago river the mounded snow filled the night with light only the waters below me were dark a black and whispering shadow the lethe and the styx in one i looked up at the towers nearby nbc trumps place the sheraton they stood tall and straight and clean in the night lights winked golden in windows i turned and stared south of me at the loop at the skyline i knew so well there was a rare moment of stillness down michigan avenue streetlights traffic lights a scattering of fresh snowflakes enough to keep everything pretty and white instead of slushy and brown god my town is beautiful chicago its insane and violent and corrupt and vital and artistic and noble and cruel and wonderful its full of greed and hope and hate and desire and excitement and pain and happiness the air sings with screams and laughter with sirens with angry shouts with gunshots with music its an impossible city at war with itself every horrible and wonderful thing blending together to create something terrifying and lovely and utterly unique i had spent my adult life here fighting bleeding to protect its people from threats they thought were purely imaginary and because of what id done the lines i crossed the city had gone mad fomor and their turtlenecks freakish ghost riots huddled groups of terrified folks of the supernatural community i hadnt meant for that to happen but that didnt matter i was the guy who made the choice this was all on me i stared down at the quiet blackness of the river i could go down there i realized running water would disrupt supernatural energy disperse it destroy the pattern in which it flowed and i was made out of energy now the black whispering river could make everything go away styx lethe oblivion my apprentice was bitter damaged my friends were fighting a war and it was tearing at their souls the one guy who i was sure could help me out had been snatched and there wasnt a whole lot i could do about it hells bells i was doing well just to find someone who could hear me talk what could i do what do you do to make up for failing everyone in your life how do you make it right how do you apologize for hideous things you never intended to happen i dont remember when i fell to my knees memories stirred by my rumination flooded over me almost as sharp and real as life those memories stirred others and brought them along like pebbles triggering a landslide my life in chicago rolled over me crushed me all the black pain and bright joy doubling me over ripping tears out of my eyes later it was quiet it was difficult a tremendous slow inertia resisted my desire but i pushed myself to my feet again i turned away from the river this city was more than concrete and steel it was more than hotels and businesses and bars it was more than pubs and libraries and concerts it was more than a car and a basement apartment it was home my home sweet home chicago the people here were my family they were in danger and i was part of the reason why that made things pretty clear it didnt matter that i was dead it didnt matter that i was literally a shadow of my former self it didnt matter that my murderer was still running around somewhere out there vague prophecies of captain murphy notwithstanding my job hadnt changed when demons and horrors and creatures of the night prey on this city im the guy who does something about it time to start doing i whispered i closed my hands into fists straightened my back and vanished chapter twentyfive i was ten minutes late to the meeting with fitz but he was still there lurking at a nearby storefront looking about as innocent as an only child near a fresh koolaid stain he had a huge empty sportsequipment bag hanging over one shoulder for the love of god the kid might as well have been wearing a stocking cap and a black mask with a giant dollar sign printed on the outside of his bag to boot i appeared next to him and said you look so relaxed and calm ill bet any cop that rolls by will ask you for tips on selfcontrol fitz twitched clearly controlling an instant instinct to flee then he spat on the frozen ground and said youre late harvey forgot to wind my watch i said and i was starting to think my brain had thrown a rod after all fitz looked up and down the street and shook his head but nothings ever that easy life can be a bitch that way i said so youre real im real fitz nodded you said you would help were you serious about that yes i said a gust of wind pulled his longish curly red hair out to one side it matched his lopsided smirk fine help okay i said turn left and start walking fitz put a fist on his hip and said you were going to help me with the guns never said that i said you need help kid not tools guns arent gonna cut it i waited for him to begin to speak before i interrupted him besides if you dont play along ive arranged for word to get to murphy about where you and your band of artful dodgers are crashing oh he snarled you you son of a bitch excuse me i said you can go fuck yourself you need help ive got it to give but there aint no free lunch kid i said in a calm and heartless tone you know that you can kiss my ass is what you can do he said and turned away go ahead and walk i said but youre throwing away your only chance to get your crew out from under baldy he stopped in the middle of taking a step if you bug out now where are you going to goback to baldy hell kill you for failing to get the guns and after that murphys crew and the rag lady will take out the whole building baldy will probably skate out on your buddies and do the same thing to some other batch of kids fitz turned his head in my general direction his eyes murderous but he was listening look kid doesnt have to be the end of the world if you work with me everythings peachy i was lying of course the last thing i wanted was to hand murphy a convenient target in her present frame of mind and i really did want to help the kidbut ive been where he was mentally he wouldnt have believed in a rescuer on a white horse in his world no one just gave anyone anything except maybe pain the best you could hope for was an exchange something for something and generally you got screwed even then i needed his cooperation handing him a familiar problem was the best way to get it im not a monster fitz and honestly i dont care about you and your goons or what happens to you but i think you can help meand im willing to help you in return if you do the young man grimaced and bowed his head its not as though i have a lot of choice is it weve all got choices i said calmly at the moment yours are limited you gonna play ball fine fitz spat fine whatever groovy i said hang a left and get going weve got some ground to cover he shoved his hands into his pockets his eyes sullen and started walking i dont even know who the hell you are my name is harry dresden i said fitz stumbled holy shit he said like that harry dresden the professional wizard the one and only he recovered his pace and shook his head i heard you were dead well yeah i said but im taking it in stride they say youre a lunatic fitz said oh yeah fitz nodded they also he frowned i could see the wheels spinning they also say you help people so so which is it youve got half a clue fitz i said you know that talk is cheap theres only one way to find out fitz tilted his head to one side and then nodded yeah so where we going to visit an old friend we went to a street toward the north end of the south side seedy wasnt a fair description for the place because seeds imply eventual regrowth and renewal parts of chicago are wondrous fair and parts of chicago look postapocalyptic this block had seen the apocalypse come grunted and said meh there were no glass windows on the blockjust solid boards mostly protected by iron bars and gaping holes buildings had security fences outside their entrances literally topped with razor wire youd need a blowtorch to get through them at least one of the fences in my line of sight had been sliced open with a blowtorch metal cages covered the streetlights toobut they were all out anyway tough to make a cheap metal cage that stops rounds from a handgun every flat open space had been covered in spraypainted graffiti which i guess were supposed to call urban art now except art is about creating beauty these paintings were territorial markers the visual parallel to peeing on a tree ive seen some gorgeous outlaw art but that wasnt in play here the thumpthud of a ridiculously overpowered woofer sent a rumbling rhythm all up and down the block loud enough to make the freshly fallen snow quiver and pack in a little tighter there was no one in sight no one granted it was getting late but thats still an oddity in chicago i watched as fitz took in the whole place and came to the same conclusion i had the first time id seen itthe obvious squalor the heavy security the criminally loud music with no one attempting to stop it this is territory he said coming to an abrupt halt im alone im unarmed and im not going there vice lords i said or they were a few years ago theyre a longterm gang so i assume they still are still not going there said fitz come on fitz i said they arent so bad for a gang they almost always have a good reason to kill the people they kill and they keep the peace on this street if you arent too far behind on your payments yeah they sound swell i shrugged though he couldnt see it police response time for this place is way the hell after everything has already happened people here are more likely to get help from a gang member than a cop if theyre in trouble youre a fan no i said it shouldnt be like this the gangs are dangerous criminals they rule through force and fear but at least they dont pretend to be anything else fitz grimaced and looked down to stare at his open palms for a moment then he said guess im not in a place where i can throw stones you couldnt break anything if you did i said youre of no use to me dead kid were not going down the block first place on the right if you dont walk past there you wont be crossing any lines fitz frowned the place with the metal shutters yeah you remember what i told you to say yeah yeah i remember the script fitz said scowling can we get this over with im not the one who can knock on the door he scowled more deeply and started walking the building he went to was part of a larger building that had once held four small businesses one had been a clinic one a lawyer and one a small grocery they were gutted and empty now only the fourth one remained the metal shutter over the doorway held the only thing that looked like actual art a nearly lifesized portrait of a rather dumpy angel the hem of his robe dirty and frayed his messy hair doing nothing to conceal his oncoming baldness he held a doughnut in one hand and had a sawedoff shotgun pointing straight toward the viewer in the other heh i said thats new fitz regarded the painting warily what is this place again a detective agency i said ragged angel investigations looks kinda closed fitz said nick cant afford an apartment i said he sleeps here he drinks sometimes you might have to be loud fitz eyed the block and then the door yeah great he rapped on the metal shutter nothing happened he repeated it knocking slightly louder and longer still nothing ticktock kid he glowered in my direction then he started pounding on the shutter in a heavy steady rhythm maybe five minutes later there was the click of a speaker evidently small enough to be concealed virtually in plain sight what said a cranky whiskeyroughened voice um fitz said are you nick christian who wants to know my name is fitz the kid said hed pitched his voice slightly higher than usual it made him sound a hell of a lot younger harry dresden said that if i was ever in trouble i could come to you there was a long silence then nicks voice said heavily dresden is history thats why im here fitz said i dont have anywhere else to go nick sounded annoyed dammit he told you to say that didnt he fitz looked slightly bemused well yes actually i am getting too old for this crap he growled then there were several loud clicks and a short heavy screech of metal and the shutter rolled up nick christian hadnt changed much since id last seen him he was short out of shape well past his fiftieth birthday and had sharp quick dark eyes that seemed to notice everything his bald spot was larger so was his stomach he was dressed in a white undershirt and boxer shorts and he held an old wooden baseball bat in his right hand he shivered and glared at fitz well boy get in out of the cold and keep your hands in sight or ill brain you fitz held his hands up in plain sight and went in i followed there was a threshold at the doorway but it was flimsy as hell and felt more like a sheet of saran wrap than a wall the muddling of business and home life in the same space was probably responsible i pushed through it following fitz right nick said close the shutter and the door turn all the locks fitz eyed nick for a moment streetwise and cynical the kid didnt like the idea of locking himself into a strange building with a strange old man its all right fitz i said he might kick your ass out his door if you give him trouble but he wont do anything to hurt you fitz glowered in my general direction again but he turned and followed nicks instructions we stood in his oneroom office it looked hell it looked almost exactly like mine had though id never compared the two in my head before old filing cabinets a coffee machine a desk and a couple of chairs that had been pushed all the way to one wall to make room for a simple folding cot on an aluminum frame nick also had a computer and a television set features my office never had nick was no wizardjust an old detective with a set of iron principles and a selfappointed mandate to help people find their lost children there were also seven pictures on his wall every one of them an eightbyten school photo of a child between the ages of six and thirteen the first few were faded the hair and clothing styles in them clearly aged nick went around to the back of his desk sat down pulled a bottle of rye from the top drawer and slugged back a swallow he capped it put it back and eyed fitz warily i dont get involved in dresdens line of work he said i know my limits the magic stuff fitz said nick shuddered and glanced at his top drawer yeah that so if you came here for that youre out of luck no fitz said its about gangs dresden said you knew them nick shrugged one shoulder some a man i know was abducted fitz said theres a description of the guy we think did it fitz dished out what i remembered about the thug who had broken into mortys house nick listened to it all without saying a word then he nodded once then he asked who is this man to you no idea fitz said youre the expert not the kidnapper nick sighed the victim fitz hardly hesitated my uncle nick mused over that then he said i am too old to get up in the middle of the night and get conned get out wait fitz said holding out a hand wait please nick opened the top drawer again but this time he came out with an old he didnt point it at fitz good try kid but ive been in this town a while walk back to the door and let yourself out dammit i muttered fitz listen to me tell him this word for word fitz listened nodded and then said i cant tell you everything for a reason mr christian dresden said you and he had an understanding that you wanted nothing to do with his side of the street i dont he said get out i fed fitz his next line he also said that you owed him a favor nick narrowed his eyes to slits what favor fitz listened to me then said all the money and fame the astor case brought you nick arched an eyebrow all the he looked away and shook his head he couldnt keep the smile off his mouth until he finally snorted when he spoke there was laughter under his words that sounds like harry the astor case had been about a little girl lost her parents cared more about the fame of having an abducted daughter than they did about her and when she ran off one day they hired the childrecovery specialist nick christian and his apprentice harry dresden to find her we did she hadnt been kidnapped but the astors had reported her so and in the absence of an actual perpetrator fingered nick and me it had been a trick and a half to get her safely back into her parents custody without going to jail there was a lawsuit afterward the judge threw it out but all in all finding that little girl had cost nick about two thousand bucks nick hadnt wanted to take the case i had talked him into it he had wanted to cut and run the moment i confirmed the kid was at liberty i had talked him into seeing it through being sure she was safe when id completed my apprenticeship nicks graduation present had been to forgive me the two grand i owed him you were tight with him nick asked he was sort of my adviser fitz said sometimes its almost like hes right there next to me still nick grunted investigation apprentice or the other kind fitz put on a sober face im not at liberty to say hngh nick said nodding heard hed picked up an apprentice youre holding back to keep me distanced from the situation yes and you just want the information you dont want me to work the field on it thats right a wwww nick said he scratched at his ear and said yeah i guess what else can you tell me about this guy i fed fitz his lines he was crazy nick snorted whole hell of a lot of gangers are crazy kid or the next best thing less moneydrugssexviolence crazy fitz said more creepycult crazy hngh nick said lines appeared on his brow theres one where they all wear the hoodies with the hoods up all the time got rolling maybe three or four years back they dont call themselves anything but the gangs call them the big hoods no one knows much about them perfect i said to fitz sounds like the assholes were looking for ask him where theyre set up a tunnel under the eisenhower expressway on the south end of the meatpacking district the other gangs think theyre crazy to be where the cops move so freely but the big hoods never seem to attract any police attention he scrunched up his eyes dont think they even claim any territory thats all i got because they arent a gang per se i said excellent fitz lets move thank you fitz said to nick thank dresden wouldnt have said that much to anyone else ill do that fitz stared intently at nick for a moment and then said what do you do here as a private cop nick asked take some cruddy work to keep the lights ondivorces and so on but mostly i look for lost kids doing it a while fitz asked thirty years find any plenty find any in one piece nick stared hard at fitz for a long time then he pointed a finger up and behind him to the row of portraits on the wall seven fitz asked seven nick said in thirty years you live like this and seven thats it thats all nick leaned back in his chair and gave fitz a small smile thats enough outside fitz said to me hes crazy yeah i said and he helps people fitz frowned and moved hurriedly back out of the vice lords domain he was silent for several blocks seemingly content to walk beside me and think eventually he looked up and asked you still there yeah all right i helped you pay up okay i said take a right at the next corner why so i can introduce you to someone who will help fitz made a rude sound you really love not telling people things dont you i dont love it so much as im just really good at it fitz snorted does this guy drink too nah sober as a priest fine fitz sighed and kept trudging chapter twentysix youve got to be kidding me said fitz we were standing outside saint mary of the angels calling the place a church is like calling lake michigan a swimming hole its huge literally taking up an entire city block and an architectural landmark of chicago gorgeously built a true piece of gothic art both inside and out st marys had often served as a refuge for people with the kind of trouble fitz was facing the kid was not in good shape wed done a considerable bit of hiking that evening and despite what might have been the beginnings of a thaw it was still below freezing and the slight lack of bitter cold in the wind wasnt stopping it from cutting through fitzs layers of mismatched clothing and his old jacket those lean gangly kids have the worst of it when winter sets in they lose their body heat fast hed been making up for it in exercise but he was getting tired and i remembered that he probably hadnt eaten since id seen him before the previous days sunrise he stood clutching his arms around his body shivering and trying to look like nothing was wrong his teeth were chattering i know a guy here i said go around to the back door and knock until someone answers ask for father forthill fitz looked skeptical whats he gonna do for me give you a blanket and some hot food for starters i said look kid im giving you my a game here forthills a decent guy this is what he does fitz clenched his jaws this isnt getting me the guns back i cant go back without them if i cant go back i cant get my crew out go inside i told him talk to forthill get some food in you if you decide you want to go back and try to sneak the guns out of that drift on your own youll have plenty of time before dawn fitz set his jaw stubbornly your choice man i said but going hungry in cold like this is hard on the body you had whatseven weapons most of them submachine guns comes out to maybe forty pounds call it fifty if you bring back all the clips and ammo think you can burrow into a halffrozen snowbank get all those guns out load them up and walk for most of an hour in the coldest part of the night on an empty stomach without a cop spotting you and wondering what a guy your age is doing on the dark streets so late carrying a really heavy bag he grunted at least have a damned sandwich fitzs stomach gurgled audibly and he sighed yeah okay it took fitz five minutes to get anyone to answer the door and when it finally opened a dour sourlooking elderly man in a heavy brown bathrobe vaguely reminiscent of a monks habit opened the door his name was father paolo and he took himself very seriously fitz told him that he needed to see father forthill that it was a matter of life and death only after several minutes of emphasizing his original statement did father paolo sigh and invite fitz in stay there paolo said pointing a stern finger at fitz fitz pointed at the ground questioningly and then nodded got it then he deliberately took a small shufflestep to one side as the priest began to turn away drawing a scowl worthy of at least a cardinal i probably shouldnt have undermined paolos authority by chuckling like that but come on thats comedy forthill came down the hall from his chambers a few moments later dressed in flannel pajamas and a heavy black terrycloth robe he had thick fuzzy house shoes on his feet and his fringe of hair was standing up every which way his bright blue eyes were a little watery and squinty without the aid of his glasses he blinked at fitz for a moment and then said can i help you my son harry dresden said you could fitz said forthill raised his eyebrows ah perhaps you should come with me fitz looked around and then nodded i guess forthill beckoned and led fitz back down some hallways to the neat modest chamber where he slept and lived it was maybe ten feet square and contained a bed a desk a chair and a couple of lamps forthill let fitz in then closed the door behind the young man please have a seat my son fitz looked around for a moment then sat down on the chair forthill nodded and sat on the edge of his bed first things first he said his eyes twinkling should i give you a good setup line for you to make a pithy comment about catholic priests and sexual abuse of young men or would you prefer to find your own opening during the conversation fitz blinked a couple of times and said what such remarks are apparently quite popular i wouldnt want to deny you the enjoyment oh uh no thats all right father forthill nodded gravely as you wish shall we talk about your problems now all right well then the priest said perhaps you should start by telling me when dresden told you to come to me for help uh fitz said he glanced around as if looking for me go ahead i told him just tell him the truth its all right fitz took a deep breath and said about thirty minutes ago father forthills eyebrows tried to turn themselves into a toupee oh yeah fitz said his eyes restless i uh i hear dead people that must be disconcerting im not crazy fitz said quickly i never thought you were my son forthill said fitz gave him a suspicious scowl you believe me the old man gave him an imps grin im well aware of the supernatural facets of our cityand that the streets have been particularly dangerous for the past six months or so thats putting it sort of lightly father fitz said he nodded im sure your experience has not been a gentle one he said i wont add to it with my own disbelief fitz bit his lower lip for a moment okay i am also aware forthill continued that dresdens shade is apparently taking a hand in things i assume thats who youve spoken to yeah forthill nodded and looked around the room hes hes here with you isnt he wow i said points for forthill yeah fitz sighed he kinda doesnt shut up forthill chuckled he ishe wasa very determined young man hasnt changed fitz said i see the priest said my son i am sure you understand that these are perilous times i am afraid that i must ask for some kind of confirmation that this entity is who he says he is fitz looked at the priest blankly then around the room you hear that yeah i said i walked over to the far wall of the room and stuck my head through it on the other side was a dark space a hidden storage compartment just large enough to contain a couple of small file cabinets the concealed compartment had been unknown to anyone but forthill until i worked a case for an archangel a while back michael carpenter and i had seen him open the hidden cabinet come over here i said knock on the wall right here forthill will know what it means uh dude fitz said i cant see where you are i sighed can you hear my voice yeah he said but its just like this disembodied thing theres not much direction to it which made sense he was not actually physically hearing me speak fitzs gift to sense spirits simply expressed itself as something his mind could interpretin this case auditory stimulus uh okay i said walk over to the back wall of the room the one you were facing when you came through the door fitz said to forthill hes trying to tell me how to prove he isnt full of crap then he stood up and walked across the room okay i said put your hand out on the wall now move to your right little more little more too far okay now about nine inches down and rap on it with your knuckles fitz did all of that and finally knocked on the wall then he turned to forthill and said mean anything to you the old priest pursed his lips and nodded indeed indeed it does man fitz said shaking his head old people forthill smiled at that well my son are you as cold and hungry as you look fitz tried to look nonchalant i could eat i guess how long has it been since youve had a hot shower fitz rolled his eyes and said now if that isnt a straight line i dont know what is forthill chuckled and spoke to the air dresden im sure that youre in a hurry and that there is some kind of dire deadline but im not talking business with you until the young man is seen to he said to fitz that door leads to my bathroom theres a shower theres a cardboard box under the sink with several items of clothing in it i keep them on hand for events such as this feel free to take any of them fitz just stared frowning uh okay get cleaned up forthill replied his tone firm ill go round up something to eat while you do do you prefer tea or cocoa um fitz said i guess cocoa excellent taste forthill said if you will excuse me he left the room quietly fitz started looking around the room immediately i doubt theres much to steal i said forthill isnt really into material things you kidding look at this place pillows blankets he looked under the bed three pairs of shoes its a hell of a lot more than my crew has zero rolls in four pairs of socks and some old moccasin house slippers guys offering you clothes and food i said youre not seriously going to steal his stuff are you fitz shrugged you do what you have to do to live man i do everyone does nothing personal he looked in forthills closet at maybe half a dozen outfits worth of clothing and shook his head ah hell notice if i try to take any of this stuff he looked toward the bathroom go ahead i said you can lock the door behind you im telling you kid forthill is one of the good guys thats makebelieve there aint no good guys fitz said or bad guys theres just guys youre wrong about that i said heard that one before people who want to use you always say theyre the good guys fitz said youre one of them right heh i said no im an arrogant ass but i know what a good guy looks like and forthill is one of them whatever man fitz said i havent had a shower in two weeks if i tell you to buzz off will you do it or do i have to keep hearing you yammer sorry fitz you arent my type he snorted went into the bathroom and locked the door behind him i heard the water start up a moment later i stood in the priests empty chamber for a moment looking around it everything there was plain modest functional and cheap the quilt covering the bed looked like it might have been made for forthill by his mother when he went to seminary there was a king james bible next to the bed it too looked worn and old i shook my head granted my life hadnt exactly been featured on an mtv series covering the excesses of the rich and famous but even id had more than forthill did how could a man go through life with so little nothing of permanence nothing built up to leave behind him nothing to testify to his existence at all the kind of man who isnt focused on his own existence i guess the kind of man who cares more about others than he does himselfto the point of spending the whole of his life a life as fleeting and precious as anyone elses in service to his faith and to humanity there was no glamour in it no fame forthill and men like him lived within their communities where they could never escape reminders of exactly what they had missed out on yet he never called attention to himself over it never sought sympathy or pity how hard must it be for him to visit the expansive loving carpenter family knowing the whole time that he could have had a family of his own did he ever spend time dreaming of what his wife would have been like his children he would never know i guess thats why they call it sacrifice i found forthill in the churchs kitchen assembling a meal from leftovers when id been the one taking shelter in the church it had been sandwiches fitz was rating a larger meal hot soup a couple of sandwiches turkey and tuna respectively a baked potato an ear of corn on the cob and a small salad a few seconds after i walked into the kitchen forthill paused aimed a vague smile at the room and said hello harry assuming thats you of course its me father i replied i mean he couldnt hear me and i knew it but it just seemed sort of rude not to say anything i had a difficult conversation with karrin this evening forthill said she told me that you had found the persons who shot at her home last night and that you want us to help them i know i sighed it sounds insane but i think that to karrin you must have sounded quite insane he continued but i consider your reaction to be remarkable for its compassion i can only presume that the boy is one of these gang members he finished off the food preparations and turned to face me more or less dont worry i have no intention of bringing ms murphy into this situationat least not for the time being her judgment has been clouded since your death and grows more so as the fighting goes on i felt myself relax a little i hoped you wouldnt i will grant the boy sanctuary here for now ill talk with him im sure he will tell me the particulars of his situation after that i will have to act in accordance with my conscience cant ask a man for more than that father i said thank you he picked up the simple wooden tray laden with fitzs meal and stood there for a moment its a shame we cant converse i would love to hear about your experience i should think it would be fascinating a chronicle of one of the most enigmatic functions of creationdeath itself nah i said the mystery doesnt stop even after you get to the other side theres just a lot more paperwork also i find it interesting that you are here on holy ground forthill said if i remember correctly the last ghost who attempted to enter this church couldnt even touch the building much less wander freely around it what does it mean he shook his head bemused i suppose youd be the one to ask eh he tipped his head in a polite if badly aimed nod and left the room it was an excellent question the thing about ghosts and holy ground when leonid kravos aka the nightmare had come to kill one of my clients id stashed at the church he hadnt been able to get in hed torn up several thousand dollars worth of landscaping and flower beds in sheer frustration the nightmare had been a more powerful shade than i was at the moment so why could i make myself at home when hed been stopped as cold as the big bad wolf at the third little pigs house note to self i said look into apparent mystic anomaly later help your friends now i sometimes give myself excellent advice occasionally i even listen to it it was time to pay a visit to the grey ghost and the big hoods chapter twentyseven i headed for the big hoods hideout with several important facts in mind fact one the big hoods themselves could not do me harm fact two there wasnt diddly i could do to the big hoods fact three the big hoods were apparently led by this grey ghost a spirit that had been tossing lightning around with impunity during the attack on mortys house that meant that the grey ghost was the shade of someone with at least a sorcerers level of talent and while i felt sure i could defend myself against such an assault if i was ready for it if i got blindsided i might end up like sir stuart quicker than you could say kazot fact four the grey ghost had a bunch of lemurs hanging around while my own spectral evocations might not be able to affect the living they would sure as hell work on lemurs and the like i could handle them easily oneonone but it seemed likely that they would come at me in waves or maybe try to wear me down by throwing a horde of wraiths at me first fact five if the grey ghost was giving the orders to mortal cultists they might have taken measures of their own to deal with ghosts there might be circle traps prepared there might be wards or other magical barriers there might be dangerous substances like ghost dust if i went in all fat and happy and confident i could wander right into serious trouble fact six there were all kinds of spiritual beings in the wide universe and ghosts were only a tiny cross section of them i had to be ready for anything another entity of some sort might well wander in drawn by the conflict or hell for all i knew one might already be taking a hand no closed minds dresden i ordered myself dont get suckered into thinking this is one limited smallscale problem theres every chance it might be part of a much much larger problem if my afterlife went anything like my life had that seemed a safe bet fact seven sooner or later dammit i was going to start laying out a little chastisement where it was long overdue i flashed back to several vivid memories of when i had done exactly that images of violence and flame and hideous foes flickered through my head sharp and nearly real the emotions that accompanied those memories came along for the ride but they were one step removed distant enough to let me process them identify them rage of course rage at the creatures who were trying to harm the innocent or my friends or me that rage had been both a weapon and armor to me in moments of mortal peril it was always there and i always welcomed its arrivalbeing filled with anger was infinitely preferable to being filled with terror but seeing it in my heightened memories it made me feel a little sick rage was a word we used for anger when it was being used in the cause of rightbut that didnt sanctify it or make it somehow laudable it was still anger violent dangerous anger as deadly as a flying bullet it just happened to be a bullet that was aimed in a convenient direction fear next always fear it doesnt matter how personally courageous you are when something is trying to kill you and you know it youre afraid its a mindless lizardbrain emotion theres no way to stop it courage is about learning how to function despite the fear to put aside your instincts to run or give in completely to the anger born from fear courage is about using your brain and your heart when every cell of your body is screaming at you to fight or fleeand then following through on what you believe is the right thing to do the white council blamed me for causing trouble with various supernatural evils and while im not quite arrogant enough to blame all the worlds problems on my mistakes they probably had a point i have issues with bullies and authority figures and i refuse to stand by and do nothing when those too weak to defend themselves become victims but how much of that had been courage and how much of it had been me embracing my probably righteous anger so that i wouldnt feel the fear as the memories flipped by i saw myself again and again throwing myself into the firesometimes literallyto help someone who needed it or to kill something that needed killing the tidal surges of my emotion had propelled me fueled my magic and many times they had made it possible to survive when i wouldnt have otherwise but when id been running on adrenaline id rarely stopped to consider the extended consequences of my actions by saving susan from bianca of the red court i had offered a highprofile insult to the entire vampire nation when duke ortega had shown up to challenge me to a duel to restore the honor of the red court and forestall a war it had ended in a bloodbathand it had never occurred to me to attempt to ensure any other outcome as a result of the disastrous duel a wizard named ebenezar mccoy my grandfather had brought an old soviet satellite down from its orbit right on top of ortegas stronghold no one survived then arianna ortegas wife the daughter of the red king had sought her own vengeance even as the red court launched a fullscale war ariannas vengeance had materialized in the form of murdering my daughters foster family and abducting her once susan heard about it she got in touch and again i flung myself into fire without a thought none of those things had to happen i mean i wasnt the only guy in the world who had driven that course of events i knew that but i had been the guy who had been standing at the tipping point between possible outcomes with depressing regularity could i have done something differently was it even possible to know in my memories i murdered susan rodriguez again time heals all wounds they say but i somehow knew i wouldnt be able to escape this one granted only a few days subjective time had passed since the events of that evening so the memory was still fresh in my painfully clear recollection but time wasnt going to help much with what i had done and it probably shouldnt i wanted to hurt the grey ghost and its merry band of shades i wanted to hurt them badly make them feel the vitriol burning inside my belly i wanted to take them on and smash them to flinders upon my will but maybe i should pause for a moment maybe i should think maybe i should reject both anger and fear and strive for an outcome beyond kicking down the door and smashing everything in my way play it smart play it responsible little late for you to be learning that lesson now isnt it dummy i asked no it was never too late to learn something the past is unalterable in any event the future is the only thing we can change learning the lessons of the past is the only way to shape the present and the future why did i want this fight so badly heres a thought genius i said to me maybe its got something to do with maggie maggie my little girl i would never see her grow up i would never get to watch for any signs of manifesting talent so that i could teach her and give her the choice of how to live her life i would never get to hear her sing a song or go trickortreating or send her a present for christmas i would never at some point during that dark thunderstorm of regret fire had erupted from seemingly every surface of my body a furious redgold flame it wasnt hot at first but after a few seconds it got uncomfortable and rapidly progressed to actual pain i ground my teeth closed my eyes and forced order upon my thoughts tried to replace the outrage with cool steady logic several seconds later the fire died away i opened my eyes slowly eyeing the scorch marks on my coat and a blister or two on my exposed skin clear bubbles of ectoplasm dribbled from the blisters so yeah i said you may have anger issues where maggie is concerned harry heh you think got a rocket i sang in your pocket turn off the juice boy show tunes really it wasnt bad enough that youve started talking to yourself man now youre doing performing art but the musically inclined me had a point play it cool boy i whispered real cool i approached the big hoods lair obliquely and cautiously one might even accuse me of being overly cautious i circled the lair from all angles including up above in a slow spiralshaped pattern that only gradually drew closer i held a veil over myself the entire time too it wasnt any easier as a ghost than it had been in the flesh and i still couldnt throw the greatest veil in the world but i managed to make myself if not invisible at least difficult to see i wasnt there to fight i was there to learn mort needed my help but maybe the best way to give it to him wasnt to go charging in like a rogue rhinoceros knowledge is power i needed all the power i could get if i was going to help morty the problem was that the grey ghost had apparently marshaled supporters of both the spirit and the fleshand i couldnt fight the damned crazy thugs who just happened to be made of solid matter id need help maybe i could hop into morty again and toss out enough power to let him run awaybut that assumed morty would let me step in at all he sure as hell didnt seem to like it the first time it also assumed that he would be free and able to physically escape and that i could neutralize his material captors there was no guarantee either of those things would be the case i thought that the tip from nick was a good one i think he had identified the right bunch of yahoos and i had faith in his knowledge of chicago streets after a lifetime walking themand survivingnick was an expert chicago pds gang unit sometimes went to him for advice sometimes he even gave it to them but any expert could be wrong if the grey ghost was wily enough to have a hideout separate from its material mooks living quarters and had stashed mort there i was about to waste a whole lot of time but how would it get a setup of its own without physical help to establish it if it was strong enough i supposed it could have a demesne of its own in the neverneverthe spirit world id dealt with a ghost named agatha hagglethorn once and shed had her own little pocket dimension filled with a victorianera copy of chicago it burned down i was not responsible anyway i had to wonder if the grey ghost didnt have a similar resource it would make one fine hideyhole to avoid annoying things like sunrise daylight and recently deceased wizards i paused for a moment to consider a notion i wondered if i could establish a demesne of my own i mean theoretically i knew how it would work granted theres as much space between theory and practice in magic as there is in physics but it isnt an unbridgeable gap i was reasonably sure that it could be done maybe i could get butters to let me talk shop with bob for a few minutes hed know what i needed to make it happen i was sure but what would i make it look like i mean in theory i could make it practically anything i wanted im sure there would be some kind of energytoarea requirement that would limit it in absolute terms but if i wanted i could make it look like the taj mahal or the old aladdins arcade where i used to play video games back before my magic made it all but impossible i could have a mansion i could probably make some kind of simulacrum of a butler if i wanted i sighed bob would i was certain suggest simulacrum french maids tottering around in stiletto heels as his first and most conservative contribution it would only get more depraved from there in the end there was really only one of a couple of things my demesne could possibly be a burger king restaurant or my old apartment the one that had burned with the rest of my life suddenly there was no appeal in considering my own demesne anymore stop wasting time i told myself i shook off the thoughts and continued my stalk of the big hoods clubhouse sniffing around for possible magical defenses alarm spells seemed most likely but i had to assume that a ghostly sorcerer could create as much destructive mayhem as a mortal one i could run into anything from illtempered guardian entities to a magical equivalent of claymore antipersonnel mines hell id seen a vampires nest that used actual ap mines nasty toys i would be keeping an eye out for any physical defenses as well in the event i needed to warn murphy or her crew about them when i showed up for the actual rescue operation for the op i corrected myself sounds cooler if you call it the op i moved closer veil in place senses tuned to the possibility of danger definitely murphy would call it the op the entrance to the hideout was just where nick had said it would be beneath an overpass where a steel door had once led to an old cityworks storage area i found no suspect magic in the immediate area around the bridge which made sense if i had been spreading detection spells around my own hideout i wouldnt have gone to the trouble to set them up where the sunrise would obliterate them every morning to make something that lasted longer than a day or two at most considerable effort was required at the very least youd have to use some kind of physical object to harbor the spells energy technically you could use any object though it was not unheardof for wizards to utilize whatever they happened to have in their pockets at the time its probably where all the old stories of enchanted spindles combs brushes and mirrors come from most often the magical energy was channeled into carvings or painted symbols id once set up a rental storage unit as a shortterm haven in case things ever went to hell id laid up about a hundred small protective spells on the walls floor and ceiling of the place in various colors of paint the energy inside them was stored in the paint safe from the sunrise and ready to project a shield whenever the symbols felt the touch of hostile magic but a monitoring spell wouldnt be the kind of thing that could lie dormant it had to actually be looking around all the time that meant a constant modest expenditure of energy which would in turn be exposed and vulnerable to sunrise land minetype spells were a lot easier like my protective spells only with more kaboom in them i wasnt surprised that i didnt find any of those outside the hideout few people would host a picnic underneath the overpass but it was chicago and all sorts of folks would be through this area during the day random people being horribly incinerated would certainly draw the attention of the local authorities and possibly that of the white council the grey ghost didnt seem to be an idiot no death traps were left lying around where some schoolkid or bum might stumble into them i wouldnt have set up like that either it made far more sense for such sentry spells to be laid down underground deep enough for the steady presence of the earth to shield the spell energy from disruption the grey ghost was smart things would get interesting about fifteen or twenty feet down i finished my last circuit of the site and moved to the door i reached out a hand and stopped with my palm about an inch away from the metal i sensed something subtle but there like the attractive field around an old weak magnet i frowned and focused on it finding a spell of a composition unlike anything id ever seen before it was something subliminal sending out a kind of beckoning energy that i wouldnt have noticed had i not been specifically looking for something like it it would otherwise have been buried in the background energy of the city and its inhabitants i stretched out a hand to touch the stream of energy flowing steadily outward it oozed over the surface of my skin a crawling sensation that made me shudder its smarter not to play around with unfamiliar magic besides i had other things to do i lowered my hand and stepped toward the source of the music id begun hearing in my head at some point there was little sense wasting more time up on the surface and i hadnt heard that song in forever but i could still sing along i started humming and and stopped myself with my nose about half an inch from the steel door i broke out into a cold sweat hells bells that magic hadnt been heavyduty but it had been puissant a few seconds after touching it i had almost walked blindly and mindlessly through the door and into whatever reception was prepared for intruders on the other side i couldnt know exactly what was over there without getting a look but it sure as hell wasnt a gift basket and a bottle of wine i stepped back from the door and the siren spell with what i felt was a properly darwinian appreciation of the danger it represented oh it might not blow you up like the defensive wards id had on my apartment but a scalpel can open up your arteries just as readily as a sword in some cases more so i shivered and clutched my arms to my belly that spell wasnt the work of a novice or marauding sorcerer experimenting with magic hed found in the metaphysical section of a bookstore whoever had put that thing together had been a true professional one with centuries of experience one who was probably more capable than i when it came to magic dont get me wrong im hoss when the spells start flying mine are some of the flashiest most violent on the planet im like the andre the giant of the supernatural world ive got a lot of power and mass to throw around andre would be a great person to have on your side in a brawl against a rowdy tavern crowd but in a more focused situation he would be at the mercy of professionals who while lacking his raw power could nonetheless apply their own strength more efficiently and effectively murphy was an excellent example of that kind of fighter she wasnt much bigger than a bread box but id seen her toss around guys weighing most of three hundred pounds like they were unruly puppies if the grey ghost was responsible for that spell then i was lucky to have survived our first meeting the smart move would be to scamper if it came to a fair fight i might find myself completely outclassed i felt a shivering cold presence on the back of my neck and turned to find wraiths nearby they drifted toward the hideout from all directions coming in a slow steady procession and moving in perfectly straight lines the siren spell made sense to me now it wasnt a guard spell though it could certainly have that purpose it was also a beacon a dinner bell being rung to signal the mindless horde now approaching they never sped up never slowed they just kept floating forward until they began to pass through the closed steel door in groups of two and three as they converged upon it i pursed my lips thinking the grey ghost wasnt killing wraiths it was using them for the moment at least there wouldnt be any kind of guard spell on the other side of the door there couldnt be or the grey ghost would be slaughtering its own troops and wasting its own investment of time and energy to boot i might have an opportunity here the inbound wraiths would almost certainly be routed by what amounted to a cattle chute that route would most likely be clear of supernatural booby traps it might be possible to gain entry find a vulnerable point along the chute and then duck out of it to run a quick reconnaissance of the grey ghosts headquarters and find mort it took half an hour for the procession to be complete and the flow of wraith traffic never let up i stopped counting them at and swallowed that wasnt a herd of wraiths that was a bloody horde if one of the wraiths decided it wanted to eat me it would have to perform a miracle to divide me into enough pieces to feed all of its dinner company my veil seemed to have prevented me from being noticed as they approached but that could just as easily be the effect of the beacon spell for all i knew once the beacon shut off theyd all turn around and come at me like greyhounds leaving the gate it would require a singularly stupid man to go hang around in narrow tunnels and cramped spaces alongside a threat like that and i harry dresden am that man i stated i waited for the last wraith to go in and counted to twenty my mouth felt dry fear boiled in my belly and made my knees feel unsteady my fingers trembled i told them all that they were just preconceived residual memories anyway and that i would tolerate no guff from them then i ground my teeth and followed the horde chapter twentyeight i slipped through the steel door and into the blackness on the other side i ignored the darkness until it went away and then began to move stealthily forward i stopped with the scoobydoo action a couple of feet later and just started walking i mean honestly sneaking it wasnt as though i could step on a twig or accidentally kick an old can and make a sound right being a ghost the problem wasnt being sneakyit was getting noticed in the first place besides nobody who was concerned about detecting my presence would be using their ears to sense me coming i began extending my wizards senses out in front of me when i say wizard senses i mean it in a similar fashion to spider sense spideys enhanced senses detect when hes in danger and warn him that hes got incoming a wizards senses dont do that though i suppose with enough work someone could come close what they do sense is the presence of magic in both its natural state and its worked forms you dont have to be concentrating to make it happenits natural in every practitioner the theory ive heard espoused most often is that the ability to sense such energies makes it possible for a regular person to become a wizard providing the kind of sensory feedback he needs to gradually work with more and more energy so while a regular person who lacked the sense could technically learn how to use magic without it it would be a process as difficult as someone who was born blind teaching himself to paint i focused on that sense in me partially blocking out my less important physical senses to give greater attention to the presence of magic in my surroundings it was pretty thick in here the door led to a concrete stairway going down into the earth and each step bore lit candles and thickly painted magical symbols the latent energy in the paint was almost devoid of arcane power barely detectable but it was there and i saw it as faint phosphorescence the energy of the beacon spell was still going strong somewhere in my head i had evidently decided to interpret it as a sound because i could hear its slow throb like a bass beat on a big woofer i went down the stairs my senses attuned to the ground at my feet what looked like one more bit of barely magical scribbling could be concealing something far more potent and dangerousbut it didnt i went down two flights of stairs unmolested the bottom of the stairway opened onto a rectangular room that had once been some sort of electrical junction it obviously wasnt in service anymore large steel boxes and glassfaced readouts were spotted with rust and dust there was more of the occult writing down hereall of it disjointed and fantastically disconnected as if someone had composed a poem in a foreign language by randomly stringing together words from a dictionary it all bore the same trace amounts of magical energy as the writing on the stairs the big hoods evidently had a certain amount of latent talent which seemed to fit together with the idea of the grey ghost recruiting some mortal flunkies to assist it in in whatever the hell he or she was trying to do what was he or she trying to do i mean i knew the grey ghost had attacked morts place but why why take mort to begin with granted the little ectomancer could probably be a pain in the ass to any ghost who got too ambitious in chicago but the grey ghosts ambitions seemed to have been limited to gunning for morty what could he possibly have to offer as a target at the far end of the junction room there was a gaping ragged hole in the wall that looked like it had been made with sledgehammers it opened onto a rough tunnel beyondthe beginnings of undertown proper a mans anguished scream came from the opening i nearly burst into a sprint but stopped myself unthinking sprints were a good way to get killed rekilled instead i moved forward into the roughhewn corridor it was cold and damp and slime and mold were everywhere i unimagined the strong musty smell that would otherwise have filled my nose and paced forward watching for traps and working hard not to move my feet in time with the bassdrum rhythm of the beacon spell i passed a number of alcoves that joined the corridor they were individual quarters for the big hoods apparently each contained a mattress or an air mattress and something resembling bedding only covered with mildew and mold each had a box or a couple of bags containing what i presumed to be personal belongings more arcane gibberish covered the walls along with slogans such as the lizard folk are already here watch for their eyes a couple of them looked occupied with large bulky forms snoring under the disgusting blankets a minute or two later the passage opened up into a torchlit room about the size of a hockey rink the entrance was high up on one wall so that my head was level with the larger rooms ceiling there were stairs cut into the wall beneath my feet so that i could walk down them into the large roomwhich i didnt as it was packed full of bad guys i swallowed and made sure my veil was still running strong the bass beat of the beacon hammered loudly here coming from a pit that had been cut into the floor it must have been at least ten feet across and i couldnt tell how deep it was it was surrounded by written formulae that were far less nonsensical than the others and they sent out flashes of dim red light in time with each pulse of the beacon the pit was full of wraiths they swirled round and round in steady mindless motion each of them overlapping with dozens of others so that it looked less like a group of beings moving in a circle than some bizarre stew with the occasional recognizable portion of human anatomy appearing above the mix the hollow notscream of the emptyeyed wraiths was a huge and hideous sound one that surged in time with the beacon maybe two dozen lemurs were scattered around the room theyd lowered their hoods and without their faceless menace to back them up they just looked like people some were standing some were sitting another group was playing cards still others just stared at nothing bemused a group of big hoods was gathered around the pit all but two of them on their knees and chanting they bowed at regular intervals and clapped their hands together at others a gallows that looked like it had been constructed out of a driveway basketball goal hung over the pit with a pair of big hoods holding one end of the rope morty dangled from the other end trussed up from his hips to his neck he was swinging back and forth on the end of the line and slowly spinning gasps and broken sobbing sounds came from him standing in empty air directly before him moving as he did was the grey ghost the figure looked at least as menacing as it had the first time around when it spoke its voice was liquid calmand feminine you need not do this to yourself mortimer the grey ghost said i take no pleasure in inflicting pain yield you will do it in the end save yourself the agony mort opened his eyes he licked his lips and said in a cracked thick voice gggo fuck yourself the grey ghost murmured tsk then nodded and said again nno morty choked out beginning to twist against his bonds he accomplished nothing other than to start spinning more rapidly no the two big hoods holding the rope calmly lowered mort down into the swirling pit of insanely hungry wraiths they collapsed in on morty as if the surf could choose where it wished to crashand it all wished to crash on the little ectomancer the cauldron of mad ghosts boiled and congealed onto him all but hiding him from sight mort began to scream again a horrible humiliated sound one counted the grey ghost two three four at the last number the flunkies hauled him up out of the pool of wraiths and morty hung there swinging back and forth and sobbing again gasping for breath each time you refuse me mortimer i will add another second to the count said the grey ghost i know what youre thinking how many seconds will it take to drive you mad mort tried to regain control of his breathing but it was a futile effort tears marked his face his nose had begun to run he opened his eyes his jaw clenched his bald pate scarlet and said his voice cracking go watch the sunrise again said the grey ghost the big hoods lowered morty into the pit once more i didnt know what happened to a living mortal attacked by a wraith but if mortys reaction was any indicator it wasnt good again he screamed it was higher pitched than a moment before more raw the screams all but drowned out the calm monotonous count of the grey ghost she went to five and then the big hoods hauled him up again he twitched in spasmodic motion as if hed developed a simultaneous charley horse in every muscle and sinew it took his screams at least ten seconds to die away its more art than science the grey ghost continued as if nothing had happened in my experience most minds break before seven granted most do not have your particular gifts whatever happens im sure i will find it fascinating i ask again will you help me go jump in a river bitch morty gasped there was a moment of silence again the grey ghost snarled slowly the obedient big hoods began to lower mort slowly toward the wraith pit again mort shook his head vainly and twisted his obviously battered body trying to curl up and away from the swirling tide of hungry ghosts he managed to forestall his fate by a few seconds but in the end he went down among the devouring spirits once more he screamed again and only after the scream had well and truly begun did the grey ghost start counting id never really had the highest opinion of morty i had hated the way hed neglected his talents and abused his clients for so long back when id first met him hed gone up in my estimation since then and especially in the past day so maybe he wasnt a paragon of virtue but he was still a decent guy in his own way he was professional and it looked like hed had more juice all along than i thought he had that said a lot about morty that hed kept quiet about the extent of his ability it said even more about him that he was standing in the lions den with no way out and was still spitting his defiance into the face of his captor dammit i thought i like the guy and the grey ghost was destroying him right in front of my eyes even as i watched morty screamed again as the wraiths surged against him raking at him with their pale gaunt fingers the grey ghosts calm voice counted numbers it felt like a minor infinity stretched between each i couldnt get mort out of this place no way even if i went allout on the room and defeated every single hostile spirit in it mort would still be tied up and the big hoods would still be looming there was no percentage in an attack yet standing around with my thumb up my ghostly ass wasnt an option either i didnt know what the grey ghost was doing to morty but it was clearly hurting him and judging from her dialogue straight out of cheesy villain general casting though it might be exposure to the wraiths would inflict permanent harm if morty continued to refuse her and there were the murderous spirits back at the ruins of morts house to think about too and as if all that wasnt enough sunrise was on the way dammit i needed an edge an advantage the fingers of my right hand touched the solid wooden handle of sir stuarts pistol and i was suddenly keenly aware of its power of the sheer tightly leashed potency of the weapon its energy hummed silently against my right palm i remembered the fight at mortys place and the havoc sir stuarts weapon had wreaked among the enemyor rather upon a single enemy the grey ghost had feared sir stuarts gun and i couldnt imagine shed done so for no reason if i could take her out the other spirits who followed her would almost certainly scatterthe kind of jackals who followed megalomaniacs around rarely had the stomach for a confrontation without their leader to stiffen their spines right sure just because the lemurs still outnumber you more than a dozen to one doesnt mean theyll see you as an easy victim dresden youll be fine there should be a rule against your own inner monologue throwing around that much sarcasm but there was still merit in the idea kill the grey ghost and then run like hell even if the lemurs came after me at least the main voice who appeared to be guiding the big hoods would be silenced it might even get all the malevolent spiritual attention entirely off of morty all i had to do was make one shot with sir stuarts pistol no problem if i missed i probably wouldnt survive the experience sure but other than that it should be a piece of cake i gritted my teeth and began to move slowly toward the grey ghost i didnt know how close i could get before my halfassed veil became useless but i had to do everything i could to maximize the chances of a hit i wasnt a marksman and the pistols of the eighteenth century werent exactly precision instruments but i couldnt afford to miss of course if the grey ghost sensed me coming she would have time to run to dodge or to pull some sort of defense together i had to kill her before she knew she was under attack there was some irony there considering the way id died the grey ghost finished her count and the big hoods hauled a sobbing morty out of the pit again he hung there twitching suffering making involuntary sounds as he gasped for breath the grey ghost stood in front of him motionless and i felt certain gloating ten feet i knew my veil was shoddy and my aim only middling but if i could close to ten feet i figured i had a fairly good chance of hitting the target that would put me on the near edge of the wraith pit shooting across it to hit the grey ghost of course if i missed the grey ghost wouldnt need to kill me all shed have to do was freaking trip me the wraiths once they sensed my presence would be all over me then id get what morty was getting except that as a ghost myself theyd be tearing me into tiny ectoplasmsoaked shreds and eating them what fun i thought i tried to move steadily to keep myself calm i didnt have any adrenaline anymore to make my hands shake but they shook anyway dammit i guess even a ghost is still on some level fundamentally human nothing for it but to keep moving thirty feet i passed within a few yards of a lemur who was apparently staring into nothingnessthough his eyes were lined up directly with me perhaps he was lost in a ghostly memory he never blinked as i went by twentyfive the wraiths wheezed out their starving strangled howls in the pit a few feet ahead of me twenty why do i keep winding up in these situations even after im dead for the fun i thought to myself for the fun fun funfun fun chapter twentynine then the floor near the grey ghosts feet rippled and a human skull floated up out of it its eye sockets burning with a cold blue flame the grey ghost turned to look at the skull and something about her body language soured what a fomor messenger is at the outer perimeter the skull said it sounded creepily like bob but there was a complete absence of anything but a vague contempt in its voice he bears word from his lord i got the impression that the grey ghost tilted her head beneath its hood a servitor arriving from the nevernever the outer perimeter is the nevernever side of which i am custodian the skull replied the inner perimeter is the mortal world you established that more than a year ago the grey ghost made a disgusted sound have a care spirit you are not indispensible she looked at the suspended morty and sighed of course the fomor disturb me with sunrise near why must my most important work continually be interrupted the skull inclined itself in a nod of acknowledgment shall i kill him and send back the body along with a note suggesting that next time they call ahead no snapped the grey ghost of course not curb your tongue spirit lest i tear it out for you if it pleases you to do so i am but a servant the skull said with another nod the contempt in its tone held steady though shall i allow him to pass and be quick about it the grey ghost snarled as it pleases you the skull replied speaking noticeably more slowly than a moment before it vanished into the floor i held very very still motion was the hardest thing for a veil to hide and i suddenly realized that the oneshot onekill plan had a serious flaw in it i had forgotten to account for evil bob the spirit was powerful intelligent dangerousand apparently incapable of anything resembling fear or respect i suppose that after a few decades of working with kemmler the most dangerous necromancer since the fall of the roman empire it was difficult to take a lesser talent seriously not that regular bob was exactly overflowing with respect and courtesy heh take that bad guy in any case i had a chance to find out more about the enemy you cant ever get too much dirt on these cloaked lunatics frequently learning more about them exposes some kind of gaping hole in their armor metaphorical or otherwise ive never had cause to regret knowing more about an enemy before commencing a fight besides if the grey ghost was a part of some kind of partnership instead of operating alone i had to know about it badguy alliances were never good news the grey ghost stepped away from the pit in fewer than thirty seconds the ground rippled again and a man appeared arising from the ground a bit at a time as if he were walking up a stairway the skull came with him floating along behind just above the level of his head i recognized him at once the leader of the fomor servitors who had come after molly he was still dressed in the black turtleneck but had added a weapons belt with a holstered pistol beneath his left hand and a short sword at his right it was one of those japanese blades but shorter than the full katana wakazashi then or maybe it was a ninjato if it was minus points for carrying it around out in the open like that oh there was something else odd about him his eyes had changed color i remembered them as a clear grey now they were a deep deep purple i dont mean purple like the dark violet eyes that lots of bobs romancenovel heroines always seem to have they were purple like a bruised corpse or like the last colors of a twilit sky he faced the grey ghost calmly and bowed from the waist the gesture slow and fluid greetings lady shade from my master cantrev lord omogh hello listen the grey ghost replied her tone sour what does omogh want from me now listen bowed again purple eyes gleaming my master desires to know whether or not your campaign is complete the grey ghosts voice came out from between clenched teeth obviously not listen bowed he would know then why you have escalated your search to a seizure of a secondtier asset the servitor paused to glance at morty and then back to the robed figure this action runs counter to your arrangement the eye sockets of the skull flickered more brightly we could still send the fomor the message about calling ahead no the grey ghost said severely it would be simple and direct no spirit the grey ghost snarled i forbid it the skulls eyes flickered rapidly for a moment agitated then it bowed lower and said as you wish the grey ghost turned to listen and said my servant believes it would be logical to murder you and send your corpse back to your master in order to express my displeasure listen bowed again i am one of many easily replaced my death would be but a brief annoyance to my lord and i think a somewhat anemic symbolic gesture the grey ghost stared at him and then said if you werent speaking the literal truth i think i should be satisfied with letting the skull have you but you really have no sense of selfpreservation at all do you of course i do lady shade i would never throw away my life carelessly it would make it impossible for me to ensure that my death is of maximum advantage to my lord the grey ghost shook her head within the hood you are a fool i will not contest the statement listen said however lady shade i must ask you for an answer to return to my lord he added mildly whatever form that answer may take inform him said the grey ghost voice annoyed that i will do as i see fit to acquire an appropriate body whoa the lady shade was looking for a meat suit which meant i shook off the line of logic to be examined later i focused on the conversation at hand you made no mention of requiring such a valuable specimen for your ends listen said look at what i have to work with lady shade snarled gesturing at the big hoods gathered around the pit scraps that cannot support the weight of my talent tell omogh that if he wishes an ally who can face the wardens he must be tolerant this specimen is of the least value to his purposes and the greatest to mine listen considered that for a moment and then nodded and the rag lady once i am seated within a mortal form i will deal with her lady shade said her voice became detectably smug assuming of course you have not already removed her yourself is that a burn on your cheek listen i hope it does not pain you very kind lady listen said with another bow i am in no discomfort worth noting may i tell my lord that you will make him a gift of these fourthtier creatures once you are restored lady shade seemed to consider that for a moment she tilted her head and looked around at the big hoods yes i suppose so ill have little need for such baubles excellent listen said he sounded genuinely pleased lady shade shook her head again is he so enamored of such minor talents a moment ago listen said i was preparing to inform him of the potential loss of a secondtier now i may inform him of the probable gain of a dozen lesser acquisitions it pleases me to draw positive gains for my lord from negative situations from his place dangling over the pit morty said in a slurred voice tell him he aint getting squat bitch cant have me listen lifted both eyebrows and looked at lady shade i require his consent the lady shade said her voice tight i will have it had you not interrupted me i would have it already now dawn nears it may be several hours after sundown before i complete the transfer ah listen said nothing in his tone made him sound overtly skeptical but i got the impression that he was nonetheless then with your leave i will depart to carry word to my lord and trouble you no more evil bob popped up into sight over listens shoulder again are you sure you do not wish this creature to be departed my lady go in peace listen lady shade said without so much as glancing at evil bob inform your lord that i anticipate that we will be able to move against the rag lady and her allies in the fortress sometime tomorrow evening listen bowed at the waist again then he turned and followed by the floating skull stepped down into the floor vanishing from mortal reality and into the spirit world the moment listen was gone lady shade waved a hand and with reedy howls of protest the wraiths in the pit were unceremoniously scattered from it the heavy bass beat of the beacon spell coming to an abrupt halt the will of lady shade pressed against them like the current of a river and they were driven from the chamber carried out through the walls and the floor by an unseen force i could feel it myself the force of her will simultaneously banishing the wraiths and commanding the attention of the lemurs in the chamber i fought to hold still before it to let it slide away from me around my veil to use it to help me hide rather than being revealed by it children she said her tone full of contempt beware the dawn approaches to your sanctums all she turned to the big hoods mortal dears mother is pleased with you keep safe the prisoner until nightfall his life is worth the world to me guard him with your own the big hoods shivered as if theyd heard the voice of a god whispering in their minds and bowed their heads as one they murmured words of some kind of ritual devotion though they were too mushmouthed for me to clearly understand them the lemurs began clearing out at once rising from their activities or lack thereof and departing moving silently from the chamber i got lucky none of them actually plowed into me by mistake well murmured lady shade to morty we shall continue our discussion in several hours you will have no food no water you will not be untied im sure that sooner or later you will see things my way i would rather die than let you in morty replied his voice a croak you cant always have what you want dear child lady shade said her voice was matteroffact calm and practical i will continue to hurt you and eventually you will be willing to do anything to stop the pain it is an unfortunate limit of mortality morty said nothing i couldnt tell whether he shivered at the coldblooded confidence in her voice but i did and i realized finally who i was dealing with the grey ghost turned and sank into the floor evidently moving into a demesne in the nevernever i waited until i was sure she was gone then simply vanished straight up appearing over the streets of chicago above dawn was a golden promise over the eastern horizon i headed toward my grave as fast as i could possibly travel the grey ghost was a shade that i knew but where had the shade come from from someone with a knowledge of possessing others bodies from someone who seemed confident she could confront the wardens of the white council the cops of the wizarding world and come out on top from someone who had been known to this omogh person whoever he was and who needed a body with enough of an innate gift for magic to support what was apparently a much greater talent only so many people with a wizards level of ability had perished in chicago most of them had been foes of mine i hadnt been the one to gack all of them but id killed this one with a gun no less from about ten feet away i reached the shelter of my grave and sank into it gratefully still shivering morty was in the hands of the corpsetaker one of the heirs of that lunatic kemmler a bodyhopping wizard with a serious case of the longterm crazies and maybe three or four times my own ability with magic if she got into morty i was guessing that like me she would have access to her full abilities once more she would be able to start hopping bodies again and pick up her career right where she left off and shed start by killing molly id survived my original encounter with her thanks only to the intervention of gentleman john marcone a little bit of good luck and better guesswork and some truly epic paranoia she was an absolute firstclass threat one i would prefer to avoid confronting at all much less alone sunrise came roaring over the land and i felt grateful to have it between the corpsetaker and me i was glad to have a chance to rest while i could things had gotten considerably more urgent come nightfall i knew i was going to have to find a way to take her on chapter thirty i huddled in my grave as the sun rose i would have thought id be more nervous about a personally lethal fiery cataclysm sweeping over the world but i wasnt when dawn came it was like listening to a big truck roll by outsidedangerous if you were in front of it but nothing but background noise if you werent my grave was peaceful i tried to track that feeling to identify that sense of contentment i enjoyed down in the ground it took me a few moments but then i understood it was like being in my basement apartment during a winter storm outside the wind howled and the snow and sleet fell but i was home with mouse and mister piled onto the couch for warmth sipping a cup of hot chicken soup in front of a big fire in the fireplace and reading a good book it was the same thing resting in my grave peace i wasnt going anywhere and it made me happy if only id brought a book my day would have been perfect instead i just leaned back against the earthen wall of the grave and closed my eyes soaking in the quiet i would be trapped here until sundown there was no sense in chewing my own guts out worrying about what would happen that evening i drifted through my memories sad and joyous and just plain ridiculous i thought about elaine and me in high school we had lived like superheroes two young people with incredible powers who must hide themselves from those around them lest they be isolated and persecuted for their differentness i hadnt really been interested in girls yet when i met elaine wed both been twelve bright and stubborn which meant that we generally drove each other crazy we had also been best friends talking about our dreams of the future sharing tears or a shoulder whichever was needed at school we both found the subject matter to be tedious beyond bearingin comparison to the complexity of justins lessons acquitting ourselves well in the publicschool curriculum had been only nominally more difficult than sharpening a pencil it was difficult to relate to the other kids in many ways we just werent interested in the same things our magic talents increasingly made television a difficulty and video games had been downright impossible elaine and i wound up playing a lot of card and board games or spending long quiet hours in the same room reading justin had manipulated us both masterfully he wanted us to bond he wanted us to feel isolated from everyone else and loyal to him though he put up a facade about it that fooled me at the time he wanted us to work through our nascent sexuality with each other and save him the bother of explaining anythingor the risk of either elaine or me forming attachments with someone outside our little circle i never suspected a thing about what he really wanted until the day elaine stayed home sick concerned about her i skipped my last class and came home early the house seemed too quiet and an energy i had never sensed before hung in the air like cloying oily perfume the second i walked in the door i found myself tensing up it was my first encounter with black magic the power of creation itself twisted to maim and destroy everything it touched elaine sat on the couch her expression calm her spine locked rigidly into perfect posture i now know that justin had put the mental whammy on her while i was gone but at the time i knew only that my instincts were screaming that something was wrong a wrongness so fundamental it made me want to run away screaming filled the room and besides elaine only sat like that when she was making a statementgenerally a sarcastic one i still remembered it plain as day justin appeared in the kitchen doorway on the other side of elaine and stood there for a moment looking at me his expression calm you skipped class again he sighed i probably should have seen that coming whats going on here i demanded my voice high and squeaky with fear what have you done justin walked to the couch to stand over elaine both of them stared at me for a long moment i couldnt read their expressions at all im making plans harry he said in a steady quiet voice i need people i can trust trust i asked his words didnt make sense i couldnt see how they applied to the current situation i couldnt see how they would make sense at all i looked from elaine back to justin again searching for some kind of explanation their expressions gave me nothing that was when my eyes fell to the coffee table and to the object lying quietly next to my wellmauled paperback copy of the hobbit a straitjacket there was something quietly calmly sinister in the congruence i just stared for a moment and the bottom fell out of my stomach as i finally realized for the first awful time what my instinct had been screaming at me i was in danger that my rescuer teacher my guardian meant to do me harm tears blurred my vision as i asked him in a very quiet very confused voice why justin remained calm you dont have the knowledge you need to understand boy not yet but you will in time yyou cant do this i whispered nnot you you saved me you saved us and i still am justin said sit down next to elaine harry from the couch elaine said in a quiet dreamy monotone sit down next to me harry i stared at her in shock and took a step back elaine justin threw kinetomancy at me when i looked away some instinct warned me in the last fraction of a second but instead of trying to block the strike i moved with it toward the front picture window weaving my own spell as i went instead of interposing my shield i spread it wide in front of me like a sail catching the force of justins blast and harnessing it me my shield justins energy and that picture window exploded onto the front lawn i remembered the enormous sound of the shattering glass and wood and the hot sting of a dozen tiny cuts from bits of flying glass and wood i remember being furious and terrified i went through the open space where the window had been fell onto the lawn took it in a roll and came up sprinting boy justin said projecting his voice loudly i looked over my shoulder at him as i ran his eyes were more coldly furious than i had ever seen them you are here with mewith elaine or you are nowhere if you dont come back right now you are dead to me i lopped the last two words off the sentence to get his real meaning and poured on more speed if i stayed he meant to render me helpless and from that beginning there could be no good endings if i went back angry i could fight him but i couldnt winnot against the man who taught me everything i knew i couldnt call the cops and tell them justin was a mad wizardtheyd write me off as a nutcase or prankster without thinking twice it wasnt like i could run to oz and ask a more powerful wizard for help hed never told me about the white council or the rest of the supernatural world abusers like to isolate their victims people who feel that they are completely alone tend not to fight back boy justins voice roared now openly filled with rage boy he didnt need to say anything more that rage said it all the man who had given me a home was going to kill me it hurt so much i wondered if he already had i put my head down and ran faster my tears making the world a blur with only one thought burning in my head this wasnt over i knew that justin could find me no matter where i ran no matter how well i hid i hadnt escaped that straitjacket i had only delayed it for a little while i didnt have any choice i had to fight back what happened next asked a fascinated voice i shook my head and snapped out of the reverie looking up to the sunlit sky outside my grave winters hold was definitely weakening the sky was grey clouds interspersed with streaks of summer blue sky there was a lot of water dripping down the edges of my grave though the snow at the bottom was still holding its chill the leanansidhe sat at the edge of my grave her bare dirty feet swinging back and forth her bright red hair had been bound back in a long tail and she was dressed in the shreds of five or six different outfits her head was wrapped in a scarf that had been knitted from yarn duplicating various colors of dirty snow and the tattered ends of it hung down on either side of her head it gave her a sort of lunaticcoquette charm especially considering the flecks of what looked like dried blood on the pale skin of her face she looked as happy as a kid on christmas morning i just stared up for a moment and then shook my head faintly you saw that what i was thinking i see you she said as though that explained it not what you were thinking what you were remembering interesting i said it made a certain amount of sense that lea could discern the spirit world better than i could she was a creature who was at least partly native to the nevernever i probably looked like some kind of pale white ghostly version of myself to her while the memories that were my substance played across the surface i thought about the wraiths and lemurs that sir stuart had put down on my first night as a ghost and how they had seemed to bleed images as they faded away yes she said her tone pleased precisely like that my but the colonial knight put on a display for you you knew sir stuart i have seen him in battle on several occasions lea said her eyes somewhat dreamy he is a worthy gentleman in his fashion quite dangerous not more dangerous than the corpsetaker i said she destroyed him lea thrust out her lower lip and her brow furrowed in annoyance did she what a contemptible waste of a perfectly doughty spirit she rolled her eyes at least my godchild you have discerned your foes identityand that of her pet i shivered her and evil bob she waved a hand evil is mainly an aesthetic choice only the spirits power is significant for your purposes not true i said mildly though i know you dont agree her expression was pensive for a moment before she said you have your mothers sight you know not her eyes ive always thought you favored malcolm the serious expression vanished and she kicked her feet again so young shade what happened next you know you were there how do the mortals say it she murmured i missed that episode i coughed out a surprised little laugh she looked faintly miffed i do not know what happened between the time you left justin and the time you came to me i see i grinned at her do you think i just give away stories for free to one of the sidhe she tilted back her head and laughed and her eyes twinkled like literally with little flashes of light you have learned much i began to despair of it but it seems you may have acquired wisdom enough and in time in time to be dead i said but yeah ive worked out by now that the sidhe dont give anything away or take anything for free and after however long i realized why that might be because you cant indeed she said beaming at me there must be balance sweet godchild always balance never take a thing without giving such a thing in return never give a favor without collecting one in kind all of reality depends on balance i squinted at her thats why you gave bianca amoracchius years ago so that you could accept that knife from her the one mab took from you she leaned toward me her eyes all but glowing with intensity and her teeth showing in a sudden carnivorous smile indeed and such a treacherous gift it was child oh but if that deceitful creature had survived you such a vengeance i would have wreaked that the world would have spoken of it in whispers for a thousand years i squinted at her but i killed bianca before you could balance the scales indeed simple boy why else think you that i gifted you with the most potent powers of faerie to protect you and your companions when we battled biancas ultimate progenitors i thought you did it because mab ordered you to tsk in all of winter i am second in power only to mabwhich she has allowed because i have incurred with it proportionate obligation to her she is my dearest enemy but even i do not owe mab so much i helped you as much as i did sweet child because i owed you for collecting a portion of my due justice from bianca the leanansidhe said her eyes grew wider wilder the rest i took from the little whores masters though i admit i hadnt expected the collection to be quite so thorough memories flashed in my head susan an obsidian knife i felt sick ill get over it i told myself eventually it hadnt been much more than a day from my point of view i was probably still in shock or trauma or somethingif ghosts could get that i mean i looked up and realized that lea was staring at me at my memories with undisguised glee she let out a contented sigh and said you do not settle things by half measures do you my godson i could get mad at her for being callous about calling those memories to my mind or i could revile her for taking such joy in so much destruction and pain but there wasnt a point in doing so my godmother was what she wasa being of violence deceit and the thirst for power she wasnt human her attitudes and reactions could not fairly be called inhumane besides i had gotten to know leas sovereign queen mab in a fashion so hideously intimate that i could not possibly describe it and believe me if lea had been the high priestess of murder bloodlust scheming and manipulation then mab was the goddess my godmother worshipped come to think of it that was probably an apt description of their relationship six of one a half dozen of another my godmother wasnt going to change there was no sense in holding what she was against her so i just gave her a tired whimsical smile instead saves time i told her do it thoroughly once and you dont have to fool around with it again later she dropped back her head and let out a deepthroated laugh then she tilted her head and looked at me you didnt realize what would happen to mortal kind when you struck down the red king and his brood did you i saw the opportunity i said after a moment if id stopped to think about the trouble it would create i dont know if id have done it any differently they had my girl her eyes gleamed spoken as someone worthy to wield power coming from you i said thats a little bit unsettling actually she kicked both feet girlishly pleased and smiled down at me how sweet of you to say so the best thing about my faerie godmother is that the creepy just keeps on coming ill trade you i said the rest of the tale for information she nodded her head in a businesslike fashion the tale for questions three done done done and done she replied so i told her chapter thirtyone i ran and ran for a good long while i wasnt on the crosscountry team at school but i often went running with elaine it was how wed hidden sneaking off to make outand stufffrom justin he was a thorough sort of guy so we made sure to actually do the running too in order to make our deception flawless and the whole time we thought we were getting away with it as an adult i could see that our efforts were about as obvious as they could possibly be justin had known i was certainnow but back then elaine and i had been sure that we were masters of deceit that schemes trappings were sure as hell turning out to be handy that day my strides slowed but turned longer steadier machinelike i was sixteen i didnt wind down for almost an hour when i finally stopped the terror had faded if not the heartache and i found myself in an entirely unexpected position i didnt know what was coming next i didnt know what was expected of me i had to think all by myself i ducked off the road and into a large culvert huddling there while i got my breath back and flailed at the wet paper bag my brain was trapped within mostly i just kept thinking that i should have known no one in my life had gone an inch out of their way to look out for me once my parents were gone justins generosity even seasoned with the demands of studying magic had been too good to be true i should have known it and elaine shed just sat there while hed been doing whatever he was going to do she hadnt tried to warn me hadnt tried to stop him i had never known anyone in my life i had loved as much as elaine i should have known she was too good to be true too i wept for a while i was tired and cold and my chest ached with the pain of loss in a single moment my home had been destroyed my life had been destroyed but i shook my head ferociously wiping my eyes and my nose on the leather sleeves of my jacket heedless of what it did to them i was still in danger i had to think i had no means of travel no money and no idea of where to go hells bells i was lucky i had my shiny new drivers license in my pocket it was midnovember and my school letter jacket wasnt going to be enough to keep me warm once it got dark my stomach made a cavernous noise and i added starving hunger to my list of problems i needed shelter i needed food i needed to find someplace safe to hide from my mentor until i could figure out how to take him onand to get all of that i needed money and i needed it fast so once it got dark i uh look i was sixteen once it got dark i sort of knocked over a convenience store for lack of anything better to hide my face id tied my sweaty tshirt around my head in a sort of makeshift balaclava i didnt have anything else to wear except my letter jacket which seemed more or less like a screaming advertisement to make it simple for the cops to figure out my identity there wasnt much i could do except to rip all the patches off of it and hope for the best after that id scavenged a paper sack from a trash bin emptied it and stuck my right hand in it once i had my equipment ready i looked up at the streetlights glowing outside the quikstop and flicked a quick hex at them learning magic is hard but if you can do even fairly modest spells you find out that wrecking technology is easy anything with electronics built into it is particularly susceptible to a hex but if you put enough oomph into it even simpler technology can be shorted out or otherwise made to malfunction at sixteen i wasnt anywhere near the wizard i would be even five or six years laterbut those lights didnt have a prayer the two streetlights over the parking lot flickered and went black i hit the lights outside the store next and two security cameras i was getting increasingly nervous as i went along and the last hex accidentally blew out the stores freezers and overhead lights along with the security camera the only lighting left in the place came from a pinball machine and a couple of aging arcade video games i swallowed and hit the door going through in a halfdoubledover crouch so that there wouldnt be any way to compare my height to the marker on the inside frame of the door i held out my right hand like it was a gun which it might have been i had the paper sack id acquired pulled over it there was something cold and squishy and greasy on the inside of the bag mayonnaise maybe i hated mayo i hustled up to the cashier a young man with a brown mullet and a boston tshirt pointed the paper sack at him and said empty the drawer he blinked reddened watery eyes at me then at the paper bag empty the drawer or ill blow your head off i shouted it probably would have been more intimidating if my voice hadnt cracked in the middle uh man the cashier said and i finally twigged to the scent of recently burned marijuana the guy didnt look scared he looked confused dude what is did you see the lights just i really hadnt wanted to do this but i didnt have much of a choice i made a little bit of a production of turning the gun to point at the liquor bottles behind the counter gathered up my will and screamed kabang kabang my verbal incantations have actually gotten more sophisticated and worldly over the years not less i know right it shocks me too the spell was just basic kinetic energy and it didnt really hit much harder than a baseball thrown by a high school pitchera regular pitcher not like robert redford in the natural that wasnt really enough power to threaten anyones life but it was noisy and it was more than enough energy to smash a couple of bottles they shattered with loud barking sounds and showers of glass and booze holy crap shouted the cashier i saw that his name tag read stan dude he flinched down holding his arms up around his head dont shoot i pointed the paper bag at him and said give me all the money stan okay okay stan said oh god dont kill me money i shouted he turned to the register and started fumbling at it stabbing at the keys as he did i sensed a movement behind me an almost subliminal presence its the kind of thing you expect to experience while standing in a linethe silent pressure of another living being behind you temporarily sharing your space but i wasnt standing in a line and i whirled in panic and shouted kabang again there was a loud snap of sound as pure force lashed through the air and the glass door to a freezer of ice cream shattered oh god stan moaned please dont kill me there was no one behind me i tried to look in every direction at once and more or less succeeded there was no one else in the store and yet the presence was still there on the back of my neck closer and more distinct than a moment before what the hell run said a resonant baritone i turned and pointed the paper bag at the pair of video games run said the voice on the sinistar game i live i am sinistar dont move i said to stan just put the money in a bag money in a bag man stan panted he was practically sobbing im supposed to do whatever you want right thats what the owners have told us cashiers right im supposed to give you the money no argument okay okay i said my eyes flicking nervously around the place its not worth dying for is it stan got that right stan muttered theyre only paying me five dollars an hour he finally managed to open the drawer and started fumbling bills into a plastic bag okay dude just a second run said the sinistar machine run again the insubstantial pressure against the back of my neck increased i turned in a slow circle but nothing was therenothing i could see at any rate but what if there was something there something that couldnt be seen i had never actually seen something summoned from the netherworld but justin had described such beings repeatedly and i didnt think hed been lying such a beast would make an ideal hunter just the sort of thing to send out after a mouthy apprentice who refused to wear his straitjacket like a good boy i took two slow steps toward the video game staring at its screen i didnt pay attention to the spaceship or the asteroids or the giant disembodied skull flying around i didnt care about the flickers of static that washed across the screen as i got closer something inside its computer reacting to my presence no i paid attention to the glass screen and to the reflection of the store that shone dimly upon it i identified my outline on it long and thin i could see the vague outlines of the store as more shadowy shapesaisles and end caps the counter and the door and the thing standing just inside the door it was huge i mean it was taller and broader than the door was it was more or less humanoid the proportions were wrong the shoulders too wide the arms too long the legs crooked and too thick it was covered in fur or scales or some scabrous fungal amalgamation of both and its eyes were empty angled pits of dim violet light i felt my hands begin to shake tremble actually they became absolutely spastic the paper bag made a steady rattling sound there was a creature from another world standing behind me i could feel it no more than seven or eight feet away from me every bit as real as stan to every sense but my sight it took a real effort to move my head enough to cast a single hurried glance over my shoulder nothing stan was shoveling various bills into a bag the store was otherwise empty the door hadnt opened since i had come through it there was a bell on it it would have rung had it opened i looked back at the reflection the thing was two feet closer and it was smiling it had a head whose shape was all but obscured by growths or lumpy scales or matted fur but beneath its eyes i could see a mouth too wide to be real filled with teeth too sharp and serrated and yellow to belong to anything of this earth that was a smile from lewis carrolls opiuminspired laudanumdosed nightmares my legs felt like they were going to collapse into water at any second i couldnt catch my breath i couldnt move malice slithered up my spine and danced in spiteful shivers over the back of my neck i could sense the things hostilitynot the mindless anger of a fellow boy id needled beyond selfrestraint or justins cold logical rage this was something different something vaster more timeless and deeper than any ocean it was a poisonous hate something so ancient so vile that it could almost kill without any other action or being to support it a hate so old and so virulent that it had curdled and congealed over its surface into a stinking staggering contempt this thing wanted to destroy me it wanted to hurt me it wanted to enjoy the process and nothing i said nothing i did would ever ever change that i was something to be eradicated preferably in some amusing fashion it had no mercy it had no fear and it was old old beyond my ability to comprehend it was patient and if i proved too disappointing to it i would only break through the veneer of that contemptand what lay beneath would dissolve me like the deadliest acid i felt stained simply by feeling its presence stained as if it had left some hideous imprint or mark upon me one that could not be wiped away and then it was behind me so close it could almost touch its outline towering over me huge and horrible and it leaned down a forked tongue slithered out from between its horrible sharkchainsaw teeth and it whispered in a perfectly low calm british accent what you have just sensed is as close as your mind can come to encompassing my name how do you do i tried to talk i couldnt i couldnt make the words form in my mouth i couldnt get enough air to push my voice up out of my throat damn it damn it i was more than some terrified child i was more than some helpless orphan preparing to endure what someone vastly older and more powerful than me was preparing to inflict i had touched the very forces of creation i was a young force of nature i had seen things no one else could see done things no one else could do and in a moment like that there was only one thing i could ask myself what would jack burton do im ffffine i said in a hoarse hardly understandable voice thats a mouthful and im busy ddo you maybe have a nickname its smile widened little morsel among those whom i have disassembled it purred its tone wrapping lovingly around the last word of the phrase i have several times been called by the same phrase ooh wwhats that he purred the thing who walks behind chapter thirtytwo he who walks behind i said fighting a losing battle to keep from trembling as scary names go that one kind of isnt id stick with the first one more evocative be patient purred the creatures disembodied voice you will understand it before the end uh dude stan asked quietly uh who are you talking to oh tell him the creature said that should be entertaining shut up stan i said and get out uh said stan what i whirled on him and pointed the paper bag at him my arms extending through the space where he who walks behind apparently both was and wasnt get the hell out of here stan fell all over himself trying to comply he literally went to the tile floor twice on his way to the door his eyes wide and stumbled out and into the night i turned back to the reflective surface of the video games screen and just as i again found the shape inside it fire erupted along my spine i was slammed forward into the video game and my head hit it hard enough to send a spiderweb of cracks through the machines glass screen pain sickening and harsh flooded through my skull and i staggered but i didnt fall justin dumorne had been hard on me it hadnt ever been this bad this scary and it had never hurt so muchbut then it had never been for real i grabbed the machines sides forced my fingers to hold on and kept myself from falling run run screamed the machine again this time the voice was blurred and distorted disturbingly deep and malicious i noted blurrily that the cracked and wildly flickering screen had a terrified wizards blood all over it the games computer was apparently failing you think that the inebriated little mortal is going to run to fetch the authorities purred the creatures voice i turned my head looking around and didnt see anything but the motion sent fire down my back and for the first time i felt a trickling there beneath my jacket i was bleeding you think that if they come running in their vehicles with their lights and their symbols that i will flee i turned and put my back to the machine my legs felt wobbly but i was beginning to fight through the pain i clenched my teeth and snarled get away from me i assure you came the creatures bodiless voice that we will not be disturbed i have made sure of it but it does demonstrate that you possess a certain talent for performance under pressure does it not you sound like my guidance counselor i said and wiped blood from one of my eyes i took a breath and stalked forward wobbling only a little i grabbed the bag of money stan had left on the counter i guess maybe you are a little scary neither fear nor pain sway you from your objective excellent this time the things voice was coming from the far side of the convenience store but theres no knowing the true temper of the blade until it has been tested even the strongestseeming steel may have hidden flaws this may be interesting i paused frowning and looked up at my faerie godmother who still sat at the edge of my grave listening raptly i godmother ive heard it said that ghosts are memories indeed lea said nodding are the memories truth lea arched a rather caustic eyebrow at my words you ask your first question before finishing the tale her mouth twisted in distaste your storytelling form leaves something to be desired child yeah i never did too well in english class will you answer the question her eyes became very very green and glittered with a wild gleeful light they are the facts the events as you experienced them i frowned i never really had a clear recollection of exactly what the thing said to me i said i mean that blow to the head gave me a headache for days ah yes lea said i remember your pain she would yeah uh anyway im remembering the conversation now word for word is that real or is it something that guy in black made up to fill in the blanks they are your memories she said the record the impression of what you lived your brain isnt the only place they are storedit is in truth often a poor facility for such a purpose she paused to consider her next words and then spread her hands palms up an odd light in her eyes it is the nature of the universe that things remain nothing ever disappears completely the very sound of creation still echoes throughout the vast darkness the universe remembers you are currently free of the shackles of mortality your limited brain no longer impedes access to that record the only blocks to your memory are those you allow to be thats either very zen or very very crazy i said so this memorythis is all the actual event did i not just say as much she asked crossly it would make a ridiculous fiction why would i bother listening otherwise i honestly wasnt sure but i decided not to push the issue ghost harry wise harry now the leanansidhe said if you are quite finished holding hostage my imagination pray continue get away from me i snarled clutching the money sparks spat fitfully from the fried security camera they were most of the light in the place even if the creature had been something solid and physical it might have hidden in the stretches of shadow between the flickering motes of light i didnt see it anywhere so it came as a shock to me when something gripped the back of my neck and effortlessly flung me into an end cap of various doughnuts and pastries i went through it and hit the shelf behind it hurt more than i could have believed years later i would have considered it a minor foothill of pain but at the time it was a mountain the sweet smell of sugar and chocolate filled my nose i figured my backside must be coated in about half an inch of frosting cream filling and powdered sugar the scent made my stomach howl for food gurgling loudly enough to be heard over the sound of items falling from the shelves here and there like i said sixteen such a useless scrap of meat contains you the creature said its voice unchanged by the violence it is entirely inconsequential and yet it molds you your existence is a series of contradictions but here is certainty mortal child this time you cannot run the hell i couldnt running had always served me fairly well and i saw no reason to change my policy now i scrambled to my feet and ran for the back of the store away from the presumed direction of my attacker i rounded the far corner of the aisle and pressed my back up against it panting something hard and hot and slimy settled around my neck a noose made of moist serpent and just as strong it jerked me up and off my feet a bruising force that threw me into the air and released me almost instantly i had an enormous flash of empathy for jerry facing the raw power and amused pleasure of a large invisible tom you cannot escape what is always behind you it said i landed on my ass hard and scrambled toward the other aisle on my hands and knees only to feel another terrible force strike me a contemptuous kick in the seat of my pants it flung me forward into a glass door on a wall of refrigerated cabinets holding racks and racks of cold drinks i bounced off the door and landed dazed staring for a second at the large cracks my head had left in the glass no one will save you i tried to crawl farther away i made it only far enough to reach the next cabinet and then a blow struck me in the ribs and flung me into the next glass door my shoulder hit it this time and didnt break the glass but i felt something go pop in my arm and the whole limb seemed to light up with abrupt awareness of pain the unseen presence of the creature came closer its voice lowered to a bare pleased murmur child of the stars i will destroy you this night my head was full of pain and fear i could sense it getting closer again coming up behind mealways there i somehow knew where i was weakest most vulnerable that was where it would always be i had to move i had to do something but the terror felt like lead weights on my wrists and ankles sapping my strength making muscles turn to water thoughts to noise i tried to run but the best i could do was a slow slippery scramble down the aisle of cold drinks pathetic said he who walks behind growing nearer with every word whimpering mewling thing useless terror i couldnt think i was going to die i was going to die and then my mouth said in a damned passable peewee herman impersonation i know you are but what am i he who walks behind stopped in his tracks there was a flickering heartbeat of uncertainty in that inevitable presence and the creature said what haha i said in the same voice doubletapping my own fear with the characters staccato laugh a thought came shining through my head maybe i cant stop this thing from coming at my back but i can choose which way i turn it i struggled to my feet and started town the aisle spinning with every step whirlingdervish style the whole time i heard myself spewing peewee hermans cartoony laughwhich in retrospect was possibly the creepiest thing to hit my ears that night i hit the door with a hip and an elbow and blew through it still spinning out into the parking lot once there i realized that my escape plan did not have a part two it hadnt been concerned with getting me any farther than the doors of the store id achieved the objective now what the darkened parking lot was a mass of shadows the nearest lights were a hundred yards away and seemed somehow dimmer more orange than they should have been there was a heaviness in the air and a faint faint stench of death and rot had that been something the creature had done had that been what it meant when it said it had made sure of our privacy stan was in the parking lot out between the two islands housing the convenience stores gas pumps he looked like a man who was trying to run in slow motion his arms were moving very slowly his legs bent as if sprinting but his pace was much slower than a walk as if hed been trying to run through a rice paddy filled with peanut butter he was looking over his shoulder at me and his face was distorted with terror a horrible mask that hardly looked human in the shadowhaunted night i began to run toward him on pure instinct herd instinct really operating on the assumption that there was greater safety in numbers my feet pounded the parking lots asphalt at normal speed and his eyes widened with almost comical slowness and amazement as i ran toward him is that what you are came the creatures voice from no direction and from all of them one of them one of the swarm that infests this world the origin point of the voice changed and i suddenly felt hot stinking breath right on the back of my neck i expected better of a pupil of dumorne i whirled throwing my arms up defensively i had time to see everything in the reflection of the convenience stores broad front windows he who walks behind emerged from the shadows in front of the terrified stan broad horrible arms wrapped around him crushing him as easily as a man picking up a child another limb maybe a tail or some kind of tentacle covered in the same growthfurscales as the rest of the creature joined the two arms so that stan was wrapped at the shoulders at the bottom of the ribs and at the hips and then with a slow smile and a simple savage twisting motion he who walks behind tore stan the convenience store clerk into three pieces id seen death before but not like that not terrible and swift and bloody i spun back to stan in time to see the three pieces fall to the ground blood went everywhere one of his arms waved in frantic windmills and his mouth opened as if to scream but nothing came out except a vomiting gurgle and a gout of blood wide terrified eyes stared at mine for a second and i jerked my gaze away desperate to avoid seeing stans soul as he died then he just sort of changed from a person in hideous pain and fear to an empty pile of of meat parts soiled cloth i had never seen death come like that as a humiliation a reduction of a unique soul to nothing more than constituent matter when the creature killed stan it didnt simply end his life it underscored the underlying futility the ultimate insignificance of that life it made a man albeit a fairly unmotivated one into less than nothingsomething that had been a waste of the resources it had consumed something that had never had a choice in its own fate never had a chance to be anything more i had involved stan in this struggle it hadnt been his fight at all granted i had never intended to hurt the guy and never would have nonetheless without my decision to stick up the convenience store he would have still been loitering behind the counter killing time until his next joint he had been caught up in violence that he had done nothing to earn or expectand it had killed him something in my head went click that wasnt right stan shouldnt have died like that no one should no oneman beast or otherwiseshould get to decide in a moment of malicious humor that it got to end stans life to take away everything he was and everything he might ever be stan hadnt deserved it he hadnt been looking for it and that creature that demon had murdered him i felt my jaw begin to ache as it clenched harder and harder i could feel my rapid pulse beating behind my eyes there was a terrible pressure inside my head and inside my chest and with it came a rising wave of anger and something darker and deadlier than anger that came welling up like a great wave from an unlit sea it wasnt right no it wasnt but the world wasnt a fair place was it and i had more reason to know it than most people twice my age the world wasnt nice and it wasnt fair people who didnt deserve it suffered and died every single day so what so somebody ought to do something about it my right arm and shoulder burned like fire as i felt my right hand slowly form a tight fist the knuckles popped one by one they hadnt ever done that before i turned to face the creatures image in the reflection it was crouched over stans corpse its talons tapping lightly on the dead mans open eyes its mouth still stretched into that horrible wide smile and when it saw the look on my face its smile widened and its eyes narrowed ahhhh it said ahhhhh there you are i was not a victim i was not a powerless child i was a wizard i was furious and i was finished running this isnt your world i whispered not now he who walks behind murmured its smile widening but it will be ours again in just a little time you wont be around to see it i said i had never used my power in anger i had never consciously tried to harm another being with my magic but this thing if anything i had ever seen had it coming if ever a being was deserving of receiving my violence it was the bloodstained creature crouching over stans mangled body everything had been taken away from me in the space of a single afternoon my home my family and now it seemed i was about to lose my life well if that was how it was going to be if i couldnt run without getting more innocent bystanders killed then i would make my stand hereand i had no intention of going quietly i reached into that deep well of anger and began drawing it together into something as hot and violent and destructive as what i was feeling inside theres something you should know i said i skipped sixth hour today spanish which im not very good at anyway what is that to me asked the creature flickum bicus just doesnt seem appropriate i replied the heat in my right arm and shoulder concentrated into my right hand the scent of burned hairs crept up to my nose and you really dont understand where youre standing do you the creatures reflection looked left and right at the gas pumps on either side of it i kept my eyes locked on its image in the windows extended my right hand back toward it and formed my little firelighting spell into something a thousand times bigger hotter and deadlier than anything i had ever attempted before i met the things eyes in the reflection reached down to the well of energy and pure will id built inside me extended my hand toward the creature and screamed fuego my rage and fear poured out of me fire lashed out from my open hand like water from a broken hydrant it spilled all over he who walks behind and over stans body and lit up the darkness with angry golden light the creature let out a scream more surprise and anger than pain clutching at its eyes with its huge hands the light changed the reflection in the glass and i could no longer see what was behind me i swept the torrent of fire left and right without turning away or changing the direction my back faced i hoped it would slow he who walks behind long enough for my modified firestarting spell to do its thing gasoline pumps have all kinds of safety mechanisms built into them to reduce the odds of accidentally igniting them theyre pretty good i mean how many times have you touched off an explosion while filling your car but as reliable as they are those measures are made to stop accidents and no engineer in the world ever thought about building them to stop angry young wizards it took a couple of seconds but then there was a screaming sound something metallic strained past the breaking point and the first tank went up in a bloom of spectacular fire the explosion flung me back scorching my skin and burning away the hair on my eyebrows i landed on my assagainand lay there stunned for a few seconds sudden weariness deeper than anything i had ever known flooded over me in reaction to the energy id expended on my economysized ignition spell and then the second tank went up hot wind and pieces of smoking metal showered against the front of the convenience store im glad the first blast knocked me down if id been standing the metal shrapnel that punched out the entire front wall of windows would have gone through me first i stared at the flames and saw a shape within itor rather i saw a creatureshaped void where the smoke and fire should have been a voice emerged from the fire something huge and terrifying a voice that belonged to gods and monsters of myth how dare you it roared how dare you raise your hand against me then that notfigure crashed to its knees and fell limply onto its side the roaring flames swept in and consumed it and my first true battle was over chapter thirtythree that was my first fight i said quietly to my godmother id never used magic to hurt anything before i rubbed my hand over my head if i hadnt cut class that day i dont know i might never have become what i did is that the lesson you took from the memory lea asked her smile spreading you were clearly being prepared to be an enforcer it seems that way i hedged trying to read her expression but justin never actually tried to get me to hurt anyone why would he wish you to be armed against him before he was certain of your loyalty lea asked he would have it was inevitable probably i said but theres no way we can know really its a long way from breaking boards in practice to breaking bones in life quite because convincing a young mortal to believe that it is right and proper to use magic for violence is a delicate process and one that cannot be rushed i grunted and leaned my head back against the wall of my grave all the wishing in the world will not change the past my godson lea said you would like to believe that perhaps justin had hidden good intentions of some sort that what happened between you was some kind of misunderstanding but you understood him perfectly yeah probably id forgotten how much it hurtthats all i said quietly id forgotten how much i loved him how much i wanted him to be proud of me children are vulnerable lea said they are easily deceived and notoriously subject to such delusions you are no longer a child she leaned forward slightly and said with slight emphasis i am bound to answer two more questions will you ask them now yes i said give me a moment to consider them as you wish lea said i closed my eyes for a moment and tried to clear my thoughts asking questions of inhuman entities can be a tricky and dangerous businesswith the fae more than most you almost never got direct answers from one of the lords of faerie the sidhe asking them direct questions especially questions touching on information relevant to a conflict of some sort was likely to elicit obscure and maliciously misleading answers i was on good terms with my godmother as humansidhe relationships went but that was no reason not to cover my bases so i thought over recent events for a while and looked for the blank spots but i kept getting distracted by the memories of that night in the convenience store they chewed at me and refused to be pushed asideespecially the conversation with he who walks behind priorities i said out loud this is about priorities oh lea asked i nodded i could ask you a lot of questions about my pastand youd answer them that is true or i could ask you about what is happening right now in the city i could find out how i could best help murphy lea nodded but i was sent back here to find my killer i said im supposed to be hunting down whoever killed me and yet ive been doing a whole lot of everything but that in point of fact lea said youve been doing little else i blinked she gave me an enigmatic feline smile oh you bitch i sighed you just love doing that to me lea demurely lowered her gaze she fluttered her eyelashes twice i scowled at her and folded my arms over my chest lea had been involved in my life since i was born and probably before that she could tell me any number of things id been quietly dying to know since i was old enough to ask questions at all she was up on all the current events too all of the high sidhe are fanatic gatherers of information and my godmother was no exception of course they tended to guard their knowledge as ferociously as a dragon guards its goldand they parted with it almost as reluctantly the sidhe arent dummies information is a great deal more valuable than gold any day of the week so i circled back to my earlier question where did my priorities lie what was more important to me digging up secrets from the shadowy bits of my past getting the information i needed to move on to my future or helping my friends and loved ones right now yeah nobrainer what can you tell me about the corpsetaker her resources and her goals i asked lea considered the answer for a moment before nodding to herself the creature you ask about is motivated purely by selfinterest after the body she possessed was killed by a brash impulsive and dangerous young wizard her spirit remained behind it took a score of moons for her to gather enough coherence to act and even then she had precious little power to exert upon the mortal world she was limited to speaking with the few mortals who can perceive such things so she found them and began to manipulate them guiding them together into the group you have already encountered her goal was to assemble her followers spiritual and material and then to abduct a body of appropriate strength clarification i interjected you mean a body with magical capability with significant capability lea replied stressing the phrase when corpsetakers spirit still dwelt upon the mortal coil even bodies with latent talent were hospitable enough for her to exercise her full power but thanks to you and like you my dear godson she has passed beyond the threshold between life and death now she requires a body with a much greater inherent talent in order to use her gifts once she is inside it i tapped my lips with a fingertip thinking so youre saying mort is a major talent in certain respects he is more potent than you were godson and he is a great deal more practicalhe avoided the notice of the white council almost entirely and hid his abilities from them quite neatly the corpsetaker wants him she doubtless intends to make some use of the citys dead and establish herself as the citys dominant practitioner i blinked why i mean shes just going to attract attention from the council if she does that and shes still on their wanted dead or alive but mostly dead list not if she looks like the little ectomancer lea countered she will simply be a concealed talent unveiling itself in a time of dire need but why risk it in the first place why chicago lea frowned golden red brows drawing together i do not know but the fomor are dangerous folk with whom to make bargains i lifted my eyebrows considering the source that was really saying something in my judgment she continued the only reason corpsetaker would deal with the fomor would be to establish her presence hereprobably as a loosely attached vassal of their nobility i found myself scowling well she isnt going to do it this is my town my godmother let out another silverchime laugh is it even now course i said i rubbed at my jaw what happens if she gets morty lea looked momentarily baffled she wins i waved a hand no no how do i get her back out of him her eyelids lowered slightly you have already utilized the only method i know so i gotta get her before she gets to morty i said quietly if you wish to save his life yes and from the sound of the conversation with creepy servitor guy id better break up the corpsetakerfomor team before it gathers any momentum it would seem to be wise lea said why the fomor i asked i mean i barely know who they are why are they all over chicago now who are they once they were the enemies of my people winter and summer alike she said lifting her chin as her emerald eyes grew distant we banished them to the sea now they are the exiles of myth and legend the outcasts of the gods and demons of every land bordering the sea defeated giants fallen gods dark reflections of beings of light they are many races and none joined together beneath the banner of the fomor in a common cause revenge i guessed quite it is a goal best served by gathering power an activity that has been made attractive by the fall of the red court and i have been more than generous with my answer to your question you have i am grateful godmother she smiled at me such a charming child betimes two questions have been answered your third i thought some more somehow i doubted that asking say who killed me would yield any comprehensible results on the other hand what the hell you never know until you try say i asked who killed me chapter thirtyfour the leanansidhe looked down at me her almondshaped green eyes distant pensive oh my child she breathed after a moment you ask such dangerous questions i cocked my head to one side you agreed to answer and i must she agreed and i must not i frowned that doesnt make any sense of course child you are not sidhe she crossed her ankles frowning and i saw a distinct spark of irritated rebellion enter her eyes im of a mind to tell you and end this charade yo u must not eternal silences voice wasnt quite the same minddestroying artillery shell it had been the first time the verdigrisencrusted statue had thoughtspoken to me but that might have been a function of me being sheltered in what amounted to a foxhole the force of it blew leas long hair straight back and her head snapped to one side as sharply as if shed been slapped on the cheek a shadow fell across my grave and i looked up to see the statue looming overhead in broad daylight which meant which meant that whatever the thing was it wasnt a ghost like me id have been withered and blasted into the scraps of what i was now if id ventured out of my grave the lingering power of the dawn wouldnt destroy me but it would hurt a lot and it would cripple and weaken me eternal silence was apparently having no problems with it lea turned her head back to the statue her eyes and expression cold i am perfectly aware of the situation she spat then she tilted her head to one side and paused as if listening to a speaker i couldnt hear she sighed fear not ancient thing i have no intention of depriving either of you what what either of who it was one of those questions to which i knew damned well that no one would tell me the answer crud clearly i should have haggled for seven questions child lea said i will tell you an answer that is true but it is not the answer that you desire three true answers i shot back immediately the bargain was made in good faith lea puffed out a little breath and made a very contained and elegant gesture that somehow managed to convey the same meaning as if she had thrown her hands up will you never cease pushing never ever i said impossible child oh very well if it will fill that bottomless well you call curiosity she shook her head glanced again at eternal silence and said the first truth is that you are acquainted with your killer i swallowed the single truly redeeming factor of the sidhe winter or summer is that they cant knowingly speak a lie they are in fact completely incapable of it thats not the same thing as saying that they cant deceivethey are past masters of deceit after all but they cant do it by directly speaking words that arent true which meant that assuming leas information was good i had just eliminated better than six billion possible suspectsand leas information was always good lea nodded at me the gesture so slight that i almost thought i imagined it the second truth is that your murder was but one of thousands at the killers hands i took that in as well trying to look at it from all angles i knew some people and things who were stonecold killers but beings who had killed thousands of mortals were few and far between famous snipers in the world wars hadnt accumulated more than a few hundred kills serial killers working for decades hadnt done any better but supernatural predators especially the longlived ones could add up that kind of count in a particularly active century or two oh and i had done my best to shut down pretty much every one of them i actually knew the suspect pool was rapidly growing smaller the final truth lea said she suddenly looked very tired your killer was but the proxy of another being and one mightier and more dangerous than he he male the pool dwindled by half give or take so so aside from the dick who killed me i also had his boss to worry about super i can say no more godson lea said you have already said too much lea lifted her hand as if to shield her face from a sudden wind and scowled in eternal silences direction your knowledge of mortals is relatively scarce it is done desist your howling lea paused to look to one side again stiffened her back a little and added a belated and unenthusiastic if you please the silent figure looked from my godmother to me and though it didnt have lungs with which to draw breath i somehow sensed that it was about to speak i know i said hurriedly i know know my path no need to blow my brains out repeating yourself eternal silence seemed faintly vaguely annoyed there came a purely psychic sensation something that that really reminded me of an unsatisfied grunt then the statue turned away and vanished from my sight huh i said after the figure had gone what the hell was that about proxies the leanansidhe muttered barely audible always proxies and respect what she gave me a direct look and i had the impression that she was saying something with particular meaning proxies child those who appear to speak on behalf of another who cannot be present much as i have served as a proxy for my queen over the years or she for me lea shook her head and said i must go child wait i said reaching up to touch her foot with my hand my ectoplasmic flesh did not sink through hers my hand felt nothing yet met an odd resistance to its motion i didnt pass into her as i had mort or molly i blinked a little at that i am of two worlds she said her tone slightly impatient as she often did she had evidently guessed at my thoughts of course i dont feel the same as mortal flesh oh i said uh listen i just want i need to know that youre going to take care of molly she tilted her head and studied me for a moment but child it was never your responsibility to care for the young woman yes it was i said she was my apprentice indeed someone whom you had pledged to teachnot to care for child did you miss the entire point of the exercise i opened my mouth and then closed it again maybe i did what was supposed to happen you were supposed to teach her to care for herself lea replied in a matteroffact tone your failure to do so she frowned i confess that i have only a limited understanding of the concepts of good and evil the differences seem largely semantic to me when applied to empiric situations yet it seems to me that you did her no great kindness by being gentle i met the sidhes impassive gaze for a moment before i looked away you might be right i am very old child it is a safe assumption in most circumstances she sniffed and leaned down to pat my hand in a rather peremptory gesture now then listen to the nice statue and do try to destroy anyone who seeks to do you harm death should be a learning experience after all or whats the point something in my godmothers words managed to land on the ghost of a functioning brain cell somewhere and a flash of inspiration hit me thats it i blurted thats how to handle the corpsetaker lea tilted her head her eyes intent and then smiled a knowing smile ahhh if you can do it i swallowed yeah interesting she murmured if you can control them they are a power potentially deadly even to the one who wields it explosive dangerous and very typical of you excellent then she moved the fingers of her right hand through a series of little gestures and was gone that left me alone in my grave with my thoughts i leaned against the wall again but i didnt settle down on the ground instead i thought about molly and how screwed up she was that was my fault in a lot of ways first thing to jump out at me i never should have let molly go to chichén itzá i had led her into the fight of my life against the red court to save my daughter but i shouldnt have exposed molly to that she was a sensitive a wizard whose magical senses were naturally attuned to the finest lightest most delicate workings of the art or to put it in more harryfriendly terms she had great big honking dumbo ears that were extremely sensitive to loud noises magic is life some forms of deathlike murder the abrupt and violent termination of a life that was not otherwise endingwere the equivalent of enormous screeching feedback to her senses and i had dragged her into a freaking concert hall of it at chichén itzá murderpalooza not to mention setting off the biggest most violent magical curse to be unleashed in the past centuryhell i wasnt exactly a sensitive guy magically speaking but even i had a blank spot in my memory over the minutes right after that arcane explosion its got to be bad for me to shut it out for molly it had to have been a whole lot worse and oh yes she had been shot and nearly killed to go with everything else i had watched her collapse from blood loss mistake it had been a big damned mistake at the time i had been so focused on getting maggie out that id let molly persuade me that she deserved to be on the team i never would have let her do that if id been thinking straight i would have told her to stay at home hold the fort or maybe stay in the car that was what id always done when i was on my way to a slugfest exposure to that kind of noise could quite effectively shatter her sanity and maybe it had even if her mental house was still on a good foundation you didnt need monsters or magic to get damaged by a brush with death soldiers coming home from wars had known that for centuries posttraumatic stress disorder from lifethreatening injuries had screwed up the lives of a lot of peoplepeople who didnt have supernatural powers as a possible outlet for their anger fear grief or guilt and who had been there to catch her the freaking leanansidhe deputy of her wickedness with her nietzsche and darwin were sentimental pansies outlook on life stars and stones when molly insisted on going why didnt i just tell her of course you can come grasshopper ive always wanted to create a mentally mutilated monster of my very own man it wasnt the legacy id wanted to leave behind me i mean i hadnt ever thought much about leaving a legacy truth be told but an apprentice with a crippled heart and mind who was probably going to get hunted down by her own people was definitely never in the plan oh kid i breathed to no one molly im so sorry it turns out ghosts can cry over here said a familiar voice it was later but not much later sometime after noon maybe it was hard to tell from the grave youve never even been here before answered another i was at the funeral how the hell would you know where his grave was i heard fitz let out a sigh frontloaded with so much drama that only a teenager could have managed it without hurting himself is it the gaping hole in the ground over there with the big pentacle on the headstone there was a brief miffed pause and butters answered okay maybe it is footsteps crunched through wet melting snow fitz and butters appeared at the edge of my grave and peered down well butters asked is he there how the hell should i know fitz replied i dont see dead people i hear them and i dont hear anything hey fitz i said the kid jumped he was wearing his newly laundered clothes and had added one of forthills old coats over the top of everything christ yeah hes there oh fantastic butters said hi harry here man help me down help you down its like five feet to the bottom if that just jump down jump into an open grave what kind of idiot are you butters replied i might as well put on a red shirt and volunteer for the away team theres snow and ice and slippery mud down there thats like asking for an ironically broken neck are all doctors whiny girls like you fitz asked hey this whiny girl is still alive because he doesnt do stupid crap fitz snorted so i help you down my foot slips we both fall in and die butters lifted an eyebrow and grunted huh true i pinched at the bridge of my nose oh hells bells guys either get a room or stop flirting and get down here haha fitz said toward me crossly he just called us gay butters blinked for not jumping into a hole we might not be able to climb out of thats kind of insensitive not for that for fitz let out a sigh of vintage teenage impatience christ just give me your hand okay ill swing you down butters fussed for a moment more making sure that fitz had a solid place to plant his feet and then he swung down into my grave he was wearing his winter gear again and carrying the gym bag once he was down he made sure he was out of direct sunlight and started opening the bag whats up i asked fitz trouble fitz said we need your help harry butters said hey wait i said scowling how did butters find you fitz he asked fitz said to butters the little me nodded harry i got from murphy that you were apparently going into social work it wasnt hard to figure out who youd ask for help so i went over to the church to talk to forthill about the situationexcept he wasnt there fitz bit his lip look dresden the father and i talked and he decided he was going to go talk to aristedes on my behalf i blinked and pushed away from the grave wall what i tried to tell him fitz said he wouldnt listen he was i think he was angry but he said he was going to resolve this before it came to some kind of bloodshed hells bells id known aristedes type in the past if it suited him hed kill forthill without an instants hesitation the good father was in danger murphy would go in guns blazing butters said shes going to break my arm when she finds out i didnt tell her we need you to help talk us through this thats crazy i said go in guns blazing its too late for that fitz said look forthill is already there i just met the guy but but i dont want him to get hurt for me we have to move now i cant i said i cant move around in broad daylight we thought of that fitz said butters said you needed a shielded vessel butters said that did he i asked wryly butters rose from the bag holding the plastic flashlight case holding bobs skull he winked at me held it out and said hop in i blinked then i said right lets go i took a deep breath and willed myself forward into the staring eye sockets of the skull chapter thirtyfive there was a very very odd swirling sensation as my spiritself leapt forward and then i was standing in an apartment okay when i say apartment i dont mean it like my old place i lived in a mostly buried box that was maybe twenty by thirty total not including the subbasement where my lab had been apartment dresden had been full of paperback books on scarred wooden shelves and comfortable secondhand furniture this was more like apartment bond james apartment bond penthouse bond really there was a lot of black marble and mahogany there was a fireplace the size of a carport complete with a modestrelatively modestblaze going in it the furniture all matched the rich hardwoods from which it had been made were handcarved in intricate designs it wasnt until the second glance that i saw some of the same rune and sigil work id used on my own staff and blasting rod the cushions on the couches plural couches and recliners and sedans and chaises plural chaises were made of rich fabric i couldnt identify maybe some kind of raw silk and embroidered with more of the same symbols in gold and silver thread a nearby table boasted what looked like a freshly roasted turkey along with a spread of fruits and vegetables and side dishes of every kind it was sort of ridiculous really there was enough food there to feed a small nation but there werent any plates to fill up and there werent any utensils to eat it with it looked gorgeous and it smelled incredible but there was something inert about it something lifeless there was no nourishment on that table not for the body or for the spirit one wall was covered in a curtain i started to pull it aside and found it responding to the touch spreading open of its own accord to reveal a television the size of billboard a hightech stereo system and an entire shelf lined with one kind of videogame console after another complicated little controls sitting neatly next to each one i cant tell a playbox from an xstation but who can keep track of all of them there are like a thousand different kinds of machines to play video games on i mean honestly um i said hello my voice echoed quite distinctlymore than it should have huge marble cavern or not anybody home there was i kid you not a drumroll then from a curtained archway there appeared a young man he looked quite ordinary really tall but not outrageously so slender without being rail thin he had decent shoulders and looked sort of familiar he was dressed like james deanjeans a white shirt a leather bikers jacket the outfit looked a little odd on him somehow forced except for a little skull embroidered in white thread on the jacket just over the young mans heart cymbals crashed and he spread his arms tada bob i said i felt one side of my mouth curling up in amusement this this is the place you always wanted me to let you out of you could fit five or six of mine in here his face spread into a wide grin well i admit my crib is pretty sweet but a gold cage is still a cage harry a gold fallout shelter more like either way you get stircrazy every few decades he said and flopped down onto a chaise you get that this isnt literally what the inside of the skull is like right its my head interpreting what i see into familiar things yeah i said its getting to be kind of common welcome to the world of spirit bob said whats with the food butterss mom is some kind of food goddess bob said his eyes widening thats the spread shes put out over the last few holidays or um butterss sensory memories of it anywayhe let me do a ridealong and then i made this facsimile of what we experienced i lifted my eyebrows he let you do a ridealong in his head bob was not wellknown for his restraint in my experience when he got to go on one of his excursions there was a contract first bob said a limiting document about twenty pages long he covered his bases huh i said i nodded at the food and you just remade it oh sure bob said i can remake whatever in here he waggled his eyebrows you want to see a replay of that time molly got the acid all over her clothes in the lab and had to strip um pass i said i sat down gingerly on a chair making sure i wasnt going to sink through it or something it seemed to behave like a normal chair tv and stuff too i am kinda made out of energy man bob said he pointed at the wall of media equipment you remember me broadcasting to your spirit radio right im like totally tapped in now television satellite imagery broadband internetyou name it i can do it how do you think i know so much hundreds of years of assisting wizards i said he waved a hand that too but i got this whole huge internet thing to play on now butters showed me his grin turned into a leer and its like ninety percent porn theres the bob i know and love i said love ick he replied and i am and im not i mean you get that i change based on who possesses the skull right sure i said so im a lot like i was with you even though im with butters because he met me back then first impression and whatnot highly important i grunted how long do we have to talk not as simple to answer as youd think bob said but youre still pretty cherry so lets keep it simple a few minutes speaking linearlybut i can stretch it out for a while subjectively huh i said neat nah just sort of the way we roll on this side of the street he said what do you want to know who killed me i replied oooh sorry cant help you with that except as a sounding board okay i said lemme catch you up on what i know i filled bob in on everything since the train tunnel i didnt hold back much of anything bob was smart enough to fill in the vast majority of gaps if i left anything out anyway and he could compile information and deduce coherent facts as well as any mind i had ever known and besides he was my oldest friend he listened his gold brown eyes intent completely focused on me wow he said when id finished you are so completely fucked i arched an eyebrow at him and said how do you figure he rolled his eyes oh where do i start how about with the obvious uriel uriel i said what a wizard tied in with a bunch of really elemental sources of power dies right after signing off on some deals that guarantee hes about to become a whole hell of a lot darkercapital letter intendedand theres this suddenhe made air quotes with his fingers irregularity about his death he gets sent back to the mortal coil to get involved again and you think an angel isnt involved somewhere remember uriel is the blackops guy of the archangels hes conned the father of lies for crying out loud you think he wouldnt scam you uh i said i felt a little thick see bob said your first tiny piece of fleshfree existence and already youre lost without me i shook my head look man im just just a spirit now this is just like paperwork im getting filled out before i catch the train to wherever bob rolled his eyes again and snorted oh sure it is you get sent back here just as the freaking corpsetaker is setting herself up as queen of chicago getting ready to wipe out the defenders of humanitysuch as they arehere in town and its just a coincidence business as usual he sniffed theyre totally playing you they i said think about it bob said i mean stop for a minute and actually think i know its been a while winter i said snow a foot deep at the end of spring queen mab obviously bob said shes here in chicago somewhere and because duh shes the winter queen she brought winter with her he pursed his lips for a few more days anyway bob was right mab might flaunt her power in the face of the oncoming season but if she didnt back down her opposite number titania would come for herat the height of summers power the solstice if previous patterns held true harry i dont want to comment about your new girlfriend but shes still here six months after you got shot seems kind of clingy wait i said youre saying that mab and uriel are in on something together the queen of air and darkness and a flipping archangel we live in strange times bob said philosophically theyre peers of a sort harry hey word is that even the almighty and lucifer worked a deal on job spiderman has teamed up with the sandman before luke and vader did the emperor it happens spiderman is pretend and doesnt count i said you start drawing distinctions like this now bob asked besides hes real like somewhere i blinked um what you think your universe is the only universe harry come on creation totally freaking huge room enough for you and spiderman both he spread his hands look im not a faith guy i dont know what happens on the other side or if you wind up going to a heaven or hell or something reasonably close to them that isnt my bag but i know a shell game when i see one i swallowed and pushed a hand back through my hair the fomors servitors corpsetaker and her gang even aristedes and his little crew theyre pieces on the board just like you bob agreed cheerfully notice anyone else who pushed you a space or two recently by which i mean that you only recently noticed i scowled other than everyone around me i was sort of thinking about the one behind you bob said his expression grew suddenly serious the walker i took a slow breath he who walks behind it was only now looking back at my crystalline memories and applying what id learned during my adult lifetime since they happened that i could really appreciate what had gone on that night the walker had never been trying to kill me if it had wanted to do that it didnt need to play with me it could simply have appeared and executed me the way it had poor stan at the gas station it had been trying to push me to shape me into something dangerouslike maybe a weapon like maybe the same way justin had i had always assumed that justin had controlled he who walks behind that my old master had sent him after me when i fled but what if id been a flipping idiot what if their relationship had worked the other way around what if justin who had betrayed me had similarly been backstabbed by his own inhuman mentor when the creature had in essence prepared me to destroy justin lotta really scary symmetry there i whispered yeah bob said still serious you are in a scary place harry he took a deep breath and it gets worse worse how its just a theory he said because this isnt my bag but look theres flesh and theres spirit right yeah i said mortals have both right there together along with the soul i thought it was the same thing soul spirit um bob said complicated think of your spiritself as a seed your soul is the earth it grows in you need both when you die the way ive heard it they sort of blend together to become something new its a caterpillarbutterfly thing okay i said how does that make it worse you here now arent a spirit bob said you arent a real ghost you youre just running around in your freaking soul man i mean for practical purposes its the same thing but but what but if something happens to you here now its for keeps i mean forever you could capitale end man spin right off the wheel altogether or worse i swallowed i mean i realized that id been in a serious situation all the way down the line but not one that could potentially be described using words like eternal joy bob shook his head i didnt think it was possible for them to do that to you according to what ive heard your souls your own id have thought you would have to walk into something like this willingly but i held up the heel of my hand and butted my forehead against it in steady rhythm oh harry bob said his voice profoundly disappointed you didnt they didnt explain it exactly the way you did i said not in so many words but they gave you a choice captain murphy had done exactly that it had been phrased in such a way that i hadnt really had much of a choice but id had a choice yeah and you chose to hazard your eternal soul even though you get all worked up about that sort of thing it wasnt phrased quite like that i began only it really had been jack had warned me that i might be trapped forever hadnt he or well um yeah i guess technically i did well bob said he cleared his throat you idiot argh i said my head hurts no it doesnt bob said scornfully you just think it should i paused and reflected and saw that bob was right and i decided that my head hurt anyway dammit just because i was a spirit or a naked soul or whatever didnt mean i needed to start ignoring who i had been bob i said lifting my head suddenly what does this mean i mean why not just let me die and move along like normal bob pursed his lips um yeah no clue what if i felt short of breath i hardly wanted to say it what if im not bobs eyes widened oh oooooohhhhhhhh uriels peoplemurphys dad and so ondid they say anything about your body that it wasnt available i said but not that it was gone bob pressed no i said they they didnt say that wow bob said eyes wide mine probably were too what do i do how the hell should i know man bob asked ive never had a soul or a body what did they tell you to do find my killer i said but that means im dead right bob waved a hand harry dead isnt look even by terms of the nonsupernatural dead is a really fuzzy area even mortal medicine regards death as a kind of process more than a state of beinga reversible process in some circumstances what are you getting at i asked theres a difference between dead and and gone i swallowed so what do i do bob lunged to his feet what do you do he pointed at the table of mother butterss feast food youve got that to maybe get back to and youre asking me what to do you find your freaking killer well both do it ill totally help the light in the room suddenly turned red a redalert sound i remembered from old episodes of star trek buzzed through the air uh i said what the hell is that butters calling me bob said leaping to his feet the form of the young man who i now realized must have looked a lot like butters when he was a kid only taller started coming apart into the sparks of a wood fire come on bob said lets go chapter thirtysix i didnt actually will myself out of the skull the way i had gone in bobs passage just sort of swept me along in his wake like a leaf being tugged after a passing tractortrailer it was a forcible reminder that the way things stood now bob was the heavyweight i was just the skinny newbie i hated that feeling that feeling sucked i reintegrated standing in a dusty room afternoon sunlight slanted through it its danger abated by the thick coating of grime over the windows the place looked like an industrial buildings entryway there was what had been a heavyduty desk maybe for a receptionist or security guard an alcove housed rows of small personal lockers several rectangles of lessfaded commercialgrade taupe paint on the walls had probably been where a time clock and timecard holders had gone butters stood nearby holding bobs flashlight and the eyes of the skull were glowing brightly with bobs presence in the physical world now that he had left his apartment the little me looked tense focused but not afraid it wasnt much of a mystery how theyd gotten into the room fitz stood there with a set of bolt cutters with threefeetlong handles held over his shoulder fitz looked scared enough for everyone there the kid was back in the lair of his erstwhile mentor and terrified of his wrath yeah i knew that feeling butters fumbled his little spirit radio out of his pocket and asked in a hushed voice dresden you here to your left i said quietly he shone bobs eyelights my way and evidently saw me illuminated by them oh he said looking relieved right good i had no clue why he looked relieved it wasnt like i could do anything unless some random ghost came by in which case my memorybased magic could cook another being incapable of affecting the material world but i guess he looked up to me or at least to my memory and i owed it to him to help however i could so i gave him a calm nod and an encouraging clench of my fist solid i take it weve come in through a blind spot i asked fitz quietly fitz nodded the chains on the doors were enough and he couldnt extend his guard spells any farther than the main room i grunted thats good why butters asked means aristedes doesnt have enough power to just burn you to cinders on the spot butters swallowed oh good doesnt mean he cant kill you i said just that he wont have a high fx budget when he does hes fast fitz said his voice shook hes really really fast like how fast butters asked fast like jackie chan or fast like the flash little of both i said he can cover ground fast and he can hit like a truck fitz nodded tightly oh butters said super we probably shouldnt fight him then he set the flashlight aside and rummaged in the duffel bag give me just a second a shadow flickered by one of the grimefilmed windows fitz let out a hiss and clutched the bolt cutters with both hands ready to use them like a club butters let out an odd little chirping sound and pulled a big old copissue flashlightslashclub from his bag the shadow passed over another window someone outside was moving toward the door coming in behind us i took a quick look at the flashlight and made sure i was standing in the light of bobs eyes and out of the path of any direct sunlight that might come through the door i couldnt do anything but if i was visibly standing there when the door opened maybe i could distract aristedes if it was him coming through maybe hed speedrush right through me and into a wall and knock himself out like a cartoon villain that would make me look cool upon cool more likely i wouldnt accomplish anything but when your friends are in danger you try anyway the door opened and i raised my arms into a dramatic stagemagicians pose it felt ridiculous but body postures draw reactions from human beings on an almost atavistic level we arent that terribly far removed from our primal roots where body language was more important than anything we said my stance declared me the ruler of the local space a man who was in control of everything happening around him one who others would follow a mix of maestro and madman that would identify me to instinct as the most dangerous thing in the room butters and fitz hit the wall on either side of the door and raised their improvised weapons as it swung open the door squealed dramatically on its hinges and a large menacing figure entered the building it hesitated lifting a hand to shield its eyes apparently staring at me butters let out a shout and swung his flashlight at the figure fitz by contrast swept the heavy set of bolt cutters down in silence even in that flash of time i had to admire butters the little guy couldnt fight and he knew it but he was smart enough to shout and draw the attention of the intruder toward the smaller weaker and lighterarmed of the two of them he had intentionally thrown himself at a larger opponent to force the man to turn so that fitz could swing at his back no fighter maybe but the little guy had guts enough for any three bruisers it didnt do either of them any good the large man seemed to sense the ploy he ducked the swinging bolt cutters without so much as turning around and simultaneously snapped out his left arm the heel of his hand thrusting forward he hit butters squarely in the belly and sent the little man sprawling then he whirled as fitz recovered his balance and swung the bolt cutters again he caught them with one hand matching fitzs strength with a single arm then with a sinuous motion of his upper body that reminded me of murphy at work he both took the bolt cutters from fitzs hands and sent the young man sprawling into butters who had just begun to climb to his feet again they both went down in a heap as the door clanged shut daniel carpenter michael carpenters eldest son stood in place for a moment holding the bolt cutters lightly as tall and as strong as his father his grey eyes distant and cold then he glanced at me opened his mouth and closed it again i waved at him and said hi daniel the sound of my voice came to him only through the radio in butterss pocket he blinked what the hell daniel asked staring at me then he looked at butters then at fitz and then at the bolt cutters i mean seriously what the hell butters what the hell are you doing butters pushed fitz off him and eyed daniel with annoyance quietly please he said in a lower intent voice were sneaking up on a bad guy here and you arent helping is that what youre doing daniel askedbut at least he lowered his voice because ms murphy thinks youre losing your mind butters blinked what why would karrin think that because of that thing daniel said nodding toward me ouch i said that stings daniel dude butters said dont be a dick thats dresden or at least its his spirit which is mostly the same thing we dont know that daniel shot back things from the spirit world can look like whatever they want to look like you know that didnt we already go through this properidentification thing i complained i know right butters said to me see what shes gotten to be like who daniel demanded karrin obviously butters shot back since you vanished harry shes been fighting a war and using whatever weapons she can find hell shes even taken help from marcone daniels face flushed darker do not talk about ms murphy that way shes the only reason the fomor havent terrorized chicago like they have everywhere else the two dont preclude one another butters said with a sigh he looked at me and spread his hands you see what im dealing with i grimaced and nodded its about her job i think shes insecure about her place in the world she was like this when i first opened up shop about the time she got put in charge of sisuspicious closeminded negative outlook about everything it was impossible to talk to her youre sneaking around against her orders daniel said to butters butters got to his feet and offered fitz a hand up orders this isnt the army man and murphy isnt the king of chicago she cant order me to do anything i notice you say that when she is not in the room i said im an independent thinker not a martyr butters replied he squinted at daniel wait a minute she had you tailing me damn i said that is paranoid daniel shook his head scowling briefly at me youre going to have to come with me mr butters no butters said im not daniel set his jaw ms murphy said that for your own good i was to get you out of whatever that creature got you into so lets go no butters said glaring up at the much larger young man im not leaving forthill to the mercy of a punk sorcerer daniel blinked his eyes several times and the determined belligerence went out of his stance the father hes here hes in danger it gets less likely were going to be able to help him the longer we stand around gabbing butters said he recovered his bag rummaged in it and added this will work better with you here anyway he straightened up and tossed a folded square of grey cloth at daniel put that on stay next to me dont talk daniel stared at the cloth dubiously then looked at butters for forthill butters said quietly softening his voice well leave as soon as hes safe and you can take me straight to karrin you have my word okay daniel agonized over it for a couple of seconds then he nodded at butters and unfolded the grey cloth oh i said suddenly understanding the little guys plan good call the fabric isnt exactly right but its close this could work butters nodded i thought it might how should we approach it smalltimer like aristedes is insecure about the size of his magical penis i said give his ego a few crumbs and hell eat out of your hand well have to go to radio silence butters said there wasnt time to make the headphones work with it if i think of anything imperative i can tell fitz hell pass it on fitz looked nervously between butters daniel and me oh uh sure because i can hear dresden even without a radio butters drew a second square of grey cloth from the bag and then tossed the bag over to one side calmly he unfolded the cloth and threw the hooded cloak it proved to be over his shoulders fastening a clasp at his throat so harry butters said how do the wardens like to make an entrance chapter thirtyseven daniel carpenter leaned back lifted a sizefourteen work boot and kicked the door leading to the factory floor completely off its hinges i was impressed the kid had power i mean sure the door was old and all the hinges rusted but it was still a freaking steel door and it went a couple of feet through the air before it slammed down onto the floor with an enormous hollow boom that echoed through the huge room beyond it thank you butters said in the absolutely obnoxious british accent he normally reserved for the nobleman his players were supposed to hate at our old weekly gaming sessions he sniffed and strode onto the factory floor his footsteps clear and precise in the empty space the fake wardens cloak floated in his wake daniel stomped along a step behind butters his dark brows lowered into a thugs glower it looked pretty natural on him he had one huge hand clamped down on the back of fitzs neck and was dragging the kid along with brusque casual power fitz looked intensely uncomfortable butters stopped at a faint old line of chalk on the floor regarded it for a moment and then called out hello i say there is anyone at home im here to speak to the sorcerer aristedes i was told he was to be found here he paused for maybe a second and a half and added ive a warlock to catch in trinidad in an hour i would prefer not to draw this out no one answered there were soft furtive sounds an old tennis shoe dragging across the concrete floor with a faint squeak footsteps a soft exhalation a faint grunt of exertion warden butters said he picked at his teeth with his thumbnail daniels shoulders locked up and tightened and fitz let out a short yowl its me he called out frantically its fitz sir they say theyre here to talk to you about the fomor fitz said a voice from off to one side one of the kids from the driveby the little one emerged from behind a set of metal cabinets he got a look at fitzs situation and tensed into a crouch ready to run hey zero fitz said trying to sound casual as he all but dangled from daniels grip the boss home there was a swishing sound as if someone had thrown a large ball at considerable speed and then aristedes said from directly behind us i am daniel twitched but butters concealed his reaction masterfully he simply glanced over his shoulder and regarded aristedes who now stood in the newly doorless entryway butters arched an eyebrow as if hed seen the trick before but at least found it welldone and turned to face aristedes he gave the man a slight bow and said i am warden valdo this is warden smythe daniel glowered if you arent otherwise occupied i wonder if we might ask for a moment of your time aristedes studied the three of them for a silent moment his eyes narrowed he was wearing a ragged old dark blue bathrobe over loose cotton chinos and a tank top the hair on his chest was thick and dark the tattoos around his skull and over his cheekbones stood out sharply against his pale skin you are from the white council he asked butters studied him for a moment and then sighed should i start at the beginning again our files describe you as a minor but competent operator were they mistaken aristedes folded his arms his expression a neutral mask i am of course aware of the white council what business do you have with me and why are you holding my apprentice prisoner i did a quick circle around aristedes since i was all ghosty he never knew i was there he didnt so much as get goose bumps on the back of his neck i guessed that he was the opposite of forthill being a selfcentered megalomaniac hadnt prepared aristedes to be sensitive to anyones soul at all theres a bulge under the robe at the small of his back i said to fitz blink twice for yes if you know what it is blink once for no fitz shot a glance at me and blinked twice a weapon i asked two blinks gun one blink knife two blinks okay i said thats definitely a needtoknow fact if you get a chance or if things get violent tell daniel about it two more nervous blinks i hesitated and then said in a gentler voice hang tough kid ive been where you are its going to be okay no blinks fitz bit his lip butters meanwhile kept the dialogue going clearly the council finds the recent activities of the fomor somewhat repulsive just as clearly our recently concluded war with the red court has left us less able to act than we would have been otherwise which thinking about it probably wasnt true the council finished the war with the red court with more active experienced dangerous wardens than theyd had when it started granted the vast majority of them were a bunch of kids mollys age or younger but they were already veterans but i was betting that the fomor picking on a bunch of lowlevel talents was a problem that was fairly far down their priority list id heard the wardens were adept at coming to the point aristedes said should we start again at the beginning to give you another chance to get there butters gave the sorcerer a frosty smile and a small inclination of his head you and your crew are still here that suggests competence we approve of competence aristedes tilted his head to one side and was silent for a moment youve come to discuss a relationship of some kind lets not get ahead of ourselves butters replied im not a recruiter this is a visit a groundlevel evaluation if you will i hated to leave the three of them standing in front of aristedes and his knife with nothing but butterss gaming accent and a few yards of grey cloth to protect them but we hadnt come here to face down aristedes we were here for forthill the hasty plan id sketched with butters called for me to locate the father while they kept aristedes attention besides those cloaks represented something that aristedes would respect if he had two brain cells to rub together the wardens of the white council had never been regarded as friendly figures like your local traffic cop people feared themprobably all the more so since the war with the red court the wardens were the guys who gave you one warning way before you were anywhere close to crossing the line by breaking one of the laws of magic the next time you saw them they were probably there to cut off your head whether they were more respected or more feared depended greatly on ones point of view but no one ever ever took them lightly it felt right somehow that butters was trading on their fearsome reputation maybe it felt right because that reputation was like me immaterialbut not unable to alter events the ghost of the wardens ferocity could do as much as i could to keep an eye on my companions so i wished them luck within the silence of my thoughts and set out to accomplish my part of the plan i vanished and reappeared at ceiling level being careful to stay out of any direct sunlight as it streamed through a few small windows high up on the walls the ceiling wasnt all that high compared to the area of the factory floor and it took me several tries before i recognized the location of the gangs camp in all that abandoned space i willed myself over to it and found forthill the priest was lying very still on the floor curled into a half circle i couldnt see if he was breathing and i couldnt touch him to check for a pulse i grimaced and knelt to thrust my hand into the matter of one of his feet i felt the sharp odd sensation of contact with living flesh like when id touched both morty and my apprentice and not the sharp tingling of contact with something solid but inert he was alive it felt like my own heart had stopped beating and then lurched into gear again i studied him for a moment trying to assess what had happened to him there was blood coming from several cuts around his face where his thin elderly skin had broken open under a sharp blowacross his cheekbones his brow ridges and on his chin his lip had been split and was swelling hed taken a beating from someones fistsor possibly from openhanded slaps delivered with supernatural speed that felt right the old priest a living breathing symbol of everything aristedes resented must have shown up to talk no matter how polite the father had been his simple presence would have been challenge enough to the ego of anyone like the sorcerer challenges could be answered only with violence and the slaps he delivered would have been both painful and insulting forthills left arm was pressed against his ribs hed fallen and curled up around his midsection the sorcerer must have given him some body blows as well broken ribs maybe or worse everything about trauma was worse when it happened to the elderlythinner skin less muscle less bone worn organs they were vulnerable i ground my teeth and looked around the camp aristedes had left a guard to watch forthill he was a boy and he might have been a very scrawny and underfed tenyearold at most he sat near the fire barrel shivering holding a rusted old steak knife his eyes roamed everywhere but he wouldnt look at the priests still form forthill suddenly shuddered and let out a soft moan before sinking into stillness again the little boy with the knife looked away his eyes suddenly wet he wrapped his arms around his knees and rocked back and forth i wasnt sure which sight hurt more i clenched my jaw what animal would do this to an old man to a child i felt my skin beginning to heat up a reflection of the rage that had swelled up inside me again it is better not to let such thoughts occupy your mind said a very calm very soothing voice i spun to face the speaker the words of a spell on my tongue ghostly power kindling in the palm of my right hand a young woman stood over forthill opposite me in a shaft of sunlight that spilled in through a hole in a blackedout window she was dressed in a black suit a black shirt a black tie her skin was darknot like someone of african ancestry but like someone had dunked her in a vat of perfectly black ink the sclera the whites of her eyes were black too in fact the only things on her that werent ink black were her eyes and the short sword she held in her hand the blade dangling parallel to her leg they were both shining silver with flecks of metallic gold she met my gaze calmly and then glanced down at my right hand where flickers of fire sent out wisps of smoke peace harry dresden she said i have not come to harm anyone i stared at her for a second and then checked the guard the little kid hadnt reacted to the strangers voice or presence ergo she was a spirit like me there were plenty of spirit beings who might show up when someone was dying but not many of them could have been standing around in a ray of sunlight and id seen a sword identical to the one she currently held back at the police station in chicago between youre an angel i said quietly an angel of death she nodded her head yes i rose slowly i was a lot taller than the angel i scowled at her back off she arched an eyebrow at me then she said are you threatening me maybe im just curious about who will show up for you when its your turn she smiled it moved only her lips what exactly do you think you will accomplish here im looking out for my friend i said hes going to be all right your services are not required that is not yet clear the angel said allow me to clarify i said touch him and you and i are going to throw down she pursed her lips briefly and then shook her head one of us will hes a good man i said i wont let you hurt him the angels eyebrows went up again is that why you think im here hello i said angel of death grim reaper ring any bells the angel shook her head again smiling a little more naturally you misunderstand my purpose educate me i said it is not within my purview to choose when a life will end i am only an escort a guardian sent to convey a newfreed soul to safety i scowled you think forthill is so lost that he needs a guide she blinked at me once no he needs she seemed to search for the proper word his soul needs a bodyguard to that purpose i am here a bodyguard i blurted what the hell has the father done that he needs a bodyguard in the afterlife she blinked at me again gentle surprise on her face it made her look very youngyounger than molly he he spent a lifetime fighting darkness she said speaking gently and a bit slowly as if she were stating something perfectly obvious to a small child there are forces that would want to take vengeance upon him while his soul is vulnerable during the transition i stared hard at the angel for several seconds but i didnt detect anything like a lie in her i looked down at the fire in my hand and suddenly felt a little bit silly and you youre going to be the one to fight for him she stared at me with those silver eyes and i felt my legs turn a little rubbery it wasnt fear exactly it was something deeper something more aweinspiringthe feeling i had when id once seen a tornado from less than a quarter of a mile away seen it tearing up trees by their roots and throwing them around like matchsticks staring out of those silver eyes was not a spirit or a being or a personality it was a force of freaking natureimpersonal implacable and utterly beyond any control that i could exert prickles of sweat popped out on my forehead and i broke the gaze quickly looking down a dark cool hand touched my cheek something of both benediction and gentle rebuke contained within it if this is anthonys time she said quietly i will see him safely to the next world the prince of darkness himself will not wrest him from me her fingertips moved to my chin and lifted my face to look at her again she gave me a small smile as she lowered her hand neither will you harry blackstone copperfield dresden noble though your intentions may be i didnt look away from her the angel knew my name down to the last inflection holy crap any fight against her would be very very brief and i was glad i hadnt simply allowed my instincts to take over okay then i said a little weakly if you arent here to kill him why dont you help him hes a part of your organization as i have already told you it is not given me to choose when a life will endor not end why not i mean why the hell not hasnt forthill earned a break from you people it isnt a question of what he deserves the angel said quietly it is a question of choice so choose to help him it isnt hard her face hadnt shifted from its serene expression for more than a few seconds during the entirety of the conversation but now it did change it went flat and hard her silver eyes blazed not for a mortal no not hard at all but such a thing is beyond me i took a slow breath thinking then i said free will she inclined her head in a micronod her eyes still all but openly hostile something given to you yet denied to me i may not take any action that abrogates the choices of a mortal forthill chose to die is that what youre saying nothing so linear she said this singularity is an amalgamation of many many choices fitz chose to place what little precious trust he had in you you chose to involve anthony in the young mans existence anthony chose to come here despite the danger aristedes chose to assault him waldo and daniel chose to involve themselves in his rescue beyond that every single one of the people known to each individual i have mentioned have made choices that impacted the life of those involved together all of you have determined this reality she spread her hands who am i to unmake such a thing fine i said be that way i will the angel responded serenely i took one more look at forthill and vanished heading back toward butters and company if the angel wasnt going to help the good father id damn well do it myself it was only a couple of jumps back to the far end of the factory floor and it took me only a few seconds to get there fitz i said i found the father hes that seems reasonable aristedes was saying to butters may i ask one question why not butters answered fitz was squirming in daniels grip leaning away from aristedes one look at his face told me why hed recognized something in his old teachers words or manner id seen the faces of abused wives while they watched their husbands drink sickly certain that the cycle of abuse would renew itself in the coming hours fitz knew what aristedes looked like when he was about to dispense violence wardens aristedes said why do you not carry swords crap the question caught butters off guard he could have smoothed over the question with a good answer or maybe even ignored it altogether convincinglybut he did the one thing he absolutely could not do if he was going to sell his false identity to aristedes he hesitated couldnt blame him i guess hed come licketysplit after forthill moving as fast as possible wed spent all of maybe ninety seconds on putting our plan together which had only been possible thanks to butterss foresight in packing those cloaksapparently hed thought it might be useful to have them on hand to create a warden sighting or two if it seemed like the citys supernatural scene could use some reassurance in our hurry to retrieve the good father i hadnt thought about the whole sword anglefor good reason the hell of it was that aristedes was reaching an accurate conclusion based on an erroneous assumption the swords of the wardens were fairly famous in supernatural circles bright silver supernaturally sharp blades perfect for chopping off the heads of warlocks and wrought with spells to deflect or disrupt magical attacks or enchantments when you saw wardens you saw their swords or at least that had been the status quo until recently the enchantress who had made them warden luccio had lost her capacity to create them when corpsetaker had swapped her into the body of a young woman with very little natural inclination toward magic as a result most of the new wardens starting with me didnt have a groovy sword which meant that most of the wardens didnt carry swords any longer but that impression apparently hadnt trickled down to street level yet things started happening very quickly aristedes produced his knife a wickedlooking number with a lot of extraneous points on itan interpretation of a bowie knife as done by h r giger daniel carpenter had evidently noticed fitzs behavior and deduced its meaning he dragged both fitz and butters behind him with a sweep of his brawny arms and positioned himself between them and the sorcerer his hands up in a defensive martial arts stance butters let out a yelp as his ass hit the cold concrete floor fitz took the fall and rolled his eyes wide with terror as he regained his feet and started to run you are all dead men aristedes snarled and then he blurred forward almost too quickly to be seen the knife gleaming in his hand chapter thirtyeight aristedes was nothing more than a streak in the air as he closed on daniel slamming into him knocking him back as daniel fell that wicked knife gleamed and whipsawed back and forth half a dozen times in the space of a second striking daniel in the chest and belly on every blow anyone other than michael and charity carpenters son would have been gutted like a fish the kid had gotten some serious trainingmaybe from murphy maybe from the einherjaren maybe from his father probably from all of them im not a professional when it comes to handtohand combat of the supernatural variety or otherwise but i know enough to know how little i know and one of the things i know is that you dont just decide to time your moves a second in advance to compensate for a lack of supernatural speed you have to learn that stuff to build it into your reflexes with weeks or months of painstaking practice daniel had he started rolling with the slashes of the knife before aristedes had fully closed the distance even as he stumbled backward from the force of the sorcerers initial impact the knife bit into his chest and bellyand found armor waiting for it beneath his winter coat daniel was wearing a garment i recognized as charitys handiwork a doublethick kevlar vest with a coat of thick titanium rings sandwiched in between the layers of ballistic cloth kevlar could stop bullets but it didnt do squat for blades that was what the titanium mail was for sparks flew up in rapid succession as the knife struck armor the impact sounded like someone hitting a side of beef with a baseball bat but daniels body was in motion giving in with each of the blows robbing them of the most savage portion of their power the knife never touched his skin aristedes came to a stop after that blindingfast combination of attacks and crouched his arm out to one side parallel to the ground the knife gripped hard in it he looked like an extra in a martial arts moviethe goober daniel turned his backward momentum into a roll and came up on his feet it didnt look very graceful but he was obviously in control of the motion and he dropped into a fighting crouch about twenty feet from the sorcerer one hand went into his hip pocket and came out with a simple folding lock knife with a black plastic handle with his thumb he snapped out a blade maybe four inches long and held the weapon tucked in close to his body point toward aristedes he jerked the cloak off his back and with a few flicks of his arm wrapped the heavy material around his left forearm then he held his left hand a little in front of him palm down fingers looseready to block or grab aristedes had a good poker face but for the moment i didnt have anything to do except watch what was going on and i knew his type the sorcerer hadnt been psychologically prepared for daniels reaction the stupid bruiser was supposed to be bleeding on the floor maybe begging for his life at the very least he should have been running terrified but instead the very large young man had apparently shrugged off the deadly attacks and meant to fight nice knife daniel said scorn dripped from the words get it out of a magazine from the last fool who tried a blade against me daniel bared his teeth come here ill give you this one aristedes flicked his knife through a little series of spins making it dance nimbly through his fingers it was a stupid thing to do in a real situation but the guy clearly knew how to use the weapon then his body tightened as he hissed a word and once more he flashed toward daniel the body language before the spell that granted him speed had given him away the kid was ready again he sidestepped and swept his arms in a pair of half circles as aristedes flashed by there was the sound of shearing cloth and then the sorcerer was past him daniel turned to face aristedes with a hiss of pain his left arm wrapped in the grey cloak was bleeding red spreading through the grey in a slow but growing stain no armor there aristedes murmured with a smile daniel said nothing he just took position again holding his bloodied knife level its point toward the sorcerer aristedes looked down and saw the long shallow cut across his right pectoral a fine sheet of blood had mixed with the sweat that had broken out on his skin heads were popping out of the debris and refuse now zero and his compatriotsmaybe a dozen kids all toldwere emerging from their hiding spots to watch the fight from the looks on their faces it was the first time theyd ever seen their fearless leader get hurt hell if theyd been anything like me when i was young they probably had believed that he couldnt be hurt daniel carpenter had just shown them differentlyand the sorcerer knew it aristedes face set into a grimace of undiluted hate as he stared at daniel then he did something unexpectedhe simply walked forward and pounced into knife range the exchange was brief most knife fights are daniel the taller of the two had the advantage of reach somewhat negated by the length of the sorcerers blade he wore armor over his torso and was stronger but aristedes was the faster of the two even without magicand he had a lot more experience hands and knives flashed all whipcrack speed and whispering violence as they parted the air i couldnt keep track of the individual cuts there were just too many of them i saw daniels mail shirt turn aside another pair of strikes one of them hard enough to send a titanium ring tinkling across the floor a flicker of red fanned through the air where one of the fighters lost a splash of blood daniel let out a short grunt then another aristedes barked out a sound of both pain and satisfaction the two parted both breathing heavily combat taxes a bodys reserves like nothing else on earth seconds of it can leave you exhausted even if youre in great shape daniel staggered and went down on one knee letting out a grunt of surprise there were wounds on both of his legspunctures deep stabs neither wound had hit one of the big arteries or hed already be unconscious but they were right through the quadriceps muscles and had to have been agonizing he snarled and attempted to rise halfway there he faltered and went down again training courage and fortitude get you only so far a deep enough wound on either leg could have taken daniel out of the fight he had them on both aristedes hadnt come away clean from the exchange though there was a deep cut on his right arm where daniels knife had caught him hard flesh hung from a flap of skin blood flowed but his arm still seemed to work if aristedes lived long enough and if he kept the arm he was going to have one hell of a scar to show off later but that wasnt going to matter much to daniel the sorcerer switched his knife to his left hand and stared at daniel with flat eyes kids like you havent learned the price of doing business when to trade pain for victory he blurred into motion again and daniel lifted his knife then the younger man cried out and fell to his side clutching at his right arm with his left hand his knife landed on the floor and spun away from him eventually coming to rest against aristedes feet the sorcerer took his time transferring his own knife to his left hand and picking up daniels he tested the blades balance and edge and said serviceable he carefully wiped the blood from daniels blade against the leg of his trousers closed it and slipped it into the pocket of his bathrobe then he fixed the young man with a nasty smile raised his own blade over his head so that daniels blood dripped down it and fell on his upraised arm and he started to chant i felt the magic gathering at once it wasnt particularly powerful but that was by my own standards magic doesnt absolutely require a ton of horsepower to be dangerous it took aristedes maybe ten seconds to summon enough will and focus for whatever he was doing and i stood there clenching my fists and my jaw in impotent fury daniel saw what was happening and found an old can in the detritus on the floor beside him he threw it at aristedes in an awkward lefthanded motion but came nowhere close to striking the sorcerer aristedes pointed the knife at daniel his eyes reptilian hissed a word and released the spell michaels eldest son arched his back and let out a strangled scream of agony aristedes repeated the word and daniel contorted in pain again his back bowing more than i would have thought possible i stifled a furious scream of my own and looked away as the sorcerer bent and twisted the energy of creation itself into a means of torment looking away was almost worse aristedes young followers were watching with a sick fascination daniel screamed until he was out of breath and then began to strangle himself as he tried to keep it up one of the kids bent suddenly and began retching onto the floor this is my house aristedes said his expression never changing i am the master here and my will is butters appeared behind aristedes from around an upended vat of some kind and swung three feet of lead pipe into the side of the sorcerers knee there was a sharp clear crack as bone and cartilage snapped and aristedes screamed and went down that sound you just heard butters said his voice tight with fear and adrenaline was your lateral collateral ligament and anterior cruciate ligament tearing free of the joint its also possible that your patella or tibia was fractured aristedes just lay there in pain gasping through clenched teeth a line of spittle drooled out of his mouth butters hefted the lead pipe like a batter at the plate get rid of the knife or i start on your cranium aristedes kept on gasping but didnt look up he tossed the creepy knife away the one in your pocket too butters said the sorcerer gave him a look of pure hatred then he tossed away the knife hed appropriated from daniel sit tight daniel butters called ill be with you in just a second m fine daniel groaned from the ground he didnt sound fine but as i watched i saw him winding pieces of the slashed cloak around the wound in his right arm binding them closed and slowing the bleeding tough kid and thinking under pressure butters focused on aristedes i dont want to hurt you he said i want to help you your knee has been destroyed you will never walk again if you dont get medical attention ill take you to a hospital what do you want aristedes growled the priest fitz these kids he bounced the lead pipe against his own shoulder a couple of times and this really isnt a negotiation yes i said clenching my fist you go butters aristedes eyed butters for a moment more then he sagged and let out a soft groan of pain oh crap you win the sorcerer said just please help me straighten it out butters said never quite looking at the man lie back and leave it straight aristedes fumbled with his leg and let out another higherpitched moan of pain butters flinched at the sound and his eyes were tortured in a sudden flash of insight i realized why he cut up corpses for a living instead of treating live patients butters couldnt handle seeing people in pain that was what hed always meant when he said that he wasnt a real doctor when he said that treating living patients was messy and disturbing compared to extracting individual organs and cataloging them in autopsies dead people were just a pile of meat and bones they were beyond all suffering a physician needs a certain level of professional detachment if he is going to best serve his patients and butters just didnt have it the little guy couldnt bring himself not to feel something for the people he worked with so he had sought a career where he practiced medicine without trying to heal anyonewithout involving himself with actual patients aristedes had seen it too he probably didnt understand it but he saw the soft spot and he went for it ruthlessly dont i breathed butters dont dammit butters said finally gritting his teeth he bent to help the man hold still youre just making it worse here he tried to keep a wary distance as he lent the man a hand but it just wasnt possible to help him and stay out of reach i saw it on his face as he realized it and began to withdraw then as the man continued his low moans of pain butters gave his head a little shake and moved to help aristedes straighten his leg i saw the sorcerers eyes narrow to slits an almost sensual pleasure contained in them dammit i said butters move i vanished and appeared beside butters shoving my hands into his chest willing myself to push him away i didnt move himmy hands just passed into him insubstantialbut a sudden frisson seemed to run through him and he began to pull away too late aristedes left arm blurred and struck butters squarely on the chin if he hadnt been drawing back the blow would have caught him just under the ear and the sorcerers hand was moving fast enough that it might have broken butterss neck even so the sharp thump of impact snapped butterss head to one side hard enough to rebound when it had reached maximum torsion he did a brief bobblehead impersonation on the way to the floor and landed in a boneless heap i wanted to scream in frustration instead i poked at my brain demanding it to come up with something to my considerable surprise it did i vanished straight up to the ceiling and spun in a quick circle there i spotted fitz moving in a low crawl toward one of the exits from the factory floor keeping a modest pile of junk between himself and aristedes fitz i bellowed i vanished and reappeared right over him fitz youve got to turn around quiet he hissed in a frantic whisper his eyes were white around the edges quiet no i cant leave me alone youve got to do it i said forthills here in the camp hurt bad theres a freaking angel of death standing over him he needs help fitz didnt answer me he kept on crawling off the factory floor and into one of the hallways outside it he was making desperate small sounds as he reached the door and got out of any possible line of sight to aristedes fitz i said fitz you have got to do something youre the only one who can cops he panted ill call the cops they can handle it he got up and started padding down the hall toward what i presumed was the nearest exit from the building butters and daniel dont have that kind of time i answered the cops get tipped off by a runaway well be lucky if a prowl car cruises by half an hour from now all three of them could be dead by then your boss cant allow witnesses youre the wizard fitz said why cant you do it i mean ghosts can possess people and stuff right just zap into aristedes and make him jump off the roof i was quiet for a moment then i said look im new at this ghost thing but it doesnt work like that even the badass ghost of a centuriesold wizard i know of can only possess a subject who is willing so far ive only been able to move into people who were sensitive to spiritsand they could have booted me out anytime they wanted aristedes is neither sensitive nor willing id be like a bug splattering on a windshield if i tried to take him over christ if you want to volunteer i could take you over i suppose i dont think youve got the right wiring for me to use my power and youd still be in danger of course but you wouldnt have to make the decisions fitz shuddered no good its weird as hell i paused and took a breath and besides it would be wrong wrong fitz asked take away someones will you take away everything they are their whole identity doing that to someone is worse than murder if you kill them they dont keep on suffering who cares fitz said this guy is an animal who cares if he gets something bad hes earned it wrong is wrong even when you really really want it not to be i said quietly i learned that one the hard way its easy to do the right thing when it doesnt cost you not as easy to do the right thing when your back is to the wall fitz shook his head the whole time i spoke that last and his pace quickened theres nothing i can do im running for my life i fought down a snarl to keep my voice level time to change tactics kid you arent thinking it through i said you know aristedes you know him which part of running for my life didnt come across i grunted the part where you leave your friends to die what hes busted up pretty bad right now weak how long do you think it will take him to replace all your crew fitzs steps dragged to a stop theyve seen him weak now hell hes hurt bad enough that he might be crippled for life what do you think hell do with the kids who saw him beaten who saw him get bloodied and smashed to the floor fitz bowed his head stars and stones kid you started showing signs of independent thought and he was so threatened by it that he set you up to get killed what do you think hell do to zero fitz didnt answer you run now i said quietly and youre going to spend your whole life running this is a crossroads this is where your life takes form here now this moment his face twisted up as if he was in physical pain still he didnt respond i wanted to put my hand on his shoulder to give him the reassurance of a human touch the best i could do was to soften my voice as much as i could i know what im talking about kid every time youre alone in the dark every time you go by a mirror youre going to remember this moment youre going to see who youve become and youll either be the man who ran away while his own crew and three good men died or youll be the man who stood tall and did something about it fitz swallowed and whispered hes too strong not right now he isnt i said hes on the ground he cant walk hes got one arm if i didnt think you had a chance id be telling you to run i cant he whispered i cant this isnt fair life hardly ever is i said i dont want to die heh no one does but everyone does it anyway that supposed to be funny maybe a little ironic given the source look kid all that matters is the answer to the question which of those men do you want to be slowly he lifted his head i realized that he could see his own reflection in the glass of an office door i stood behind him looking down at him and remembering with a faint sense of irrational disbelief that i had once been no taller than the boy which man fitz i asked quietly chapter thirtynine when i faced my old master i did it with newly made staff and blasting rod in hand with the ancient forces of the universe at my call and with words of power upon my tongue fitz had more courage than i had as a child he went to face his demons with no weapon at all as his footsteps rapped steadily on the concrete floor i worried about the kid he was doing this on my sayso what if aristedes wasnt hurt as badly as i thought what if he knew some kind of restorative magic fitz wouldnt have a chanceand i would never forgive myself i gritted my teeth and told myself not to borrow trouble things were bad enough without adding in a bunch of my own worries that wouldnt help anybody fitz stepped into sight of aristedes and stopped in his tracks easy i said quietly calm dont show him any weakness you can do it fitz took a deep breath and walked forward fitz aristedes spat he was sitting up now his leg straight out in front of him butterss unconscious body had been dumped next to daniel who sat on the ground in a small puddle of his own blood grimacing in pain and obviously disoriented hed bound the wounds closed more or less but it was clear that he still needed real medical attention zero and the other kids several obviously detailed to watch daniel and butters were standing around with pipes and old knives what do you think youre doing here traitor fitz faced him in silence you led those men to us youve endangered the lives of everyone here fitz almost seemed to dwindle as if a cloud had passed between him and the wan light spilling in the windows dark hostile eyes glared at fitz from all around a quick check with my senses confirmed that the sorcerer was using power hes pushing them i said quietly making them feel hostility toward you it isnt real youve got to shake him break his focus fitz gave a barely perceptible nod of his head i didnt lead them here they caught me while i was trying to recover the weapons they forced me to come with them thats not what the priest said aristedes shot back the father thought he was helping me fitz replied there was no reason to hurt him no reason aristedes asked his voice was dangerous deadly and smooth that he should trespass here is reason enough but he wanted to destroy this family that is something i will not permit family right fitz said were like the simpsons around here personally i would have gone with the waltons but i liked the cut of the kids jib aristedes stared at fitz with reptilian eyes and said give me one reason why i should not kill you here and now because you cant fitz said in a bored tone you arent going anywhere under your own power youre fucked you need help the sorcerers voice dropped to a bare whisper do i yep fitz said wasnt like it wasnt going to happen eventually anyway right sooner or later you were gonna wind up eating applesauce with a rubber spoon somewhere you think a bunch of kids you terrified into following you are gonna take care of grandpa aristedes come on ill give you one chance aristedes said leave now fitz tapped a finger on his chin thoughtfully then he said nah dont think so aristedes blinked what heres how its going to work fitz said im going to take the priest those two guys and the crew away from you im going to get them some help im going to call an ambulance and get you some help too after that we never cross paths again are you insane i was fitz said nodding i think im coming out of it now i know you arent coming back from loopyland though so im taking the crew away from you aristedes clenched his fists and his eyes blazedand though he probably didnt realize it his concentration faltered the influence magic he held over the children wavered kill him the flateyed children looked at fitz zero started taking a step toward him fitzs voice was a whip crack sharp and loud in the echoing chamber stop and they did no magic was involved fitz had something more powerful than that hed cared for those other kids hed thought about them encouraged them and led them that was something every bit as real as mystic power and dark enchantmentand it carries a hell of a lot more weight love always does zero fitz said quietly were done staying with this idiot put down the knife and come with me zero aristedes said sharply i could all but see the strain in the air as the sorcerer doubled down on his influenceworking struggling to force the boy to do his will he shouldnt have bothered it was over it had been over ever since fitz chose to walk back into that room fitz walked over to zero and put a hand on the other boys shoulder z he said quietly i cant make you do anything so you tell me who do you want looking out for you me or him zero looked searchingly at fitz then at aristedes dont listen to him aristedes said through clenched teeth spraying spittle without me you wont last a day on these streets the fomor will take you all no z fitz said quietly they wont its okay weve got help zero blinked his eyes several times he bowed his head the old knife in his fingers clattered to the concrete floor another dozen knives and pipes fell to the floor as the other boys released them they all went over to fitz and gathered around him ill kill you hissed aristedes ill kill you fitz faced the crippled sorcerer and shook his head then he did what was possibly the cruelest thing he could have done to his former mentor he turned away and ignored him zero fitz said we need an ambulance for the father now call nineoneone dont move himlet the ambulance guys do that zero nodded and pulled one of those cheap prepaid cell phones out of the pocket of his oversized jacket he ran for the door presumably to get a better signal within the next few minutes rough but serviceable medical supplies had been brought out and daniels wounds had been cleaned and bound tighter than hed been able to manage on his own aristedes tried to get a couple of the kids to pay attention to him but they were following fitzs lead they ignored him so the sorcerer just sat and watched it all in stunned silence maybe i should have felt a little bit bad for the guy as far as his world was concerned he had just died only he was still alive to see the unthinkablea world that existed without him he was a living breathing ghost maybe i should have felt some empathy there but i really didnt butters stirred and sat up groggily as fitz finished up tying a second pressure bandage to daniels leg michaels son let out a short grunt of pain and then breathed deeply several times he was still shaking and pale but his eyes were steady he met fitzs gaze and said thank you fitz shook his head i didnt do anything you two were the ones who beat him the father was the one who beat him daniel corrected him he knew what would happen to him when he came here and he knew wed come after him butters grunted and spoke without opening his eyes forthill wouldnt have played it like that he came here to give peace a chance he groaned and pressed a hand to his jaw nnngh ow daniel frowned thinking it over so he didnt want us to come after him butters snorted he knew we would come after him no matter what he did and he also knew that if the sorcerer went off on him there would be someone to come along and do it the other way hes a man of peace doesnt mean hes stupid where is he daniel asked by the fire fitz said that way about thirty yards the ambulance is on the way butters groaned and slowly pushed himself up he rubbed at his jaw again and said take me to him wait daniel said fitz you ran i dont blame you but you came back fitz paused pursed his lips and said yeah i did didnt i why fitz shrugged dresden he told me that if i ran now id run forever and im sick of that heh butters said heh heh he totally kenobied the day dark eyes gleaming he looked at daniel still have doubts daniel shook his head once smiling then he sank down to the floor with a satisfied groan the father please butters said fitz nodded and led butters over toward the gangs little camp but not before butters looked around and said thanks harry good to know youve still got our backs i watched them go to help forthill quietly sure man i said though i knew no one could hear me anytime emergencyservice personnel arrived by the time they got there weapons had been hidden stories had been set concerned adults had come to discourage some local homeless youth from playing and living in a dangerous old ruined building there had been an altercation with a possibly drunken vagrant that had gotten out of hand things had fallen down injuring several it wouldnt have taken more than half a brain to see the holes in the story but butters knew the med techs no one had been killed and no one wanted to press any charges the techs were willing to keep their mouths shut for a couple of greenbacks ah chicago forthill was in bad shape but by the time theyd gotten him onto a stretcher and out to the ambulance the angel of death was nowhere to be seen hah up yours reaper girl the father would live to notfight another day daniel went with the father aristedes rode in his own ambulance he was still stunned by what had happened or else smart enough to look disoriented and keep his mouth shut the techs after a few quiet words from butters strapped his arms and legs down for the ride he never resisted he never did anything the doors of the ambulance shut on a broken man as for me i couldnt emerge from the old factory into the light i had to stay in shadowed doorways to watch the proceedings the afternoon must have been a warm one the snow had visibly begun to lessen and water ran and dripped everywhere when everyone with immediate medical needs had been taken care of i went back to where i knew butters would be sure enough he came into the business entryway to recover his duffel bag and the flashlight containing bobs skull butters slung the bags strap over his shoulder and pulled the little spirit radio out of it he dropped that in his pocket and took out the flashlight housing then he held it up and said okay jobs done orange campfire lights shot in a stream over my right shoulder and past me into the eye sockets of the skull where they took up their familiar glow see i told you so duly noted butters said seriously i blinked at him and looked behind me then back at the skull bob you were behind me that whole time yeah bob said the nerd had me shadow you sorry harry butters could see me and i folded my arms and scowled at him you didnt trust me butters pushed his glasses up on his nose trust but verify he said seriously dont take this the wrong way harry but the testimony of a cat and a maybeinsane girlwizard or notdidnt exactly thrill all of us with its undeniable veracity murphy told you to do it i said actually murphy didnt want any of us to take any chances dealing with you he replied things have used your appearance to get to her before i wanted to say something heated and ferocious but all i could have rationally responded with was something like youre right and that wouldnt have sounded very rational so i just grunted butters nodded and youve got to understand how bad the streets have been the fomor have no limits harry theyll use women children petsanythingto get an emotional lever on you if they can to fight that youve got to have buckets and buckets of sangfroid i grunted and scowled some more but you bucked her orders butters scratched his nose with one finger well you know it sounds cooler if i say i acted on my own initiative i had a hunch listen to quincy here the skull burbled giggling you had me you dope i had you butters admitted and i trust you and murphy doesnt much bob said with cheery pride which is probably smart someone else gets hold of my skull and who knows what theyd do with me i am a loose cannon the wardens would waste me in a hot second present company excluded i said you dont count the skull said stoutly you were drafted granted the point being that i am an outlaw and chicks love that oy butters said rolling his eyes enough bob you got it hombre bob said i couldnt help laughing a little you see what ive got to live with butters said yeah i said you uh he said he rubbed at the back of his head youre missed here harry a lot after a while most of us you know we figured you were gone we kind of had a wake at your grave pizza and beer called it a funeral but murphy wouldnt go illegal gathering i said butters snorted out a breath through his nose that was her excuse yeah well i said well see butters paused body motionless for a moment well see what whether or not this is permanent i said gesturing at myself butters snapped up straight what bob thinks that there is hinkiness afoot with regard to my ah disposition you you could come back butters whispered or maybe i havent left i said i dont know man i got suckered into this whole encoreappearance thing im as in the dark as everyone else wow butters breathed i waved a hand look that will fall out where it may i said weve got a real problem to deal with like right now he nodded one sharp gesture tell me i told him about the corpsetaker and her plan for mort and her deal with the point guy of the fomors servitors so weve got to break that up right the hell now i concluded i want you to get murphy and her vikings and tell them to go stomp the corpsetakers hideout butters sucked in a breath through his teeth ugh i know there hasnt been time for a lot of chitchat since you uh became departed but they arent murphys vikings whose are they marcones oh well have to talk to childs marcones new guy yeah him butters shivered guy gives me the creeps could be will and company would be enough butters shook his head could be will and company have done too much already man seriously somethings got to happen if you wait you get a renegade wizard the white council has nightmares about knocking on your front door and by knocking i mean converting it from matter to energy butters nodded ill talk to her well figure out something he squinted at me what are you going to be doing covering the ghosty side of things i said she and her wannabe bob and her lemurs and all the wraiths shes been calling up assuming things go well on the mortal coil i dont want her slipping out the back door and coming back to haunt us another day he frowned youre going to do all that by yourself i showed him my teeth not exactly move theres not much time when he asked when else i answered sundown chapter forty i vanished from inside the factory the second i felt sundown shudder through reality the jumps were longer now almost double what id managed the night before and it took less time to orient myself between them i guess practice makes perfect even if youre dead or whatever i was it took me less than two minutes to get to the burnt remains of mortys place on the way i could see that southern winds were blowing and they must have brought a springtime warmth with them all of the citys snow was melting and the combination of the two with the oncoming night meant that a misty fog hung in the air cutting visibility down to maybe fifty or sixty feet fog in chicago isnt terribly unusual but never that thick streetlights were ringed with blurred luminous halos traffic signals were soft blurs of changing color cars moved slowly cautiously and the thick mist laid a rare hush over the city strangling its usual voice i stopped about a hundred yards away from mortys house there i felt it a trace of the summoning energy that had been built into his former home drawing me forward with the same gentle beckoning as might the scent of a hot meal after a long day it was like the corpsetakers summons but of a magic far less coarse far more gentle the necromancers magic was like the suction of a vacuum cleaner morts magic had been more like the gravity of the earthless overtly powerful but utterly pervasive hell morts magic had probably had some kind of effect on me all the way over in chicago between his house was the first place id come to after all and though i had a logical reason to go there it was entirely possible that my reasoning had been influenced it was magic after all intended to attract the attention of dangerous spirits at that very moment in her moldy old lair the corpsetaker was torturing morty and planning to murder my friendsso the remnants of the spell were definitely getting my attention i went closer to mortys house and felt that same pull get a little stronger the spell had been broken when morts house had burned down and it was fading the mornings sunrise had almost wiped it away it wouldnt survive another dawnbut with a little help it might serve its purpose one more time from the voluminous pocket of my duster i withdrew sir stuarts pistol i fiddled with the gun until the gleaming silver sphere of the bullet rolled out into my hand along with a sparkling cloud of flickering light as each mote touched my skin i heard the faint echo of a shot cracking outthe gunfire of sir stuarts memory hundreds of shots crackled in my ears distant and faint the ghostly memory equivalent of gunpowder sir stuart had heard a lot of it but what i needed wasnt firepower not for this i took up the shining silver sphere the memory of sir stuarts home and family and regarded it with my full attention once again the scene of the small family farm seemed to swell in my vision until it surrounded me in a faint translucent landscape that quivered and throbbed with power all its own for a second i could hear the wind rustling through the fields of grain and smell the sharp honest scents of animals drifting to me from the barn mixing with the aroma of freshbaked bread coming from the house the shouts and cries of children playing some sort of game hung in the air they werent my memories but i felt something beneath their surface something powerful and achingly familiar i reached into my own thoughts and produced the memories of my own home casting them up to merge with sir stuarts cherished vision i remembered the smell of wood and ink and paper of all the shelves of secondhand books that had lined the walls of my old apartment with their ramshackle double and triplestacked layers of paperbacks i remembered the scent of woodsmoke from my fireplace blending with the aroma of fresh coffee in a cup i threw in the taste of campbells chicken soup in a steaming mug on a cold day when my clothes had been soaked with rain and snow and i had gotten out of them and huddled beneath a blanket near the fire sipping soup and feeling the warmth sink into me i remembered the solid warmth of my dog mouse his heavy head pillowed on my leg while i read a book and the softness of misters fur as he came by and gently batted my book away with his paw until i paused to give him his due share of attention i remembered my apprentice molly diligently studying and reading remembered us having hours and hours of conversation as i taught her the basics of magic of how to use it responsibly and wiselyor at least as responsibly and wisely as i knew how they werent necessarily the same thing i remembered the feeling of pulling warm covers up over me as i went to bed of listening to thunderstorms complete with flickering lightning pounding rain and howling wind and of the simple secure pleasure of knowing that i was safe and warm while the elements raged outside i remembered walking with confidence in pitch darkness because i knew every step that would take me safely through my rooms home i invoked the memory of home i dont know at what point the bullet dissolved into raw potential but its power blended with my memories humming a powerful harmonic chord with the emotions behind those memoriesemotions common to all of us a need for a place that is our own security safety comfort home home i breathed aloud i found the tatters of morts gathering spell and in my thoughts began to knit the edges of the memories together with the frayed magic home i breathed again gathering my will fusing it with memory and sending it out into the nighttime air come home i said and my voice carried into the night reverberating through the mist borne by the energy of my spell into a nightshivering encompassing music as i released that power and memory into the night come home come home it all flowed out of me in a steady deliberate rush leaving me with unhurried purpose i felt the magic rush out in a steadily growing circle and then it was gone except for the faintest whisper of an echo come home come home come home i opened my eyes slowly there had been no sound no stirring of energies no warning of any kind i stood in a circle of silent staring holloweyed spirits now that i knew what they werethe insane dangerous ghosts of chicago the ones that killed peoplethey looked different those two little kids my goodness spooky now a little too much darkness in their sunken eyes expressions that wouldnt change if they were watching a car go by or pushing a toddlers head under the surface of the water a businessman apparently from the latenineteenth century i recognized as the shade of herman webster mudgett an american trailblazer in the field of entrepreneurial serial murder i spotted another shade from a century earlier who could only have been captain william wells a cold and palpable fury radiating from him still there were moremany more chicago has an intense history of violence tragedy and sheer weirdness that really cant be topped this side of the atlantic i couldnt put names to a third of them but i knew now looking at them exactly what they werelives that had ended in misery in fury in pain or in madness they were pure energy of destruction given human form smoldering like coals that could still sear flesh long after they ceased to give off light they were a loaded gun standing behind them patient and calm like sheepdogs around their flock were the guardian spirits of morts house i had assumed them to be his spiritual soldiers but i could see now what their main purpose had been they the ghosts of duty and obligation unfulfilled had remained behind in an attempt to see their tasks to completion they the shades of faith of love of duty had been a balancing energy with the dark power of the violent spirits they had grounded the savagery and madness with their sheer steady simple existenceand the faded shade of sir stuart stood tall and calm among them i held sir stuarts weapon in my right hand and half wished i could go back in time and rap my twentyfourhoursyounger self on the head with it the fading spirit hadnt been trying to hand me a weapon at all hed been giving me something far more dangerous than that i thought hed handed me potent but limited power a single deadly shot id been thinking in mortal terms from a mortal perspective stuart hadnt given me a gun hed given me a symbol hed given me authority i held the gun in my right hand and closed my eyes for a moment focusing on it concentrating on not merely holding it but taking it into me making it my own i opened my eyes looked at the tall brawny shade and said thank you sir stuart as i spoke the gun shifted and changed elongating abruptly the wood of its grip and stock swelled out becoming knifeplaned oak and as it did i reached into my memory runes and sigils carved themselves in a tight spiral down the length of the staff i took a deep breath and once more felt the solid power of my wizards staff six feet of oak as big around as my own circled thumb and finger the foremost symbol of my power gripped steadily in my hand i bowed my head focusing intently drawing on the memories of the hundreds of spells and dozens of conflicts of my life and as i did the symbols on the staff pulsed with opalescent energy that reminded me of sir stuarts bullets in flight power hummed through the spectral wood so that it shook in my hand and flickered sharply sending pulses of weirdly colored light light i sensed would be visible even to mortal eyes surging through the mist there was a rushing sound something almost like a sudden strike upon an unimaginably large and deep drum an impact that rippled out from me and passed throughout the city and the surrounding lands it sent a shiver of energy through me and for an instant i felt the warmth of the southern wind the close muggy dampness of the air the wet slushy cold of the snow beneath my insubstantial feet i smelled the stench of mortys burned home on the air and for a single instant for the first time since the tunnel i felt the rumble of hunger in my belly then dozens of spectral gazes simultaneously shifted focusing exclusively on me and their weight hit me like a sudden cold wind good evening everyone i said quietly turning to address the circle of raw fury and devotion that surrounded me our friend mortimer is in trouble and we dont have much time chapter fortyone the corpsetakers stronghold hadnt changed but it had awakened i felt the difference as soon as i approached and a quick effort to invoke the memory of my sight brought the changes into sharp clear view a column of lurid light all shades of purple and scarlet rose into the night sky over the entrance to the stronghold i could see the magical energy involved my gaze piercing the ground as if it had been slightly cloudy water there beneath the ground where i had seen them on the stairs and in the tunnels were formulas of deadly power full of terrible energy now awakened and burning bright all of that shoddy nonsensical quasimagical script hadnt been anything of the sort or rather it had been only apparent nonsense the true formulas strongly burning wards built on almost the same theory and system i had once used to protect my own home had been concealed within the overt insanity right in front of me and i missed it i breathed i should have known better the corpsetaker had once been part of the white council sometime back before the french and indian war wed gone to the same school even if wed graduated in very different years not only that but she was getting assistance from a being that had been created from part of my own personal arcane assistant evil bob had probably given her similar advice on constructing wards wards werent like a lot of other magic they were based on a threshold the envelope of energy around a home granted the loonies currently inhabiting the tunnels were haironfire bonkers but they were still human and they still had the same need for a home that everyone else did thresholds dont care about sunrise not when a living breathing mortal fuels them every moment just by living within them build a spell onto a threshold and it doesnt easily diminish as a result you can slowly over time pump more and more and more energy into spells based upon it the corpsetaker hadnt needed access to a wizardlevel talented body to create the wards shed just used tiny talents regularly over months and months and built up the wards to majorleague defenses a little at a time preparing for the night when she would need them obviously shed decided that since she was torturing a worldclass ectomancer in order to make her big comeback from beyond the grave tonight was a great night not to be interrupted i hate fighting competent people i growled i just hate it formidable defenses said a quiet voice behind me i looked over my right shoulder sir stuart studied the wards as well hed become a tiny bit more solidlooking and there was distant distracted interest in his eyes yeah i said got any ideas mortal magic he replied beyond our reach i know that i replied grumpily but weve got to get in i looked around at the crew of lunatic ghosts id mentally dubbed the lecter specters what about those guys breaking the rules is kind of what they do are they crazy enough to get in threshold inviolable which again made sense id gotten into the fortress the night before because the door had been open and the ghostsummoning spell had essentially been a big old welcome mat a standing invitation clearly tonight was different well i muttered nothing worth doing is easy is it there was no response i turned to find that sir stuarts shade had faded out again and his eyes were lost in the middle distance stu hey stu he didnt respond except to face forward again his expression patient ready to follow orders dammit i sighed okay harry youre the bigtime wizard figure it out by yourself i vanished and reappeared at the doorway then i leaned on my staff and studied the active wards that did me limited good i knew them id used constructions much like them on my own home youd need to throw several tons of bodies at them literally to bring them downwhich was what had happened to my firstgeneration wards wave after wave of zombies had eventually gotten through i mean go figure you prepare your home for an assault and you dont take zombies into consideration id fallen victim to one of the other classic blunders along with not getting involved in a land war in asia and never going in against a sicilian when death was on the line my second generation of wards had planned for zombies so had these so even if i had zombies which i didnt i wasnt going to be able to go through them so i said dont go through them go around them yeah smart guy how theres an open way between the heart of the fortress and the nevernever i said thats like a permanently open door with an allday invitation or they wouldnt need fortifications on the other side all you have to do is get to it assault evil bobs defenses and evil bob and whatever the corpsetaker recruited from god only knows what kind of dark hellhole smash them up and blast through from the spirit world well that plan did have a lot of words like assault and smash and blast in it which i had to admit was way more my style one problem though i couldnt open a way to the nevernever once i was through i could probably find evil bobs fortressit would perforce have to be nearby but like the mortalworld lair i couldnt open the door other than that though its genius i assured myself a direct assault against a fortress that had undoubtedly been designed to defeat direct assaults brilliant uncomplicated doordie suicidal and theres the minor issue that you arent capable of actually implementing it but geniusabsolutely gandalf never had this kind of problem he had exactly this problem actually standing in front of the hidden dwarf door to moria remember when i sighed sometimes my inner monologue annoys even me edro edro i muttered open i rubbed at the bridge of my nose and ventured mellon nothing happened the wards stayed i guessed the corpsetaker had never read tolkien tasteless bitch i hate this dependingonothers crap i muttered then i vanished and reappeared at the head of my horde okay everybody i said huddle up i got a lot of blank looks which was probably only reasonable most of those spirits predated football okay i said everyone get to where you can see and hear me clearly gather in the ghosts understood that they huddledin three dimensions some crowded around me in a circle on the ground the rest took to the air and arranged themselves overhead christ i muttered its like thunderdome i held out my hand palm up and closed my eyes for a moment i called up my most recent memories of molly both of her physical appearance and of her evident state of mind then i focused on projecting those memories following my newly developing instincts with the whole ghost routine when i opened my eyes a small threedimensional image of molly hovered above the surface of my palm rotating slowly this young woman is somewhere in chicago i said maybe nearby we need her help to get to mort so um soldier boys stay here with me the rest of you guys go locate her appear to her tell her that harry dresden sent you and lead her back here do not reveal yourselves to anyone else harm no one i looked around at them okay before id finished the last word half of the crowdthe crazy halfwas gone i just hoped that they would listen to me that my beckoning spell and the mantle of authority sir stuart had passed to me would help ensure their cooperation i felt fairly confident in my instinct that nutty killer ghosts were not terribly good at following orders this could turn out bad in so many ways i muttered but it mostly didnt maybe ten minutes after id dispatched them the lecter specters reappeared among the ranks of the quiet guardians with no sound no flash no fanfare one second nothing the next there they all were all but two a moment later the twins came walking toward us molly limped along between the two little spirits holding hands with each of them she was moving with her back perfectly rigid her steps cautious and she looked a little green around the gills like i said shes a sensitive she must have figured out the true nature of the child ghosts immediately upon meeting them and she clearly did not relish the idea of being in skin contact with them it said a lot about her intestinal fortitude that she had accompanied them at all it probably said even more about her trust in me it was no coincidence that the ghosts had found her so quickly either shed already been on the way molly was dressed for battle there were still bloodstains on the front of her long coat where shed taken a bullet through the muscle of her thigh it was based on the design of a firemans coat and like daniels vest mollys coat contained an armored lining of titanium rings sandwiched between layers of ballistic fabric she still wore her ragged clothing beneath the coat but shed added a nylonweb tactical belt to her ensemble it bore several potions which shed always been good at making and a pair of wands covered in rows of runes and sigils like those on my own staff one was tipped in a crystal of white quartz the other with an amethyst once the twins had led her to me they vanished reappearing in their previous spaces in the ranks molly blinked and looked around for a moment she took her cane from under one arm and leaned on it taking some of the weight off her wounded leg then she took out the little tuning fork rapped it once against the cane and held it up in front of one of her eyes so that she was looking through the tines holy mary mother of god she breathed her eyes widening as she took in the spook squad harry is that you in there two ghosts enter one ghost leaves i replied then i vanished from the spookydome and reappeared in front of her hi molly shook her head a little she looked tired still but some of the strain id seen in her the night before seemed to have drained out of her who are they mortys friends i said i gestured at her you wore your party dress i see she smiled for a second enough to show her dimples then it was gone butters got in touch with me he told me what was going on i nodded murphy molly looked away shes on the way with whoever she can get marcones guys she shook her head marcone is in italy or something childs is in charge let me guess hes just supposed to mind the store until the boss gets back and he didnt get chosen for his daring and ambition molly nodded pretty much i grimaced hows your brother more stitches more scars molly said looking awaybut not in time to hide the flash of pure murderous rage i saw in her eyes hell live the padre stable unconscious he was beaten badly what about fitz and his gang i asked with my father for now she said mom makes battalionsized meals already eight or ten more mouths isnt bad just until theres enough time to figure out what to do with them i snorted quietly and murph would just call in the kids location and tell the cops to round them up for that hit if theyd gone anywhere else she wouldnt do that to michael i thought the same thing your idea molly shrugged very good grasshopper i said smiling she smiled but only with the corners of her eyes thanks i shook my head crap it was easy to get distracted when talking about memories the ghost thing must have been slowly congealing my brain okay chitchats over heres the short version i told her about the big hood hideout the wards and what the corpsetaker was up to as i spoke molly took a moment to open her sight and take a quick glance at the wards she shuddered and closed it again are you sure we cant just hammer through them if we studied the layout for a day or two maybe i said we dont have that kind of time whats the plan then me and my army go in through the back door in the nevernever i said once im in ill wreck those formulae and take down the wards team murphy comes storming in like they do on tv i need you to open the way molly bit her lip and then nodded i can do that are you sure that when i do the other side will be close enough the nevernever isnt subject to normal geography it attaches to the physical world by means of symbols and ideas open a way in a happy place and odds are youll get a happy place in the nevernever open a way in a bad place and the spirit world near it will be the same flavor of bad sometimes ways that opened only ten or twenty feet apart from each other go to radically different portions of the nevernever molly was concerned that if a way was opened anywhere but in the basement of the stronghold it might lead to the spiritual version of timbuktu rather than where i wanted to go theres seriously bad juju infesting this whole area i said well get as close as we can to the entrance it should get me somewhere in the same neighborhoodand impretty light on my feet these days haha molly said and thumped her cane gently on the ground im not what if i cant keep up i pressed my lips together and tried to keep from wincing her mouth tightened you dont want me to go with you it isnt about what i want i said theyll need you on this side if murphy tries to go in before the wards are down people are going to die horribly youre the only one who can tell when the wards fall so you stay molly looked away again she swallowed then she nodded okay i looked at her for a moment she was clearly hurting in all kinds of ways she was just as clearly in control of herself she didnt like the role id asked her to play but she had accepted its necessity youre one hell of a woman molly i said thank you she flinched as if shed just been shot her eyes widened as she jerked her head back to me and her face went entirely bloodless she stared at me for a moment her mouth started working soundlessly her eyes overflowed with tears it took her several seconds to let out a little choking sound then she shuddered and turned away from me she lifted her arm and wiped her eyes on her coat sleeve im sorry she said im sorry its okay i said trying to keep my voice gentle i know i know things havent been easy for you lately bound to bring on the waterworks once in a while god she said both bitterness and amusement in her voice harry how can you be so completely clueless and still be you she took a deep breath then straightened her back and squared her shoulders okay were burning time yeah i said she walked toward the door to the big hoods hideout she planted her feet firmly withdrew the amethysttipped wand from her belt and held it firmly in her right hand i saw her gather her focus and do it rapidly she was very nearly operating on the level of a full member of the white council after less than five seconds she looked up lifted the wand drew it in a long vertical line through the air and murmured rokotsu for a second nothing happened then the air seemed to split and fall open as if reality had been nothing more than a curtain suddenly stirred by an outside breeze the opening widened until it was the size of the front door of a home and odd aqua green light poured out from the other side molly rolled her neck a little as if the effort had pained her it probably had opening a way takes a serious energy investment and molly had never been a highhorsepower practitioner she stepped back and said all yours boss thanks grasshopper i said quietly then i turned to the spook squad and said all right everybody lets go knock some heads together i turned and plunged through the way into the nevernever and the deadliest spiritpredators of the concrete jungle came with me chapter fortytwo before i died i went to a lot of movies movie theaters were totally useless for me especially as more and more of them went with increasingly advanced technology for their sound and projection systems the way i tended to foul up technology especially electronics just by standing around meant that it was tough to see a movie all the way through without something going horribly wrong with the sound the picture or both magic draws a lot of its power from emotion and at the movies that meant that things would tend to go bad at the parts of the movie that were the most gripping and interesting so i could see a movie that sucked at a theater usually but if i wanted to see a good movie there was only one solution a drivein there are still a few of them up and running i went down to the one in aurora there i could be far enough from the projector not to interfere with it the sound system of the movie consisted of hundreds of little car speakers and car radios mostly turned up loud yeah the place was full of kids who were basically at the drivein in order to make out wander around in giggling groups sneak friends in for free in their trunks and drink smuggled alcohol that never bothered me i could park up front sit on the hood of my car with my back leaning against the windshield my hands behind my head and enjoy the whole movie all the way through i usually took bob along he sat on the dashboard i always thought id been doing him a favor although when i thought back it made me think hed been doing it for the sake of shared experience for company anyway the point is ive seen a lot of movies so i know whereof i speak when i say that i went through the way my apprentice opened and landed in the first act of a movie cold water engulfed the lower half of my body and a second later a wave slapped me in the middle of the back nearly throwing me off my feet after the past days of muted physical stimuli i staggered and gasped against the sudden shock of pure sensation salt spray filled my mouth i should have expected that this was the spirit world where the immaterial wasnt gravity heat cold lightthey were all just as real as i was now i was a civilian again there wouldnt be any fun ghost tricks like vanishing out of the cold water i spat regained my balance and got my bearings i was maybe ten yards away from a pebble beach the light was grey and somehow oppressive the beach rose a couple of feet from the water across maybe two or three hundred yards then ran right up onto the feet of a granite cliff there were things littering the beach imagine a jack from the childrens game now imagine it had babies with a porcupine the size of a dump truck that was what lurked there some kind of massive lethargiclooking beasts their bodies mostly dug into the ground each projected several enormous bladelike spines seven or eight feet long in several directions from its hump of a bodyalong with hundreds of other spines about a quarter that size they were scattered in a vaguely ordered pattern all across the beach between us and the cliffs their sides heaving gently as they breathed my eyes tracked on the cliffs to squat ugly blockylooking structures at their summit there were narrow slits carved in their fronts in a couple of spots along the cliff face the stone had collapsed into a very steep gradient a particularly agile monkey might be able to make his way up to the top all of those spots were covered in razor wire and surrounded by fortified positions that would make an ascension a particularly nerveracking form of suicide a cool wind that smelled of rotten meat fluttered across the pebbles and sand and it carried a bloodred banner mounted above the structures out to the side displaying a black swastika within a white circle i stared at it blankly for half a second while another wave hit me in the back and threatened my balance then it struck me where id seen this before the first act of saving private ryan oh crap i breathed this was the nevernever the spirit world and beings of powerful mind and will could reshape the world to their liking evil bob had been the part of bob the skull which had been in the service of this jerk named kemmler who had apparently been killed for good sometime during world war ii evil bob had been working with a theme when he designed defenses to his patrons base of operations there were flashes of light from the firing slits in the bunkers at the top of the cliffs bullets that shone faintly scarlet hammered into the beach at the waters edge and then tracked toward us the hisssplat of impact got to us a second before the chattering thump of the guns get behind me i shouted to the spook squad i heard them splashing through the water in immediate obedience right as long as i was a spirit in the spirit world i might as well take advantage of it since i didnt really have my old duster even though id been wearing it ever since carmichael pulled me up off the tracks i didnt see any reason why i shouldnt have my shield bracelet either i focused on my left wrist without actually looking at it exerted my will and then shook my arm in the old familiar gesture that would make sure the bracelet was clear of the sleeve of my duster when i did i felt its slight familiar weight as it dropped downa chain its links made of several braided metals and festooned with dangling charms in the shape of medieval shields hah i muttered and began to run my will into it to bring up a shield a heavy weight hit me and sent me to one side i hit the cold water and went under glowing red energy masquerading as bullets smashed through the water where id just been standing i came up out of the water sputtering and saw one of the projectiles slam into a protector ghost who had been behind me the round impacted as if upon a living body apart from one detail there was no blood instead it tore away a section of the spirits arm and sent a spray of clear ectoplasm splattering out of him he barely reacted pausing to glance at his arm as if puzzled the next round tore away the largest part of his head and the spirit simply dissolved into more transparent ectoplasmic jelly that was swallowed by the sea sir stuarts shade helped me get back on my feet as a second stream of projectiles strafed through the spook squad sending ghosts diving and scrambling for cover that was not there several more were hit gaining savage bloodless wounds we lost another spirit one of the lecters behind me i shouted again and channeled my will through the shield bracelet spreading it out into a quarter dome of faint blue energy that came to life ahead of me it attracted fire at onceand shed it sending spalling projectiles hissing through the air as they rebounded i started forward toward the beach with sir stuarts shade behind me and slightly to one side the whole way steadying me as the surf kept trying to knock me down the spook squad began to close in on me taking shelter behind the shield and we pressed forward to the beach as fast as i could walk while still holding the shield it turned into hard work within a few seconds even in magic there are some laws you dont get away fromlike the conservation of energy those pseudobullets were hitting my shield with a certain amount of force i had to expend a similar amount of energy to stop them i was cheating by making my shield as rounded as possible deflecting rather than directly opposing but even so it was taking one hell of a lot of my effort and will to keep the fire off us my shield wasnt a solution really i was working too hard to manage a simultaneous counterstrike sometime soon within the hour i wouldnt be able to keep holding it and when it went we were all going to be dead deader i had to figure out a way to silence those guns sir stuart i shouted do any of the gang carry grenades sir stuarts hand and arm came into view from behind me he was holding i kid you not a little black iron bomb about the size of a baseball there was a hole in it that had been plugged with a cork and a fuse stuck out of it the thing was straight out of a cartoon except for its size i looked back over my shoulder and saw that several of the doughboys had produced more modernlooking pineapple grenades of their own a couple of shades dressed in uniforms of the vietnam era had them too neat i said okay heres the plan we head for the base of that bunker right there and your boys blow it up then we get the one next to it then we blow the nests on that slope between the two bunkers and get the hell off this beach sir stuart eyed the ground ahead of me while fire rattled against my shield he studied it intently for a moment then nodded he looked over his shoulder at the rest of the squad his face devoid of expression all of them simultaneously nodded back at him that was not even a little creepy i muttered okay stay behind the shield and i started pushing forward again striding across the pebble beach toward the cliff that was when the shells came in there was a highpitched whistle from overhead and then a flash of motion i had an instants impression of a skull plummeting at a steep angle and blazing with the same angry scarlet energy as the incoming rounds it hammered into the beach about thirty yards ahead of us it didnt make any noise when it exploded instead there was a sudden and absolute silence as if the skull was drawing in absolutely every motion around it including that of sound moving through the airand then there was a flash of light and an instant later a roar of wind and fire my ears screamed with the pain of the shift in air pressure pebbles slammed into my shield sending it to blazing blue brightness as the incoming energy began to overload what the shield could handle the excess energy being shed as light when the dust cleared there was a crater in the ground as deep as my grave and twenty feet across more screaming whistles came from overhead and i felt a surge of raw panic trying to push the thoughts out of my brain hells bells if one of those skulls hit closer to us or behind us where my shield couldnt cover we were dead another nearmiss might blow my shield down entirely and then the machine guns would have us there was only one place to go that might be safe from the screaming skulls weve got to get closer i growled come on and i broke into a flatout sprint toward the machine guns chapter fortythree things were pretty much a desperate blur between the waters edge and the cliffs there was a lot of running and gunfire and spraying dirt and pebbles several more shades were destroyed by screaming skull shrapnel my shield took one hell of a beating and as we got closer to the machine guns the angles of fire from either side meant that the shield could protect fewer and fewer of the shades there was nowhere to run nowhere to hide no direction to go but forward it was either that or die and i was as terrified as i had ever been in my life honestly im glad my memories arent much clearer than they are there was a nasty bit in the middle when i was running between two of the crouching spike beasts i remember realizing that the things were so heavily armored in layers and layers of bony plate that they couldnt stand up the fire from machine guns and screaming skulls alike seemed only a minor discomfort to them i remember a pair of reptilian eyes flicking toward me and then dozens of the shorter spikes shot out upon greasy living tendrils and started whipping around like a highpressure water hose with no one holding it one of them wrapped around my arm and only the spellarmored sleeve of my duster kept the bladed spike from opening my flesh to the bone sir stuarts ax flashed and the tendril separated from the main beast collapsed into ectoplasm i ordered the shades to use their blades and dozens of swords axes combat knives and bayonets appeared we hacked our way through the spike beasts and endured increasingly intense fire we lost several more protector shades as we didthey were hauled into the open by tendrils and torn to pieces by machinegun fire the mortar skulls stopped coming down near us about twenty yards out from the cliffs and we finally reached the base of the first tower the shades and i all crowded in close to its base where the gunners couldnt shoot us without getting out and leaning over the top or something i reversed my shield so that its quarter dome covered us in every direction that the cliff face or the ground didnt though the fire on us had lightened considerably grenades i ordered in a firm and manly tone that did not sound at all like a panicked fourteenyearold sir stuart held a pair of his black minibombs out to a caponeera gangster who produced a lighter and flicked it to life sir stuart rose the lit fuses trailing small sparks took a couple of steps back from the tower and flung the grenades swiftly upward one at a time it was a little ticklish taking the shield down in time to allow the grenades to pass by then bringing it up again the wizardly equivalent of interrupting a sneeze but i pulled it off both of the little bombs made clinking noises as they bounced off the inner lip of the firing slits and there were snarling sounds from above us for a second or two then there was a loud whump of an explosion and inhuman shrieks of what could only be pain a second later there was another whump and clear fluid spattered out of the bunkers firing slit and pattered down onto my shield chaching i crowed sir stuarts shade shot me a fierce grin get ready to move to the next one i called i scrambled down the cliff face to where stone gave way to sand and shale and the steep slope swept up from the beach to whatever was above wed taken out the bunker on one side of the slope wed have to take out the one on the other side or be riddled with fire from several directions as we made the ascent i brought my shield around and angled it as best i could as i stepped out into the open firing points at the top of the slope opened up instantly intently and my shield blazed into sight again as more focused enemy power came down upon it from the positions atop the slope i crossed the thirtyfoot gap to the base of the next tower keeping ferocious will on the shield and the spook squad came with me on the way i got a glimpse of the opposition they wore the blackandgrey uniforms of the old waffenss but they werent human their faces were stretched and distorted into the muzzle and jaws of a wolf which looked damned peculiar without any fur covering it their eyes were black empty holesand im not being metaphorical when i say that there were simply no eyes there just empty sockets machinegun crews and riflemenor maybe riflethingsalike poured fire into us a panting eager hunger to spill blood apparent on their monstrous faces i stopped at the other corner holding the shield until all the spooks had made it across then took cover myself redirecting the shield as i had the last time to cover us all handsome fellows sir stuarts shade noted cheerily he looked less faded than he had only moments before i had a feeling that sir stuart in life had been the sort of person who was invigorated by actionand that his shade was no different well send them a nice written compliment later i called back and gestured up above us at the second bunker do it again stuart nodded and turned to the gangster once more and again he made two excellent throws pitching a pair of little bombs up the steep angle and into the bunker again enemy ectoplasm sprayed and again the tower above us went silent now the fun part i said were going up the slope my shield wont last very longwhoever is behind this is going to put everything he has into taking it down so we close to grips with them as fast as we can sir stuart nodded and gestured to the nearest of the mad ghosts give them the order i pursed my lips for a second and then nodded hey you guys i said pointing at the twins two little sets of dead empty eyes turned toward me along with dozens more and i felt that same cold chill at the touch of their awareness were about to go up that slope the very instant my shield drops i want you to close with the enemy as fast as you can and take them down dont hold back give it to them hard dont stop until theyre all down clear more soulempty stares none of them moved none of them responded sure i said you got it if you didnt youd say something right no response god its like gallagher performing at the harvard faculty club i muttered here we go folks one two three and i went around the corner again shield held in front of me it coalesced into a blazing blueandsilver dome almost instantly taking so much energy that the kinetic force began to transfer through pushing against me like a galeforce wind i staggered drunkenly unable to see through the shield and anticipate my next steps up the steep slope the footing was treacherous shale and sand and loose stone twisted and turned beneath me even with the occasional supporting shove from sir stuart my forward momentum began to falter and i slipped to one knee my bracelet getting hotter and hotter around my wrist i managed to lunge awkwardly forward a couple of timesand then something hit my shield like a runaway train and silverandblue energy shattered into a coruscation of sound and light i was abruptly able to see up the slope where the enemy was momentarily reeling from the explosive feedback of the failed shield and the lecter specters went to work as i stared up the slope the only thing i could think was that this must be what it looked like in the interior of a tornado the mad ghosts of chicago rushed forward with such speed and power that their forms blurred into elongated streaks that jostled to be the first to reach their victims corkscrewing up the cutting they ignored ridiculous constraints such as gravity and the solidity of matter and as they rushed upon the enemy they changedand i gained fresh nightmare material im willing to share the least disturbing bits the twins for example just leaned forward and seemed to slither sinuously through the air toward the foe as they went their bodies elongated intertwined and twisted into a single entity that looked like a demented artists rendition of a battle between a giant squid and some kind of unnamed deepsea horror fish with too many spines and too many fins and great googlymoogly eyes they reached the nearest bad guy bobbed up and then slammed down with so much grace that i almost missed the fact that theyd smashed the wolfwaffen so hard into the ground that he was no thicker than my old checkbook tentacles shot out and ripped a rifle from the wolfwaffen next to the first then plunged forward into its mouth and throat in through its nostrils in through its ears a second later they came whipping out againalong with slimecovered chunks of whatever theyd happened to be able to grab while they were in there they pulled the creatures stomach out through its mouth along with several feet of intestineand then the tentacles whipped said loops of flesh around the wolfwaffens neck and strangled it it got considerably less cheerful and humane from there snarls then screams filled the steep little opening in the cliff wall ghosts twisted into monstrous forms by decades of hollow mindless hunger fell upon the wolfwaffen in our way uttering howls and squeals and clicks and screams filling the air with a nightmare cacophony that left me slamming my palms up over my ears and biting down on a scream of pain the enemy fought at first and those who did died swiftly as more and more hideous things dealt with the wolfwaffen their morale faltered and they began to run those that did died horribly and toward the end overwhelmed by terror a handful of the enemy could only stand staring in horror and screaming high and piteously those last few died indescribably ghosts dont get hungry i reminded myself dead men dont eat so there was no reason whatsoever that i should throw up the thought was hilarious for some reason so i started laughing i couldnt help it i laughed and laughed even as i realized that i couldnt just sit therenot having turned loose an elemental force of horror like the lecters come on i said giggling come on before they get out of earshot i staggered up and climbed the slope sir stuart and the protector spirits following along behind me it wasnt an easy climb the lecter specters had left a lot of the wolfwaffen partly alive or at least had left some of their parts alive and blood and worse fluids were everywhere the fortunate few the fighters who had gone down fast had become nothing but buckets of slimy ectoplasm any way you looked at it the climb was a messy nauseating dangerous one but it was a whole heck of a lot less dangerous than if wed been getting shot at the whole way i reached the top of the slope and looked across the long network of trenches that ran outside the bunkers along the top of the cliff there was intermittent gunfire there were intermittent screams as i watched i saw a frantic panicked wolfwaffen clamber out of the trench it got about threequarters of the way out before what looked like a slimy yellow tongue shot out of the trench from below my line of sight and plunged into its backand out its chest the impaling tongue then wrapped around the howling wolfwaffen and pulled it back into the trench with so much force that a puff of dust and dirt billowed out from wherever he impacted hells bells i giggled hells bells thats hideous sir stuart nodded grimly he made a gesture protector spirits began putting the nearby hideously mangled wolfwaffen out of their misery i swatted myself firmly on the cheek and forced the laughter back i felt myself trying to scream in horror once the laughter was damped down the demonic servitors evil bob had put in position had probably been some very nasty customers they had probably deserved a violent death but there are things you just dont do things you just cant see and still be both human and sane i forced the incipient screams away too it took me a minute or two to get it done when i looked up sir stuart was facing me his eyes sad concerned and empathetic he knew what i was feeling hed known it himselfwhich probably stood to reason as the commander more or less of the criminal psych ward of chicagos ghosts my fault i said my voice sounded dull my tongue felt like it had been coated in lead i told the lecters not to stop until they were all down the big shade nodded gravely follow them i said make sure any of the enemy who is left is given a clean death then round them up and come back to me sir stuart nodded he looked at the protector spirits then they all moved out at the same time going both directions up and down the cliff i leaned on my staff and rested holding that shield had taken a lot out of me so much so that when i looked down at my hand i could just barely see the shape of the stony ground right through it i was fading i shuddered and clutched the staff hard it made sense really ive always believed that magic came from inside you from who and what you werefrom your mind and from your heart now i was all mind and heart the shield had to be fueled by something i hadnt really stopped to consider where that energy would come from now i knew i looked at my hand and the ground on the other side of it again how much more would it take to make me disappear altogether i had no way of knowing no way of even making a good guess what if i needed to use my magic again when i took up the hunt for my killer after all of this was over what if i blew it all here what if i wound up like sir stuartjust an empty shade i leaned my head against the solid oak of the staff it didnt matter murphy and companynot to mention mortneeded my help they would get it even if it meant i became nothing but an old faded memory or maybe became one more insane shade drifting through chicagos night causing havoc without reason without regret and without mercy i shook my head a little and straightened my back from the sounds of it there couldnt be many bad guys left for the lecters to deal with these were certainly the corpsetakers defensesan area of bad mojo like this would have a kind of gravity for anyone crossing over from the material world through any way near the location to which it had been linked sort of like a funnel spiderweb that had been the point of building it this way to make sure anyone who wanted in from the nevernever side wound up on that beach i needed to find the way this site was guarding the back door to the corpsetakers hideout the one id seen evil bob and the fomor servitor use i closed my eyes and shut away the recent horrors i willed away my worry and my fear i didnt have to breathe but i did anyway because that was the only way id ever learned to attain a state of clarity in out slowly then i carefully quested out with my senses looking for the energy that would surround an open way i found it immediately and opened my eyes it was coming from straight ahead of me away from the cliff and the beach several hundred yards back up among some rolling wooded hills i could see the head of a footpath that led into the woods there had been regular traffic on it for it to be so evident and i doubted that many hikers or boy scout troops had been tromping through that was our next step an instant violent instinct screamed at me without warning i didnt question it i flung myself to one side rolling in the air to bring up my shield again a wrecking ball of pure psychic force hit the shield and half of the little shield charms dangling from my bracelet screamed and then shattered into tiny shards the blow flung me a good twenty feet and i hit the ground rolling until said ground vanished from underneath me i dropped to the floor of one of the defensive trenches and lay there for a second stunned at the sheer savagery of the assault i heard slow heavy confident footsteps clomp clomp then a pair of black jackboots appeared at the top of the trench my gaze tracked up the ss officers uniform which included a black leather trench coat not too unlike my own it wasnt one of the wolfwaffen instead of a deformed monstrous wolf face this being had only a bare skull sitting atop the uniforms high collar blue fire glowed in its eye sockets and it regarded me with cold disdain a worthy effort for a novice evil bob said i wish you to know that i regret your death as the loss of significant potential he lifted what was probably not actually a luger pistol and aimed it calmly at my head goodbye dresden chapter fortyfour stall i thought desperately sir stuart and company wouldnt be busy for long stall it isnt in your best selfinterest to do that i said evil bobs eyelights flickered the gun didnt waver that hypothesis assumes that i possess selfinterest if you didnt i said you would have pulled the trigger already for a second nothing happened then the skull tilted slightly to one side and i got the impression that evil bob had become suddenly pensive i rushed to continue theres no percentage for your boss in hesitation and since i know you arent doing it for my sake your hesitation must therefore be an act of selfinterest an intriguing argument said evil bob and potentially valid given the penchant for independence evident in my progenitor by which you mean the original bob obviously evil bob sniffed he from whose essence i came to be your instincts for such matters are acute dresden you have given me something to consider in the future when my attention is not otherwise occupied by mildly effective stalling tactics and he pulled the trigger just as sir stuarts thrown ax whirled into evil bobs outstretched shooting arm it hit him only with the spinning wooden handle but it was enough to save my life a blast of psychic energy of sheer deadly will hit the concrete wall of the trench about five feet to my left and turned it into a cloud of powder i raised my right hand and snarled forzare and responded with a hammerblow of force of my own evil bob lifted the other blackleatherclad hand and brushed my strike aside but it rocked him back a step sir stuart charged into sight hitting evil bob hard at the hips and tackled him forward and down into the trench the pair of them hit hard but the dark spirit was on the bottom and evil bobs skull cracked as it hit the concrete his highcrowned ss hat went flying i let out a short scream of rage and swung my staff at the skull evil bob caught my descending staff in one hand and locked it in place as if his fingers had been a hydraulic vise he got his other hand under sir stuarts chest and simply thrust his arm forward sir stuart went flying out of the trench and i heard him hit the ground again about a second and a half later ah evil bob said cold blue eyelights regarded my staff a simple tool but serviceable in mccoys style the eyes flared brighter and the key to your rather effective little army as well excellent i wrenched at the staff but couldnt get it away from the dark spirit i felt sort of goofy about it in addition to being extremely alarmed about how strong the thing was i wrenched at the staff with all the power of my hips legs back and shoulders with the leverage of my widespaced grip and only barely managed to make evil bob wobble he just stood up holding the end of the staff in his hand and only after examining it again did he apparently notice me i will make this offer exactly once dresden evil bob said quite calmly he put his other hand on the staff mirroring me and i suddenly realized that if he wanted to he could fling me considerably farther than he had sir stuartassuming he didnt just ram the staff straight back into my chest and out of my back i was suddenly unsure whether the spook squad could take evil bob even if they were all right there lecters guardians and all what offer i asked him a relationship he replied with me yeah he actually said it like that um i said narrowing my eyes maybe you could clarify what you mean by a relationship because ive got to tell you bob ive uh ive been hurt the joke missed him completely i was apparently snarking on the wrong frequency in the nature of an apprenticeship he said you have sound fundamental skills you are practical your ambition is tempered by an understanding of your limits you have the potential to be an excellent partner and im not flipping insane like the corpsetaker i said hardly but your insanities are more manageable evil bob said and you have few selfdelusions he sniffed the master never favored that creature in any case but he would have been interested in you even if kemmler was still around im pretty sure a relationship with him wouldnt be in the cards either i said in an apologetic tone ive got a strict rule about dating older men the spirit looked at me blankly for a moment then as the real bob sometimes did he gave me the impression of an expression that simple immobile bone could not possibly have expressed his eyes slowly widened you he said slowly are mocking me i whistled through my teeth guess the real bob made you from the slow bits huh the blue lights flared brighter and i felt heat on my face even from six feet away i am the real one he said in a hard distant tone the true creation of the master finally shed of my weakness my doubt freed to use my power guess he threw in a little of his narcissism too i drawledbut i met his gaze with my own and felt an odd little smile turn up the sides of my mouth the skulls jaws slowly parted like a snake preparing to strike you who are barely more than an apprenticeyou will die for mocking me yeah but i will never ever throw in with you i snarled back i will never be like you or your precious master or that nutball corpsetaker so take your offer of a relationship and shove it up your schutzstaffel evil bobs eyelights blazed and he wrenched at the staff he really was a lackey a real mastermind wannabe would have boned up on the evil overlord list hed felt so confident in his power okay maybe not without reason that hed spent a moment talking to me instead of just moving on worse hed given me a chance to start lipping off to him and that comes so naturally to me that i dont really need to consciously consider it anymore except on special occasions so what with my brain being unoccupied and all id had the opportunity to realize a fundamental truth about the nevernever here the spiritual becomes the material here spiritual power is physical power strength of mind and will are as real as muscle and sinew and i was damned if some blurry photocopy of the thoughts and will of some dustyass dead necromancer was going to take me out if he hadnt made with the stupid recruiting speech if i hadnt had my choices laid out in such stark relief in front of me if i hadnt been reminded of who i was and of those things for which id lived my life maybe evil bob would have killed me then and there but he had reminded me i did remember i spent my lifetime fighting the darkness without becoming the darkness maybe i had faltered at the very end maybe i had finally come up against something that made me cross the linebut even then i hadnt turned into a degenerate freakazoid of the kemmler variety one mistake at the end of my life couldnt erase all the times i had stood unmoved at the edge of the abyss and made snide remarks at its expense they could kill me but they couldnt have me i was my own and when evil bob shoved the staff at my chest i drew upon the surge of fierce joy that truth had inspired upon the will that had been dinged and dented but never broken and fell back with the motion digging the tip of the staff into the concrete as if it had been soft mud and used the momentum to fling evil bob over me his unbreakable grip didnt falterand he arced overhead and then back down while i wrenched at the staff helping his forward momentum instead of fighting it he hit the floor of the trench like a big fascist meteor the noise was incredible the impact shattered the concrete for twenty feet in every direction chips and shards went flying dust flew up in a miniature mushroom cloud i was flung back by the shock wave of impactwith my staff still gripped firmly in my hands booya i drunkenly howled from the ground i choked a little on the dust as i staggered back to my feet my heart pounding my whole body alive with strain and adrenaline i stabbed a pointing finger toward the impact crater thats right who just rocked your face harry fucking dresden thats who i coughed a little more and leaned against the side of the trench panting until the world stopped feeling all spinny grinning a wolfs grin as i did and then gravel made a soft rustling sound from inside the dust cloud a form appeared just an outline limping slowly it came a few feet closer and i recognized evil bob by the rising glow of his eyelights the skull became visible a second later and though i could see that the entire surface was lined with a fine network of cracks and chips it was not broken the blue eyelights began to glow brighter and brighter the dark spirit clenched his fists and his arms slowly rose as if he was pulling something from the very earth beneath his feet the ground started shaking there was an ugly low humming sound like some kind of demon locomotive screaming by in a tunnel beneath my feet my turn the dark spirit hissed hells bells i muttered harry you idiot when will you learn not to victory gloat the spirits skull mouth dropped open wider and wider and a sudden stream of candleflamecolored energy coalesced into bob the skulls human form right behind evil bob my bob lunged forward and snaked his arms beneath the dark spirits bobs fingers locked behind the fractured skull of my enemy gathering the dark spirit into a full nelson he wrenched evil bob violently to one side and the dark spirit screamed a sudden torrent of energy ripping through the wall of the trench and about fifty yards of earth as he pivoted vaporizing spirit matter into an enormous piesliceshaped acre of ectoplasm then evil bob spun letting out a shriek of fury and slammed his attacker back into the opposite wall harry bob shouted his face pale and his eyes wide there were chips of broken concrete in his hair take the spooks and go help butters no i shouted back lets take him evil bob took two bounding steps the second one on the trench wall about five feet up from the ground and whirled falling back to the ground with my bob on the bottom more concrete shattered and bob the skull did something id never heard him do before he screamed in pain you cant he shrieked panicked i cant not with everything here the dark spirit twisted like a snake and broke bobs grip evil bob nearly got out of it entirely but my old lab assistant managed to get a lock on one arm and the pair of them whirled and twisted on the ground almost too quickly to be seen pitting dozens of escapes and counterlocks against each other in only a few seconds go bob shrieked gutwrenching bonedeep terror in his voice go go go once youre gone ill shut the way behind you and bail hurry a shadow appeared at the top of the trench and a weary batteredlooking sir stuart held out his hand to me dammit i snarled dont make me regret this bob go bob howled i took sir stuarts hand and the big man pulled me out of the trench with a grunt of effort up on top i found the spooks waiting for me in their typical silence right i said lets go double time i gripped my staff tight put my head down and sprinted for the way into the corpsetakers stronghold chapter fortyfive the way hung in the air in the middle of the trail maybe fifty yards back into the forest an oblong mirror of silver light its bottom edge was maybe six feet off the ground and a wooden staircase had been built to allow access to it behind us back over toward the beach i could hear low drumbeats of impact the crackling scream of shattering concrete the two bobs were going at it hammer and tongs and i desperately hoped that my old friend was all right there was another worry too if bob couldnt stop evil bob from coming through the way after us wed be caught with the corpsetaker in front of us and evil bob behind i didnt imagine things would go very well for us if that happened a flutter in the energies around the way danced across my senses and i paused to focus more intently on the way itself going so far as to call up my sight for a quick peek a glance told me everything i needed to know the way was unstable rather than being the steady solid steelandconcrete bridge between here and the mortal world that i had seen before it was instead a bridge made of frayed and straining ropes that looked like it might fall apart the instant it was used bob you tricky little bastard i murmured admiringly my former lab assistant had been lying his socks off earlier bob wasnt planning on closing the way behind usbecause he had already rigged it to collapse as soon as we went through his verbal explanation to me had been meant for evil bobs ear holes if evil bob thought we were dependent on bob to shut the door behind us then he would have no reason to hurry after us and if bob had told me the real deal out loud evil bob could have simply rushed to the way ahead of us and collapsed it himself leaving us totally shut out bob was really playing with fire if hed taken time to sabotage the way before he came to back me up it meant that he had left me to face the wolfwaffen and their boss and gambled that id be able to hold my own until he circled back to me on this side of things his ploy to keep evil bobs attention meant that evil bob was free to focus entirely on tearing him apart confident that he could always come charging at our backs as soon as he finished off my bob more concrete shattered somewhere back toward the beach bits of small debris most of it no larger than my fist came raining down among the trees a moment later okay kids gather round and listen up i shook my head and addressed the huddled shades when we go through i said well be right in the middle of them sir stuart i want you and your men to rush any lemurs or wraiths that are near us dont hesitate just hit them and get them out of my way i eyed the lecter specters the rest of you follow me were going to destroy the physical representations for the wards the little girl ghost looked up at me and scowled as if id just told her she had to eat a hated vegetable how can you have any pudding if you dont eat your meat i told her seriously were going to destroy the wards once that is done you guys can join the rest of the shades in taking down the corpsetaker and her crew okay everyone got it silent stares okay good i guess i turned to the way and took a deep breath this worked out reasonably well last time right right so here we go i hesitated then i said hang on one second theres one more thing i want everyone to do i went through the way and felt it falling apart under the pressure of our collective spiritual weight it was an odd sensation falling against the back of my neck like icecold cobwebs i didnt let my fear push me into hurrying i kept my steps steady until i walked onto the floor of the underground chamber where id seen morty and the corpsetaker the night before i had time for a quickflash impression the pit had been filled with wraiths once more swirling around in a humanoid stew mort hung above the pit again in considerably worse repair than the last time id seen him his shirt was gone his torso and arms were covered in welts and bruises he had spots of raw skin that had been burned maybe with electricity if the jumper cables and car battery sitting on the ground nearby were any indication several of them were on his bald scalp someone among the big hood lunatics was familiar with the concept of electroshock therapy that one sure was a stretch the corpsetaker stood in the air above the pit hissing words into mortys ear morts head was moving back and forth in a feeble negative he was weeping his body twitching and jerking in obvious agony his lips were puffy and swollen probably the result of getting hit in the mouth repeatedly i dont think he could focus his eyesbut he kept doggedly shaking his head again the hooded lemurs were gathered around but instead of playing cards this time they all stood in an outwardfacing circle around the pit as if guarding against an attack pity for them that the back door from the nevernever was inside the circle when the spook squad and i came through they all had their backs to us now im not arrogant enough to think that i was the first guy to lead a company of ghosts into an assault granted i dont think it happens every day or anything but its a big world and its been spinning for a long time im sure someone did it long before i was born maybe pitting the ancestral spirits of one tribe against those of another im not the first person to assault an enemy fortress from the nevernever side either it happened several times to either side in the war with the red court its a fairly standard tactical maneuver it requires a certain amount of intestinal fortitude to pull off as evil bob had demonstrated with his normandy defenses but i am dead certainbadumpbumpchingthat im the first guy to lead an army of spirits in an assault from the spiritworld side and had them start off by screaming boo the spooks all stood in the same space i did which felt weird as hellbut i hadnt wanted to take a chance with the rickety way collapsing and leaving some of the squad behind when i shouted they all did tooand i got a whole hell of a lot more than i bargained for the sound that came out of all those spirit throats including mine seemed to feed upon itself wavelengths building and building like seas before a rising storm our voices werent additive bunched so closely like that but multiplicative when we shouted the sound went out in a wave that was almost tangible it hit the backs of the gathered lemurs and bumped them forward half a step it slammed into the walls of the underground chamber and brought dust and mold cascading down and morts eyes snapped open in sudden startled shock get em i howled the dead protectors of chicagos resident ectomancer let out a bloodcurdling chorus of battle cries and blurred toward the foe you hear a lot of stories of honor and chivalry from soldiers most people assume that such tales apply primarily to men who lived centuries ago but let me tell you something people are people no matter which century they live in soldiers tend to be very practical and they dont want to die i think youd find military men in any century you cared to name who would be perfectly okay with the notion of shooting the enemy in the back if it meant they were more likely to go home in one piece sir stuarts guardians were for the most part soldiers spectral guns blazed immaterial knives hatchets and arrows flew ectoplasm splashed in buckets half the lemurs got torn to shreds of flickering newsreel imagery before i was finished shouting the command to attack much less before they could recover from the stunning force of our combined voices the corpsetaker shrieked something in a voice that scraped across my head like the tines of a rusty rake and i twisted aside on instinct one of the lecters took the hit and a gaping hole the size of a bowling ball appeared in the center of his chest with me i shouted i vanished and reappeared at the bottom of the staircase that led down to the chamber a streamer of urine yellow lightning erupted from the corpsetakers outstretched hand but id had my shield bracelet at the ready and i deflected the strike into a small knot of stunned enemy lemurs when it hit them there was a hideous explosive cascade of fire and havoc and they were torn to shreds as if theyd been made of cheesecloth holy crap either one of those spells would have done the same to me if id been a quarter second slower dead or alive kemmlers disciples did not play for funsies the lecter specters appeared in a cloud around me even as i sent a slug of pure force out of the end of my staff forcing the corpsetaker to employ her own magical counter her wrists crossed in front of her body the energy of my strike splashed off an unseen surface a few inches in front of her hands and gobbets of pale green light splattered out from the impact dresden screamed mort he stared at meor more accurately at the lecters all around mewith an expression of something very like terror what have you done what have you done come on i shouted and vanished from the bottom of the stairs to the top just as the corpsetaker appeared halfway up the stairway and sent another torrent of ruinous energy down toward the position the lecters and i had just vacated at the top of the stairs the tunnel was like i remembered itdecorated in miniature shrines with very real sigils of power concealed within splatters of gibberish candles glowed at each positionward flames that accompanied the activation of the mystic defenses the shrines i shouted to the lecters manifest and destroy them i brought my shield up again an instant before corpsetaker sent a slew of dark gelatinous energy up the stairs i caught the spell in time but it instantly began wrenching at my shield as if it had been some kind of living being chewing away at it devouring the energy i was using to hold the shield firm crap i was not going to fare well in a magical duel with someone who had clearly been doing this kind of thing for a long long timenot when i had the lecters to protect the corpsetaker would tear them apart if she could to stop us from bringing the wards down shei always thought of her as a she for some reason even though she could grab any kind of body she wanted male female or otherwisewas far more experienced than i was with what was probably a much broader range of nasty memories upon which to draw on top of that i was already winded so to speak the fight with evil bob had been a job of work if i stood there trading punches she had an excellent chance of wearing me down enough to kill me if all i did was keep shielding the lecters shed be free to throw her hardest punches and i felt certain that anyone from kemmlers crew could hit like a truck time to get creative i dropped the shield and simultaneously thrust my staff at the black jelly stuff snarling forzare pure force tore the dark energy to shreds and continued on down the stairs to strike the corpsetaker my aim was bad the strike only spun her in place and sent her sprawling back into open air i took a quick look back at the lecters and immediately wished i hadnt the flames of the candles in the hall had burned down to pinpoints of cold blue light once again the ghosts had assumed forms from nightmaresand they were going totally ballistic on the big hoods hideout something that looked like a blending of a gorilla and a venus flytrap smashed apart a wooden crate supporting one shrine a giant caterpillar its segmented body made of severed human heads their faces screaming their tongues functioning as legs rippled up a wall and began tearing out chunks of concrete where a ledge had been worn destroying another shrine right it was working i just had to keep the corpsetaker busy until the wild rumpus got finished tearing apart the defenses i called up my sight and vanished to a point twenty feet below the corpsetakers position reappearing inside solid stone my eyes couldnt see a thing but my sight wasnt impaired i could see dark violent energy swirling around where id last seen the corpsetaker nasty stuff i felt my lips stretch into a snarl as i hefted my staff again and growled fuego ghost fire roared up through solid matter in an instant the dark energy had gathered to oppose my spell but i sensed more than heard a cry of surprise and pain the psycho hadnt expected that one then the dark energy vanished i scanned around me wildly and found it reappearing behind and above me i vanished again flicking out another strike at the corpsetakers locationonly to find that the corpsetaker had blinked to a new one the next sixty seconds or so was a nauseating blur of motion and countermotion we exchanged spells in solid stone parried each other hovering in open air above the wraith pit and leapfrogged each others positions throughout the sleeping quarters of the big hoods it was all but impossible to aim since it required us to correctly guess the next position of the opponent and then hit it with a spell but i clipped her once more and she landed a strike of pure kinetic force that slammed into my hip and missed my ghostly genitals by about an inch twice she darted into the hallway to attack the lecters but i stayed on her forcing her to keep moving keep defending allowing her only time enough to throw quick jabs of power back at me i wasnt her match in a straightup fight but this was more like some kind of hallucinatory variant of whacamole maybe i couldnt take her out but i could damned well keep her from stopping the lecters if she turned her attention from me i was wizard enough to take her out and she knew it if she went allout on me i could stand up to her long enough to let the lecters finish their projectand she knew that too i could feel her rage building lending her next nearmiss a hammering edge that jolted my teeth right through my shieldand i laughed at her in reply making no effort whatsoever to hide my scorn i shrugged off another jab letting it roll off my shield and then corpsetaker vanished and reappeared at the far end of the hallway at the door to the old electricaljunction room the very last of the ward flames burned there at one final unspoiled shrine the corpsetaker faced the lecters who were already moving toward her lifted her hand and spoke a single word filled with ringing power stop and the lecters did completely i mean like statuestill screw that i called out and raised my staff drawing upon my own will go there was a sudden strain in the air between the corpsetaker and me and i felt it as a physical pressure against my right hand in which i brandished my staff corpsetakers upraised palm wavered slightly as our wills contended down the length of the hallway i pushed hard grinding my teeth and simply willing the lecters to finish the job i leaned forward a little and shoved out my staff envisioning the lecters tearing down the last of the little shrines my will lashed down the hallway and blew the hood back from the corpsetakers face maybe she was wearing the form of one of her victims maybe i was getting a look at the real corpsetaker either way she wasnt a pretty woman she had a face shaped like a hatchet only less gentle and friendly both cheeks were marked with what looked like ritual scars in the shape of spirals her hair was long and white but grew in irregular blotches on her scalp as if portions of it had been burned and scarred her skin was tanned leather covered in fine seams and wrinkles and there was a lizardlike quality to the way it loosened around her neck but her eyes were gorgeous she had eyes a shade of vibrant jade like i had never seen this side of the sidhe and her eyelashes were long thick and dark as soot as a young woman she must have been a lean stunner dangerously pretty like a james bond villainess our eyes met and i braced myself for the soulgazebut it didnt happen hells bells i had my sight wideopen enough to let me see the flow of energy straining between our outstretched hands and it still didnt happen guess the rules change when youre all soul and nothing else the corpsetaker watched me for a moment apparently not particularly straining to hold my will away again you meddle in what is not your concern bad habit i said but then its pretty much what wizards do this will not end well for you boy she replied leave now heh thats funny i said i was straining i tried to keep it out of my voice for a second there it sounded like you were telling me to go away i mean as if i would just go away she blinked twice at me then in a tone of dawning comprehension she murmured you are not brilliant you are ignorant now you done it thems fightin words i drawled the corpsetaker tilted her head back and let out an eerie little screech i think that to her it was laughter then she turned swiped a hand at the last shrine and demolished it herself the wards came down all around us energy fading dispersing settling abruptly back down to earth i could see the massive currents of power begin to unravel and disperse back out into the world within seconds the protective wards were gone as if theyd never existed the corpsetaker made that shrieking sound again and vanished and in the sudden absence of her will i almost fell flat on my face i caught myself by remembering that i could now officially scoff at gravity stopped falling halfway to the floor and righted myself again the wards were down murphy and company would be crashing the party at any moment and for some reason the corpsetaker now wanted them to do it right that couldnt be good chapter fortysix i let go of my sight and went up the final flight of stairs the ones that led from the junction room up to the street entranceand found them stacked with big hoods i blinked for a fraction of a second when i saw them id practically forgotten the realworld thugs under the corpsetakers control all the power wed been throwing around in the duel had been ghostly stuff the big hoods had no practical way to be aware of it how odd must the past couple of minutes have been from their point of view theyd have felt the wave of cold seen candles burning suddenly low and then heard lots of boards and candles and paints being smashed and clawed down while the concrete and stone walls were raked by invisible talons and the candles were smacked up and down the halls and stairways there were at least a dozen of them on the stairs and they had guns and there wasnt a whole lot i could do about it for a second i entertained notions of setting the lecters on them but i rejected the idea in a spasm of nausea id seen what the killer spooks had done to the wolfwaffen if i turned them loose theyd deal with the big hoods the same wayand the big hoods at the end of the day were as much the corpsetakers victims as her physical muscleand once you turned loose a force that elemental you almost had to expect collateral damage i didnt want any of it to splash onto murphy and company okay i told the lecters go back downstairs and help sir stuart and his boys out against those lemurs after that defend mort the lecters only response was to vanish presumably to the main chamber good mort had still been conscious the last time id seen him he could tell them what to do if they needed any further direction meanwhile id do the only thing i could to take on the big hoods id play superscout for karrins team i vanished to outside the door to the stronghold and found several forms crouched there evening traffic was rumbling by on the bridge overhead though the street running below it was deserted and the space beneath the bridge was entirely shadowed i ignored the darkness and saw murphy next to the door rummaging in a black nylon backpack she was wearing her tactical outfitblack clothing and boots and one of charity carpenters vests made of kevlar and titanium over that was a tactical harness and she had two handguns and her teeny assault rifle a little belgian gun called a p it packed one hell of a punch for such a compact packagemuch like murphy herself next to her against the wall were three great gaunt wolveswill andi and marci from the color of their fur next came molly in her rags and armor sitting calmly against the wall with her legs crossed butters brought up the rear dressed in dark colors carrying his gym bag and looking extremely nervous i went over to him and said boo the word emerged from the little radio in his pocket and butters jumped and said meep meep i said seriously yeah yeah yeah butters muttered keep your voice down were sneaking up on someone here they already know youre here i said there are about a dozen gunmen on the other side of that door quiet murphy hissed dammit butters butters held up the radio dresden says theyre right on the other side of the door now he shows up murphy muttered not when were planning the entry give me the radio butters leaned across molly and tossed the radio underhand molly just sat smiling quietly murphy caught the radio so what can you tell us she hesitated grimaced and said i keep wanting to add the word over to the end of sentences but this isnt exactly radio protocol is it not really i said but we can do whatever makes you happy over no one likes a wiseass harry murphy said i always enjoy seeing you in gunmetal ms murphy i continued it brings out the blue in your eyes really makes them pop over the wolves were all wagging their tails dont make me bitchslap you dresden murphy growled but her blue eyes were twinkling tell me what you know i gave her the brief on the interior of the hideout and what was waiting there so you didnt get this necromancer bitch she said thats one hell of a negative way to put it i replied grinning whos a grumpy pants tonight over murphy rolled her eyes at butters and said in exactly the same tone so you didnt get this necromancer bitch not yet i said pretty sure her ghost troops are done for but i need to get back downstairs and see just wanted to give you the rundown you remember how to get to the basement down the stairs through the hole in the wall fifty feet down a hall that turns left down more stairs yeah you got it i said uh butters said point of order theres a locked door and a bunch of guys with guns between here and there molly stood up they wont have guns she said calmly butters frowned uh dresden just said i heard him molly replied theyre going to empty their weapons at you the moment they see you in the doorway okay as plans go i cant be the only one who has a problem with that butters said illusion i asked molly she nodded murphy frowned i dont get it why that why not push them back with fire or make them all go to sleep or something because this is the bad guys home i said they have a threshold molly nodded any spell that goes through gets degraded down to nothing i cant push anything past the door if i go in without being invited i wont have any magic to speak of without an invitation harry cant cross the threshold at all murphy nodded so youre going to give them a target at the door makes sense she frowned how were you going to get back in harry i stood there for a second with my mouth open well crap i muttered over murphy snorted god it really is you isnt it she turned back to her bag and took out a small black plastic hemisphere of what had to be explosives of some kind she pressed it onto the doors surface right next to its lock no problem ill invite you in once the doors down doesnt work like that i said got to be an invitation from someone who lives there murphy scowled nothings ever simple with you dresden me since when have you been polly plastique kincaid showed me how murphy said without any emphasis and you know me dresden ive always been a practical girl she pressed a little device with a couple of tines on it through a pair of matching holes in the bowl turned a dial and said get clear setting for ten seconds whatever youre going to do molly have it ready my apprentice nodded and everyone but me and murphy backed down the wall from the door i waited until they were done moving away before i said murph these gangers theyre victims too she took a breath then she said are they standing right by the door no five or six steps down she nodded then they wont be in the direct line of the blast this is a fairly small shaped charge with a little luck no one will get hurt luck i said she closed her eyes for a second then she said you cant save everyone dresden right now im concerned with the man these victims are torturing and holding prisoner theyre still people but they come right after him and everyone here on my worry list i felt a little guilty for making an insinuation about murphys priorities maybe it was too easy for me to talk i was the one the big hoods couldnt hurt after all i wasnt sure how to say something like that though so i just sort of grunted and mumbled its okay murphy said very quietly i get it your perspective has changed i stared down at her for a moment then i said not about some things relationship ambivalence from beyond the grave she said her mouth turning up at the corners perfect karrin i began dont she said cutting me off just dont it doesnt matter now does it of course it matters no she said you are not patrick swayze i am not demi moore she touched a switch on the little box and it started ticking and this sure as hell isnt pottery class she moved a couple of yards down the wall pressed her hands up over her ears and opened her mouth molly butters and the wolves all did more or less the same thing it looked well theyd have been insulted if i said anything but it looked darned cute on the wolves them all crouched down with their chins on the ground folding their ears forward with their paws im sure any real wolf would have been shocked at the indignity i stayed where i was standing right in front of the door i mean what the hell right when was i going to get a chance to see an explosion from this angle again i was a little disappointed there was just a huge bang a flash of light and then a cloud of dust which was pretty much descriptive of most of the explosions id seen though i was glad no one had actually been watching me i flinched and hopped back about a foot when it went off when the dust cleared enough to see through the door swung freely on its hinges murphy stuck her foot around the corner and kicked it all the way open then gestured to molly molly murmured and closed her eyes then lifted her hand abruptly there were two murphys crouched by the door the one nearest it was chewing gum noisily she stood up with her p flicked on the little flashlight under the barrel and stepped around the corner the gun pointing down the stairs gunfire erupted the gumchewing murphy dropped to one knee and started shooting the assault rifle chattering in two and threeround bursts it was noisy as hell for about five seconds and then there was silence gumchewing murphy withdrew back around the corner once she was out of sight of whoever was inside she vanished the real murphy stood up then and pitched an object down the stairs a moment later there was an eyesearing flash of light and thunder go go go murphy called and swung to point her gun down the stairs with just a portion of her upper body and face exposed to possible fire while the rest of her body was hidden behind the wall the three wolves rose and plunged through the dusty doorway in a single blur of motion wolves in general get underestimated in the modern worldafter all humans have guns and helicopters but back in the day when things were more muscle powered wolves were a real threat to humans possibly the numbertwo predator on the planet people dont remember that wolves are far stronger far faster and far more dangerous than human beings that humanity taught wolves to fear and avoid themand that without that fear and advanced weaponry a human being was nothing more than a possible threat and a potential meal a wolf with no fear could tear several human beings apart a wolf with no fear and an intelligent mind directing it to work in close concert with teammates was a force of freaking nature more or less literally the point being that three wolves against a dozen big hoods in those tiny confines was not a fair fightit wasnt even close people started screaming and murphy moved in dropping her assault rifle to let it hang from her harness and holding a little personal stunner in her hand i watched from the doorway unable to proceed farther will marci and andi plowed into the first guy half a dozen steps down in a single bound i dont care how big and strong you are getting hit by a stun grenade and about five hundred pounds of wolf in the wake of a closequarters explosion is going to make you want to call it a day he went down taking the next several big hoods with him there was a huge tangle of frantic bodies and flashing teeth the wolves had the advantage hands holding weapons got targeted first and bloodspattered guns tumbled down the stairs one of the big hoods produced a knife about the size of a cafeteria tray and drew back to hack awkwardly at wills back with it murphy stomped the weapon down flat against the stairs and jabbed the arm holding it with a stunner a cry of pain rose sharply and the weapon fell then it was about momentum and snarling wolves the big hoods were driven down the stairs stunned bruised and bleeding once at the bottom the wolves started attacking with even more savage growlsherding the big hoods like so many dazed and overmuscled sheep they drove the guards down the length of the electricaljunction room and out of my direct line of sight i had to imagine them all piled up in a corner i heard growls rolling up out of the wolves throats in a low continual thunder murphy went down the rest of the stairs hands on her gun again but not actually pointing it at anyone you she said nodding toward the presumed position of the big hoods knife boy whats your name i stammered a voice i cant i dont murph i called corpsetakers been messing with these guys heads for a while now ever since that thing with sue they are not operating at one hundred percent murphy glanced at the radio in her pocket and then back at whoever she was talking to her expression had changed from potential executioner to something more like a schoolteacher you dont want to cross murphy had been damaged in the same way before thats a wallet in your pocket son yes maam mumbled the voice she nodded take it out with just two fingers toss it over here to me nice and easy i dont want you to hurt me said the voice murphy tilted her head and i saw pain in her eyes she lowered the gun and her voice became gentler yet just toss me the wallet im going to set things right yes maam mumbled the voice again a ratty old nylon wallet hit the floor near murphys feet murphy picked it up never taking her eyes off the group i saw her go through the wallet i like dogs ventured the voice there was a disconnected tone to it they wont hurt you if you stay there murphy said joshua is that your name i yes maam it was i mean it is josh josh age nineteen murphy said a flicker of anger entered her blue eyes jesus these gameplaying bastards bitch technically i said murphy snorted come here josh molly approached the top of the stairway and stood next to me where she usually did a little behind me and to my left she must have gotten a look at my position through her little tuning fork a big hood appeared in front of murphy he was about five hundred times bigger than she was he had hands like shovels one of his hands was bleeding take the hood off please murphy said he hastened to do so he was an ugly bluntfeatured kid his hair was longish and matted it had been months since it was cut combed or washed he didnt have enough beard to notice from the top of the staircase and he didnt look too bright he blinked his eyes several times in the light coming from murphys flashlight hello josh murphy said keeping her tone level and calm my name is karrin lo karrin josh said let me see your hand she said firmly establish the pattern molly murmured under her breath good josh hesitated a moment and then held out his hand murphy examined it doesnt look too deep its already beginning to stop bleeding had worse maam josh mumbled she nodded again do you know why you were on those stairs bad people josh said bad people who were going to hurt us he frowned you i could hurt you right now but im not going to am i murphy said no thats right she said i know this is hard josh but im probably your friend he frowned i dont know you youre a stranger im going to help you she said help all of you if youll let me get you some food and some clean clothes josh shrugged a shoulder kay im hungry murphy looked away from him and i saw her control another expression of anger im looking for a little bald man i know hes here josh looked uncomfortable is he here downstairs you know he is i muttered it hadnt carried to the radio but murphy glanced with an arched eyebrow up the stairway then turned back to the kid josh looked back and forth and shifted his weight tell me the truth josh murphy said its all right downstairs josh said with boz boz murphy asked boz is big josh said murphy eyed the kid up and down and squared her shoulders um right okay josh theres one more thing i want you to do for me and then you can go sit down with your friends kay my friends are up at the top of the stairs i want you to ask them in josh furrowed his brow huh invite them inside please oh no he said shaking his head no one in the secret hideout orders its all right murphy said im giving you new orders invite them in please josh seemed to waver umm murphys hand dipped into her pocket and he seemed to flinch then it emerged holding one of those highactivity protein bars wrapped in mylar you can have this if you do the way to a dim minions heart was evidently through his stomach josh snapped up the bar with both hands and said up toward the top of the stairs wont you please come inside i took a tentative step forward and felt no resistance the threshold had parted molly did the same and hurried down the stairs will andi marci molly said in a calm voice back a couple of steps please the wolves glanced at murphy and then started backing up what are you doing murphy asked im making sure we dont need to hurt them ms murphy molly said trust me grasshopper i asked its legal she said rolling her eyes dont worry and we cant just stand around whats the response time to this block eight minutes murphy said calmly ish its been about four since the charge went off molly said ticktock murphy grimaced do it molly turned to josh and said go stand with your friends you guys look tired josh had a mouthful of whatever it was he nodded always tired and he shuffled over to the dazedlooking group in the corner a lot of cults do that molly said quietly it makes them easier to influence and control she closed her eyes for a moment then took a slow deep breath and opened them she lifted her right hand and murmured in a silkensoft tone neru and the dozen or so big hoods just sank down to the floor mother of god murphy said softly and turned to stare at molly sleep spell i said quietly like the one i had to use on you murph i didnt mention that the spell id used on murphy had taken every bit of skill id had and ten times as long to put together molly had just done the same thing only a dozen times biggertouching each individual mind and crafting the spell to lull it to sleep what shed just done was hard in fact it was what one could only have expected from a member of the white council maybe my godmother had a point molly shuddered and rubbed at her arms ugh they arent they arent right ms murphy they werent stable and they could have had their switches flipped to violence at any time this will at least make sure they wont hurt themselves or anyone else until morning murphy studied her for a moment and then nodded thank you molly my apprentice nodded back murphy took up her gun again and then looked at her she smiled and shook her head rag lady huh molly looked down at her outfit and back up i didnt pick the name the diminutive woman shook her head her expression firm with disapproval if youre going to create a persona youve got to think of these things do you know how many extra pms jokes are flying out there now molly looked serious i think that just makes it even scarier murphy pursed her lips and shrugged a shoulder yeah i guess it might scares me i said murphy smiled a little more because youre a chauvinist pig dresden no i snorted because i realize a lot better than you two do how dangerous you are both of them stopped at that blinked and looked at each other okay ghostyscout time i said sit tight for a second im going to check below meet you at the top of the next stairway murphy said got it i said oh nice work on that spell grasshopper mollys cheeks turned pink but she said casually yeah i know atta girl i said never let them think youre out of your depth i vanished and appeared in the main chamber below i was unprepared for the sight that waited for me corpsetaker was standing about twenty feet from where mort hung suspended her jaw was was unhinged like a snakes open much wider than it should have been able as i watched she made a couple of convulsive motions with her entire body and swallowed down a recognizable objecta childs shoe circa nineteenth century she tilted her head back as if it helped her slide whichever one of the two child ghosts shed eaten last down her gullet and then lowered her chin and smiled widely at mort lindquist sir stuarts faded form was the only one still visible in the room the wispy cameralit mists of several other spirits were still dissolving all around the room mort spotted me and slurred dresden you moron what have you done corpsetaker tilted her head back and laughed i wasnt keeping them shut away because they might hurt this bitch morty said he sounded hurt and exhausted and furious i was protecting them because she was going to eat them i stared for a second the corpsetaker had been going to eat the lecters the most vicious dangerous powerful spirits in all of chicago just like she had planned to do to chicagos ghosts when kemmlers disciples had attempted a ritual called a darkhallow several years before i realizeda ritual that if successful would have turned the necromancer who pulled it off into a being of godlike power ahhhh the corpsetaker said the sound deep and rich and full of satisfaction i got a very bad feeling in the pit of my stomach im almost full she continued she smiled at me with very wide very white very sharplooking teeth almost chapter fortyseven one thing you never do in a fight no matter how emotionally satisfying it might seem is pause to gloat with an enemy standing right in front of you savvy foes arent going to just hang around letting you yak at them theyre going to take advantage of the opening youre giving them the same goes for desperate foes who arent interested in trying to win a fair fight before the corpsetaker finished speaking i snapped my staff forward and snarled fuego fire lashed toward her she deflected the strike with a motion of her hand like youd use to ward off a fly the memoryfire went flying on by her through the wall and gone such a pity she said i was just going to she wanted to keep up the gloating i was game i hit her again only harder this time i sent it flying a lot faster and it stung though she slapped the fire aside before it could do much more than singe her she let out a furious sound fool i will some people i swear they never learn id built up a rhythm so i gave her my best evocation a burst of fire and force sizzling with a lot of curve and english on it an ogrebuster the size of a softball blazing with scarlet and golden light she swept both arms into an xshaped defensive stance fingers contorted in a desperate defensive gesture and she snapped out a string of swift words she stopped the strike but an explosion of flame and force rolled over her and she screamed in pain as she was driven twenty feet back and into the solid rock of the wall yahhh i shouted in wordless defiance even as i reached for my next spell and suddenly felt very strange sden stop mort was screaming his voice sounded very far away look at yourself i had the next blast of fire and energy ready in my mind but i stopped to glance at my hands i could barely see them they were faded to the point of near invisibility the shock drove the spell out of my head and color and substance rushed back into my limbs they were still translucent but at least i could see them i turned wide eyes to where mort still hung over the wraith pit his voice suddenly snapped back up in volume becoming very clear you keep throwing your memories at her mort said but part of what you are now goes out with themand it doesnt come back youre about to destroy yourself man shes luring you into it of course she was dammit why stand around trying to block my attacks when she could just vanish from in front of them evil bobs fortifications it seemed had served a purpose other than simply barring the wayid used up way too much of myself on the way through them and then here trading punches with corpsetaker id used up a lot more slinging out the memory of my magic left and right when id seen how careful sir stuart was to recover such expended power practically the minute id gotten out of captain jacks car i couldnt see her without bringing up my sight but corpsetakers mocking laugh rolled through the underground chamber from the section of wall id knocked her into i stared at my hands again and clenched them in frustration mort was right id already done too much but how the hell else was i supposed to fight her i turned to mort he was having trouble keeping his eyes on me as he twisted slowly on the rope he closed them dresden you cant do anything more get out of here i dont want anyone else to give themselves away for me he said his voice raw not for me sir stuarts shade floating protectively beside mort regarded me with sober distant eyes corpsetakers mad laughter mocked us all then she said if id known you would deliver so thoroughly dresden id have gone looking for you ages ago boz kill the little man there was a growl and the stirring of a large animal and then a human garbage truck started climbing out of the wraith pit emerging from the stewing broil of wraiths like godzilla rising out of the surf boz had a stench to him so thick that it carried over into the realm of spirita psychic stink that felt like it might have choked me unconscious had i still been alive the guys brain had been down there stewing in wraiths for only god knew how long and if mortys reaction to exposure was any indication boz had to have had his sanity pureed he was crusted over in filth so thick that i couldnt tell where the spiritual muck left off and the physical crud began i could see his eyes like dull gleaming stones underneath his hood they were absolutely gone this guy was only a person by legal definitions his humanity had long since begun to fester and rot boz climbed out of the pit radiating a physical and psychic power full of rot and corruption and rage and endless hungers he stood there blankly for a second and then he turned and took one slow lumbering voorheesian step after another toward the apparatus from which mort hung the ectomancer regarded boz weakly and then said great this is all i need what i said mort what does she mean uh sorry little distracted here mort said what the corpsetaker what did she mean that she doesnt need you anymore you fed her enough power to fuel a couple of dozen nightmares dresden mort said she can do whatever she wants now what so she gobbles a bunch of killers and she gets to be a real boy again it cant be that easy boz reached the basketball goal grabbed it in his huge hands and just turned it slowly the hard way mort began to rotate toward the edge of the pit agh dresden do something i glared at morty spreading empty hands and then in pure frustration i tossed a punch at boz it was like slapping my fist through raw sewage i didnt hit anything solid and my fist and arm came out covered in disgusting residue i couldnt act information was the only weapon i had kind of limited here mort morty had begun to hyperventilate but he clearly came to some sort of decision he started gasping out words rapidly she can be real againfor a little while she can manifest i said bozs fingernails were spotted with dark green mold he reached out and grabbed the rope holding mort he untied the rope from its stay without letting it slide and began to haul mort toward the edge of the pit arms and mouths and fingers stretched up from the bubbling wraiths trying to reach the ectomancer gah mort gasped trying to twist away wraith fingertips touched his face and he winced in apparent pain once she does that she gets to be her old self for a while she can walk talkwhatever use her magic for real i breathed the corpsetaker wouldnt have to limit herself to people who could contact the dead people from whom she could try to wrest consent as she had done to mort she could simply take someone newand then she was back in the game a bodyswitching lunatic with a hateon for the white council and all things decent in general her boss kemmler had apparently slithered his way out of being dead more than once maybe her whole freakycult operation had been a page from his playbook i vanished to the bottom of the stairs and screamed murph hurry but i saw no one at the top of the stairs sir stuart stood in front of boz clenching his jaw and his ax in impotent rage as boz lowered mort to the ground and then leaned over him reaching down with his huge hands to grasp mort on either side of his head a twist a snap and it would be over for the ectomancer but what could i do i had nothing more than the ghost of a decent spell in me and then i was misty history morty was beat to hell exhausted unable to use his own magicor he damned well would have gotten himself out of this clustergeist by now even if hed let me inwhich i wasnt sure he would do in his condition not even to save his lifei doubted the two of us had enough energy and control between us to get him free mort could have called sir stuart into him drawn upon the marines experience and the memory of his strength but the ectomancer was still tied up and besides sir stuart was in the same condition i was only worse all of us were helpless to act on the physical world if id still had the lecters i could have ordered one of them to manifest and free morty which i maybe should have chanced a few minutes ago hindsight was blinding in its clarity it was too late for that nowcorpsetaker had taken the lecters out of the picture and without the mad spirits ability to manifest in the physical world my thoughts sped to quicksilver flickering frantic memory hit me like a hammer hells bells every time ive run into a ghost its tried to rip my lungs out youre telling me none of your spooks can do something theyre sane mort shouted back its crazy for a ghost to interact with the physical world sane ghosts dont go around acting crazy for a ghost manifesting in the material world was an act of madnessa memory trying to enforce its will on the living the past struggling to steer the course of the present it was according to everything i had learned about magic and life an inversion of the laws of nature a defiance of the natural order ghosts who werent supermighty manifested all the time it wasnt a question of raw power and it never had beenit was a matter of desire you just had to be crazy enough to make it happen that was what the corpsetaker had gotten from devouring the lecters not sufficient power but sufficient insanity she just had to be crazy enough to make it happen for a wizard running around as a lost soul expending his very essence in an attempt to rescue a guy who hadnt even really been his friend was definitely of questionable rationality grabbing the leashes of several dozen maniac ghosts and leading them on a banzai charge against a far stronger foe was probably less than stable too hell even the last few major choices of my lifemurdering susan in order to save our child giving myself to mab so that i could save little maggiewere not the acts of a stable sane man neither had been my entire career really given the options that had been available to me i mean i dont mean to brag but i could have used my abilities to make money if id wanted to a lot of money instead a little basement apartment a job catering to clientele who hadnt merely needed helptheyd needed a miracle money not much the occasional good deed sure but you cant eat sincere thanks girls dont flock to the guy who drives the old car reads a lot of books and kicks down the doors of living nightmares my own people in the white council had persecuted me my whole life mostly for trying to do the right thing and id kept on doing it anyway hell i was pretty much crazy already that being the case how hard could it be it would take a certain amount of energy i was sure maybe everything i had left it wouldnt get me any closer to the answers i wanted it wouldnt let me find out who had murdered me it might destroy me altogether heck for that matter if it took too much power to pull off it could snuff me here and now but the alternative watching morty die not going to happen id face oblivion first i gripped the wooden grain of my staff recalling the feelings that had surged through me when i had summoned and bound the lecters i called on my memories one more time i called up the ache of sore muscles after a hard workout and the sheer physical joy of my body in motion during a run walking down the street sinking into a hot bath swimming through cool water stroking over the softness of another body beside mine i thought of my favorite old tshirt a plain black cotton one with chimpanzee written on the chest in white typeset letters i thought of the creak of my old leather cowboy boots the comfort of a good pair of jeans the scent of a woodsmoked grill drifting into my nose when i was hungry the way my mouth would water and my stomach would growl i thought of my old mickey mouse alarm clock going off too early in the morning and groaning out of bed to go to work i remembered the smell of a favorite old books pages when i opened them again and the smell of smoldering motor oil a staple feature of my old blue beetle i remembered the softness of susans lips against mine i remembered my daughters slight warm weight in my arms her exhausted body as limp as a rag dolls i remembered the way tears felt sliding free of my eyes the annoying blockage of congestion when i had a cold and a thousand other thingslittle things minor things desperately important things you know life then i did something fairly nutty as i gathered the memory for what i was to attempt i just uttered the spell in plain old english the energy seared through my thoughts in a way that would have been damaging to a living wizard maybe fatal it seemed appropriate to use it here and i released whatever power i had left clothing it in garments of memory as i murmured the most basic of ideas the foundation of words and of reality be my universe shook there was a vast rushing sound rising to a crescendo that would have made a sane person flinch and crouch down to find shelter and in a sudden burst of silence i stood firmly in cold dank dimness the cold raised gooseflesh on my skin shadows had swollen to cover almost all the details around me and no wonder they had all the candles and lamps that lit the chamber had burned down to little pinpoints i tapped boz on the shoulder and said hey gorgeous his face twisted in complete surprise turning to stare in blank incomprehension at mine i winked at him and whispered boo and then i slugged him with my quarterstaff it hurt i mean more than the shock of impact that lanced up through my wrists i was solid again at least for a moment i was myself again and with my remembered body came a fountain of remembered pain my legs and knees creaked and ached something that was a natural progression for a big guy a kind of background pain that i never noticed until it was gone and then back again i hadnt exactly stretched out and id socked boz with everything i had id torn a muscle in my back doing it my head wasnt clear suddenly riddled with a catalog of muscle twitches physically painful hunger and old injuries id just learned to ignore now suddenly screaming in fresh agony ive said before that only the dead feel no pain but id never spoken from experience before pain used as a weapon is one thing personal pain the kind that comes from just living our lives is something else pain isnt a lot of fun at least not for most folks but it is utterly unique to life painphysical emotional and otherwiseis the shadow cast by everything you want out of life the alternative to the result you were hoping for and the inevitable creator of strength from the pain of our failures we learn to be better stronger greater than what we were before pain is there to tell us when weve done something badlyits a teacher a guide one that is always there to both warn us of our limitations and challenge us to overcome them for something no one likes pain does us a whole hell of a lot of good stepping back into my old self and moving instantly into violent motion hurt like hell it was amazing i let out a whoop of sheer adrenaline and mad joy as boz tumbled back over morts recumbent form oof mort shouted dresden a howl of excitement came rolling out of sir stuarts throat and he clenched his fist in vicious satisfaction flashing briefly into full color aye set boot to arse boy boz came up into a crouch pretty smoothly for someone of his bulk and stayed there low and on all fours an animal that saw no advantage in learning to stand erect absolutely no sign of discomfort showed on his face even though id split open his cheek with the blow from my staff and blood joined the other substances encrusting his face hells bells my staff wasnt exactly a toothpick it was as heavy as three baseball bats i wasnt a toothpick either i wasnt sure of my weight in baseball bats but i could look down at a lot of guys in the nba and i wasnt a scrawny kid anymore the point being that the blow delivered with all the power of my shoulders hips and legs as well as my arms should have knocked boz outor killed him outright id been aiming for his temple hed jerked his head back so that the end of my staff hit his left cheekbone instead hell i might have broken it but instead of collapsing in pain he just crouched there silent stony eyes looking right through me as he faced me without flinching i began to gather my will and staggered nearly falling on my face i had nothing left it was only that burning flash of irrational certainty that had driven me to attempt to manifest that was keeping me on my feet at alland i realized with a cold little chill that i might not be able to stop boz from killing morty good lord im regretting this now i muttered i have nevereversmelled bo this bad in my life and i once had smores with a sasquatch hang out with him for a while mort gasped eventually its not so bad wow really no not really i kept my eyes on boz but did my best to grin at mort hed been strung up and tortured by lunatics for almost twentyfour hours and his executioner was still trying to finish the job but he still had the guts to engage in badinage anyone with that kind of spirit in the face of horror is okay in my book boz came at me like a predatora smooth swift motion that moved his whole body at once unfettered by any kind of reluctance or hesitation he never rose to do it either he flung himself forward as much with his arms as his legs and his bodys center of mass never came much higher than my knees i gave him a boot to the head i literally kicked him in the head with my hiking boot and it was like stubbing my toe on a large rock he just plowed on through the kick and hit me at the knees boz had a lot of mass we went down me on my ass him lying on my lower legs he started trying to claw his way up my body to my throat i declined to allow him such liberties and communicated that desire to him by thrusting the end of my staff at his neck he slapped at the staff with one paw and caught it in an iron grip i tried to roll away he got his other hand on the weapon we wrenched and wrestled for control of it he was stronger than me he was heavier than me i had slightly more leverage but not enough to make the difference then boz surged forward driving with treetrunk legs and i went down on my back all his weight came down on the staff and he drove it toward my throat temporary body or not it still worked the same way as the one i was used to if boz crushed my windpipe the body would die if that happened i assumed i would be left behind immaterial again while the false flesh collapsed into ectoplasmthe way ghosts and demons were driven back to their spirit forms when their temporary bodies were destroyed but we were getting pretty far out of my comfort zone when it came to ghostly lore boz bore down and it was all i could do to keep him from choking me with my own staff i couldnt even dream of moving him he had seventyfive or eighty pounds on me all of them solid stinking mass and he was coming at me with a silently psychotic determination but he hadnt realized where we had fallen i released the staff with my right hand and his shoulders bunched his back rounding out in a massive hump of trapezius muscles my one hand wasnt able to do much to hold him back and i felt the harsh pain of blood trying to hammer through the arteries boz was compressing with my right hand i seized the ends of the jumper cables still attached to the heavyduty automobile battery the one morty had been tortured withand jammed the metal ends of them both against the freshly bloodsoaked side of bozs face it wasnt exactly a surgical strike i was holding both clamps in the same hand and only a couple of seconds from being choked unconscious after all but it worked the clamps touched each other and wet skin and sparks flew boz convulsed and jerked away from the sudden source of agony a reflex action as immutable as pulling your arm away from a searinghot pan handle he shifted his weight and i pushed up adding every ounce of muscle i had to aid the movement he pitched off me rolling and i followed him letting go of the staff and looping the main body of the jumper cable around his neck he thrashed and tried to get away but i had gotten onto his back and locked my legs around his hips i grabbed the cable in both hands and hauled back on it with everything i had it was over pretty quick though it didnt feel like it at the time boz thrashed and struggled but as heavily muscled as he was he wasnt flexible enough to get his arms back and up to reach where i was on his back so he couldnt pull me off he tried to break away but between the cable and the grip of my legs he wasnt able to shake me off he tried to get his fingers in beneath the jumper cable but though he managed to get in a couple of digits i was pulling too hard and was more than strong enough to outmuscle one of his fingers i dont care how crazy you are when your brain doesnt get oxygen you go down boz did too i held the choke for another ten seconds to make sure he wasnt playing possum on me and then for fifteen then twenty someone was snarling a string of curses and i hadnt realized it was me the simple sensation of straining power of primal victory surged through me like a drug and only the coup de grace remained i ground my teeth id killed men and women before but never when id had an alternative i might be a fighter but i wasnt a killer not when there was a choice i forced myself to let go of the cables and boz flopped to the ground entirely limp but alive i had to roll him off one of my legs pushing with my other heel but he finally went and i shambled upright breathing hard then i turned to mort and started untying knots he watched me with wary eyes dresden what youre doing being in the flesh like that it isnt right i know i said but no one else was going to do it he shook his head im just saying it isnt good for you those spirits the ones id been shelteringthey werent any different from any other ghost when they got started doing this it does things to you longterm youll change he leaned a little toward me right now youre still you but what you felt there at the endit grows keep doing this and you wont be you anymore im almost done i told him jerking the ropes clear as fast as i could it took a bit theyd strung him up pretty carefully distributing his weight across a lot of rope i guess corpsetaker hadnt wanted to spend several hours getting her limbs back under control once mort cracked he groaned and tried to sit up it took him a couple of attempts but when i tried to help him he waved my offer away can you walk i asked him he shuddered i can damned well walk out of here just give me a minute i dont have it i said ive got to move why because my friends are up there somewhere he sucked in a breath i know i said with a grimace then i rose grabbed my staff and started walking toward the stairs stu i heard mort say you know knots right i glanced back and saw sir stuart nod mort nodded back and started gathering up the coils of rope id pulled off him he beckoned to sir stuart come in i dont want the man mountain there getting up and finishing what he started i almost hesitated to make sure mort was all right but id spent too much time down here already and i could feel the hectic buzz of my fatigue growing by the moment i had to get upstairs there was only one reason corpsetaker would have taken down her own wards as she had she wasnt limited to such a small sampling of humanity now when it came to seizing a new body shed wanted people to come inside her lair it would give her more variety to choose from i rushed up the stairs praying that i would be in time to stop kemmlers protégé from taking one of my friendsfor keeps chapter fortyeight i pounded up the stairs and found that it was getting dark dammit id gotten way too used to the upside of ghostliness i reached up to my neck to find my mothers pentacle amulet and and it wasnt there which it should have been i mean my actual duster had been destroyed but the one i was wearing was an exact duplicate there was no reason my mothers amulet shouldnt have been there but it wasnt that was possibly something significant but i didnt have time to worry about it at the moment instead i sent a whisper of will into my staff and the runes carved in it began to glow with bluewhite wizard light casting their shapes in pure light on the moldy stone walls and floor of the hallway showing me the way i didnt have much magic left in me but a simple light spell was much much easier than any kind of violent spell requiring far less energy i ran down the hall past the filthy sleeping rooms with curtains for doors and through the break in the wall to the old electricaljunction room a flashlight lay on the floor spilling light onto a patch of wolf fur from a couple of inches away and otherwise doing nothing to illuminate the scene i had to brighten the light from my staff to see that murphy and the wolves were lying in a heap on the floor next to the unconscious big hoods the corpsetaker was nowhere to be seen neither was molly i turned in a slow circle looking for any sign of what had happened and found nothing feet scraped on rock and i turned swiftly bringing up my staff ready to unleash whatever power i had left in meand found butters standing halfway down the stairs looking like a rabbit about to bolt his face was pale as a sheet behind his glasses and his dark hair was a wild mess my god he breathed dresden back for a limited engagement i breathed lowering the staff butters what happened i i dont know they started shouting something and then they just just collapsed and you didnt i asked i was out there he said pointing behind him you know looking out for the police or whatever being eyes huh i said i turned back to murphy and the wolves yeah pretty much he said he moved quietly down the stairs are they all right i crouched down over murphy and felt her neck her pulse was strong and steady ditto for the nearest of the wolves yeah i said my heart slowing down a little i think s something cold and hard pressed against the back of my head i looked down murphys sig was missing from its holster everyone trusts a doctor purred butters in a tone of voice that butters would never have used even wizards dresden i felt myself tensing corpsetaker you were able to manifest after all intriguing youve a natural gift for darker magic i think my master would have snapped you up in an instant id spent an afternoon with murphy working on gun disarms at dough joes hurricane gym i tried to remember which way i had to spin to attempt to take the gun away it depended on how it was being heldand i had no idea how corpsetaker was holding the weapon on me i was pretty sure butters was a lefty but i didnt think that would matter to the corpsetaker once she set up shop oh boy i could have hung out with people like you im pretty sure it wouldnt have worked out possibly not corpsetaker said i accorded you far more respect than you merited as an opponent how much of you is left behind that body youve cobbled together scarcely more than one of those pathetic wraiths i think you could have made a viable move in time but clearly youve no patience no head for strategy yeah i guess ive still got a soul and a conscience where you installed that stuff soul conscience corpsetaker said almost laughing those are nothing but words they arent even true limitsjust the figments of them useless just because something isnt solid doesnt mean it isnt real i said if you had a brain in your head youd know that youre obsessed with the fantasies of the young she replied with my friends breath though i must admit that that the ironic reversal of our current state is simply delicious and without a hesitation or any change in the tone of her voice she put a bullet into the back of my head the pain was infinitely brief and indescribable a massive spike of agony that felt as if it should have sent me flying i saw a cloud of something fly forward and then splatter all over one of the wolves and the nearest big hood ectoplasm i realized dully my physical body had been destroyed it had fallen back into the spirit matter from which id formed it the pain faded and then i was back in the still neutral absence of sensation of the ghost state i reached for the splattered matter with an instinctive unspoken yearning to return to it i could barely see my hand i tried to turn around but it felt like i was submerged in something thicker and more viscous than water and it took forever i stared into the corpsetakers eyes within butterss face and watched the bodyjumping lunatic smirk at me not much of you now is there she murmured youll be a wraith within days i think that balances our account enjoy eternity dresden i tried to snarl a curse but i was just so tired i couldnt get the sound to come out of me and by the time i had tried corpsetaker had taken butterss body back to the bottom of the stairs she was moving so fast or or maybe i was just that slow i tried to follow and all i could manage was to drift in the corpsetakers wake moving with grace but slowly so slowly corpsetaker made a gesture and a veil fell away from another shade at the top of the stairs it was butters he stood there dressed not in his winter gear but in the scrubs i was far more used to seeing him wear he was completely motionless except for his eyes which rolled around frantically a rapidly evaporating puddle of ectoplasm spread at his feet an expression of pure confusion was locked onto his face corpsetaker had been a big fan of body switching when she left me and morty in the basement she must have come directly up here to grab a new body shed probably dropped some variant of a sleeping spell on murphy and the wolvesand then butters must have shown up corpsetaker had gone with her usual trick forcibly trading bodies with a victimand the manifested ghost body shed been in had fallen back into ectoplasm the moment she wasnt there to give it energy and form butterss essence his soul had just been booted out of his body and now it stood there vulnerable and unmovingbrightly colored but fading away even as i watched shed tossed a quick veil over butterss shade so that no one who might come upon her would see him standing there forlorn and confused while she drove around in his hijacked body the thing that really got to me corpsetaker threw a little smirk back at me as she got to butterss shade there wasnt anything i could do to stop her but she wanted me to see how thoroughly shed outthought and outmaneuvered me but the universe has a funny sense of humor and apparently its not always aimed at me while corpsetaker looked back at me to smirk molly rippled forth from under a veil of her own on the last step between butterss stolen body and the explosionchewed door she grabbed the corpsetaker by the front of butterss coat butters wasnt exactly heroic in build molly on the other hand was several inches taller than he and had her mothers genes everything id been able to teach her about mixing it up and six months of hard time under the tender guiding hand of the leanansidhe molly slammed the corpsetaker against the wall so hard that stolen teeth slammed together then she seized butterss freaking face in a clawlike hand and thrust her head close locking eyes with the corpsetaker i wanted to scream a negation but nothing came out i frantically tried to move faster if i succeeded it didnt show you want to play head games molly snarled her blue eyes blazing lets go the corpsetakers face contorted into an expression somewhere between murderous rage and that of an orgasm and she opened her stolen eyes wide molly and the dark wizard went into a soulgaze and there wasnt a thing i could do about itexcept keep trying to get closer i could feel power flickering between them though like bursts of heat coming out of a furnace as i got glacially nearer it was an entirely invisible struggle a simultaneous and mutual siege of the personality mind magic is dangerous slippery stuff and doing combat with another mind is all about imagination focus and sheer willpower right now molly was thrusting an array of images and ideas at the corpsetaker trying to force the other to pay attention to them some of the thoughts would be there to undermine defenses others to assault them and still others trying to slip past unnoticed to wreak havoc from within some of the thoughts would be simple thingswhispered doubts meant to shake the others confidence for example others would be far more complex constructions idea demons imagined ahead of time prepared for such an occasion and unleashed upon the thoughts and memories of the foe the white council hated mind magic generally speaking if you beat someones defenses you could do a lot of things to them and precious few of them were good events however had forced them to acknowledge the necessity of giving all of its members lessons in psychic selfdefense that were more comprehensive than the simple wall technique that id been briefly introduced to a couple of oldtimers who knew how to play the game had begun dispensing the basics to everyone interested in learning as it turned out i had a natural fortress of personality which explained a lotlike how hard it had always been for faerie glamour to trick me for long and why id been able to grind through several forms of mental assault over the years if someone came in after me they had a big badass castle to contend with they could pound on it all day as such things were measured without breaking the defenses and id been told that it would take an extended campaign to conquer my head entirelylike any decent castle there were multiple lines and structures where new defenses could take hold but i didnt have much of a forward game for me the best offense had to be an obstinate defense molly on the other hand well molly was sort of scary her castle wasnt huge and imposingthe damned thing was invisible made of mirrors covered in fog wrapped in darkness and generally hard even to pin down much less besiege anyone who went into her head had better bring a gps a seeingeye dog and a backup set of eyeballs worse her offense was like dealing with a mongolian horde shed send in waves and waves of every kind of mental construction imaginable and while you were busy looking at those ninja thoughts would be sneaking through your subconscious planting the psychological equivalent of explosives wed practiced against each other a lotimmovable object versus irresistible force it generally ended in a draw when molly had to quit and nurse a headache at which point i would join her in scarfing down aspirin a couple of times my thuggish constructions had stumbled over her defenses and started breaking mirrors a couple of times her horde had gotten lucky or particularly sneaky wed had the same thoughtimage set up to signal victoryvader swooping down in his tie fighter smugly stating i have you now once that got through the game was over but outside of practice that thought could just as easily be something more like put your gun into your mouth and pull the trigger we both knew that we both worked hard to improve as a result it was a part of the training id taken every bit as seriously as teaching her theory or enchantments or exorcism or any of a hundred other areas wed covered over the past few years but wed never done it for blood the corpsetaker moved butterss hands up to gently frame mollys cheeks and said my my my training standards have improved molly slammed corpsetakers head back against the wall with a short harsh motion and said stop squirming and fight corpsetaker bared butterss teeth in a slow grin and suddenly surged forward slamming mollys back against the opposite wall while simultaneously moving up a stair so that their eyes were on the same level slippery little girl but i was crushing minds like yours centuries before your greatgrandfathers grandfather left the old country molly suddenly let out a gasp and her face twisted in pain they never have the stomach to hurt their darling little apprentices corpsetaker crooned thats called pain let me give you a lesson lady molly panted did you pick the wrong part of my life in which to mess with me she took a deep breath and spoke in a ringing furious voice now get the fuck out of my friend ideru i felt the surge of her will as she spoke the word and suddenly reality seemed to condense around my apprentice there was a terrible terrible force that ripped forth from her pulling hungrily at everything around it id felt something similar once when a nascent white court vampire had unintentionally begun to feed on mean energy that spiraled and swirled and pulled at the roots of my senses but that was only one facet of the gravity that molly exuded with the spell corpsetakers eyes widened in surprise and sudden strain then she snarled have it your way the little doctor was my second choice in any case and then i saw corpsetakers dark mad soul flow into my apprentice on the tidal pull of the beckoning shed performed the expression of butterss face went empty and he collapsed utterly without movement of any kind three feet away his shades helpless confused gaze locked onto his fallen physical form and his eyes went wide with terror molly screamed in sudden shockand fear in that instant i saw in her eyes the reflection of her terror the panic of someone who has come loaded for bear and found herself facetoface with a freaking dinosaur instead my drifting dreamslow advance had finally gotten me close enough with sluggish and agonizing grace i stretched out one hand and caught the corpsetakers ankle as she slithered into my apprentice i settled my grip grimly and felt myself pulled forward into the havoc of the war for mollys body mind and soul chapter fortynine i landed in the middle of a war there was a ruined city all around me the sky above boiled with storm clouds moving and roiling too quickly to be real filled with contrasting colors of lightning rain hammered down i heard screams and shouted imprecations all around me overlapping one another coming from thousands of sources blending into a riotous roarand every single voice was either mollys or the corpsetakers as i watched some great beast somewhere between a serpent and a whale smashed its way through a brick buildinga fortress i realizedmaybe fifty yards away thrashing about as it fell and grinding it to powder a small trio of dots of bright red light appeared on the vast things rubbledusted flanks just like the targeting of the predators shoulder cannon in the movies of the same name and then multiple streaks of bluewhite light flashed in from somewhere and blew a series of holes the size of train tunnels right through the creature around me i saw groups of soldiers many of them in sinister black uniforms others looking like idealized versions of united states infantry laying into one another with weapons of every sort imaginable from swords to rocket launchers a line of tracer fire went streaking right through me having no more effect than a stiff breeze i breathed a faint sigh of relief i was inside mollys mindscape but her conflict was not with me and neither was the corpsetakers i was just as much a ghost here at the moment as i had been back in the real world the city around me i saw was a vast grid of fortified buildings and i realized that the kid had changed her usual tactics she wasnt trying to obscure the location of her mental fortress with the usual tricks of darkness and fog she had instead chosen a different method of obfuscation building a sprawl of decoys hiding the true core of her mind somewhere among them corpsetaker had countered her it would seem by the simple if difficult expedient of deciding to crush them all even if it had to be done one at a time that vast beast construct had been something more massive than i had ever attempted in my own imagination though molly had tossed some of those at me once or twice it wasnt simply a matter of thinking bigthere was an energy investment in creating something with that kind of mental mass and molly generally felt such huge unsubtle thrusts werent worth the effort they tookespecially since someone with the right attitude and imagination would take them down with only moderately more difficulty than small constructs corpsetaker though evidently didnt agree she was a lot older than molly or me and she would have deeper reserves of strength to call upon greater discipline and the confidence of long experience the kid had managed to take on the corpsetaker on mollys most familiar ground and to play her hand in her strongest suitbut my apprentices strength didnt look like it was holding up well against the necromancers experience and expertise i stopped paying attention to everything happeningall the artillery strikes and cavalry charges and shambling hordes of zombies and storms of knives that just came whirling out of the sky the form of any given construct wasnt as important as the fact of its existence a flying arrow that could pierce the heart for example was potentially just as dangerous as an animate shadow reaching out with smothering black talons as long as one could imagine an appropriate construct to counter the threat and do so in time to stop it any construct could be defeated it was a simple thing at its most basic level and it sounded easy but once youre throwing out dozens or hundredsor thousandsof offensive and defensive constructs at a time believe meit takes your full attention its also all you can do to deal with one opponent which explained why i hadnt been assaulted by the corpsetaker instantly if she had even taken note of my presence at all she and molly were locked together tight the soulgaze had probably played a part in that neither was letting go until her opponent was dead both combatants were throwing enormous amounts of offensive constructs at each other even though molly was demolishing her own defenses almost as rapidly as the corpsetaker was as tactics go that one had two edges molly was hurting herself but by doing so she was preventing the corpsetaker from pressing too closely lest she be caught up in the vast bursts of destruction being exchanged a mistake could easily destroy anyones mind in that vista of havoc centuriesold necromancer or not on the other hand if she spotted where molly was fighting from it looked like shed have the power to drive in and crush my apprentice but if she closed in on the wrong target shed leave herself wideopen to a surprise attack from the real molly corpsetaker had to know that just as she had to know that if she simply kept on the pressure the whole place would eventually be ground down and molly would be destroyed anyway my apprentice had come with a good plan but she had miscalculated the corpsetaker was a hell of a lot stronger than she had expected molly was playing the most aggressive defensive plan id ever seen and hoping that she could pressure the corpsetaker into making a mistake it wasnt a good plan but it was all she had one way or another it wasnt going to be a long fight best if i got moving molly was here somewhere in the sprawl of fake strongholds and she would be just as hidden from me as from the corpsetaker but i had an advantage that the necromancer didnt i knew my apprentice this wasnt the nevernever we were in mollys head inside a world of thought and imagination there was no magic involvednot now that we were here anyway i might be a slender wisp of a ghost but i still had my brain and that gave me certain liberties here i went over to the ruined building where the monster thing was groaning through its death i heaved aside a piece of rubble and pulled a pale blue bathroom rug stained with dust and weird purple blood out of the wreckage it was a tiny piece of an environmental construct but even so it was a serious effort to appropriate it as my own my arms shook with weakness as i lifted the carpet and snapped it once blood and dust flew from it as if it had never existed and then i settled it calmly on flat ground sat on it and folded my legs and my arms in front of me up simba i said in my best attempt to imitate yul brynner and the carpet quivered and then rose off the ground staying as rigid and almost as comfortable as a sheet of heavy plywood it rose straight in the air and as it did i gripped the edges surreptitiously it wouldnt do to have either my enemy or my apprentice get a glimpse of me flailing wildly for my balance as the carpet moved but on the other hand i didnt want to just fall off either i could probably come up with something to keep me from getting hurt when i hit the ground but it would look awfully bad and i dont care how close to dead he might be a wizard has his pride granted the imagination was the only place where i was going to get one of these darned things to work id tried the flyingcarpet thing before when i was about twenty it had been a fairly horrible experiment that had dropped me into a notyetclosed landfill during a thunderstorm and then there was the famous flyingbroomstick incident of wacker drive which wound up on the internet as a ufo sighting after that i had wisely determined that flying was mostly just a great way to get killed and settled for driving my old car around instead but hey in my imagination that carpet had worked greatand that was how it went as a guest in mollys imagination too i went up high enough to get a good viewand was impressed with the kid the city of fortresses stretched for miles there were hundreds of them and fighting raged all the way through it was the opposite of what the kid usually did in a mental battlean inverse mongol horde with endless defenders pouring out like angry bees to defend the hive corpsetaker unfortunately was playing mama bear to mollys queen bee shed get hurt coming in but as long as she wasnt stupid not very badly she could crush all the defenders eventuallyand then rip the hive to shreds i leaned forward a little and the carpet began to gather speed moving ahead shifts of my weight to the left or right let me bank and it wasnt long before i was cruising through the rain as fast as i could and still keeping my eyes clear i flew a spiral pattern scanning the city beneath me the battle kept going in the skies toomostly flying demon things and lightning bolts that kept smashing them out of the air it got boring to watch after the first dozen spectacular lightning strikes or so and i tuned that conflict out too as i kept searching finally i spotted what i was looking for a ruined building that had been reduced to a crater by an artillery shell or some other explosion it was impossible to tell what it had been from what was left and burned rubble covered the area around it coating a thickbodied old oak tree and the tree house on its lower branches in dust dirt and debris i went past the tree house without stopping or slowing down for several more minutes and then went evasive i couldnt be sure the corpsetaker didnt know i had ridden in on her coattails and if she was following me or had sent a construct to do so i didnt want to lead her to molly so the carpet went from forty or fifty miles an hour to more than a hundred and at the same time i constructed a veil around me so that i surged forward and simply vanished i flew low snaking through the streets and only after id crossed my own trail five or six times without spotting anything shadowing me did i finally soar in to the tree house it looked like a miniature home with a door and siding and trim and windows and everything a rope ladder allowed one to climb up to the porch but it had been pulled up i floated up to the door on the flying carpet and knocked politely i have you now i said as much like james earl jones as i could i do a better yul brynner mollys strained face appeared at the window and she blinked harry whats with the comehither grasshopper i asked you practically vacuumed me in with the corpsetaker molly narrowed her eyes and said what was i wearing the first time we met i blinked at her opened my mouth closed it thought about it and then said oh come on moll i have no idea clothes you were like eight years old and your mom tried to shut the door in my face and i was there to see your dad she nodded once as if that was the answer shed been looking for and opened the door come on i went into the tree house with her the inside was bigger than the outside you can do that sort of thing in your imagination its kind of fun ive got one closet of my castle that looks like a giant disco roller rink the roller skaters come after you like juggernaut the music makes heads explode and the mirror ball distributes a killer laser beam mollys headquarters looked like the bridge of i kid you not the uss enterprise the old one the one that was full of dials that obviously didnt do anything and that had a highpitched echoing cricket chirp going off every five or six seconds there was an upside to that setting though molly was wearing one of the old sixties miniskirt uniforms look im not interested in a relationship with the kid i do love her tremendously but that doesnt mean that she doesnt look fantastic anyone with eyes can see that and ive always been the kind of person who can appreciate gorgeous scenery without feeling a need to go camping in it actually glancing around there were about half a dozen mollys all of them wearing old sixties miniskirt uniforms each of them manning a different station the one who had opened the door had jetblack hair in a neat almost mathematical gaminestyle cut and slightly pointed ears star trek i asked her really what she demanded bending unnaturally black eyebrows together there are two kinds of people in the universe molly i said star trek fans and star wars fans this is shocking she sniffed this is the postnerdcloset world harry its okay to like both blasphemy and lies i said she arched an eyebrow at me with nimoysian perfection and went back to her station communications officer molly in a red uniform with a curly black fro and a silver object the size of a toaster in her ear said quadrant four is below five percent and the extra pressure is being directed at quadrant three captain molly in her gold outfit with her hair in a precise jacqueline onassis do spun the bridge chair toward communications molly and said pull out everything and shift it to quadrant three ahead of them the chair spun back toward science officer molly set off the nukes in four science molly arched an eyebrow askance oh hush im the captain youre the first officer and thats that snapped captain molly were fighting a war here so set off the nukes hi harry molly i said nukes i was saving them as a surprise she said there was a big tv screen at the front of the roomnot a flatscreen a big slightly curved old crt it went bright white all of a sudden ensign captain molly said ensign molly dressed in a red uniform wearing braces on her teeth and maybe ten years younger than captain molly twiddled some of the dials that didnt do anything and the bright white light dimmed down from outside there was a long scream an enormous one like godzillasized or maybe bigger everyone on the bridge froze a brass section from nowhere played an ominous sting bahmpahhhhhhhhhhm youre kidding i said looking around a sound track i dont mean to ensign molly said in a strained teenager tone she had a russian accent that sounded exactly like sanya i watched show too much when i was kid okay your brain is a very strange place i said i meant it as a compliment and it showed in my voice ensign molly gave me a glowing grin and turned back to her station i walked to the righthand side of the captains chair and folded my arms the screen came up to light again showing a devastated section of the city grid no not decimated had that part of the city been decimated one out of every ten buildings would be destroyed thats what decimated means personally i think some earlyyears respected television personality got decimated and devastated confused at some point and no one wanted to point it out to him so everyone started using them interchangeably but dammit words mean what they mean even if everyone thinks they ought to mean something else science molly spoke in a grim voice nuclear detonation confirmed enemy forces in quadrant four have been decimated captain i pressed my lips firmly together thank you number one captain molly said spinning back to face the front harry um help not sure what i can do grasshopper i told her seriously i barely managed to steal a bathroom rug from some rubble and whip up a flying carpet her stuff goes right through me and vice versa she looked at me for a moment and i saw the same look of fear flicker over every face on the bridge then she took a deep breath nodded and turned to face the front she started giving smooth orders and her other selves replied in calm steady voices after a few moments captain molly said if you arent here to i mean if you cant help why are you here because youre here i said calmly least i can do is stand with you if she wins captain molly swallowed youll die i snorted and flashed her a grin best thing about being a spook grasshopper im already dead quadrant three is collapsing communications officer molly reported quadrant two is at twenty percent captain molly bit her lip how many quadrants i asked her four she said since you know quadrants i wanted to say something about decimated but i didnt were in quadrant one captain molly nodded i dont think i can stop her harry fights not over until its over kid i said dont let her beat you make her work for it science molly said in a firm tone death is not the only consequence here should the corpsetaker prevail she will have full access to our talents abilities memories and knowledge even though we have spent the last months distancing ourselves from others to insulate against a situation such as this one the corpsetaker could still inflict considerable damage on not only our friends and family but on complete innocents that is unacceptable captain captain molly looked from science molly to me and then said the fight isnt over yet prepare the omega bomb but do not deploy aye aye said science molly and she stood up and strode to the other side of the bridgeand an old wooden cabinet beside an old wooden door i blinked at it wow thats kind of out of theme captain molly coughed loudly that thats nothing to worry about pay it no mind i watched science molly get a device the size of a small microwave out of the old cabinet and push one button on it then she set it on the console next to her um i said omega bomb the corpsetaker doesnt get me captain molly said in a firm tone ever and its in that old wooden cabinet because i dont know what youre talking about said captain molly dismissively ensign bring up the screen for quadrant two i eased away from captain molly as she kept commanding the battle and went over to stand next to science molly um the captain doesnt seem to want me to know about that door definitely not said science molly also in confidential tones its a needtoknow door why because if you know about it youre one of the ones who needs to know about it she replied calmly and if you dont its better that you not know the captain feels youve suffered enough suffered enough i asked what do you mean i have nothing further to say on the subject said science molly its my fault ensign molly said sorry look i dont mean to with the cabinet and the door okay but i cant help it you ever get that feeling youre standing in a room full of crazy people i got that feeling it isnt a very nice feeling i stared at the door and the old wooden cabinet it wasnt a particularly outstanding door in any waya standard hanging door if rather old and battered ditto the cabinet both had been stained a medium brown apparently a very long time ago both were covered with dings and dents not as though something had tried to break them down but simply from years and years of use they looked sort of familiar i studied the door and the cabinet thoughtfully glancing occasionally at the big old crt as quadrant two buckled under the corpsetakers assault the fighting had been fierce but she still hadnt revealed herself and molly hadnt managed to kill her with the nukes or the assault would have ended with her another quadrant went and captain molly detonated another set of massive nuke constructs then a third and more nukes neither of the second pair of detonations was followed by a massive scream the way the first one had been molly had bloodied the corpsetaker presumably but it hadnt been enough dammit captain molly said clenching one fist and staring at the screen shes got to be near now but where the streets outside were so full of battling constructs that they were literally piling up with bodies slowing the progress of the enemybut not stopping it dammit i felt helpless just standing next to the kid wasnt going to do her any good but i was holding on to the world by a thread i just didnt have the ability to make things happen either here or in the real world all i could do was was use my freaking brain duh wait i said molly ive got an idea all the mollys turned to look at me i turned to captain molly slow her down i said youve got to slow the corpsetaker down whatever you have to do you need to buy some time go captain molly blinked at me then she turned and started snapping orders the bridge mollys started twisting dials and punching keys i turned to communications molly hey you do communications right she looked baffled right we need to communicate i said you need to make a longdistance call now communications molly said her eyes widening right the hell now i corrected her i leaned down and explained what i needed in terse tones thats going to be tricky she said were already at one hundred percent on the reactor i put on my best sean connery voice then go to a hundred and ten pershent science molly arched an eyebrow at me and punched a button engineering bridge aye screamed a furious scottishaccented molly what do ye want now more power engineer the answer was a furious rush of pure profanitybut the deep enginehum in the background around us went upward a bit and the floor started to vibrate science molly pointed at communications molly and said go mayday communications molly said into her console this is a mayday emergency transmission we urgently require assistance suddenly everything lurched to one side and we all staggered oh i dont believe this crap i muttered shes found us captain said science molly shields at seventy percent hit her with everything captain molly snapped finally growled tactical molly who sat next to ensign molly wearing a gold uniform almost identical to captain mollys shed been sitting there doing absolutely nothing and looking bored the entire time id been there now she turned and started jabbing buttons and cheesy sound effects filled the bridge minimal damage reported science molly the bridge rocked again and we staggered one of the panels exploded in a shower of sparks some molly in a red uniform who hadnt spoken crashed limply to the deck not real ensign molly said sorry my bad some things you just cant get rid of damage alarms started wailing they sounded like a badly distorted version of a young woman screaming shields have failed captain science molly reported and she reached for the omega bomb no i snapped stop her captain molly took one look at me and then leapt at science molly she seized the omega bomb stop she ordered there is no room for emotion here snapped science molly its over this is all you can do to protect them i gave you an order snapped captain molly youre letting your fear control you replied science molly coldly this is the only logical way captain molly screamed in incoherent rage and slugged science molly in the face science molly screamed back and swung a fist into captain mollys stomach music started playing loud highpitched strident most would recognize it sorry ensign molly called cringing i hurried forward to grab at the struggling mollysand my hands went right through them right i was an observer here welcome sure but if i wanted to control what was going on i had to do it the hard way like corpsetaker was doing i turned to ensign molly and said dammit do something theres nothing i can do she said her eyes uncertain and full of sadness theyve been like that ever since they killed you i stared at molly and felt my mouth fall open time stopped the door the old wooden door the cabinet where molly had kept her suicide device i turned toward them my godmothers voice echoed in my head you are currently freed of the shackles of mortality your limited brain no longer impedes access to that record the only blocks to your memory are those you allow to be i remembered the door the cabinet i remembered the past sanya had insisted that they keep me on the backboard when they carried me into st mary of the angels after my apartment burned down the darkskinned knight of the cross carried me from his minivan and into the church alone toting the board and my couple of hundred pounds and change on one shoulder as if id been a big sack of doggy chow molly had gone ahead of him worried speaking rapidly to someone i wasnt sure whoone of the priests i guessed i hurt everywhere i could feel and in the places i couldnt feel i only wished i could hurt my body from the waist down had stopped talking to me altogether id fallen off a ladder while trying to get some of my elderly neighbors out of the burning building and landed on a stone planter landed bad and on my back ive gotten lucky occasionally this time i hadnt i knew what the fall the point of impact and the lack of sensation in my lower body meant id broken my back the red king had my daughter i was the only one who was going to do anything about it and id fallen and broken my back sanya carried me into the utility room that was mostly used for storageparticularly for storing a battered wizard and his friends when they needed the refuge the church offered there were a number of folding cots in the room stored for use sanya set me down rolled out a cot put some sheets on it and then placed me on the cot backboard and all might as well leave me on the floor i told him im lying on a board either way pffft sanya said his dark handsome face lighting up with a white grin i do not care to clean the floor after you leave someone else can do the sheets says you i said you smell like burning hair some of it was on fire he said cheerfully his eyes though were less jovial he put a hand on my chest and said you are badly hurt yeah you want a drink he asked one hand hovered near his jackets breast pocket where i knew he kept his flask pass maybe ill just cope instead he made another disgusted noise and produced said flask took a swig from it and winked at me i was never clear on the difference da molly appeared in the doorway and sanya looked at her hes on the way molly said her voice was strained her day hadnt been as bad as mine but she still looked shaken sanya offered molly a pull from the flask she shook her head very good the big russian said i will talk to forthill tell him what is happening sanya molly said putting a hand on his arm thank you he gave her a wide grin perhaps it was just a coincidence i arrived when i did molly rolled her eyes and gave him a faint shove toward the door it didnt move the big man but he went and molly flicked on a little lamp and shut the door behind him she walked over to me and took a couple of kfc wet wipes from her bag she knelt down next to the cot opened them and started cleaning my face i closed my eyes and said nothing my little girl was going to die my little girl was going to die and there was nothing i could do about it oh id been defeated before people had even died because i failed but those people had never been my own flesh and blood they hadnt been my child id lost i was beaten this was all over and it was all your fault harry if id been faster if id been smarter if id been strong enough of mind to make the hard choices to focus on saving maggie first and everyone else second but i hadnt been id been insufficient to the challenge and she was going to die because of it i broke right there i just broke the task given to me had been more than i could bear and what followed would be nothing but torturous regret id failed my own child my chest convulsed i made a sound and my eyes filled until i couldnt see molly sat beside me patiently cleaning my face and neck with her wipes i must have had soot on my face when i could see again there were large patches of grey and black on the wipes and my face felt cold and tingled slightly ive got to help her i said quietly harry dont dont twist the knife in your own wound molly replied right now you need to stay calm and quiet until butters can look at you i wish you hadnt gotten him involved i said i didnt even ask him she said i got halfway through the first sentence and he asked where you were then said hed come see you i shook my head no i mean i drew a deep breath kid ive got to cross a line molly froze one hand still extended im not getting up off this bed alone i said quietly its my only option you run in the circles i do you get more than a few offers of power it always comes with a price usually a hidden one but you get the offers id had more than a few chances to advance myself provided i was willing to set aside anything like integrity to do so i hadnt been not until today who molly asked simply my mouth twitched at one corner one is a lot like another i said she shook her head but but if you go over to one of them theyll make me into a monster i said quietly sooner or later she wouldnt look at me i cant let that happen i said for all i know i could turn into something that would hurt maggie myself but maybe i can use them to get her out of danger she inhaled sharply and looked up at me its got to be mab i said shes wicked smart but she isnt omniscient or infallible ive swindled faeries before i can do it again she inhaled sharply youre going to be the winter knight she shook her head what if she doesnt i mean what if she wont i let out a low chuckle oh shell do it if i go to her shell do it shes been after me long enough i dont understand molly said shell shell twist you change you its what they do i fumbled and put one of my hands on hers molls whatever happens im not going to make it out of this one she stared at me for a minute then she shook her head she shook her head and silent tears fell from her eyes molly i said again patting her hand kid for everything there is a season dont she said dont you dare quote the bible at me not to justify this bible i said i was quoting the byrds she burst out in a huffing sound that was both a laugh and sob look molls nothing lasts forever nothing and if ive got to choose between myself and my daughter thats not even a choice you know that she bowed her head and wept harder but i saw her nod just a little i need your help i said she looked up at me bloodshot eyes a mess im going to arrange things but mabs going to be wary of me she knows my history and if i know whats going on shell be able to tell im lying to her i dont have enough of a poker face for that no molly said sniffing and briskly swiping at her eyes you dont you still suck at lying boss to the people who know me maybe i said smiling do you understand what im asking you to do she bit her lip and said do you have you thought what its going to mean for me once once youre dead i said quietly i think ebenezar or injun joe will take over for me continue your training they both know how strongly i felt about sheltering you from the councils judgment she looked suddenly exhausted she shook her head slightly thats not what i meant oh i said molly had crushed on me since she was a teenager i hadnt really thought anything of it i mean it had been going on for years and and crushes probably didnt last for years did they they faded mollys feelings hadnt but i didnt reciprocate them i loved her to pieces but i was never going to be in love with her especially not if i was dead i guess if our positions had been reversed that might have been kind of hard for me to accept too i patted her hand again awkwardly and said im sorry that i wasnt here longer that it couldnt be more than it was you never did anything wrong by me harry she said she lifted her chin and met my eyes again this isnt about me though is it its about maggie she nodded and i saw steel enter her spine so of course ill help you i lifted her fingers to my mouth and put a gentle kiss on them youre one hell of a woman molly i said thank you she shivered then she said how do you want to do it bring me a phone i said need to make a call you stay out of it itll be better if you dont know okay she said then then you come back in here you put me to sleep you take the memory of this conversation and the phone call out of my head how she asked if i leave any obvious holes it could hurt youand it might be visible to something as powerful as mab i thought about it for a moment and said i nodded off in the van on the way here set it up so that i was never awake once i was here until i wake up after she thought about it and said it could work if i do it slowly enough it might not leave a ripple do it like that then she stood up she walked over to a battered old wooden cabinet on the wall and opened it among other things there was an old freestanding rotary phone inside it attached to a long extension cord a makeshift line that forthill had run through the drywall from the next room she brought the phone to me and set it carefully on my chest then she walked to the similarly battered old wooden door you realize she said that i could change this harry could find out who you were using to kill yourself i could take it right out of your head and call them off youd never know you could do that i said quietly and i feel like an utter bastard for asking this of you grasshopper but i dont have anyone else to ask you should call thomas she said he deserves the truth thomas my brother my family hed be one of little maggies only blood relations once i was gone and molly was right he did deserve the truth no i said barely louder than a whisper tell him later if you want after if you tell him before that he wont stand for it hell try to stop it and maybe hed be right to do it no i said quietly he wouldnt but hed do it anyway this is my choice molls she turned to go and paused youve never called me molls before today was saving it i said for when you werent my apprentice anymore wanted to try it out she smiled at me she shed one more tear then she left it took me a moment to gather myself then i dialed an international number on the rotary phone kincaid answered a flat voice its dresden i said the voice warmed very slightly harry whats up i took a deep breath you owe me a favor i said quietly for that thing with ivy on the island damn right he said im calling it in okay he said you want some backup on something i have a target for you there was a silence from the other end of the phone then he said tell me the new winter knight i said theres a new one theres going to be i said how do you more silence then he said its like that theres a good reason i said yeah theres a little girl more silence youll know its coming no i said i wont ill see to it okay he said when they were going to kill my daughter sometime before the next sunrise i figured it might take me some time to get her home assuming i didnt die trying anytime after noon tomorrow i said the sooner the better okay you can find me yeah be sure i said i pay my debts i sighed again yeah thanks he let out a soft chuckle thanking me he said thats new he hung up i did the same then i called for molly okay i said lets do this molly took the phone and put it back in the cabinet then she picked up a slender new white candle in a holder and a small box of matches she came over and set the candle on a folding table nearby where i could see it without moving my head she struck a match and lit it all right she said harry this has to be a smooth gentle job so focus on the candle i need you to still your mind so that i can work it felt odd letting the grasshopper take the leadbut i guess that was what id been training her to do i focused on the candle and began to quiet my thoughts good molly said quietly after a moment her voice soft velvet relax take a nice slow deep breath good listen to my voice and let me guide you another deep breath now and together with my accomplice i finished arranging my murder chapter fifty i surfaced from the memory shivering and looked around in confusion i was still in mollys mindscape on the cheesy bridge it was silent completely silent nothing moved the images on the screen and the various mollys were all frozen in place like mannequins everything that had been happening in the battle had been happening at the speed of thoughtlightning fast there was only one reason that everything here would be stopped still like this right in the middle of the action so much for that lineartime nonsense eh my voice came out sounding harsh and rough footsteps sounded behind me and the room began to grow brighter and brighter after a moment there was nothing but white light and i had to hold up a hand to shield my eyes against it then the light faded somewhat i lifted my eyes again and found myself in a featureless expanse of white i wasnt even sure what i was standing on or if i was standing on anything at all there was simply nothing but white and a young man with hair of dark gold that hung messily down over silver blue eyes his cheekbones could have sliced bread he wore jeans old boots a white shirt and a denim jacket and no youth born had ever been able to stand with such utter tranquil stillness as he youre used to linear time he said his voice was resonant deep mellow with the almost musical timbre you hear from radio personalities it was the easiest way to help you understand arent you a little short for an archangel i asked him uriel smiled at me it was the sort of expression that would make flowers spontaneously blossom and babies start to giggle appropriate i must confess to being more of a star wars fan than a star trek fan personally the simple division of good and evil the clarity of perfect right and perfect wrongits relaxing it makes me feel young i just stared at him for a moment and tried to gather my thoughts the memory now that i had it again was painfully vivid god that poor kid molly id never wanted to cause her pain shed been a willing accomplice and shed done it with her eyes openbut god i wished it hadnt had to happen to her she was hurting so much and now i could see whyand i could see why the madness she was feigning might be a great deal more genuine than she realized that had to have been why murphy distrusted her so strongly murph had excellent instincts for people she must have sensed something in molly sensed the pain and the desperation that drove her and it must have sent up a warning flag in murphys head which would have hurt molly badly to be faced with suspicion and distrust however polite karrin might have been about it that pain would in turn have driven her further away made her act stranger which would earn more suspicion in an agonizing cycle id never wanted that for her what had i done id saved maggiebut had i destroyed my apprentice in doing so the fact that id gotten myself killed had no relative bearing on the morality of my actions if i had you cant just walk around picking and choosing which lives to save and which to destroy the inherent arrogance and the underlying evil of such a thing runs too deep to be avoidedno matter how good your intentions might be i knew why molly had tried to get me to tell thomas shed known just as i had that thomas would try to stop me from killing myself regardless of my motivations but shed been right about something else too he was my brother hed deserved more than id given him that was why i hadnt thought of him not once since returning to chicago how could i possibly have remembered my brother without remembering the shame i felt at excluding him from my trust how could i think of thomas without thinking of the truth of what i had done normally i would never have believed that i was the sort of man who could make himself forget and overlook something rather than facing a harsh reality no matter how painful it might be i guess im not perfect the young man facing me waited patiently apparently giving me time to gather my thoughts saying nothing uriel i should have known from the outset uriel is the archangel who most people know little about most dont even know his nameand apparently he likes it that way if gabriel is an ambassador if michael is a general if rafael is a healer and spiritual champion then uriel is a spymasterheavens spook uriel covered all kinds of covert work for the almighty when mysterious angels showed up to wrestle with biblical patriarchs without revealing their identities when death was visited upon the firstborn of egypt when an angel was sent into cities of corruption to guide the innocent clear of inbound wrath uriels hand was at work he was the quietest of the archangels to my way of thinking that probably indicated that he was also the most dangerous hed taken notice of me a few years back and had bestowed a measure of power known as soulfire on me id done a job or three for him since then hed dropped by with annoying cryptic advice once in a while i sort of liked him but he was also aggravatingand scary in a way that i had never known before there was the sense of something hideously absolute about him something that would not yield or change even if the universe itself was unmade standing in his presence i always felt that i had somehow become so fragile that i might fly to dust if the archangel sneezed or accidentally twitched the wrong muscle which given the kind of power such a being possessed was probably more or less accurate all of this i asked waving a hand generally was to lead me there to that memory you had to understand i eyed him and said wearily epic fail because i have no idea what youre talking about uriel tilted back his head and laughed this is one of those things that was about the journey not the destination i shook my head you you lost me on the contrary harry you found yourself i eyed him then tore at my hair and said arrrgh cant you give me a straight answer is there some law of the universe that compels you to be so freaking mysterious several actually uriel said still clearly amused all designed for your protection but there are still some things i can tell you then tell me why i said why do all this why sucker me into going back to chicago why jack told you uriel said they cheated the scale had to be balanced i shook my head that office in chicago between it was yours one of them he said nodding i have a great deal of work to do i recruit those willing to help me what work i asked the same work as i ever have done uriel said i and my colleagues labor to ensure freedom freedom of what i asked of will of choice the distinction between good and evil is meaningless if one does not have the freedom to choose between them it is my duty my purpose in creation to protect and nourish that meaning i narrowed my eyes so if youre involved in my death i tilted my head at him its because someone forced me to do it uriel waggled a hand in a soso gesture and turned to pace a few steps away force implies another will overriding your own he said over his shoulder but there is more than one way for your will to be compromised i frowned at him then said with dawning comprehension lies the archangel turned his eyebrows lifted as though i were a somewhat dim student who had surprised his teacher with an insightful answer yes precisely when a lie is believed it compromises the freedom of your will so what i asked captain jack and the purgatory crew ride to the rescue every time someone tells a lie uriel laughed no of course not mortals are free to lie if they choose to do so if they could not they would not be free his eyes hardened but others are held to a higher standard their lies are far deadlier far more potent i dont understand i said imagine a being who was there when the first mortal drew the first breath uriel said hard angry flickers of light danced around us notable even against formless white one who has watched humanity rise from the dust to spread across and to change the very face of the world one who has seen quite literally tens of thousands of mortal lives begin wax wane and end someone like an angel i said quietly someone like that he said showing his teeth briefly a being who could know a mortals entire life could know his dreams his fears his very thoughts such a being so versed in human nature in mortal patterns of thought could reliably predict precisely how a given mortal would react to almost anything uriel gestured at me for example how he might react to a simple lie delivered at precisely the right moment uriel waved his hand and suddenly we were back in the utility room at st marys only i wasnt lying on the backboard on a cot or rather i was doing exactly thatbut i was also standing beside uriel at the door looking in at myself do you remember what you were thinking uriel asked me i did remember i remembered with perfect clarity in fact i thought that id been defeated before that people had even died because i failed but those people had never been my own flesh and blood they hadnt been my child id lost i was beaten i shook my head i remember saying to myself that it was all over and it was all your fault harry ah uriel said as i finished the last sentence and he lifted his hand now look i blinked at him and then at the image of me lying on the cot i dont i frowned there was something odd about the shadows in the room but here uriel said lifting a hand light shone from it as though from a sudden sunrise it revealed the room casting everything in stark reliefand i saw it a slender shadow crouched beside the cot vague and difficult to notice even by uriels lightbut it was there and it was leaning as though to whisper in my ear and it was all your fault harry the thought the memory resonated in my head for a moment and i shivered that that shadow its an angel it was once he said and his voice was gentleand infinitely sad a long long time ago one of the fallen i breathed yes who knew how to lie to you harry yeah well blaming myself for bad stuff isnt exactly um completely uncharacteristic for me man im awareas was that he said nodding at the shadow it made the lie even stronger to use your own practice against you but that creature knew what it was doing its all about timing at that precise moment in that exact state of mind the single whisper it passed into your thoughts was enough to push your decision uriel looked at me and smiled faintly it added enough anger enough selfrecrimination enough guilt and enough despair to your deliberations to make you decide that destroying yourself was the only option left to you it took your freedom away his eyes hardened again i attempt to discourage that sort of thing where possible when i cannot i am allowed to balance the scales i still dont understand i said how does me coming back to haunt chicago for a few nights balance anything oh it doesnt uriel said i can only act in a mirror of the offending action im afraid you just get to whisper in my ear to whisper seven words in fact he said what you did was elective elective i asked i had no direct involvement in your return in my judgment it needed to happenbut there was no requirement that you come back to chicago uriel said calmly you volunteered i rolled my eyes well yes duh because three of my friends were going to die if i didnt uriel arched an eyebrow at me abruptly then he reached into the pocket of his jacket and withdrew a cell phone he made it beep a couple of times then turned on the speakerphone and i heard a phone ringing murphy answered captain jacks baritone whats this dresden is telling me about three of his friends being hurt dresden jack said in an absent tone as if searching his memory and finding nothing uriel seemed mildly impatient he wasnt buying it tall thin insouciant and sent back to chicago to search for his killer oh right him jack said that guy yes uriel said there was a guileless pause and then jack said what about him uriel bless his angelic heart closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep calming breath collin he said in a reproving parental tone i might have mentioned something about it jack said sure guys got a lot of friends friends are running around fighting monsters i figure at least three of them are going to get hurt if he isnt there to back them up seemed reasonable collin uriel said his voice touched with an ocean of disappointment and a teaspoon of anger you lied i speculated captain jack replied i got him to do the right thing didnt i collin our purpose is to defend freedomnot to decide how it should be used everything i told him was technically true more or less and i got the job done jack said stubbornly look sir if i were perfect i wouldnt be working here in the first place now would i and then he hung up on speakerphone on a freaking archangel i couldnt help it i let out a rolling belly laugh i just got suckered into doing this by stars and stones you didnt even know that he big bad angel boy and you get the wool pulled over your eyes by i stopped trying to talk and just laughed uriel eyed the phone then me and then tucked the little device away again clearly nonplussed it doesnt matter how well i believe i know your kind harry they always manage to find some way to try my patience it took me a moment to get the laughter under control but i did look uri i dont want to say the archangel gave me a look so cold that my words froze in my throat harry blackstone copperfield dresden he said quietlyand he said it exactly right speaking my name in a voice of that same absolute power that had so unnerved me before do not attempt to familiarize my name the part you left off happens to be rather important to who and what i am do you understand i didnt but as he spoke i knewnot just suspected but knewthat this guy could obliterate me along with the planet i was standing on with a simple thought in fact if what id read about archangels was right uriel could probably take apart all the planets like all of them everywhere and i also knew that what i had just done had insulted him and and frightened him i swallowed it took me two tries but i managed to whisper arent we just mr sunshine today uriel blinked he looked less than certain for a moment then he said mr sunshine is perfectly acceptable i suppose i nodded sorry i said about your name i didnt realize it was so um intimate he said quietly sensitive names have tremendous power dresden yet mortals toss them left and right as though they were toys its like watching infants play with hand grenades sometimes the ghost of a smile touched his face as he glanced at me some more so than others and i forgive you of course i nodded at him then after a quiet moment i asked what happens now thats up to you uriel said you can always work for me i believe you would find it challenging to do soand i would have considerable use for someone of your talents for how long i asked i mean for guys like captain jack is it forever uriel smiled collin like the others is with me because he is not yet prepared to face what comes next when he is hell take that step for now he is not when you say what comes next what do you mean exactly the part involving words like forever eternity and judgment oh i said what comes next exactly so i can stay between i said quietly or i can go get on that train if you do uriel said his eyes intent and serious then you accept the consequences for all that you have done while alive when judged what you have done will be taken into account your fate ultimately will be determined by your actions in life youre saying that if i dont work for you ill just have to accept what comes i am saying that you cannot escape the consequences of your choices he said i frowned at him for a minute then i said if i get on the train it might just carry me straight to hell i cant talk to you about that he said what comes next is about faith harry not knowledge i folded my arms what if i dig the ghost routine you dont uriel replied but even if you did i would point out to you that your spiritual essence has been all but disintegrated you would not last long as a shade nor would you have the strength to aid and protect your loved ones should you lose your sanity you might even become a danger to thembut if that is your desire i can facilitate it i shook my head trying to think then i said it depends upon my friends i said quietly my family i have to know that theyre all right uriel watched me for a moment and then opened his mouth to speak shaking his head a little as he did stop i said pointing a finger at him dont you dare tell me to make this choice in the dark captain jack gave me a halftruth that sent me running around chicago again another angel told me a lie that got me killed if you really care so much about my free will youll be willing to help me make a free informed choice just as if i was a grownup so either admit that youre trying to push me in your own direction or else put your principles where your mouth is and make like the ghost of christmas present he stared at me for a long moment his brow furrowed from your perspective yes i suppose it does look that way then he nodded firmly and extended his arm toward me take my hand i did the white expanse gave way to reality once more suddenly i stood with uriel inside the corpsetakers hideout on the stairs where that final confrontation had come molly was at the top of the stairs leaning back against the wall her body was twisting and straining her chest heaving with desperate breaths blood ran from both nostrils and had filled the sclera of her eyes turning them into inhumanlooking blueandred stones she let out little gasps and choked screams along with whispered snatches of words that didnt make any sense uriel did that thing with his hand again and suddenly i could see molly even more clearlyand saw that some kind of hideous mass was wound around her like a python constricting its prey it consisted of strands of some kind of slimy jelly purple and black and covered with pulsing pustules that reeked of corruption and decay corpsetaker mollys duel with the corpsetaker was still under way butterss body lay at mollys feet empty of life and movement and his shadenow i could see that it was bound into near immobility by threads of the corpsetakers dark magicstood exactly as he had when i last saw him staring down at his own body in horror down here in the electricaljunction room murphy and the wolves were bound with threads of the same dark magic as buttersa sleeping spell that had compelled them all into insensibility molly whimpered drawing my gaze back to the top of the stairs as her legs gave way she slid slowly down the wall her eyes rolling wildly her mouth started moving more surely her voice becoming stronger and darker for about two seconds one of the corpsetakers hatefilled laughs rolled from mollys lips that hideous slimy mass began to simply ooze into the young womans skin do something i said to uriel he shook his head i cannot interfere this battle was mollys choice she knew the risks and chose to hazard them she isnt strong enough i snapped she cant take on that thing uriel arched an eyebrow were you under the impression that she did not know that from the beginning harry yet she did it because she feels guilty i said because she blames herself for my death shes in the same boat i was no uriel said none of the fallen twisted her path no that was me i said but only because one of them got to me nonetheless uriel said that choice was yoursand hers youre just going to stand there i asked uriel folded his arms and tapped his chin with one fingertip mmmm it does seem that perhaps she deserves some form of aid perhaps if id had the presence of mind to see to it that some sort of agent had been sent to balance the scales to give her that one tiny bit of encouragement that one flicker of inspiration that turned the tide he shook his head sadly things might be different now and as if on cue mortimer lindquist ectomancer limped out of the lower hallway and into the electricaljunction room with sir stuarts shade at his right hand mort took a look around his dark eyes intent and then his gaze locked onto molly hey he croaked you arrogant bitch ghost mollys eyes snapped fully open and flicked to mort they were filled with more bitter venomous hate than my apprentice could ever have put into them im not really into this whole hero thing mort said dont have the temperament for it dont know a lot about the villain side of the equation either he planted his feet facing the corpsetaker squarely his hands clenched into fists at his side but it seems to me you halfwit that you probably shouldnt have left a freaking ectomancer a pit full of wraiths to play with and with a howl more than a thousand wraiths came boiling around the corner in a cloud of clawing hands gnashing teeth and screaming hunger they rode on a wave of morts power and no longer drifted with lazy disconnected grace now they came forth like rushing storm clouds like racing wolves like hungry sharks a tide of mindless destruction i saw mollys eyes widen and the pulsing spiritual mass that was the corpsetaker began to pull away from the young woman my apprentice didnt let her molly let out a wheezing cackle and both hands formed into claws that clutched at the air i saw the energy of her own magic surround her fingers so that she grasped onto the corpsetakers essence as if it had been a nearly physical thing the necromancers spirit began to ooze through mollys grip the exhausted girl could only slow the corpsetaker down but it was enough the tide of wraiths slammed into the corpsetaker like a freight train their wails blending into a sound that i had heard before in the train tunnel where carmichael saved me the corpsetaker had begun to resume her usual form the instant she disengaged from molly and i could see the sudden shock and horror in her beautiful eyes as that spiritual tide overwhelmed her i saw her struggle uselessly as the wraith train carried her up the stairs and out into the night the train swept her straight up into the airand then reversed itself and slammed her down into the earth i saw her try to scream but all i heard was the blaring howl of the horn of a southbound train and then she was gone youre right uriel said his tone filled with a chill satisfaction someone needed to do something he glanced aside at me gave me a slight bow of his head and said welldone mort limped up the stairs to check on molly youre the one who called to me eh molly looked up at him obviously too exhausted to move more than her head harry well its sort of complicated to explain what was going on but he told me you could help guess he was right mort said where is he molly asked i mean his ghost mort glanced around and looked right at meright through me he shook his head not here molly closed her eyes and began to cry quietly i got her boss molly said quietly we got her and im still here still me thank you shes thanking me i said quietly for that and much more uriel said she still has her life her future her freedom you did save her you know the idea to have her call to mortimer in the closing moments of the psychic battle was inspired ive cost her too much i said quietly i believe that when you went after your daughter you said something about letting the world burn that you and your daughter would roast marshmallows i nodded bleakly it is one thing for you to say let the world burn it is another to say let molly burn the difference is all in the name yeah i croaked im starting to realize that too late to do any good but i get it uriel gave me a steady look and said nothing i shook my head get some rest kid i called though i knew she wouldnt hear me youve earned it the scene unfolded murphy and the wolves woke up less than a minute after the corpsetaker was shown to the door will and company changed back to their human forms while mort after a whispered tip from sir stuart rushed over to butterss fallen body he worked a subtle complex magic that made some of mine look pretty crude and drew butterss spirit from the disintegrating tangle of the corpsetakers spell and back down into his physical body it took several minutes and when butters woke up andi and marci both naked both rather pleasant that way were giving him cpr theyd kept his body alive in the absence of his soul wow butters slurred as he opened his eyes he looked back and forth between the two werewolf girls subtract the horrible pain in my chest this migraine and all the mold and mildew and im living the dream then he passed out the cops showed up a bit after that two of them were guys murphy knew the werewolves vanished into the night a couple of seconds before the blue bubbles of the cop cars showed up taking the illegal portions of murphys armament with them murphy and mort told them all about how mort had been abducted and tortured by the big hoods and if they didnt tell the whole story what they did tell was one hundred percent true molly and butters got handed off to emts along with several of the big hoods who had been knocked around and chewed up mort got some attention too though he refused to be taken to a hospital the rest of the big hoods got a pair of cuffs and a ride downtown boz was carted out like a tranquilized rhinoceros karrin and mort stood around outside as the uniforms sorted everything out and i walked over to stand close enough to hear them came back to help mort said it happens sometimes some people die feeling that something was incomplete i guess dresden thought that he hadnt done enough to make a difference around here mort shook his head as if the big goon didnt turn everything upside down whenever he showed up karrin smiled faintly and shook her head he always said you knew ghosts youre sure it was really him mort eyed her me and everyone else yeah karrin scowled and stared into the middle distance mort frowned and then his expression softened you didnt want it to be his ghost did you murphy shook her head slowly but said nothing you needed everyone to be wrong about it because if it really was his ghost mort said it means that he really is dead murphys face just crumpled her eyes overflowed and she bowed her head her body shook in silence mort chewed on his lip for a moment then glanced at the cops on the scene he didnt say anything else to murphy or try to touch herbut he did put himself between her and everyone else so that no one would see her crying damn i wished id been bright enough to see what kind of guy morty was while i was still alive i stood there watching karrin for a moment and then turned away it hurt too much to see her in pain when i couldnt reach out and touch her or make an offcolor joke or find some way to give her a creative insult or otherwise show her that i cared it didnt seem fair that i should get to say goodbye to her even if she couldnt hear it she hadnt gotten to say it to me so i didnt say anything i gave her a last look and then i walked away i went back over to uriel to find him conversing with sir stuart dont know sir stuart was saying im not not as right as i used to be sir theres more than enough left to rebuild on uriel said trust me the ruins of a spirit like sir stuarts are more substantial than most men ever manage to dredge up id be very pleased to have you working for me my descendant sir stuart said frowning over at morty uriel watched mort shielding karrins sorrow and said youve watched over him faithfully stuart and hes grown a great deal in the past few years i think hes going to be fine sir stuarts shade looked at mortimer and smiled undeniable pride in his features then he glanced at uriel and said i still get to fight aye uriel gave him a very sober look and said i think i can find you something sir stuart thought about it for a moment and then nodded aye sir aye ive been in this town too long a new billet is just what i need uriel looked past sir stuart to me and winked excellent he said and shook hands with sir stuart a man named carmichael will be in touch i lingered until everyone had vanished into the thick mist that still cloaked the earth it took less time than it usually did for these sorts of things no one had died no need to call in the lab guys the uniform cops closed the old metal door as best they could drew a big x over it with crimescene tape and seemed willing to ignore the hole that had been blasted in it theyre going to be all right you know uriel said quietly tonights injuries will not be lethal to any of them thank you i said for telling me that he nodded have you decided i shook my head show me my brother he arched an eyebrow at me then he shrugged and once again offered his hand we vanished from the night and appeared in a very expensively furnished apartment i recognized my brothers place at once it had changed a bit the brushed steel décor had been softened the old broadway musical posters had been replaced with paintings mostly pastoral landscapes that provided an interesting counterpoint of warmth to the original style of the place candles and other decorative pieces had filled in the rather spartan spaces i remembered adding still more warmth all in all the place looked a lot more like a home now a lot less like a dressed stage a couple of things were out of place there was a chair in the living room positioned in front of the large flatscreen highdefinition television set the size of a dining room table the chair was upholstered in brown leather and looked comfortable and it didnt match the rest of the room there were also food stains on it empty liquor bottles littered the side table next to it the door opened and my brother thomas walked in he might have been an inch under six feet tall though it was hard for me to tellhe had worn so many different kinds of fashionable shoes that his height was always changing subtly he had dark hair currently as long as my shortest finger and it was a mess not only was it messy it was simply messy instead of attractively messy and for thomas that was hideous he had a couple of weeks growth of beard not long enough to be an actual beard yet but too long to be a sexy shadow his cold grey eyes were sunken with dark rings beneath them he wore jeans and a tshirt with drink stains on it he hadnt even pretended to need a coat against the nights cold and breaking their easily maintained cover as human beings was something that the vampires of the white court simply did not do for gods sake he was barefoot hed just walked out like that apparently to the nearest liquor store my brother took a bottle of whiskeyexpensive whiskeyfrom a paper bag and let the bag fall to the floor then he sat down in the brown leather chair pointed a remote at the television and clicked it on he clicked buttons and it skipped through several channels he stopped clicking based apparently on his need to take a drink and stopped on some kind of sports channel where they were playing rugby then he simply sat slugged from the bottle and stared its hard for the halfborn uriel observed in a quiet neutral tone what did you call him i asked belligerently which probably wasnt really bright but thomas was my brother i didnt like the thought of anyone judging him the scions of mortals and immortals uriel said unperturbed halflings halfbloods halfborn the mortal road is difficult enough without adding a share of our burdens to it as well i grunted that skinwalker got hold of him a while back it broke something in him the naagloshii feel a need to prove that every creature they meet is as flawed and prone to darkness as they themselves proved to be uriel said it gives them some measure of false peace i think to lie to themselves like that you sound like you feel sorry for them i said my voice hard i feel sorry for all the pain they have and more so for all that they inflict on others your brother offers ample explanation for my feelings what that thing did to thomas how is that different from what the fallen did to me he didnt die as a result uriel said bluntly he still has choice he added in a softer voice what the naagloshii did to him was not your fault i know that i said not very passionately the door to the apartment opened and a young woman entered she was in her twenties and gorgeous her face and figure were appealing glowing with vitality and health and her hair was like white silk she wore a simple dress and a long coat and she slipped out of her shoes immediately upon entering justine paused at the door and stared steadily at thomas for a long moment did you eat anything today she asked thomas flicked the television to another channel and turned up the volume justine pressed her lips together then she walked with firm purposeful strides into the apartments back bedroom she came out again a moment later preceded by the click of her high heels she was dressed in red lace underthings that left just enough to the imagination and in the same shade of heels she looked like the cover of a victorias secret catalog and moved with a sort of subsurface instinctive sensuality that could make dead men stir with interest i had empirical evidence of the fact but i also knew that my brother couldnt touch her the touch of love or anyone who was truly beloved was anathema to the white court like holy water was for hollywood vampires thomas and justine had nearly killed themselves for the sake of saving the other and ever since then every time my brother touched her he came away with seconddegree burns if you dont feed soon youre going to lose control of the hunger she said thomas looked away from her he turned up the television she moved one long lovely leg and with the toe of her pump flicked off the main switch of the power strip the television was plugged into it turned off and the apartment was abruptly silent you think youre going to hurt my feelings if you take a lover even though ive given you my blessing you are irrational and at this point im not sure youre capable of thinking clearly about the consequences of your actions i dont need you telling me how to deal with the hunger thomas said in a low voice he looked at her and though he was at least a little angry there was an aching naked hunger in his gaze as his eyes traveled over her why are you torturing me like this because im tired of the way youve been torturing yourself since harry died she said quietly it wasnt your fault and it hurts too much to watch you do this every day he was on my boat thomas said if he hadnt been there hed have died somewhere else justine said firmly he made enemies thomas and he knew that you knew that i should have been with him thomas said i might have done something seen something and you might not have justine replied she shook her head no its time my love to stop indulging your guilt this way her lips quirked its just so very emo and i think weve had enough of that thomas blinked justine walked over to him i swear her walk would have been enough to try the chaste thoughts of a saint even uriel seemed to appreciate it with that same slow gentle sensuality she bent overitself quite a lovely sightand took the bottle from thomas then she walked back across the room and put it on a shelf love i am going to put an end to this hunger strike of yours tonight thomass eyes were growing paler by the heartbeat but he frowned love you know that i cant justine arched a dark eyebrow at him you cant he ground his teeth touch you have you the protection of being united with someone who loves you will burn meeven though i was the one who gave it to you thomas justine said you are a dear dear man but there is a way around that you know a rather straightforward method for removing the protection of having had sex with you my love a key slipped into the apartments door and another young woman entered she had darkshaded skin and there was an exotic reddish sheen to her straight black hair her dark chocolate eyes were huge and sultry and she wore a black trench coat and black heelsand it turned out when the trench coat fell to the floor that was the extent of her wardrobe this is mara justine said extending a hand and the girl crossed the room to slide her arms around justine justine gave maras lips an almost sisterly kiss and then turned to thomas her eyes smoldering now love im going to have herwithout deeply committed love perhaps but with considerable affection and healthy desire and after that youre going to be able to have me and you will and things will be much better my brothers eyes gleamed bright silver repeat justine murmured her lips caressing the words as necessary i felt my cheeks heat up and coughed then i turned to uriel and said under the circumstances the archangel looked amused at my discomfort yes i glanced at the girls who were kissing again and sighed yeah uh i think my brothers going to be fine then youre ready uriel asked i looked at him and smiled faintly i wondered when wed get around to that he said and once more extended his hand this time we appeared in front of a chicago home there were a couple of ancient oak trees in the yard the house was a white colonial number with a white picket fence out front and evidence of children in the form of several snowmen that were slowly sagging to their deaths in the warm evening air there were silent forms standing outside the house men in dark suits and long coats one stood beside the front door one stood at each corner of the house on the roof as calmly as if they hadnt had their feet planted on an icy surface inches from a potentially fatal fall two more stood at the corners of the property in the front yard and a couple of steps and a lean to one side showed me at least one more in the backyard at the back corner of the property more guardian angels i said michael carpenter has more than earned them uriel said his voice warm as has his family i looked sharply at uriel shes shes here forthill wanted to find the safest home in which he could possibly place your daughter dresden uriel said all in all i dont think he could have done much better i swallowed shes i mean shes cared for uriel said loved of course do you think michael and charity would do less for your child when you have so often saved their children i blinked some tears out of my eyes stupid eyes no no of course not i swallowed and tried to make my voice sound normal i want to see her this isnt a hostage negotiation dresden uriel murmured but he was smiling he walked up to the house and exchanged nods with the guardian angel at the door we passed through it ghost style though it wouldnt have been possible for actual ghosts the carpenters had a threshold more solid and extensive than the great wall of china i would not be in the least surprised if you could see it from space we walked through my friends silent sleeping house the carpenters were early to bed early to rise types inexplicable but i suppose nobodys perfect uriel led me upstairs past two more guardian angels and into one of the upstairs bedroomsone that had once upon a time been charitys sewing room and spare bedroom hapless wizards had been known to find rest there once in a while we went through the door and were greeted by a low warning rumble a great mound of shaggy fur lying beside the rooms single twin bed rose to its feet mouse i said and dropped to my knees i wept openly as my dog all but bounced at me he was obviously joyous and just as obviously trying to mute his delightbut his tail thumped loudly against everything in the room and puppyish sounds of pleasure came from his throat as he slobbered on my face giving me kisses i sank my fingers into his fur and found it warm and solid and real and i scratched him and hugged him and told him what a good dog he was uriel stood over us smiling down but said nothing missed you too boy i said just kind of stopping by to say goodbye mouses tail stopped wagging his big doggy eyes regarded me very seriously and then glanced at uriel what has begun must finish little brother uriel said your task here is not yet over mouse regarded the archangel for a moment and then huffed out a breath in a huge sigh and leaned against me i scratched him some more and hugged himand looked past him to where my daughter slept maggie dresden was a darkhaired darkeyed child which had been all but inevitable given her parents coloring her skin tone was a bit darker than mine which i thought looked healthier than my skin ever had i got kind of pasty what with all the time in my lab and reading and running around after dark her features were well perfect beautiful the first time id seen her in the flesh despite everything else that was going on at the time somewhere under the surface i had been shocked by how gorgeous she was she was the most beautiful child id ever seen like in the movies or anywhere but i guess maybe all parents see that when they look at their kids it isnt rational that doesnt make it any less true she slept with the boneless relaxation of the very young her arms carelessly thrown over her head she wore one of mollys old tshirts as pajamas it had an old worn ironon decal of rd on it with the caption beep beep de deep kerwooo under it i knelt down by her stroking mouses fur but when i tried to touch her hand mine passed through hers immaterial i leaned my head against mouses big solid skull and sighed shell have a good life here i said quietly people who care about her who love kids yes uriel said mouses tail thumped several more times yeah buddy and shell have you i glanced up at uriel for how long i mean most dogs temple dogs have been known to live for centuries he replied your friend is more than capable of protecting her for a lifetimeeven a wizards lifetime if need be that made me feel a little better i knew what it was like to grow up without my birth parents around and what a terrible loss it was not to have that sense of secure continuation most of the other kids around me had maggie had lost her foster parents and then her birth mother and then her biological father she had another foster home nowbut she would always have mouse hell i said to mouse for all i know youll be smarter than i would have been about dealing with her anyway mouse snorted grinning a doggy grin he couldnt speak but i could effortlessly imagine his responseof course hed be smarter than i was that particular bar hadnt been set very high take care of her buddy i said to mouse and gave his shoulders a couple of firm pats with my fists i know youll take good care of her mouse sat up away from me his expression attentive and serious and then very deliberately offered me his paw i shook hands with him gravely and then rose to face the archangel all right i said quietly im ready chapter fiftyone uriel extended his hand again and i took it the carpenters house faded from around us and we reappeared in the world of empty white light there was one difference this time two glass doors stood in front of us one of them led to an office buildingin fact i recognized it as the interior of captain jacks department in chicago between i saw carmichael go by the door consulting a notepad and fishing in his pocket for his car keys the other door led only to darkness that was the uncertain future it was what came next i can hardly remember the last time i spent this much time with one particular mortal uriel said thoughtfully i wish i had time to do it more often i looked at him for a long moment and said i dont understand he laughed it was a sound that seethed with warmth and life i found myself smiling and joined him i dont understand what your game is in all of this game i shrugged your people conned me into taking a pretty horrible risk with my soul i guess if thats what you call this i waved a hand and youve got plausible deniabilityi know i knowor maybe you really are sincere and captain murphy threw a curveball past all of us either way it doesnt make sense why not uriel asked because it doesnt have anything to do with balancing the scales of one of the fallen lying to me i said you havent done any fortunecookie whispers into my head have you no he said not yet well thats what i mean i said the scale still isnt balanced and i dont think you send people back just for kicks uriel regarded me pleasantly he said nothing so you did it for a reason something you couldnt have gotten with your seven whispered words perhaps it was to balance the situation with molly he said i snorted yeah i bet all the time you go around solving your problems one by one in neat little rows i bet you never ever try to hit two birds with one stone uriel regarded me pleasantly he said nothing im headed for the great beyond and you still wont give me a straight answer i demanded smiling uriel regarded me pleasantly he said nothing a lot i laughed again tell you what big guy just tell me something something useful ill be happy with whatever i get he pursed his lips and thought about it for a moment then he said no matter where you go there you are i blinked goodness i said buckaroo banzai confucius he said wow how very fortune cookie of you i gave him a half smile and offered him my hand but despite your cryptic ways im sure of one thing now that i wasnt before oh souls i said i mean you always wonder if theyre real even if you believe in them you still have to wonder is my existence just this body is there really something more do i really have a soul uriels smile blossomed again youve got it backward harry he said you are a soul you have a body i blinked at that it was something to think about mr sunshine it has been a dubious and confusing pleasure harry he said shaking my hand i feel the same way i released his hand nodded and squared my shoulders then moving briskly lest my resolve waver i opened the black door and stepped through given the way my life has typically progressed i probably should have guessed that what came next was pain a whole lot of pain i tried to take a breath and a searing burst of agony radiated out from my chest i held off on the next breath for as long as i could but eventually i couldnt put it off anymore and again fire spread across my chest i repeated that cycle for several moments my entire reality consumed by the simple struggle to breathe and to avoid the pain i was on the losing side of things and if the pain didnt exactly lessen it did eventually become more bearable good whispered a dry rasping voice very good i felt the rest of my body next i was lying on something cool and contoured it wasnt precisely comfortable but it wasnt a torment either i clenched my fingers but something was wrong with them they barely moved it was as though someone had replaced my bones and flesh with lead weights heavy and inert and my tendons and muscles were too weak to break the inertia but i felt cool damp earth crumbling beneath my fingertips doesnt seem to bode well i mumbled my tongue didnt work right my lips didnt either the words came out a slushy mumble excellent rasped the voice i told you he had strength enough my thoughts resonated abruptly with another voice one that had no point of contact with my ears we will see what had my godmother said at my grave that it was all about respect and and proxies the eyes rasped the voice open your eyes mortal my eyelids were in the same condition as everything else they didnt want to move but i made them i realized that they felt cooler than the rest of my skin as if someone had recently wiped them with a damp washcloth i opened them and cried out weakly at the intensity of the light i waited for a moment then tried again then again on the four or five hundredth try i was finally able to see i was in a cave lit by wan onioncolored light i could see a roof of rock and earth with roots of trees as thick as my waist trailing through here and there water dripped down from overhead all around me i could hear it some dropped onto my lips and i licked at it it tasted sweet sweeter than doublethick cherry syrup and i shivered in pleasure this time i was starving i looked around me slowly it made my head feel like it was about to fly apart every time i twitched it but i persevered i was so far as i could tell naked i was lying on fine soft earth that had somehow been contoured to the shape of my body there were pine needlessoft onesspread about beneath me in lieu of a blanket their scent sharp and fresh there was a dull throb coming from my arms and i looked down to see there were roots or vines or something growing into me they wrapped around my wrists and penetrated the skin there structures that were plantlike but pale and spongylooking i could barely make out some kind of fluid flowing through the tendrils and presumably into my body i wanted to scream and thrash my arms but it just seemed like too much work a moment later my leaden thoughts notified me that the vines looked something like an intravenous fluid line an iv what the hell kind of hell was this supposed to be i realized that something rounded and unyielding was supporting my head i twitched and moved myself enough to look up and realized that my head was being held in someones lap ah whispered the voice now you begin to understand i looked up still farther and found myself staring into the face of mab queen of air and darkness the veritable mother of wicked faeries herself mab looked not cadaverous it wasnt a word that applied her skin seemed stretched tight over her bones her face distorted to inhuman proportions her emerald green eyes were inhumanly huge in that sunken face her teeth unnaturally sharp she brushed a hand over one of my cheeks and her fingers looked too long her nails grown out like claws her arms looked like nothing but bone and sinew with skin stretched over them and her elbows were somehow too large too swollen to look even remotely human mab didnt look like a cadaver she looked like some kind of nearly starved insect a praying mantis smiling down at its first meal in weeks oh i said and if my speech was halting at least it sounded almost human that kind of hell mab tilted back her head and cackled it was a dull brittle sound like the edge of a rusted knife no she said alas no my knight no you have not escaped i have far too much work for your hand to allow that not yet i stared at her dully which was probably the only way i was capable of staring at the moment then i croaked im alive her smile widened even more and well my dear knight i grunted it was all the enthusiasm i could summon yay it makes me feel like singing mabs voice grated from between sharp teeth welcome back o my knight to the green lands of the living enough said that enormous thoughtvoice the same one from the graveyard but less mind annihilating the foolish gamble is concluded his physical needs must be met i know what i am doing mab purred or it would have been a purr if cats had been made from steel wool fear not ancient thing your custodian lives i turned my head slowly the other way after a subjective century i was able to see the other figure in the cave it was enormous a being that had to crouch not to bump its head on the ceiling it was more or less human in formbut i could see little of that form it was almost entirely concealed in a vast cloak of dark green with shadows hiding whatever lay beneath it the cloaks hood covered its head but i could see tiny green fires like small flickering clouds of fireflies burning within the hoods shadowed depth demonreach the genius loci of the intensely weird unmapped island in the middle of lake michigan wed sort of had an arrangement made a couple of years back and i was beginning to think that maybe i hadnt fully understood the extent of that arrangement im on the island i rasped you are here long have this old thing and i labored to keep your form alive my knight mab said long have we kept flesh and bone and blood knit together and stirring waiting for your spirits return mab gave you breath here provided nourishment the parasite maintained the flow of blood parasite what id already had a really really long day but i got shot i mumbled my knight mab hissed the statement one of possession your broken body fell from your ship into cold and darknessand they are my domain the cold queen brought you to here demonreach emitted my head was starting to ache hearing his psychic voice your phsyical vessel was preserved and now here you are mab murmured oh the quiet one angered us sending your essence out unprotected had he been incorrect i would have been robbed of my knight and the old monster of his custodian our interests coincided i blinked slowly and again my lagging brain started catching up to me mab had me i hadnt escaped her i hadnt escaped what she could make me become oh god and all the people whod gotten hurt helping me theyd done it for nothing told me i was dead i muttered dead is a grey word mab hissed mortals fear it and so they wish it to be blackand they have but few words to contain its reality it escapes from such constraints death is a spectrum not a line and you my knight had not yet vanished into the utter darkness i licked at my lips again guess youre kind of upset with me you attempted to cheat the queen of air and darkness mab hissed you practiced a vile wicked deception upon me my knight her inhuman eyes glittered i expected no less of you were you not strong enough to cast such defiance into my teeth you would be useless to my purposes her smile widened to our purposes now the very ground seemed to quiver to let out an unthinkably low deep angry growl mabs eyes snapped to demonreach i have his oath ancient one what he has given is mine by right and you may not gainsay it he is mine to shape as i please dammit i said tiredly dammit and a voicea very calm very gentle very rational voice whispered in my ear lies mab cannot change who you are i struggled and twitched my fingers five i muttered six seven heh i couldnt help it i laughed again it hurt like hell and it felt wonderful heh heh mab had gone very still she stared at me with wide eyes her alien face void of expression no i said then weakly no maybe im your knight but im not yours emerald fire flickered in her eyes cold and angry what you cant make me your monster i slurred doesnt work and you know it mabs eyes grew colder more distant oh you can make me do things i said you can mess with my head but all that makes me is a thug the effort of so many words cost me i had to take a moment to rest before i continued you wanted a thug you get that from anywhere lloyd slate was a thug plenty where he came from demonreachs burning eyes flickered and a sense of something like cold satisfaction came from the cloaked giant said it yourself need someone like me i met mabs eyes with mine and curled my upper lip into a sneer go on try to change me the second you do the second i think youve played with my head or altered my memory the first time you compel me to do something ill do the one thing you cant have in your new knight i lifted my head a little and i knew that i must have looked a little crazy as i spoke ill do it ill follow your command and i will do nothing else ill make every task you command one you must personally oversee ill have the initiative of a garden statue and do you know what that will give you my queen her eyes burned what i felt my own smile widen a mediocre knight i said and mediocrity my queen is a terrible terrible fate her voice came forth from lips so cold that frost began forming on them the next drop of water to fall on me thumped gently a tiny piece of sleet do you think i cannot punish you for such defiance do you think i cannot visit such horrors upon those you love as to create legends that last a thousand years i didnt flinch i think youve got too much on your plate already i spat back i think you dont have the time or the energy to spare to fight your own knight anymore i think you need me or you wouldnt have gone to all the trouble of keeping me alive for this long of taxing your strength this much to get it done you need me or else why are you here in chicago in may again the inhuman eyes raked at mine but when she spoke her voice was very very soft and far more terrible than a moment before i am not some mortal merchant to be bargained with i am not some petty president to be argued with i am mab you are mab i said and i owe you a debt for preserving my life for giving me the power i needed to save my daughters life dont think that i have forgotten that the faeries expression finally changed she frowned and tilted her head slightly as if puzzled then why this defiance when you know i will take vengeance for it because my soul is my own i said quietly you cannot steal it from me you cannot change it you cannot buy it i am mine mab i have fought long and hard against horrors even you would respect i have been beaten but i have not yielded im not going to start yielding now if i did i wouldnt be the weapon you need her eyes narrowed i will be the winter knight i told her i will be the most terrifying knight the sidhe courts have ever known i will send your enemies down in defeat and make your power grow i smiled again but i do it my way on my terms when you give me the task ill decide how it gets doneand youll stay out of the way and let me work and thats how its going to be after a long silent moment she said you dare give commands to me mortal i cant control you i said i know that but i can control me and ive just told you the only way you get what you want out of me i shrugged a little up to you my queen but think about whether you want another thug to command or an ally to respect otherwise you might as well start cutting on me right here right now and get yourself somebody with less backbone the queen of air and darkness stared down at me for silent moments then she said you will never be my ally not in your heart probably not i said but i can follow the example of my godmother i can be a trusted enemy i can work with you mabs pale white eyebrows lifted and her eyes gleamed i will never trust you wizard and then she rose abruptly and let my head fall back to the earth she walked away her silken gown hanging limply upon her insectthin frame prepare yourself demonreach stirred the pale tendrils and roots began withdrawing themselves from my arms leaving small bleeding holes behind for what i asked for the journey to my court sir knight she paused and looked over one shoulder at me green eyes bright and cold there is much work to do be done click here for more books by this author authors note when i was seven years old i got a bad case of
