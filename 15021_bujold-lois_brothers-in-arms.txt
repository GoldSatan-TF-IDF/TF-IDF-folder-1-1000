lois mcmaster bujold brothers in arms chapter one his combat drop shuttle crouched still and silent in the repairs docking baymalevolent to miless jaundiced eye its metal and fibreplas surface was scarred pitted and burned it had seemed such a proud gleaming efficient vessel when it was new perhaps it had undergone psychotic personality change from its traumas it had been new such a short few months ago miles rubbed his face wearily and blew out his breath if there was any incipient psychosis floating around here it wasnt contained in the machinery in the eye of the beholder indeed he took his booted foot off the bench hed been draped over and straightened up at least to the degree his crooked spine permitted commander quinn alert to his every move fell in behind him there miles limped down the length of the fuselage and pointed to the shuttles portside lock is the design defect im chiefly concerned about he motioned the sales engineer from kaymer orbital shipyards closer the ramp from this lock extends and retracts automatically with a manual overridefine so far but its recessed slot is inside the hatch which means that if for any reason the ramp gets hung up the door cant be sealed the consequences of which i trust you can imagine miles didnt have to imagine them they had burned in his memory for the last three months instant replay without an off switch did you find this out the hard way at dagoola iv admiral naismith the engineer inquired in a tone of genuine interest yeah we lost personnel i was damn near one of them i see said the engineer respectfully but his brows quirked how dare you be amused fortunately for his health the engineer did not smile a thin man of slightly above average height he reached up the side of the shuttle to run his hands along the slot in question pull himself up chinup fashion peer about and mutter notes into his recorder miles resisted an urge to jump up and down like a frog and try to see what he was looking at undignified with his own eyelevel even with the engineers chest miles would need about a onemeter stepladder even to reach the ramp slot on tiptoe and he was too damn tired for calisthenics just now nor was he about to ask elli quinn to give him a boost he jerked his chin up in the old involuntary nervous tic and waited in a posture of parade rest appropriate to his uniform his hands clasped behind his back the engineer dropped back to the docking bay deck with a thump yes admiral i think kaymer can take care of this for you all right how many of these drop shuttles did you say you had twelve fourteen minus two equalled twelve except in dendarii free mercenary fleet mathematics where fourteen minus two shuttles equalled two hundred and seven dead stop that miles told the calculating jeerer in the back of his head firmly it does no one any good now twelve the engineer made a note what else he eyed the battered shuttle my own engineering department will be handling the minor repairs now that it looks like well actually be holding still in one place for a while i wanted to see to this ramp problem personally but my second in command commodore jesek is chief engineer for my fleet and he wants to talk to your jump tech people about recalibrating some of our necklin rods i have a jump pilot with a head wound but jumpset implant microneurosurgery is not one of kaymers specialties i understand nor weapons systems no indeed the engineer agreed hastily he touched a burn on the shuttles scarred surface perhaps fascinated by the violence it silently witnessed for he added kaymer orbital mainly services merchant vessels a mercenary fleet is something a bit unusual in this part of the wormhole nexus why did you come to us you were the lowest bidder ohnot kaymer corporation earth i was wondering why you came to earth were rather off the main trade routes except for the tourists and historians er peaceful he wonders if we have a contract here miles realized here on a planet of nine billion souls whose combined military forces would make pocket change of the dendariis five thousandright he thinks im out to make trouble on old mother earth or that id break security and tell him even if i was peaceful precisely miles said smoothly the dendarii are in need of rest and refitting a peaceful planet off the main nexus channels is just what the doctor ordered he cringed inwardly thinking of the doctor bill pending it hadnt been dagoola the rescue operation had been a tactical triumph a military miracle almost his own staff had assured him of this over and over so perhaps he could begin to believe it true the breakout on dagoola iv had been the third largest prisonerofwar escape in history commodore tung said military history being tungs obsessive hobby he ought to know the dendarii had snatched over ten thousand captured soldiers an entire pow camp from under the nose of the cetagandan empire and made them into the nucleus of a new guerrilla army on a planet the cetagandans had formerly counted on as an easy conquest the costs had been so small compared to the spectacular resultsexcept for the individuals whod paid for the triumph with their lives for whom the price was something infinite divided by zero it had been dagoolas aftermath that had cost the dendarii too much the infuriated cetagandans vengeful pursuit they had followed with ships till the dendarii had slipped through political jurisdictions that cetagandan military vessels could not traverse hunted on with secret assassination and sabotage teams thereafter miles trusted they had outrun the assassination teams at last did you take all this fire at dagoola iv the engineer went on still intrigued by the shuttle dagoola was a covert operation miles said stiffly we dont discuss it it made a big splash in the news a few months back the earthman assured him my head hurts miles pressed his palm to his forehead crossed his arms and rested his chin in his hand twitching a smile at the engineer wonderful he muttered commander quinn winced is it true the cetagandans have put a price on your life the engineer asked cheerfully miles sighed yes oh said the engineer ah id thought that was just a story he moved away just slightly as if embarrassed or as if the air of morbid violence clinging to the mercenary were a contagion that could somehow rub off on him if he got too close he just might be right he cleared his throat now about the payment schedule for the design modificationswhat had you in mind cash on delivery said miles promptly acceptance to follow my engineering staffs inspection and approval of the completed work those were the terms of your bid i believe ahyes hm the earthman tore his attention away from the machinery itself miles felt he could see him switching from technical to business mode those are the terms we normally offer our established corporate customers the dendarii free mercenary fleet is an established corporation registered out of jacksons whole mm yes buthow shall i put thisthe most exotic risk our normal customers usually run is bankruptcy for which we have assorted legal protections your mercenary fleet is um hes wondering how to collect payment from a corpse miles thought a lot riskier the engineer finished candidly he shrugged an apology an honest man at least we shall not raise our recorded bid but im afraid were going to have to ask for payment up front as long as were down to trading insults but that gives us no protection against shoddy workmanship said miles you can sue remarked the engineer just like anybody else i can blow your miless fingers drummed against his trouser seam where no holster was tied earth old earth old civilized earth commander quinn at his shoulder touched his elbow in a fleeting gesture of restraint he shot her a brief reassuring smileno he was not about to let himself get carried away by theexoticpossibilities of admiral miles naismith commanding dendarii free mercenary fleet he was merely tired his smile said a slight widening of her brilliant brown eyes replied bullshit sir but that was another argument which they would not continue here out loud in public you can look said the engineer neutrally for a better offer if you wish we have looked said miles shortly as you well know right um what about half up front and half on delivery the earthman frowned shook his head kaymer does not pad its estimates admiral naismith and our cost overruns are among the lowest in the business thats a point of pride the term cost overrun made miless teeth hurt in light of dagoola how much did these people really know about dagoola anyway if youre truly worried about our workmanship the monies could be placed in an escrow account in the control of a neutral third party such as a bank until you accept delivery not a very satisfactory compromise from kaymers point of view butthats as far as i can go a neutral third earther party thought miles if he hadnt checked up on kaymers workmanship he wouldnt be here it was his own cash flow miles was thinking about which was definitely not kaymers business you having cash flow problems admiral inquired the earther with interest miles fancied he could see the price rising in his eyes not at all miles lied blandly rumors afloat about the dendariis liquidity difficulties could sabotage a lot more than just this repair deal very well cash up front to be held in escrow if he wasnt to have the use of his funds neither should kaymer beside him elli quinn drew air in through her teeth the earther engineer and the mercenary leader shook hands solemnly following the sales engineer back toward his own office miles paused a moment by a viewport that framed a fine view of earth from orbit the engineer smiled and waited politely even proudly watching his gaze earth old romantic historic earth the big blue marble itself miles had always expected to travel here someday although not surely under these conditions earth was still the largest richest most varied and populous planet in scattered humanitys entire wormhole nexus of explored space its dearth of good exit points in solar local space and governmental disunity left it militarily and strategically minor from the greater galactic point of view but earth still reigned if it did not rule culturally supreme more warscarred than barrayar as technically advanced as beta colony the endpoint of all pilgrimages both religious and secularin light of which major embassies from every world that could afford one were collected here including miles reflected nibbling gently on the side of his index finger the cetagandan admiral naismith must use all means to avoid them sir elli quinn interrupted his meditations he smiled briefly up at her sculptured face the most beautiful his money had been able to buy after the plasma burn and yet thanks to the genius of the surgeons still unmistakably elli would that every combat casualty taken in his service could be so redeemed commodore tung is on the comconsole for you she went on his smile sagged what now he abandoned the view and marched off after her to take over the sales engineers office with a polite relentless will you excuse us please his eurasian third officers bland broad face formed above the vid plate yes ky ky tung already out of uniform and into civilian gear gave him a brief nod in lieu of a salute ive just finished making arrangements at the rehab center for our nine severelywounded prognoses are good for the most part and they think they will be able to retrieve four of the eight frozen dead maybe five if theyre lucky the surgeons here even think theyll be able to repair demmis jumpset once the neural tissue itself has healed for a price of course tung named the price in gsa federal credits miles mentally converted it to barrayaran imperial marks and made a small squeaking noise tung grinned dry appreciation yeah unless you want to give up on that repair its equal to all the rest put together miles shook his head grimacing there are a number of people in the universe id be willing to doublecross but my own wounded arent among em thank you said tung i agree now im just about ready to leave this place last thing i have to do is sign a chit taking personal responsibility for the bill are you quite sure youre going to be able to collect the pay owed us for the dagoola operation here im on my way to do that next miles promised go ahead and sign ill make it right very good sir said tung am i released for my home leave after that tung the earth man the only earther miles had ever metwhich probably accounted for the unconscious favorable feelings he had about this place miles reflected how much time off do we owe you by now ky about a year and a half with pay alas a small voice added in his mind and was suppressed as unworthy you can take all you want thank you tungs face softened i just talked to my daughter i have a brandnew grandson congratulations said miles your first yes go on then if anything comes up well take care of it youre only indispensable in combat eh uh where will you be my sisters home brazil i have about four hundred cousins there brazil right all right where the devil was brazil have a good time i shall tungs departing semisalute was distinctly breezy his face faded from the vid damn miles sighed im sorry to lose him even to a leave well he deserves it elli leaned over the back of his comconsole chair her breath barely stirred his dark hair his dark thoughts may i suggest miles that hes not the only senior officer who could use some time off even you need to dump stress sometimes and you were wounded too wounded tension clamped miless jaw oh the bones broken bones dont count ive had the damn brittle bones all my life i just have to learn to resist the temptation to play field officer the place for my ass is in a nice padded tacticsroom chair not on the line if id known in advance that dagoola was going to get sophysical id have sent somebody else in as the fake pow anyway there you are i had my leave in sickbay and then spent a month wandering around like a cryocorpse whod been warmed up in the microwave when you walked into a room it was like a visit from the undead i ran the dagoola rig on pure hysteria you cant be up that long and not pay for it after with a little down at least i cant my impression was there was more to it than that he whirled the chair around to face her with a snarl will you back off yes we lost some good people i dont like losing good people i cry real tearsin private if you dont mind she recoiled her face falling he softened his voice deeply ashamed of his outburst sorry elli i know ive been edgy the death of that poor pow who fell from the shuttle shook me more than more than i should have let it i cant seem to i was out of line sir the sir was like a needle through some voodoo doll she held of him miles winced not at all why why why of all the idiotic things hed done as admiral naismith had he ever established as explicit policy not to seek physical intimacy with anyone in his own organization it had seemed like a good idea at the time tung had approved tung was a grandfather for gods sake his gonads had probably withered years ago miles remembered how he had deflected the first pass elli had ever made at him a good officer doesnt go shopping in the company store hed explained gently why hadnt she belted him in the jaw for that fatuousness she had absorbed the unintended insult without comment and never tried again had she ever realized hed meant that to apply to himself not her when he was with the fleet for extended periods he usually tried to send her on detached duties from which she invariably returned with superb results she had headed the advance team to earth and had kaymer and most of their other suppliers all lined up by the time the dendarii fleet made orbit a good officer after tung probably his best what would he not give to dive into that lithe body and lose himself now too late hed lost his option her velvet mouth crimped quizzically she gave him asisterly perhapsshrug i wont hassle you about it any more but at least think about it i dont think ive ever seen a human being who needed to get laid worse than you do now oh god what a straight linewhat did those words really mean his chest tightened comradely comment or invitation if mere comment and he mistook it for invitation would she think he was leaning on her for sexual favors if the reverse would she be insulted again and not breathe on him for years to come he grinned in panic paid he blurted what i need right now is paid not laid after thatafter that um maybe we could go see some of the sights it seems practically criminal to come all this way and not see any of old earth even if it was by accident im supposed to have a bodyguard at all times downside anyway we could double up she was sighing straightening up yes duty first of course yes duty first and his next duty was to report in to admiral naismiths employers after that all his troubles would be vastly simplified miles wished he could have changed to civilian clothes before embarking on this expedition his crisp greyandwhite dendarii admirals uniform was conspicuous as hell in this shopping arcade or at least made elli changethey could have pretended to be a soldier on leave and his girlfriend but his civilian gear had been stashed in a crate several planets backwould he ever retrieve it the clothes had been tailormade and expensive not so much as a mark of status as pure necessity usually he could forget the peculiarities of his bodyoversized head exaggerated by a short neck set on a twisted spine all squashed down to a height of fourfootnine the legacy of a congenital accidentbut nothing highlighted his defects in his own mind more sharply than trying to borrow clothes from someone of normal size and shape you sure its the uniform that feels conspicuous boy he thought to himself or are you playing fooliefoolie games with your head again stop it he returned his attention to his surroundings the spaceport city of london a jigsaw of nearly two millennia of clashing architectural styles was a fascination the sunlight falling through the arcades patterned glass arch was an astonishing rich color breathtaking it alone might have led him to guess his eye had been returned to its ancestral planet perhaps later hed have a chance to visit more historical sites such as a submarine tour of lake los angeles or new york behind the great dykes elli made another nervous circuit of the bench beneath the lightclock scanning the crowd this seemed a most unlikely spot for cetagandan hit squads to pop up but still he was glad of her alertness that allowed him to be tired you can come look for assassins under my bed anytime love in a way im glad we ended up here he remarked to her this might prove an excellent opportunity for admiral naismith to disappear up his own existence for a while take the heat off the dendarii the cetagandans are a lot like the barrayarans really they take a very personal view of command youre pretty damn casual about it early conditioning total strangers trying to kill me make me feel right at home a thought struck him with a certain macabre cheer you know this is the first time anybody has tried to kill me for myself and not because of who im related to have i ever told you about what my grandfather really did when i was she cut off his babble with a lift of her chin i think this is it he followed her gaze he was tired shed spotted their contact before he had the man coming toward them with the inquiring look on his face wore stylish earther clothes but his hair was clipped in a barrayaran military burr a noncom perhaps officers favored a slightly less severe roman patrician style i need a haircut thought miles his collar suddenly ticklish my lord said the man sergeant barth said miles the man nodded glanced at elli who is this my bodyguard ah so slight a compression of the lips and widening of the eyes to convey so much amusement and contempt miles could feel the muscles coil in his neck she is outstanding at her job im sure sir come this way please he turned and led off the bland face was laughing at him he could feel it tell by looking at the back of the head elli aware only of the sudden increase of tension in the air gave him a look of dismay its all right he thought at her tucking her hand in his arm they strolled after their guide through a shop down a lift tube and then some stairs then picked up the pace the underground utility level was a maze of tunnels conduits and power optics they traversed miles guessed a couple of blocks their guide opened a door with a palmlock another short tunnel led to another door this one had a live human guard by it extremely neat in barrayaran imperial dress greens who scrambled up from his comconsole seat where he monitored scanners to barely resist saluting their civilianclothed guide we dump our weapons here miles told elli all of them i mean really all elli raised her brows at the sudden shift of miless accent from the flat betan twang of admiral naismith to the warm gutturals of his native barrayar she seldom heard his barrayaran voice at thatwhich one would seem puton to her there was no doubt which one would seem a puton to the embassy personnel though and miles cleared his throat to be sure of fully disciplining his voice to the new order miless contributions to the pile on the guards console were a pocket stunner and a long steel knife in a lizardskin sheath the guard scanned the knife popped the silver cap off the end of its jewelled hilt to reveal a patterned seal and handed it back carefully to miles their guide raised his brows at the miniaturized technical arsenal elli unloaded so there miles thought to him stuff that up your regulation nose he followed on feeling rather more serene up a lift tube and suddenly the ambience changed to a hushed plush understated dignity the barrayaran imperial embassy miles whispered to elli the ambassadors wife must have taste miles thought but the building had a strange hermeticallysealed flavor to it redolent to miless experienced nose as paranoid security in action ah yes a planets embassy is that planets soil feels just like home their guide led them down another lift tube into what was clearly an office corridormiles spotted the sensor scanners in a carved arch as they passedthen through two sets of automatic doors into a small quiet office lieutenant lord miles vorkosigan sir their guide announced standing at attention andbodyguard miless hands twitched only a barrayaran could convey such a delicate shade of insult in a halfsecond pause between two words home again thank you sergeant dismissed said the captain behind the comconsole desk imperial dress greens againthe embassy must maintain a formal tone miles gazed curiously at the man who was to be will or nill his new commanding officer the captain gazed back with equal intensity an arrestinglooking man though far from pretty dark hair hooded nutmegbrown eyes a hard guarded mouth fleshy blade of a nose sweeping down a roman profile that matched his officers haircut his hands were blunt and clean steepled now together in a still tension in his early thirties miles guessed but why is this guy looking at me like im a puppy that just piddled on his carpet miles wondered i just got here i havent had time to offend him yet oh god i hope hes not one of those rural barrayaran hicks who see me as a mutant a refugee from a botched abortion so said the captain leaning back in his chair with a sigh youre the great mans son eh miless smile became absolutely fixed a red haze clouded his vision he could hear his blood beating in his ears like a death march elli watching him stood quite still barely breathing miless lips moved he swallowed he tried again yes sir he heard himself saying as from a great distance and who are you he managed just barely not to let it come out as and whose son are you the fury bunching his stomach must not be allowed to show he was going to have to work with this man it might not even have been an intentional insult couldnt have been how could this stranger know how much blood miles had sweated fighting off charges of privilege slurs on his competence the mutants only here because his father got him in he could hear his fathers voice countering for gods sake get your head out of your ass boy he let the rage stream out on a long calming breath and cocked his head brightly oh said the captain yes you only talked to my aide didnt you im captain duv galeni senior military attache for the embassy and by default chief of imperial security as well as service security here and i confess rather startled to have you appear in my chain of command it is not entirely clear to me what im supposed to do with you not a rural accent the captains voice was cool educated blandly urban miles could not place it in barrayaran geography im not surprised sir said miles i did not myself expect to be reporting in at earth nor so late i was originally supposed to report back to imperial security command at sector two hq on tau ceti over a month ago but the dendarii free mercenary fleet was driven out of mahata solaris local space by a surprise cetagandan attack since we were not being paid to make war directly on the cetagandans we ran and ended up unable to get back by any shorter route this is literally my first opportunity to report in anywhere since we delivered the refugees to their new base i was not the captain paused his mouth twitching and began again i had not been aware that the extraordinary escape at dagoola was a covert operation of barrayaran intelligence wasnt it perilously close to being an act of outright war on the cetagandan empire precisely why the dendarii mercenaries were used for it sir it was actually supposed to be a somewhat smaller operation but things got a little out of hand in the field as it were beside him elli kept her eyes straight ahead and didnt even choke i uh have a complete report the captain appeared to be having an internal struggle just what is the relationship between the dendarii free mercenary fleet and imperial security lieutenant he finally said there was something almost plaintive in his tone er what do you know already sir captain galeni turned his hands palmup i hadnt even heard of them except peripherally until you made contact by vid yesterday my filesmy security filessay exactly three things about the organization they are not to be attacked any requests for emergency assistance should be met with all due speed and for further information i must apply to sector two security headquarters oh yeah said miles thats right this is only a class iii embassy isnt it um well the relationship is fairly simple the dendarii are kept on retainer for highly covert operations which are either out of imperial securitys range or for which any direct traceable connection with barrayar would be politically embarrassing dagoola was both orders are passed from the general staff with the advice and consent of the emperor through chief of imperial security illyan to me its a very short chain of command im the gobetween supposedly the sole connection i leave imperial hq as lieutenant vorkosigan and pop upwhereveras admiral naismith waving a new contract we go do whatever weve been assigned to do and then from the dendarii point of view i vanish as mysteriously as i came god knows what they think i do in my spare time do you really want to know elli asked her eyes alight later he muttered out of the corner of his mouth the captain drummed his fingers on his desk console and glanced down at a display none of this is in your official dossier twentyfour years oldarent you a little young for your rank ahadmiral his tone was dry his eyes passed mockingly over the dendarii uniform miles tried to ignore the tone its a long story commodore tung a very senior dendarii officer is the real brains of the outfit i just play the part ellis eyes widened in outrage a severe glance from miles tried to compel her to silence you do a lot more than that she objected if youre the sole connection frowned galeni who the devil is this woman his wording rendered her if not a nonperson certainly a nonsoldier yes sir well in case of emergencies there are three dendarii who know my real identity commander quinn who was in on the beginning of the whole scam is one of them im under orders from illyan to maintain a bodyguard at all times so commander quinn fills in whenever i have to change identities i trust her implicitly you will respect my people damn your mocking eyes whatever you think of me how long has this been going on lieutenant ah miles glanced at elli seven years isnt it ellis bright eyes glinted it seems like only yesterday she cooed blandly it seemed she was finding it hard to ignore the tone too miles trusted she would keep her edged sense of humor under control the captain regarded his fingernails and then stared at miles sharply well im going to apply to sector two security lieutenant and if i find out that this is another vor lordlings idea of a practical joke i shall do my level best to see that you are brought up on charges for it no matter who your father is its all true sir my word as vorkosigan just so said captain galeni through his teeth miles infuriated drew breaththen placed galenis regional accent at last he jerked up his chin are youkomarran sir galeni gave him a wary nod miles returned it gravely rather frozen elli nudged him whispering what the hell later miles muttered back barrayaran internal politics will i need to take notes probably he raised his voice i must get in touch with my actual superiors captain galeni i have no idea what my next orders even are galeni pursed his lips and remarked mildly i am actually a superior of yours lieutenant vorkosigan and chapped as hell miles judged to be cut out of his own command chainand who could blame him softly now of course sir what are my orders galenis hands clenched briefly in frustration his mouth set in irony i will have to add you to my staff i suppose while we all await clarification third assistant military attache ideal sir thank you said miles admiral naismith needs very much to vanish just now the cetagandans put a price on hismyhead after dagoola ive been lucky twice it was galenis turn to freeze are you joking i had four dead and sixteen wounded dendarii because of it said miles stiffly i dont find it amusing at all in that case said galeni grimly you may consider yourself confined to the embassy compound and miss earth miles sighed reluctance yes sir he agreed in a dull tone as long as commander quinn here can be my gobetween to the dendarii why do you need further contact with the dendarii theyre my people sir i thought you said this commodore tung ran the show hes on home leave right now but all i really need before admiral naismith departs into the woodwork is to pay some bills if you could advance me their immediate expenses i could wrap up this mission galeni sighed his fingers danced over his comconsole and paused assistance with all due speed right just how much do they require roughly eighteen million marks sir galenis fingers hung paralyzed lieutenant he said carefully that is more than ten times the budget for this entire embassy for a year several tens of times the budget for this department miles spread his hands operating expenses for troops and techs and eleven ships for over six months plus equipment losseswe lost a hell of a lot of gear at dagoolapayroll food clothing fuel medical expenses ammunition repairsi can show you the spreadsheets sir galeni sat back no doubt but sector security headquarters is going to have to handle this one funds in that amount dont even exist here miles chewed on the side of his index finger oh oh indeed he would not panic in that case sir may i request you send to sector hq as soon as possible believe me lieutenant i consider getting you transferred to someone elses command an object of the highest priority he rose excuse me wait here he exited the office shaking his head what the hell prodded elli i thought you were about to try and dismantle the guy captain or no captainand then you just stopped whats so magic about being komarran and where can i get some not magic said miles definitely not magic but very important more important than being a vor lord in a weird way yes right now look you know the planet komarr was barrayars first interstellar imperial conquest right i thought you called it an annexation a rose by any other name we took it for its wormholes because it sat across our only nexus connection because it was strangling our trade and most of all because it accepted a bribe to let the cetagandan fleet pass through it when cetaganda first tried to annex us you may also recall who was the chief conquistador your dad back when he was only admiral lord vorkosigan before he became regent it made his reputation yeah well it made more than one reputation for him you ever want to see smoke come out of his ears whisper the butcher of komarr in his hearing they actually called him that thirty years ago miles she paused was there any truth to it miles sighed there was something ive never been able to get the whole story out of him but im damn sure whats in the history books isnt it anyway the conquest of komarr got messy as a result in the fourth year he was imperial regent came the komarr revolt and that got really messy komarran terrorists have been a security nightmare for the imperium ever since it was pretty repressive there i guess anyway so times gone on things have calmed down a bit anyone from either planet with energy to spare is off settling newlyopened sergyar theres been a movement among the liberalsspearheaded by my fatherto fully integrate komarr into the empire its not a real popular idea with the barrayaran right its a bit of an obsession with the old manbetween justice and genocide there is in the long run no middle ground miles intoned he gets real eloquent about it so all right the route to the top on dear old casteconscious armymad barrayar was and always has been through the imperial military service it was opened to komarrans for the first time just eight years ago that means any komarran in the service now is on the spot they have to prove their loyalty the way i have to prove my he faltered prove myself it also follows that if im working with or under any komarran and i turn up unusually dead one day that komarran is dog meat because my father was the butcher and no one will believe it wasnt some sort of revenge and not just that komarran every other komarran in the imperial service would be shadowed by the same cloud itd put things back years in barrayaran politics if i got assassinated now he shrugged helplessly my father would kill me i trust you werent planning on it she choked so now we come to galeni miles went on hastily hes in the servicean officerhas a post in security itself must have worked his tail off to get here highly trustedfor a komarran but not at a major or strategic post certain critical kinds of security information are deliberately withheld from him and here i come along and rub his nose in it and if he did have any relatives in the komarr revoltwell here i am again i doubt if he loves me but hes going to have to guard me like the apple of his eye and i god help me am going to have to let him its a real tricky situation she patted him on the arm you can handle it hm he grunted glumly oh god elli he wailed suddenly letting his forehead fall against her shoulder and i didnt get the money for the dendariicant till god knows whenwhat will i tell ky i gave him my word she patted him on the head this time but she didnt say anything chapter two he let his head rest against the crisp cloth of her uniform jacket a moment longer she shifted her arms reaching toward him was she about to hug him if she did miles decided he was going to grab her and kiss her right there and then see what happened behind him galenis office doors swished open elli and he both flinched away from each other elli coming to parade rest with a toss of her short dark curls miles just standing and cursing inwardly at the interruption he heard and knew the familiar drawling voice before he turned brilliant sure but hyper as hell you think hes going to slip his flywheel any second watch out when he starts talking too fast oh yeah thats him all right ivan miles breathed closing his eyes how god have i sinned against you that you have given me ivanhere god not deigning to answer miles smiled crookedly and turned elli had her head tilted frowning and listening in sudden concentration galeni had returned with a tall young lieutenant in tow indolent as he was ivan vorpatril had obviously been keeping in shape for his athletic physique set off his dress greens to perfection his affable open face was evenfeatured framed by wavy dark hair in a neat patrician clip miles could not help glancing at elli covertly alert for her reaction with her face and figure elli tended to make anyone standing next to her look grubby but ivan might actually play the stem to her rose and not be overshadowed hi miles said ivan what are you doing here i might ask you the same thing said miles im second assistant military attache they assigned me here to get cultured i guess earth yknow oh said galeni one corner of his mouth twitching upward is that what youre here for id wondered ivan grinned sheepishly hows life with the irregulars these days he asked miles you still getting away with your admiral naismith scam just barely said miles the dendarii are with me now theyre in orbit he jabbed his finger skyward eating their heads off even as we speak galeni looked as if hed bitten into something sour does everybody know about this covert operation but me you vorpatrili know your security clearance is no higher than my own ivan shrugged a previous encounter it was in the family damned vor power network muttered galeni oh said elli quinn in a tone of sudden enlightenment this is your cousin ivan id always wondered what he looked like ivan who had been sneaking little peeks at her ever since hed entered the room came to attention with all the quivering alertness of a bird dog pointing he smiled blindingly and bowed over ellis hand delighted to meet you mlady the dendarii must be improving if you are a fair sample the fairest surely elli repossessed her hand weve met surely not i couldnt forget that face i didnt have this face a head just like an onion was the way you phrased it as i recall her eyes glittered since i was blinded at the time i had no idea how bad the plastiskin prosthesis really looked until you told me miles never mentioned it ivans smile had gone limp ah the plasmaburn lady miles smirked and edged closer to elli who put her hand possessively through the crook of his elbow and favored ivan with a cold samurai smile ivan trying to bleed with dignity looked to captain galeni since you know each other lieutenant vorkosigan ive assigned lieutenant vorpatril here to take you in tow and orient you to the embassy and to your duties here said galeni vor or no vor as long as youre on the emperors payroll the emperor might as well get some use of you i trust some clarification of your status will arrive promptly i trust the dendarii payroll will arrive as promptly said miles your mercenarybodyguardcan return to her outfit if for any reason you need to leave the embassy compound ill assign you one of my men yes sir sighed miles but i still have to be able to get in touch with the dendarii in case of emergencies ill see that commander quinn gets a secured comm link before she leaves as a matter of feet he touched his comconsole sergeant barth he spoke into it yes sir a voice replied do you have that comm link ready yet just finished encoding it sir good bring it to my office barth still in his civvies appeared within moments galeni shepherded elli out sergeant barth will escort you out of the embassy compound commander quinn she glanced back over her shoulder at miles who sketched her a reassuring salute what will i tell the dendarii she asked tell themtell them their funds are in transit miles called the doors hissed shut eclipsing her galeni returned to his comconsole which was bunking for his attention vorpatril please make getting your cousin out of that costume and into a correct uniform your first priority does admiral naismith spook you just a little sir miles wondered irritably the dendarii uniform is as real as your own sir galeni glowered at him across his flickering desk i wouldnt know lieutenant my father could only afford toy soldiers for me when i was a boy you two are dismissed miles fuming waited until the doors had closed behind them before tearing off his greyandwhite jacket and throwing it to the corridor floor costume toy soldiers i think im gonna kill that komarran sonofabitch oooh said ivan arent we touchy today you heard what he said yeah so galenis all right a bit regulation maybe theres a dozen little tinpot mercenary outfits running around in oddball corners of the wormhole nexus some of them tread a real fine line between legal and illegal hows he supposed to know your dendarii arent next door to being hijackers miles picked up his uniform jacket shook it out and folded it carefully over his arm huh come on said ivan ill take you down to stores and get you a kit in a color more to his taste they got anything in my size they make a lasermap of your body and produce the stuff oneoff computer controlled just like that overpriced sartorial pirate you take yourself to in vorbarr sultana this is earth son my man on barrayars been doing my clothes for ten years he has some tricks that arent in the computer well i guess i can live with it can the embassy computer do civilian clothes ivan grimaced if your tastes are conservative if you want something in style to wow the local girls you have to go farther afield with galeni for a duenna i have a feeling im not going to get a chance to go very far afield miles sighed itll have to do miles sighted down the forestgreen sleeve of his barrayaran dress uniform adjusted the cuff and jerked his chin up the better to settle his head on the high collar hed halfforgotten just how uncomfortable that damn collar was with his short neck in front the red rectangles of his lieutenants rank seemed to poke into his jaw in back it pinched his stilluncut hair and the boots were hot the bone hed broken in his left foot at dagoola still twinged even now after being rebroken set straight and treated with electrastim still the green uniform was home his true self maybe it was time for a vacation from admiral naismith and his intractable responsibilities time to remember the more reasonable problems of lieutenant vorkosigan whose sole task now was to learn the procedures of one small office and put up with ivan vorpatril the dendarii didnt need him to hold their hand for routine rest and refit nor could he have arranged any more safe and thorough a disappearance for admiral naismith ivans particular charge was this tiny windowless room deep in the bowels of the embassy compound his job to feed hundreds of data disks to a secured computer that concentrated them into a weekly report on the status of earth to be sent back to security chief illyan and the general staff on barrayar where miles supposed it was computercollated with hundreds of other such reports to create barrayars vision of the universe miles hoped devoutly that ivan wasnt adding kilowatts and megawatts in the same column by far the bulk of this stuff is public statistics ivan was explaining seated before his console and actually looking at ease in his dress greens population shifts agricultural and manufacturing production figures the various political divisions published military budgets the computer adds em up sixteen different ways and blinks for attention when things dont match since all the originators have computers too this doesnt happen too oftenall the lies are embedded before it ever gets to us galeni says more important to barrayar are records of ship movements in and out of earth local space then we get to the more interesting stuff real spy work theres several hundred people on earth this embassy tries to keep track of for one security reason or another one of the biggest groups is the komarran rebel expatriates a wave of ivans hand and dozens of faces flickered one after another above the vid plate oh yeah said miles interested in spite of himself does galeni have secret contacts and so on with them is that why hes assigned here double agenttriple agent i bet illyan wishes said ivan as far as i know they regard galeni as a leper evil collaborator with the imperialist oppressors and all that surely theyre no great threat to barrayar at this late date and distance refugees some of these were the smart refugees though the ones who got their money out before the boom dropped some were involved in financing the komarr revolt during the regencytheyre mostly a lot poorer now theyre aging though another half generation if your fathers integration policies succeed and theyll have totally lost momentum captain galeni says ivan picked up another data disk and then we come to the real hot stuff which is keeping track of what the other embassies are doing such as the cetagandan i hope theyre on the other side of the planet said miles sincerely no most of the galactic embassies and consuls are concentrated right here in london makes watching each other ever so much more convenient ye gods moaned miles dont tell me theyre across the street or some damned thing ivan grinned almost theyre about two kilometers away we go to each others parties a lot to practice being snide and play iknowyouknowiknow games miles sat hyperventilating slightly oh shit whats up you coz those people are trying to kill me no theyre not itd start a war were at peace right now sort of remember well theyre trying to kill admiral naismith anyway who vanished yesterday yeah butone of the reasons this whole dendarii scam has held up for so long is distance admiral naismith and lieutenant vorkosigan never show up within hundreds of light years of each other weve never been trapped on the same planet together let alone the same city as long as you leave your dendarii uniform in my closet whats to connect ivan how many fourfootnineinch blackhaired greyeyed hunchbacks can there be on this damn planet dyou think you trip over twitchy dwarfs on every street corner on a planet of nine billion said ivan theres got to be at least six of everything calm down he paused ynow thats the first time ive ever heard you use that word what word hunchback youre not really you know ivan eyed him with friendly worry miless fist closed opened in a sharp throwaway gesture anyway cetagandans if they have a counterpart doing what youre doing ivan nodded ive met him his names ghemlieutenant tabor then they know the dendarii are here and know admiral naismiths been seen they probably have a list of every purchase order weve put through the comm net or will soon enough when they turn their attention to it theyre tracking they may be tracking but they cant get orders from higher up any faster than we can said ivan reasonably and in any case theyve got a manpower shortage our security staffs four times the size of theirs on account of the komarrans i mean this may be earth but its still a minor embassy even more so for them than us never fear he struck a pose in his station chair hand across his chest cousin ivan will protect you thats so reassuring miles muttered ivan grinned at his sarcasm and turned back to his work the day wore on interminably in the quiet changeless room his claustrophobia miles discovered was developed to a much higher pitch than it used to be he absorbed lessons from ivan and paced from wall to wall between times you could do that about twice as fast you know miles observed to ivan plugging away at his data analysis but then id be done right after lunch said ivan and then i wouldnt have anything to do at all surely galeni could find something thats what im afraid of said ivan quitting time rolls around soon enough then we go party no then you go party i go to my room as ordered maybe ill catch up on my sleep finally thats it think positive said ivan ill work out with you in the embassy gym if you want you dont look so good you know pale and um pale old thought miles is the word you just edited he glanced at the distorted reflection of his face in a bit of chrome plating on the console that bad eh exercise ivan thumped his chest will be good for you no doubt muttered miles the days fell quickly into a set pattern miles was awakened by ivan in the room they shared did a stint in the gym showered breakfasted and went to work in the data room he began to wonder if he would ever be permitted to see earths beautiful sunlight again after three days miles took the computerstuffing job away from ivan and started finishing it by noon so that he might at least have the later hours for reading and study he devoured embassy and security procedures earth history galactic news in the later afternoon they knocked off for another grueling workout in the gym on the nights ivan stayed in miles watched vid dramas with him on the nights he went out travelogues of all the sites of interest he wasnt allowed to go visit elli reported in daily on the secured comm link on the status of the dendarii fleet still holding in orbit miles closeting himself with the comm link found himself increasingly hungry for that outside voice her reports were succinct but afterwards they drifted off into inconsequential small talk as miles found it harder and harder to cut her off and she never hung up on him miles fantasized about courting her in his own personawould a commander accept a date from a mere lieutenant would she even like lord vorkosigan would galeni ever let him leave the embassy to find out ten days of clean living exercise and regular hours had been bad for him miles decided his energy level was up up and bottled in the immobilized persona of lord vorkosigan while the list of chores facing admiral naismith piled up and up and up will you stop fidgeting miles ivan complained sit down take a deep breath hold still for five minutes you can do it if you try miles made one more circuit of the computer room then flung himself into a chair why hasnt galeni called me yet the courier from sector hq got in an hour ago so give the man time to go to the bathroom and get a cup of coffee give galeni time to read his reports this is peacetime everybodys got lots of leisure to sit around writing reports theyd be hurt if nobody read em thats the trouble with your governmentsupported troops said miles youre spoiled you get paid not to make war wasnt there a mercenary fleet that did that once theyd show up in orbit somewhere and get paidto not make war worked didnt it youre just not a creative enough mercenary commander miles yeah lavarrs fleet it worked real good till the tau cetan navy caught up with em and then lavarr was sent to the disintegration chamber no sense of humor the tau cetans none miles agreed neither has my father too true well the comconsole blinked ivan had to duck out of the way as miles pounced on it yes sir said miles breathlessly come to my office lieutenant vorkosigan said galeni his face was saturnine as ever no cues there yes sir thank you sir miles cut the com and plunged for the door my eighteen million marks at last either that said ivan genially or hes found a job for you in inventory maybe youre going to get to count all the goldfish in the fountain in the main reception court sure ivan hey its a real challenge they keep moving around you know how do you know miles paused his eyes lighting ivan did he actually make you do that it had to do with a suspected security breach said ivan its a long story ill bet miles beat a brief tattoo on the desk and vaulted around its corner later im gone miles found captain galeni sitting staring dubiously at the display on his comconsole as if it was still in code hm galeni leaned back in his chair well your orders have arrived from sector hq lieutenant vorkosigan and galenis mouth tightened and they confirm your temporary assignment to my staff officially and publicly you may now draw your lieutenants pay from my department as of ten days ago as for the rest of your orders they read the same as vorpatrilsin fact they could be templated from vorpatrils orders with the name changed you are to assist me as required hold yourself at the disposal of the ambassador and his lady for escort duties and as time permits take advantage of educational opportunities unique to earth and appropriate to your status as an imperial officer and lord of the vor what this cant be right what the devil are escort duties sounds like a callgirl a slight smile turned one corner of galenis mouth mostly standing around in parade dress at official embassy social functions and being vor for the natives there are a surprising number of people who find aristocratseven offplanet aristocratspeculiarly fascinating galenis tone made it clear that he found this fascination peculiar indeed you will eat drink dance perhaps his tone grew doubtful for a second and generally be exquisitely polite to anyone the ambassador wants to ah impress sometimes you will be asked to remember and report conversations vorpatril does it all very well rather to my surprise he can fill in the details for you i dont need to take social notes from ivan miles thought and the vor are a military caste not an aristocracy what the hell was hq thinking of it seemed extraordinarily obtuse even for them yet if they had no new project on line for the dendarii why not use the opportunity for count vorkosigans son to acquire a little more diplomatic polish no one doubted that he was destined for the most rarified levels of the servicehe would hardly be exposed to less varied experience than ivan it wasnt the content of the orders it was only the lack of separation from his other persona that was so unexpected still report conversations could this be the start of some special spy work perhaps further clarifying details were en route he didnt even want to think about the possibility that hq had decided it was finally time to shut down dendarii covert ops altogether well said miles grudgingly all right so glad murmured galeni you find your orders to your taste lieutenant miles flushed and closed his mouth tightly but if only he could get his dendarii taken care of the rest didnt matter and my eighteen million marks sir he asked taking care to keep his tone humble this time galeni drummed his fingers on his desk no such credit order arrived with this courier lieutenant nor any mention of one what shrieked miles theres got to be he almost lunged across galenis desk to examine the vid himself caught himself up just in time i calculated ten days for all the his brain dumped unwanted data streaming past his consciousnessfuel orbital docking fees resupply medicaldentalsurgical the depleted ordnance inventory payroll rollover liquidity margin dammit we bled for barrayar they cantthere must be some mistake galeni spread his hands helplessly no doubt but not one in my power to repair send againsir oh i shall better yetlet me go as courier if i talked to hq in person hm galeni rubbed his lips a tempting idea no better not your orders at least were clear your dendarii will simply have to wait for the next courier if all is as you say his emphasis was not lost on miles im sure it will all be straightened out miles waited an endless moment but galeni offered nothing more yes sir he saluted and faced about ten days ten more days ten more days at least they could wait out ten more days but he hoped hq would get the oxygen back to its collective brain by then the highestranking female guest at the afternoon reception was the ambassador from tau ceti she was a slender woman of indeterminate age fascinating facial bone structure and penetrating eyes miles suspected her conversation would be an education in itself political subtle and scintillating alas as the barrayaran ambassador had monopolized her miles doubted he was going to get a chance to find out the dowager miles had been assigned to squire about held her rank by virtue of her husband who was the lord mayor of london and now being entertained by the ambassadors wife the mayors lady seemed able to chatter on interminably mainly about the clothing worn by the other guests a passing servant of rather military bearing all the human servants in the embassy were members of galenis department offered miles a wine glass full of strawpale liquid from a gold tray which miles accepted with alacrity yes two or three of those with his low tolerance for alcohol and he would be numb enough to endure even this was this not exactly the constrained social scene he had sweated his way despite his physical handicaps into the imperial service to escape of course more than three glasses and he would be stretched out asleep on the inlaid floor with a silly smile on his face and deep in trouble when he woke up miles took a large sip and almost choked apple juice damn galeni he was thorough a quick glance around confirmed that this was not the same beverage being served to the guests miles ran his thumb around the high collar of his uniform jacket and smiled tightly something wrong with your wine lord vorkosigan the dowager inquired with concern the vintage is a trifle ah young miles murmured i may suggest to the ambassador that he keep this one in his cellars a little longer like till i get off this planet the main reception court was a higharched skylighted elegantly appointed chamber that looked as if it should echo cavernously but was strangely hushed for the large crowd its levels and niches could enclose sound absorbers concealed somewhere miles thoughtand he bet if you knew just where to stand secure cones to baffle eavesdroppers both human and electronic he noted where the barrayaran and tau cetan ambassadors were standing for future reference yes even their lip movements seemed shadowed and blurred somehow certain rightofpassage treaties through tau cetan local space were coming up for renegotiation soon miles and his charge drifted toward the architectural center of the room the fountain and its pool it was a cool trickling sort of sculptured thing with colorcoordinated ferns and mosses redgold shapes moved mysteriously in the shadowed waters miles stiffened then forced his spine to relax a young man in black cetagandan dress uniform with the yellow and black facepaint markings of a ghemlieutenant approached smiling and watchful they exchanged wary nods welcome to earth lord vorkosigan murmured the cetagandan is this an official visit or are you on a grand tour a little of both miles shrugged ive been assigned to the embassy for my ah education but i believe you have the advantage of me sir he didnt of course both the two cetagandans who were in uniform and the two who were not plus three individuals suspected of being their covert jackals had been pointed out to miles first thing ghemlieutenant tabor military attache cetagandan embassy tabor recited politely they exchanged nods again will you be here long my lord i dont expect so and yourself i have taken up the art of bonsai for a hobby the ancient japanese are said to have worked on a single tree for as long as a hundred years or perhaps it only seemed like it miles suspected tabor of humor but the lieutenant kept his face so straight it was hard to tell perhaps he feared cracking his paint job a trill of laughter mellow like bells drew their attention toward the far end of the fountain ivan vorpatril was leaning against the chrome railing down there dark head bent close to a blonde confection she wore something in salmon pink and silver that seemed to waft even when she was standing still as now artfully artless golden hair cascaded across one white shoulder her fingernails flashed silverpink as she gestured animatedly tabor hissed slightly bowed exquisitely over the dowagers hand and passed on miles next saw him on the other side of the fountain jockeying for position near ivanbut somehow miles felt it was not military secrets tabor was prowling for no wonder hed seemed only marginally interested in miles but tabors stalk on the blonde was interrupted by a signal from his ambassador and he perforce followed the dignitaries out such a nice young man lord vorpatril miless i dowager cooed we like him very much here the ambassadors lady tells me you two are related she cocked her head at him brightly expectant cousins of a sort miles explained ahwho is the young lady with him the dowager smiled proudly thats my daughter sylveth daughter of course the ambassador and his lady had a keen barrayaran appreciation of the nuances of social rank miles being of the senior family line not to mention the son of prime minister count vorkosigan outranked ivan socially if not militarily which meant oh god he was doomed hed be stuck with the vip dowagers forever while ivanivan carried off all the daughters a lovely couple said miles thickly arent they just what sort of cousins lord vorkosigan uh oh ivan and me yes our grandmothers were sisters my grandmother was prince xav vorbarras eldest child ivans was his youngest princesses how romantic miles considered describing in detail how his grandmother her brother and most of their children had been blown into hamburger during mad emperor yuris reign of terror no the mayors lady might find it merely a shivery and outre tale or even worse romantic he doubted shed grasp the true violent stupidity of yuris affairs with their consequences escaping in all directions to warp barrayaran history to this day does lord vorpatril own a castle she inquired archly ah no his mother my aunt vorpatril who is a social barracuda who would eat you alive has a very nice flat in the capital city of vorbarr sultana miles paused we used to have a castle but it was burned down at the end of the time of isolation a ruined castle thats almost as good picturesque as hell miles assured her someone had left a small plate with the remains of their hors doeuvres sitting on the railing by the fountain miles took the roll and started breaking off bits for the goldfish they glided up to snap at the crumbs with a brief gurgle one refused to rise to the bait lurking in the depths how interesting a goldfish that did not eatnow there was a solution to ivans fishinventory problem perhaps the stubborn one was a fiendish cetagandan construct whose cold scales glittered like gold because they were he might pluck it out with a feline pounce stamping it underfoot with a mechanical crunch and electric sizzle then hold it up with a triumphal cryah through my quick wits and reflexes i have discovered the spy among you but if his guess were wrong ah the squish under his boot the dowagers recoil and the barrayaran prime ministers son would have acquired an instant reputation as a young man with serious emotional difficulties ah ha he pictured himself cackling to the horrified woman as the fish guts slithered underfoot you should see what i do to kittens the big goldfish rose lazily at last and took a crumb with a splash that marred miless polished boots thank you fish miles thought to it you have just saved me from considerable social embarrassment of course if the cetagandan artificers were really clever they might have designed a mechanical fish that really ate and excreted little the mayors lady had just asked another leading question about ivan which miles in his absorption foiled to completely catch yes most unfortunate about his disease miles purred and prepared to launch a monologue maligning ivans genes involving inbred aristocracies radiation areas left from the first cetagandan war and mad emperor yuri when the secured comm link in his pocket beeped excuse me maam im being paged bless you elli he thought as he fled the dowager to find a quiet corner to answer it no cetagandans in sight he found an unoccupied niche on the second level made private by green plants and opened the channel yes commander quinn miles thank god her voice was hurried we seem to have us a situation down there and youre the closest dendarii officer what sort of situation he didnt care for situations that came capitalized eui was not normally inclined to panicky exaggerations his stomach tightened nervously i havent been able to get details i can trust but it appears that four or five of our soldiers on downside leave in london have barricaded themselves in some sort of shop with a hostage holding off the police theyre armed our guys or the police both unfortunately the police commander i talked to sounded like he was prepared for blood on the walls very soon worse and worse what the hell do they think theyre doing damned if i know im in orbit right now preparing to leave but itll be fortyfive minutes to an hour before i can get down there tungs in worse position itd be a twohour suborbital flight from brazil but i think you could be there in about ten minutes here ill key the address into your comm link how were our guys permitted to take dendarii weaponry offship a good question but im afraid well have to save it for the postmortem so to speak she said grimly can you find the place miles glanced at the address on his readout i think so ill meet you there somehow right quinn out the channel snapped closed chapter three miles pocketed the comm link and gazed around the main reception court the reception had peaked there were perhaps a hundred people present in a blinding variety of earth and galactic fashions and a fair sprinkling of uniforms besides barrayaran a few of the earlier arrivals were cutting out already ushered past security by their barrayaran escorts the cetagandans appeared to be truly gone along with their friends his escape must be opportune rather than clever it appeared ivan was still chatting with his beautiful charge down at the end of the fountain miles bore down upon him ruthlessly ivan meet me by the main doors in five minutes what its an emergency ill explain later what sort of ivan began but miles was already slipping out of the room and making his way toward the back lift tubes he had to force himself not to run when the door to his and ivans room slid shut behind him he peeled out of his dress greens tore off the boots and catapulted for the closet he yanked on the black tshirt and grey trousers of his dendarii uniform barrayaran boots were descended from a cavalry tradition dendarii had evolved from footsoldiers gear in the presence of a horse the barrayaran were the more practical although miles had never been able to explain that to elli it would take two hours or so in the saddle on heavy crosscountry terrain and her calves rubbed to bleeding blisters to convince her that the design had a purpose besides looks no horses here he sealed the dendarii combat boots and adjusted the greyandwhite jacket in midair tumbling back down the lift tube at max drop he paused at the bottom to pull down his jacket jerk up his chin and take a deep breath one could not saunter inconspicuously while gasping he took an alternate corridor around the main court to the front entrance still no cetagandans thank god ivans eyes widened as he saw miles approach he flashed a smile at the blonde excusing himself and backed miles against a potted plant as if to hide him from view what the hell he hissed youve got to walk me out of here past the guards oh no i dont galeni will have your hide for a doormat if he sees you in that getup ivan i dont have time to argue and i dont have time to explain which is precisely why im sidestepping galeni quinn wouldnt have called me if she didnt need me ive got to go now youll be awol not if im not missed tell themtell them i retired to our room due to excruciating pain in my bones is that osteojoint thing of yours acting up again i bet the embassy physician could get that antiinflammatory med for you no nono more than usual anywaybut at least its something real theres a chance theyll believe it come on bring her miles gestured with his chin toward sylveth waiting out of earshot for ivan with an inquiring look on her flowerpetal face what for camouflage smiling through his teeth miles propelled ivan by his elbow toward the main doors how do you do miles nattered to sylveth capturing her hand and tucking it through his arm so nice to meet you are you enjoying the party wonderful town london he and sylveth made a lovely couple too miles decided he glanced at the guards from the corner of his eye as they passed they noticed her with any luck he would be a short grey blur in their memories sylveth glanced in bewilderment at ivan but by this time they had stepped into the sunlight you dont have a bodyguard ivan objected ill be meeting quinn in a short time how are you going to get back in the embassy miles paused youll have until i get back to figure that out ngh whens that i dont know the outside guards attention was drawn to a ground car hissing up to the embassy entrance abandoning ivan miles darted across the street and dove into the entrance to the tubeway system ten minutes and two connections later he emerged to find himself in a very much older section of town restored ndcentury architecture he didnt have to check for street numbers to spot his destination the crowd the barricades the flashing lights the police hovercars fire equipment ambulance damnation miles muttered and started down that side street he rolled the words back through his mouth switching gears to admiral naismiths flat betan accent aw shit miles guessed the policeman in charge was the one with the amplifier comm and not one of the halfdozen in body armor toting plasma rifles he pushed his way through the crowd and hopped over the barricade are you the officer in charge the constables head snapped around in bewilderment then he looked down at first purely startled he frowned as he took in miless uniform are you one of those psychopaths he demanded miles rocked back on his heels wondering how to answer that one he suppressed all three of the initial retorts that came to his mind and chose instead im admiral miles naismith commanding dendarii free mercenary fleet whats happened here he interrupted himself to slowly and delicately extend one index finger and push skyward the muzzle of a plasma rifle being held on him by an armored woman please dear im on your side really her eyes flashed mistrustfully at him through her faceplate but the police commander jerked his head and she faded back a few paces attempted robbery said the constable when the clerk tried to foil it they attacked her robbery said miles excuse me but that makes no sense i thought all transactions were by computer credit transfer here theres no cash to rob there must be some misunderstanding not cash said the constable stock the store miles noticed out of the corner of his eye was a wineshop a display window was cracked and starred he suppressed a queasy feeling of unease and plunged on keeping his voice light in any case i fail to understand this standoff with deadly weapons over a case of shoplifting arent you overreacting a trifle where are your stunners they hold the woman hostage said the constable grimly so stun them all god will recognize his own the constable gave miles a peculiar look he didnt read his own history miles guessedthe source of that quote was just across the water from here for pitys sake they claim to have arranged some sort of deadman switch they claim this whole block will go up in flames the constable paused is this possible miles paused too have you got ids on any of these guys yet no how are you communicating with them through the comconsole at least we werethey appear to have destroyed it a few minutes ago we will of course pay damages miles choked thats not all youll pay growled the constable well out of the corner of his eye miles saw a hovercar labeled euronews network dropping down to the street i think its time to break this up he started toward the wineshop what are you going to do asked the constable arrest them they face dendarii charges for taking ordnance offship all by yourself theyll shoot you theyre crazydrunk i dont think so if i were going to be shot by my own troops theyve had much better opportunities than this the constable frowned but did not stop him the autodoors were not working miles stood baffled before the glass a moment then pounded on it there was shadowy movement behind the iridescent shimmer a very long pause and the doors slid open about a third of a meter miles turned sideways and slipped through a man inside shoved them shut again by hand and jammed a metal brace in their slot the interior of the wineshop was a shambles miles gasped at the fumes in the air aromatic vapors from shattered bottles you could get plastered just from breathing the carpeting squished underfoot miles glanced around to determine who he wanted to murder first the one whod unblocked the door stood out as he was wearing only underwear s admiral naismith the doorman hissed he came to a tilted attention and saluted whose army are you in soldier miles growled at him the mans hands made little waving motions as if to offer explanations by mime miles couldnt dredge up his name another dendarii in uniform this time was sitting on the floor with his back to a pillar miles squatted down considering hauling him to his feet or at least his knees by his jacket and bracing him miles stared into his face little red eyes like coals in the caverns of his eyesockets stared back without recognition eugh muttered miles and rose without further attempt to communicate that ones consciousness was somewhere in wormhole space who cares came a hoarse voice from the floor behind a display rack one of the few that hadnt been violently upended who thell cares oh weve got the best and brightest here today dont we miles thought sourly an upright person emerged around the end of the display rack saying cant be hes disappeared again at last someone miles knew by name all too well further explanation for the scene was almost redundant ah private danio fancy meeting you here danio shambled to a species of attention towering over miles an antique pistol its grip defaced with notches dangled menacingly from his ham hand miles nodded toward it is that the deadly weapon i was called away from my affairs to come collect they talked like you had half our bleeding arsenal down here no sir said danio that would be against regs he patted the gun fondly jus my personal property because you never know the crazies are everywhere are you carrying any other weapons among you yalen has his bowie knife miles controlled a twinge of relief as premature still if these morons were on their own the dendarii fleet might not have to get officially sucked into their morass after all did you know that carrying any weapon is a criminal offense in this jurisdiction danio thought this over wimps he said at last nevertheless said miles firmly im going to have to collect them and take them back to the flagship miles peered around the display rack the one on the flooryalen presumablylay clutching an unsheathed hunk of steel suitable for butchering an entire steer should he encounter one mooing down the metalled streets and skyways of london miles thought it through and pointed bring me that knife private danio danio pried the weapon from his comrades grip nooo said the horizontal one miles breathed easier when he had both weapons in his possession now danioquickly because theyre getting nervous out thereexactly what happened here well sir we were having a party wed rented a room he jerked his head toward the deminaked doorman who hovered listening we ran out of supplies and came here to buy more cause it was close by got everything all picked out and piled up and then the bitch wouldnt take our credit good dendarii credit the bitch miles looked around stepping over the disarmed yalen oh ye gods the store clerk a plump middleaged woman lay on her side on the floor at the other end of the display rack gagged trussed up in the naked soldiers twisted jacket and pants by way of makeshift restraints miles pulled the bowie knife out of his belt and headed for her she made hysterical gurgling noises down in her throat i wouldnt let her loose if i were you said the naked soldier warningly she makes a lot of noise miles paused and studied the woman her greying hair stuck out wildly except where it was plastered to her forehead and neck by sweat her terrorized eyes rolled whitely she bucked against her bonds mm miles thrust the knife back in his belt temporarily he caught the naked soldiers name off his uniform at last and made an unwelcome mental connection xaveria yes i remember you now you did well at dagoola xaveria stood straighter damn so much for his nascent plan of throwing the entire lot to the local authorities and praying they were all still incarcerated when the fleet broke orbit could xaveria be detached from his worthless comrades somehow alas it looked like they were all in this together so she wouldnt take your credit cards you xaveriawhat happened next erinsults were exchanged sir and and tempers kind of got out of hand bottles were thrown and thrown on the floor the police were called she was punched out xaveria eyed danio warily miles contemplated the sudden absence of actors from all this action in xaverias syntax and and the police got here and we told them wed blow the place up if they tried to come in and do you actually have the means to carry out that threat private xaveria no sir it was pure bluff i was trying to thinkwellwhat you would do in the situation sir this one is too damned observant even when hes potted miles thought dryly he sighed and ran his hands through his hair why wouldnt she take your credit cards arent they the earth universals you were issued at the shuttleport you werent trying to use the ones left over from mahata solaris were you no sir said xaveria he produced his card by way of evidence it looked all right miles turned to test it in the comconsole at the checkout only to discover that the comconsole had been shot the final bullet hole in the holovid plate was precisely centered must have been intended as the coup de grace although the console still emitted little wheezing popping noises now and then he added the price of it to the running tally in his head and winced actually xaveria cleared his throat it was the machine that spat it up sir it shouldnt have done that miles began unless unless theres something wrong with the central account his thought finished the pit of his stomach felt suddenly very cold ill check it out he promised meanwhile we have to wrap this up and get you out of here without your being fried by the local constables danio nodded excitedly toward the pistol in miless hand we could blast our way out the back make a run for the nearest tubeway miles momentarily bereft of speech envisioned plugging danio with his own pistol danio was saved only by miless reflection that the recoil might break his arm hed smashed his right hand at dagoola and the memory of the pain was still fresh no danio miles said when he could command his voice we are going to walk quietlyvery quietlyout the front door and surrender but the dendarii never surrender said xaveria this is not a firebase said miles patiently it is a wineshop or at any rate it was furthermore it is not even our wineshop though i shall no doubt be compelled to buy it think of the london police not as your enemies but as your dearest friends they are you know because he fixed xaveria with a cold eye until they get done with you i cant start ah said xaveria quelled at last he touched danio on the arm yeah maybemaybe we better let the admiral take us home eh danio xaveria hauled the exbowie knife owner to his feet after a moments thought miles walked quietly behind redeye pulled out his pocket stunner and placed a light blast to the base of his skull redeye toppled sideways miles sent up a short prayer that this final stimulus wouldnt send him into traumashock god alone knew what chemical cocktail it chased except that it clearly wasnt alcohol alone you take his head miles directed danio and you yalen take his feet there that effectively immobilized all three of them xaveria open the door place your hands on top of your head and walk do not run to where you will submit quietly to arrest danio you follow thats an order wish we had the rest of the troops muttered danio the only troop you need is a troop of legal experts said miles he eyed xaveria and sighed ill send you one thank you sir said xaveria and lurched gravely forward miles brought up the rear gritting his teeth miles blinked in the sunlight of the street his little patrol fell into the arms of the waiting police danio did not fight when they started to frisk him though miles only relaxed when he saw the tanglefield finally turned on the constable commander approached inhaling for speech a soft foomp broke from the door of the wineshop blue flames licked out over the slidewalk miles cried out wheeled and sprinted explosively from his standing start gulping a huge breath and holding it he hurtled through the wineshop doors into darkness shot through with twisting heat around the display case the alcoholsoaked carpeting was growing flames like stands of golden wheat running in a crazy pattern following concentrations of fumes fire was advancing on the bound woman on the floor in a moment her hair would be a terrible halo miles dove for her wriggled his shoulder under her grunted to his feet he swore he could feel his bones bend she kicked unhelpfully miles staggered for the door bright like the mouth of a tunnel like the gate of life his lungs pulsed straining for oxygen against his tightlyclosed lips total elapsed time eleven seconds in the twelfth second the room behind them brightened roaring miles and his burden fell to the slidewalk rollinghe rolled her over and overflames were lapping over their clothing people were screaming and yelling at an unintelligible distance his dendarii uniform cloth combatrated would neither melt nor burn but still made a dandy wick for the volatile liquids splashed on it the effect was bloody spectacular but the poor clerks clothing offered no such protection he choked on a faceful of foam sprayed on them by the fireman who had rushed forward he must have been standing at the ready all this time the frightenedlooking policewoman hovered anxiously clutching her thoroughly redundant plasmarifle the fire extinguisher foam was like being rolled in beer suds only not so tastymiles spat vile chemicals and lay a moment gasping god air was good nobody praised air enough a bomb cried the constable commander miles wriggled onto his back appreciating the blue slice of sky seen through eyes miraculously unglazed unburst unslagged no he panted sadly brandy lots and lots of very expensive brandy and cheap grain alcohol probably set off by a short circuit in the comconsole he rolled out of the way as firemen in white protective garments bearing the tools of their trade stampeded forward a fireman pulled him to his feet farther away from the nowblazing building he came up staring at a person pointing a piece of equipment at him resembling for a disoriented moment a microwave cannon the adrenalin rush washed over him without effect there was no response left in him the person was babbling at him miles blinked dizzily and the microwave cannon fell into more sensible focus as a holovid camera he wished it had been a microwave cannon the clerk released at last was pointing at him and crying and screaming for someone hed just saved from a horrible death she didnt sound very grateful the holovid swung her way for a moment until she was led away by the ambulance personnel he hoped theyd supply her with a sedative he pictured her arriving home that night to husband and childrenand how was the shop today dear he wondered if shed accept hushmoney and if so how much it would be money oh god miles elli quinns voice over his shoulder made him jump do you have everything under control they collected stares on the tubeway ride to the london shuttleport miles catching a glimpse of himself in a mirrored wall while elli credited their tokens was not surprised the sleek polished lord vorkosigan hed last seen looking back at him before the embassy reception has been transmuted werewolfwise into a most degraded little monster his scorched damp bedraggled uniform was flecked with little fluffy bits of drying foam the white placket down the jacket front was filthy his face was smudged his voice a croak his eyes red and feral from smoke irritation he reeked of smoke and sweat and drink especially drink hed been rolling in it after all people near them in line caught one whiff and started edging away the constables thank god had relieved him of knife and pistol impounded as evidence still he and elli had their end of the bubblecar all to themselves miles sank into his seat with a groan some bodyguard you are he said to elli why didnt you protect me from that interviewer she wasnt trying to shoot you besides id just got there i couldnt tell her what had been going on but youre far more photogenic it would have improved the image of the dendarii fleet holovids make me tonguetied but you sounded calm enough i was trying to downplay it all boys will be boys chuckles admiral naismith while in the background his troops burn down london elli grinned sides they werent interested in me i wasnt the hero whod dashed into a burning buildingby the gods when you came rolling out all on fire you saw that miles was vaguely cheered did it look good in the long shots maybe itll make up for danio and his jolly crew in the minds of our host city it looked properly terrifying she shuddered appreciation im surprised youre not more badly burned miles twitched singed eyebrows and tucked his blistered left hand unobtrusively under his right arm it was nothing protective clothing im glad not all our equipment design is faulty i dont know to tell the truth ive been shy of fire ever since her hand touched her face as well you should be the whole thing was carried out by my spinal reflexes when my brain finally caught up with my body it was all over and then i had the shakes ive seen a few fires in combat the only thing i could think of was speed because when fires hit that certain point they expand fast miles bit back confiding his further worries about the security aspects of that damned interview it was too late now though his imagination played with the idea of a secret dendarii raid on euronews network to destroy the vid disk maybe war would break out or a shuttle would crash or the government would fall in a major sex scandal and the whole wineshop incident would be shelved in the rush of other news events besides the cetagandans surely already knew admiral naismith had been seen on earth he would disappear back into lord vorkosigan soon enough perhaps permanently this time miles staggered off the tubeway clutching his back bones said elli worriedly did you do something to your spine im not sure he stomped along beside her rather bent muscle spasmsthat poor woman must have been fatter than i thought adrenalinll fool you it was no better by the time their little personnel shuttle docked at the triumph the dendarii flagship in orbit elli insisted on a detour to sickbay pulled muscles said his fleet surgeon unsympathetically after scanning him go lie down for a week miles made false promises and exited clutching a packet of pills in his bandaged hand he was pretty sure the surgeons diagnosis was correct for the pain was easing now that he was aboard his own flagship he could feel the tension uncoiling in his neck at least and hoped it would continue all the way down he was coming down off his adrenalininduced high toobetter finish his business here while he could still walk and talk at the same time he straightened his jacket brushing rather futilely at the white flecks and jerked up his chin before marching into his fleet finance officers inner sanctum it was evening shiptime only an hour skewed from london downside time but the mercenary accountant was still at her post yield bone was a precise middleaged woman heavyset definitely a tech not a troop whose normal tone of voice was a calming drawl now she spun in her station chair and squealed at him oh sir do you have the credit transfer she took in his appearance and her voice dropped to a more usual timbre good god what happened to you as an afterthought she saluted thats what im here to find out lieutenant bone he hooked a second seat into its floor brackets and swung it around to sit backwards his arms draped over its back as an afterthought he returned her salute i thought you reported yesterday that all our resupply orders not essential for orbital lifesupport were on hold and that our earthside credit was under control temporarily under control she replied fourteen days ago you told me wed have a credit transfer in ten days i tried to time as many expenses as possible to come in after that four days ago you told me it would be another ten days at least miles confirmed glumly ive put off as much stuff as i can again but some of it had to be paid off in order to get credit extended another week weve dipped dangerously far into reserve funds since mahata solaris miles rubbed a finger tiredly over the seat back yeah maybe we should have pushed on straight to tau ceti too late now if only he were dealing with sector ii security headquarters directly we would have had to drop threefourths of the fleet at earth anyway sir and i didnt want to break up the set i know we stay here much longer and none of us will be able to leavea financial black hole look tap your programs and tell me what happened to the downside personnel credit account about london time tonight hm her fingers conjured up arcane and colorful data displays from her holovid console oh dear it shouldnt have done that now where did the money go ah direct override that explains it explain it to me miles prodded well she turned to him of course when the fleet is on station for long at any place with any kind of financial net at all we dont just leave our liquid assets sitting around we dont no no anything that isnt actually outgoing is held for as long as possible in some sort of shortterm interestgenerating investment so all our credit accounts are set to ride along at the legal minimum when a bill comes due i cycle it through the computer and shoot just enough to cover it from the investment account into the credit account is this er worth the risk risk its basic good practice we made over four thousand gsa federal credits on interest and dividends last week until we fell out of the minimum amount bracket oh said miles he had a momentary flash about giving up war and playing the stock market instead the dendarii free mercenary holding company alas the emperor might have a word or two to say about that but these morons lieutenant bone gestured at the schematic representing her version of danios adventures that afternoon attempted to tap the account directly through its number instead of through fleet central accounting as everyone has been told and told to do and because were riding so low at the moment it bounced sometimes i think im talking to the deaf more lurid bar graphs fountained up at her fingertips but i can only run it round and round for so long sir the investment account is now empty so of course its generating no extra money im not sure we can even make it six more days and if the credit transfer doesnt arrive then she flung up her hands the whole dendarii fleet could start to slide piecemeal into receivership oh miles rubbed his neck hed been mistaken his headache wasnt waning isnt there some way you can shift the stuff around from account to account to create er virtual money temporarily virtual money her lips curled in loathing to save the fleet just like in combat mercenary accounting he clasped his hands together between his knees and smiled up at her hopefully of course if its beyond your abilities her nostrils flared of course its not but the kind of thing youre talking about relies mostly on time lags earths financial network is totally integrated there are no time lags unless you want to start working it interstellar ill tell you what would work though her voice trailed off well maybe not what go to a major bank and get a shortterm loan against say some major capital equipment her eyes glancing around by implication through the walls to the triumph revealed what order of capital equipment she had in mind we might have to conceal certain other outstanding liens from them and the extent of depreciation not to mention certain ambiguities about what is and is not owned by the fleet corporation versus the captainownersbut at least it would be real money and what would commodore tung say when he found out that miles had mortgaged his command ship but tung wasnt here tung was on leave it could be all over by the time tung got back wed have to ask for two or three times the amount we really needed to be sure of getting enough lieutenant bone went on you would have to sign for it as senior corporation officer admiral naismith would have to sign for it miles reflected a man whose legal existence was strictlyvirtual not that an earth bank could be expected to find that out the dendarii fleet propped his identity most convincingly this could be almost the safest thing hed ever done go ahead and set it up lieutenant bone um use the triumph its the biggest thing weve got she nodded her shoulders straightening as she regained some of her accustomed serenity yes sir thank you sir miles sighed and shoved to his feet sitting down had been a mistake his tired muscles were seizing up her nostrils wrinkled as he passed upwind of her perhaps hed better take a few minutes to clean up it would be hard enough to explain his disappearance when he returned to the embassy without explaining his remarkable appearance as well virtual money he heard lieutenant bone mutter disapprovingly to her comconsole as he exited good god chapter four by the time miles had showered groomed and donned a fresh uniform and glossy spare boots his pills had cut in and he was feeling no pain at all when he caught himself whistling as he splashed on aftershave and adjusted a rather flashy and only demiregulation black silk scarf around his neck tucked into his greyandwhite jacket he decided hed better cut the dosage in half next round he was feeling much too good too bad the dendarii uniform did not include a beret one could tilt at a suitably rakish angle though he might order one added tung would probably approve tung had theories about how spiffy uniforms helped recruiting and morale miles was not entirely sure this wouldnt just result in acquiring a lot of recruits who wanted to play dressup private danio might like a beret miles abandoned the notion elli quinn was waiting patiently for him in the triumphs number six shuttle hatch corridor she swung gracefully to her feet and ahead of him into their shuttle remarking wed better hustle how long do you think your cousin can cover for you at the embassy i suspect its already a lost cause miles said strapping himself in beside her in light of the warnings on the pain pill packet about operating equipment he let her take the pilots seat again the little shuttle broke smoothly away from the side of the flagship and began to drop through its orbital clearance pattern miles meditated morosely on his probable reception when he showed up back at the embassy confinedtoquarters was the least he might expect though he plead mitigating circumstances for all he was worth he did not feel at all like hustling back to that doom here he was on earth on a warm summer night with a glamorous brilliant woman friend it was onlyhe glanced at his chronometer night life should just be getting rolling london with its huge population was an aroundtheclock town his heart rose inexplicably yet what might they do drinking was out god knew what would happen if he dropped alcohol on top of his current pharmaceutical load with his peculiar physiology except that it could be guaranteed not to improve his coordination a show it would immobilize them for a rather long time in one spot securitywise better to do something that kept them moving to hell with the cetagandans he was damned if he would become hostage to the mere fear of them let admiral naismith have one last fling before being hung back in the closet the lights of the shuttleport flashed beneath them reached up to pull them in as they rolled into their rented hardstand gsa federals per diem with its waiting dendarii guard miles blurted hey elli lets golets go window shopping and so it was they found themselves strolling in a fashionable arcade at midnight not just earths but the galaxys wares were spread out for the visitor with funds the passersby were a parade worth watching in their own right for the student of fad and fashion feathers were in this year and synthetic silk leather and fur in revival of primitive natural fabrics from the past and earth had such a lot of past to revive the young lady in thethe aztecviking outfit miles guessedleaning on the arm of the young man in faintly thcentury boots and plumes particularly caught his eye perhaps a dendarii beret wouldnt be too unprofessionally archaic after all elli miles observed sadly was not relaxing and enjoying this her attention on the passersby was more in the nature of a hunt for concealed weapons and sudden movements but she paused at last in real intrigue before a shop discreetly labeled cultured furs a division of galactech bioengineering miles eased her inside the display area was spacious a sure tipoff to the price range they were operating in red fox coats white tiger carpets extinct leopard jackets gaudy tau cetan beaded lizard bags and boots and belts black and white macaque monkey vestsa holovid display ran a continuous program explaining the stocks origins not in the slaughter of live animals but in the test tubes and vats of galactechs rd division nineteen extinct species were offered in natural colors coming up for the fall line the vid assured them were rainbow rhino leather and triplelength white fox in designer pastels elli buried her hands to the wrists in something that looked like an explosion of apricot persian cat does it shed miles inquired bemusedly not at all the salesman assured them galactech cultured furs are guaranteed not to shed fade or discolor they are also soilresistant an enormous width of silky black fur poured through ellis arms what is this not a coat ah thats a very popular new item said the salesman the very latest in biomechanical feedback systems most of the fur items you see here are ordinary tanned leathersbut this is a live fur this model is suitable for a blanket spread or throw rug various sorts of outerwear are upcoming from rd next year a live fur her eyebrows rose enchantingly the salesman rose on his toes in unconscious echoellis face was having its usual effect on the uninitiated a live fur the salesman nodded but with none of the defects of a live animal it neither sheds nor eats nor he coughed discreetly requires a litter box hold on said miles how can you advertise it as living then wheres it getting its energy from if not the chemical breakdown of food an electromagnetic net in the cellular level passively gathers energy from the environment holovid carrier waves and the like and every month or so if it seems to be running down you can give it a boost by placing it in your microwave for a few minutes on the lowest setting cultured furs cannot be responsible however for the results if the owner accidentally sets it on high that still doesnt make it alive miles objected i assure you said the salesman this blanket was blended from the very finest assortment of felis domesticus genes we also have the white persian and the chocolatepoint siamese stripe in stock in the natural colors and i have samples of decorator colors that can be ordered in any size they did that to a cat miles choked as elli gathered up the whole huge boneless doublearmful pet it the salesman instructed elli eagerly she did so and laughed it purrs yes it also has programmable thermotaxic orientationin other words it snuggles up elli wrapped it around herself completely black fur cascading over her feet like the train of a queens robe and rubbed her cheek into the silky shimmer what wont they think of next oh my you want to rub it all over your skin you do muttered miles dubiously then his eyes widened as he pictured elli in all her lovely skin lolling on the hairy thing you do he said in an entirely changed tone his lips peeled back in a hungry grin he turned to the salesman well take it the embarrassment came when he pulled out his credit card stared at it and realized he couldnt use it it was lieutenant vorkosigans chock full of his embassy pay and utterly compromising to his present cover quinn beside him glanced over his shoulder at his hesitation he tilted the card toward her to see shielded in his palm and their eyes met ah no she agreed no no she reached for her wallet i should have asked the price first miles thought to himself as they exited the shop carting the unwieldy bundle in its elegant silver plastic wrappings the package the salesman had finally convinced them did not require airholes well the fur had delighted elli and a chance to delight elli was not to be lost for mere imprudenceor prideon his part he wanted to delight her he would pay her back later but now where could they go to try it out he tried to think as they exited the arcade and made their way to the nearest tubeway access port he didnt want the night to end he didnt know what he did want no he knew perfectly well what he wanted he just didnt know if he could have it elli he suspected didnt know how for his thought had taken him either a little romance on the side was one thing the change of career he was thinking of proposing to hernice turn of phrase thatwould overturn her existence elli the spaceborn who called all downsiders dirtsuckers in careless moments elli with a career agenda of her own elli who walked on land with all the dubious distaste of a mermaid out of water elli was an independent country elli was an island and he was an idiot and this couldnt go on unresolved much longer or he would burst a view of earths famous moon miles figured was what they needed preferably shining on water the towns old river unfortunately went underground in this sector absorbed into arterial pipes below the rdcentury building boom that had domed the half of the landscape not occupied by dizzily soaring spires and preserved historic architecture quietude some fine and private place was not easy to come by in a city of roiling millions the graves a fine and private place but none i think do there embrace the deathly flashbacks to dagoola had faded of late weeks but this one took him unawares in an ordinary public lift tube descending to the bubblecar system elli was falling torn out of his numb grip by a vicious vortex design defect in the antigrav systemswallowed by darkness miles ow elli objected let go of my arm whats the matter falling miles gasped of course were falling this is the downtube are you all right let me see the pupils of your eyes she grabbed a handgrip and pulled them to the side of the tube out of the central fast traffic zone midnight londoners continued to flow past them hell had been modernized miles decided wildly and this was a river of lost souls gurgling down some cosmic drain faster and faster the pupils of her eyes were large and dark do your eyes get dilated or constricted when you get one of your weird drug reactions she demanded worriedly her face centimeters from his what are they doing now pulsing im all right miles swallowed the surgeon doublechecks anything she puts me on now it may make me a little dizzy she told me that he had not loosed his grip in the lift tube miles realized suddenly their height difference was voided they hung face to face his boots dangling above her ankleshe didnt even need to hunt up a box to stand on nor risk a twist in his neckimpulsively his lips dove onto hers there was a splitsecond wail of terror in his mind like the moment after hed plunged from the rocks into thirty meters of clear green water that he knew was icy cold after hed surrendered all choice to gravity but before the consequences engulfed him the water was warm warm her eyes widened in surprise he hesitated losing his precious forward momentum and began to withdraw her lips parted for him and her arm clamped around the back of his neck she was an athletic woman the grip was a nonregulation but effective immobilization surely the first time his being pinned to the mat had meant hed won he devoured her lips ravenously kissed her cheeks eyelids brow nose chinwhere was the sweet well of her mouth there yes the bulky package containing the live fur began to drift bumping down the lift tube they were jostled by a descending woman who frowned at them a teenage boy shooting down the center of the tube hooted and made rude explicit gestures and the beeper in ellis pocket went off awkwardly they recaptured the fur and scrambled off the first exit they came to and fled the tubes field through an archway onto a bubblecar platform they staggered into the open and stared at each other shaken in one lunatic moment miles realized hed upended their carefullybalanced working relationship and what were they now officer and subordinate man and woman friend and friend lover and lover it could be a fatal error it could also be fatal without the error dagoola had thrust that lesson home the person inside the uniform was larger than the soldier the man more complex than his role death could take not just him but her tomorrow and a universe of possibilities not just a military officer would be extinguished he would kiss her againdamn he could only reach her ivory throat now the ivory throat emitted a dismayed growl and she keyed open the channel on the secure comm link saying what the hell it cant be you youre here quinn here commander quinn ivan vorpatrils voice came small but clear is miles with you miless lips rippled in a snarl of frustration ivans timing was supernatural as ever yes why said quinn to the comm link well tell him to get his ass back here im holding a hole in the security net for him but i cant hold it much longer hell i cant stay awake much longer a long gasp that miles interpreted as a yawn wheezed from the comm link my god i didnt think he could really do it miles muttered he grabbed the comm link ivan can you really get me back in without being seen for about fifteen more minutes and i had to bend regs all to hell and gone to do it too im holding down the guard post on the third sublevel where the municipal power and sewer connections come through i can loop the vid record and cut out the shot of your entry but only if you get back here before corporal veli does i dont mind putting my tail on the line for you but i object to putting my tail on the line for nothing you copy elli was studying the colorful holovid display mapping the tubeway system you can just make it i think it wont do any good she grabbed his elbow and marched him toward the bubble cars the firm gleam of duty crowding out the softer light in her eyes well have ten more minutes together on the way miles massaged his face as she went to credit their tokens trying to rub his escaping rationality back through his skin by force he looked up to see his own dim reflection staring back at him from the mirrored wall shadowed by a pillar face suffused with frustration and terror he squeezed his eyes shut and looked again moving in front of the pillar and staring most unpleasantfor a second he had seen himself wearing his green barrayaran uniform damn the pain pills was his subconscious trying to tell him something well he didnt suppose he was in real trouble until a brain scan taken of him in his two different uniforms produced two different patterns upon reflection the idea was suddenly not funny he embraced quinn upon her return with more complicated feelings than sexual desire alone they stole kisses in the bubble carmore pain than pleasure by the time they reached their destination miles was in the most physically uncomfortable state of arousal he could ever recall surely all his blood had departed his brains to engorge his loins rendering him moronic by hypoxia and lust she left him on the platform in the embassy district with an anguished whisper of later it was only after the tubeway had swallowed her that miles realized shed left him holding the bag which was vibrating with a rhythmic purr nice kitty miles hoisted it with a sigh and began walkinghobblinghome he awoke blearily the next morning engulfed in rumbling black fur friendly thing isnt it remarked ivan miles fought his way clear spitting fuzz the salesman had lied clearly the nearbeast ate people not radiation it enveloped them secretly in the night and ingested them like an amoebahed left it on the foot of his bed dammit thousands of little kids sliding under their blankets to protect them from the monsters in their closets were in for a shocking surprise the cultured fur salesman was clearly a cetagandan agentprovocateur assassin ivan wearing his underwear and with his toothbrush sticking jauntily out between gleaming incisors paused to run his hands through the black silk it rippled as if trying to arch into the strokes ats amazing ivans unshaven jaw worked shifting the toothbrush around you want to rub it all over your skin miles pictured ivan lolling yech he shuddered god wheresa coffee downstairs after youre dressed all nice and regulation try to at least look as if youd been in bed since yesterday afternoon miles smelled trouble instantly when galeni called him alone into his office a half hour after their workshift started good morning lieutenant vorkosigan galeni smiled falsely affable galenis false smile was as horrendous as his rare real one was charming morning sir miles nodded warily all over your acute osteoinflammatory attack i see yes sir do sit down thank you sir miles sat gingerlyno pain pills this morning after last nights adventure topped by that unsettling hallucination in the tubeway miles had flushed them and made a mental note to tell his fleet surgeon that there was yet another med she could cross off his list galenis eyebrows drew down in a flash of doubt then his eye fell on miless bandaged right hand miles shifted in his seat and tried to be casual about tucking it behind the small of his back galeni grimaced sourly and keyed up his holovid display i picked up a fascinating item on the local news this morning said galeni i thought youd like to see it too i think id rather drop dead on your carpet sir miles had no doubt about what was coming damn and hed only worried about the cetagandan embassy picking it up the journalist from euronews network began her introductionclearly this part had been made a little later for the wineshop fire was dying down in the background when the cut with admiral naismiths smudged strained face came on it was still burning merrily unfortunate misunderstanding miles heard his own betan voice coughing i promise a full investigation the long shot of himself and the unhappy clerk rolling out the front door on fire was only moderately spectacular too bad it couldnt have been nighttime to bring out the full splendor of the pyrotechnics the frightened fury in the holovid naismiths face was faintly echoed in galenis miles felt a certain sympathy it was no pleasure commanding subordinates who failed to follow orders and sprang dangerous idiocies on you galeni was not going to be happy about this the news clip ended at last and galeni flipped the offswitch he leaned back in his chair and regarded miles steadily well this was not miless instincts warned him the time to get cute sir commander quinn called me away from the embassy yesterday afternoon to handle this situation because i was the closest ranking dendarii officer in the event her fears proved fully justified my prompt intervention did prevent unnecessary injuries perhaps deaths i must apologize for absenting myself without leave i cannot regret it however apologize purred galeni suppressing fury you were out awol unguarded in direct defiance of standing orders i missed the pleasure evidently by seconds of making my next report to security hq a query of where to ship your broiled body most interesting of all you managed to apparently teleport in and out of the embassy without leaving a ripple in my security records and you plan to wave it all off with an apology i think not lieutenant miles stood the only ground he had i was not without a bodyguard sir commander quinn was present i wave off nothing then you can begin by explaining precisely how you passed out and back in through my security net without anyone noticing you galeni leaned back in his chair with his arms folded frowning fiercely i here was the fork of the thing confession might be good for his soul but should he rat on ivan i left in a group of guests departing the reception through the main public entrance since i was wearing my dendarii uniform the guards assumed i was one of them and your return miles fell silent galeni ought to be put in full possession of the facts in order to repair his net but among other things miles didnt know himself exactly how ivan had diddled the vid scanners not to mention the guard corporal hed fallen into bed without asking the details you cannot protect vorpatril lieutenant remarked galeni hes my meat next after you what makes you think ivan was involved miless mouth went on buying time to think no he should have thought first galeni looked disgusted get serious vorkosigan miles took a breath everything ivan did he did at my command the responsibility is entirely mine if youll agree that no charges will fall upon him ill ask him to give you a complete report on how he created the temporary hole in the net you will eh galenis lips twisted has it occurred to you yet that lieutenant vorpatril is above you in this chain of command no sir gulped miles it er slipped my mind his too it appears sir i had originally planned to be gone only a short time and arranging my return was the least of my worries as the situation extended itself it was apparent to me that i should return openly but when i did get back it was two in the morning and hed gone to a great deal of troubleit seemed ungrateful and besides galeni interpolated sotto voce it looked like it might work miles suppressed an involuntary grin ivan is an innocent party charge me as you wish sir thank you lieutenant for your kind permission goaded miles snapped dammit sir what would you have of me the dendarii are as much barrayaran troops as any who wear the emperors uniform even if they dont know it they are my assigned charge i cannot neglect their urgent needs even to play the part of lieutenant vorkosigan galeni rocked back in his chair his eyebrows shooting up play the part of lieutenant vorkosigan who do you think you are im miles fell silent seized by a sudden vertigo like falling down a defective lift tube for a dizzy moment he could not even make sense of the question the silence lengthened galeni folded his hands on his desk with an unsettled frown his voice went mild lose track did you im miless hands opened helplessly its my duty when im admiral naismith to be admiral naismith as hard as i can i dont usually have to switch back and forth like this galeni cocked his head but naismith isnt real you said so yourself uh right sir naismith isnt real miles inhaled but his duties are we must set up some more rational arrangement for me to be able to carry them out galeni did not seem to realize that when miles had however inadvertantly entered his chain of command it had expanded not by one but by five thousand yet if he did awake to the fact might he start messing with the dendarii miless teeth closed on the impulse to point out this possibility in any way a hot flash ofjealousyshot through him let galeni continue please god to think of the dendarii as miless personal affair hm galeni rubbed his forehead yes wellin the meantime when admiral naismiths duties call you come to me first lieutenant vorkosigan he sighed consider yourself on probation i would order you confined to quarters but the ambassador has specifically requested your presence for escort duties this afternoon but be aware that i could have made serious charges disobeying a direct order for instance im keenly aware of that sir uh and ivan well see about ivan galeni shook his head apparently contemplating ivan miles couldnt blame him yes sir said miles deciding hed pushed as hard as he dared for now dismissed great thought miles sardonically exiting galenis office first he thought i was insubordinate now he just thinks im crazy whoever i am the afternoons politicalsocial event was a reception and dinner in honor of a visit to earth of the baba of lairouba the baba hereditary headofstate of his planet was combining political and religious duties after completing his pilgrimage to mecca he had come to london for participation in the rightofpassage talks for the western orion arm group of planets tau ceti was the hub of this nexus and komarr connected to it through two routes hence barrayars interest miless duties were the usual in this case he found himself partnering one of the babas four wives he wasnt sure whether to classify her as a dread dowager or nother bright brown eyes and smooth chocolate hands were pretty enough but the rest of her was swathed in yards of creamy silk edged with gold embroidery that suggested a zaftig pulchritude like a very enticing mattress her wit he could not gauge as she spoke neither english french russian nor greek in their barrayaran dialects or any other and he spoke neither lairouban nor arabic the box of keyed translator earbugs had unfortunately been misdelivered to an unknown address on the other side of london leaving half the diplomats present able only to stare at their counterparts and smile miles and the lady communicated basic needs by mimesalt maamwith good will through dinner and he made her laugh twice he wished he knew why even more unfortunately before the afterdinner speeches could be cancelled a box of replacement earbugs was delivered by a panting caterers assist ant there followed several speeches in a variety of tongues for the benefit of the press corps things broke up the zaftig lady was swept off miless hands by two of her cowives and he began to make his way across the room back to the barrayaran ambassadors party hounding a soaring alabaster pillar holding up the arched ceiling he came face to face with the lady journalist from euronews network man dieu its the little admiral she said cheerfully what are you doing here ignoring the anguished scream inside his skull miles schooled his features to anexquisitelypolite blankness i beg your pardon maam admiral naismith or she took in his uniform her eyes lighting with interest is this some mercenary covert operation admiral a beat passed miles allowed his eyes to widen his hand to stray to his weaponless trouser seam and twitch there my god he choked in a voice of horrornot hard thatdo you mean to tell me admiral naismith has been seen on earth her chin lifted and her lips parted in a little halfsmile of disbelief in your mirror surely were his eyebrows visibly singed his right hand was still bandaged not a burn maam miles thought wildly i cut it shaving miles came to full attention snapping his polished boot heels together and favored her with a small formal bow in a proud hard and thickly barrayaranaccented voice he said you are mistaken maam i am lord miles vorkosigan of barrayar lieutenant in the imperial service not that i dont aspire to the rank you name but its a trifle premature she smiled sweetly are you entirely recovered from your burns sir miless eyebrows roseno he shouldnt have drawn attention to themnaismiths been burned you have seen him when can we speak of this the man you name is of the greatest interest to barrayaran imperial security she looked him up and down so i would imagine since you are one and the same come come over here and how was he going to get out of this one he took her by the elbow and steered her toward a private corner of course we are the same admiral naismith of the dendarii mercenaries is my illegitimate twin brother no that didnt scan light didnt just dawn it came like a nuclear flash at ground zero clone miles finished smoothly what her certainty cracked her attention riveted upon him my clone miles repeated in a firmer voice hes an extraordinary creation we think though weve never been able to confirm it that he was the result of an intended cetagandan covert operation that went greatly awry the cetagandans are certainly capable of the medical end of it anyway the real facts of their military genetic experiments would horrify you miles paused that last was true enough who are you by the way lise vallerie she flashed her press cube at him euronews network the very fact she was willing to reintroduce herself confirmed hed chosen the right tack ah he drew back from her slightly the news services i didnt realize excuse me maam i should not be talking to you without permission from my superiors he made to turn away no waitahlord vorkosigan ohyoure not related to that vorkosigan are you he jerked up his chin and tried to look stern my father oh she breathed in a tone of enlightenment that explains it thought it might miles thought smugly he made a few more little escapingmotions she clamped to him like a limpet no please if you dont tell me i shall surely investigate it on my own well miles paused its all rather old data from our point of view i can tell you a few things i suppose since it impinges upon me so personally but it is not for public dissemination you must give me your word of that first a barrayaran vor lords word is his bond is it not she said i never reveal my sources very well nodded miles pretending he was under the impression shed promised though her words in fact had said nothing of the sort he nabbed a pair of chairs and they settled themselves out of the way of the roboservers clearing the banquet debris miles cleared his throat and launched himself the biological construct who calls himself admiral naismith is perhaps the most dangerous man in the galaxy cunningresoluteboth cetagandan and barrayaran security have attempted in the past to assassinate him without success hes started to build himself a powerbase with his dendarii mercenaries we still dont know what his longrange plans for this private army are except that he must have some valleries finger went to her lips doubtfully he seemedpleasant enough when i spoke with him allowing for the circumstance a brave man certainly aye theres the genius and the wonder of the man cried miles then decided hed better tone it down a bit charisma surely the cetagandans if it was the cetagandans must have intended something extraordinary for him hes a military genius you know wait a moment she said he is a true clone you saynot just an exterior copy then he must be even younger than yourself yes his growth his education were artificially accelerated apparently to the limits of the process but where have you seen him here in london she answered started to say more and then stopped but you say barrayar is trying to kill him she drew away from him slightly i think perhaps id better let you trace him yourselves oh not anymore miles laughed shortly now we just keep track of him hed dropped out of sight recently you see which makes my own security extremely nervous clearly he must have been originally created for some sort of substitution plot aimed ultimately against my father but seven years ago he went renegade broke away from his captorscreators and started working for himself webarrayarknow too much about him now and he and i have diverged too much for him to attempt to replace me at this late date she eyed him he could he really could almost miles smiled grimly but if you could ever get us in the same room youd see i was almost two centimeters taller than he is late growth on my part hormone treatments his invention must give out soonhe babbled on the cetagandans however are still trying to kill him so for thats the best proof we have that hes actually their creation clearly he must know too much about something wed dearly love to know what he favored her with an inviting canine smile horribly false she drew back slightly more miles let his fists close angrily the most offensive thing about the man is his nerve he might at least have picked another name for himself but he flaunts mine perhaps he became used to it when he was training to be me as he must have done once he speaks with a betan accent and takes my mothers betan maiden name for his surname betanstyle and do you know why yeah why why she shook her head mutely staring at him in repelled fascination because by betan law regarding clones he would actually be my legal brother thats why he attempts to gain a false legitimacy for himself im not sure why it may be a key to his weakness he must have a weakness somewhere some chink in his armor besides hereditary insanity of coursehe broke off panting slightly let her think it was from suppressed rage and not suppressed terror the ambassador thank god was motioning at him from across the room his party assembled to depart pardon me maam miles rose i must leave you but ah if you encounter the false naismith again i should consider it a great service if you would get in touch with me at the barrayaran embassy pour quoi her lips moved slightly rather warily she rose too miles bowed over her hand executed a neat aboutface and fled he had to restrain himself from skipping down the steps to the palais de london in the ambassadors wake genius he was a frigging genius why hadnt he thought of this cover story years ago imperial security chief illyan was going to love it even galeni might be slightly cheered chapter five miles camped in the corridor outside captain galenis office the day the courier returned for the second time from sector hq exercising great restraint miles did not trample the man in the doorway as he exited but he let him clear the frame before plunging within miles came to parade rest before galenis desk sir yes yes lieutenant i know said galeni irritably waving him to wait silence fell while screen after screen of data scrolled above galenis vid plate at the end galeni sat back creases deepening between his eyes sir miles reiterated urgently galeni still frowning rose and motioned miles to his station see for yourself miles ran it through twice sirtheres nothing here so i noticed miles spun to face him no credit chitno ordersno explanationno nothing no reference to my affairs at all weve waited here twenty bleeding days for nothing we could have walked to tau ceti and back in that time this is insane this is impossible galeni leaned thoughtfully on his desk on one splayed hand staring at the silent vid plate impossible no ive seen orders lost before bureaucratic screwups important data misaddressed urgent requests filled away while waiting for someone to return from leave that sort of thing happens it doesnt happen to me hissed miles through his teeth one of galenis eyebrows rose you are an arrogant little vorling he straightened but i suspect you speak the truth that sort of thing wouldnt happen to you anybody else yes not you of course he almost smiled theres a first time for everything this is the second time miles pointed out he glowered suspiciously at galeni wild accusations boiling behind his lips was this some bourgeois komarrans idea of a practical joke if the orders and credit chit werent there they had to have been intercepted unless the queries hadnt been sent at all he had only galenis word that they had but it was inconceivable that galeni would risk his career merely to inconvenience an irritating subordinate not that a barrayaran captains pay was much loss as miles well knew not like eighteen million marks miless eyes widened and his teeth closed behind set lips a poor man a man whose family had lost all its great wealth in say the conquest of komarr could conceivably find eighteen million marks tempting indeed worth riskingmuch for it wasnt the way he would have read galeni but what after all did miles really know about the man galeni hadnt spoken one word about his personal history in twenty days acquaintance what are you going to do now sir miles jerked out stiffly galeni spread his hands send again send again thats all i cant pull your eighteen million marks out of my pocket lieutenant oh no well just see about that he had to get out of here out of the embassy and back to the dendarii the dendarii where he had left his own fully professional informationgathering experts gathering dust while hed wasted twenty days in immobilized paralysis if galeni had indeed diddled him to that extent miles swore silently there wasnt going to be a hole deep enough for him to hide in with his eighteen million stolen marks galeni straightened and cocked his head eyes narrowed and absent its a mystery to me he added lowly almost to himself and i dont like mysteries nervy cool miles was struck with admiration for an acting ability almost equal to his own yet if galeni had embezzled his money why was he not long gone what was he waiting around for some signal miles didnt know about but he would find out oh yes he would ten more days said miles again sorry lieutenant said galeni still abstracted you will be sir i must have a day with the dendarii admiral naismiths duties are piling up for one thing thanks to this delay were now absolutely forced to raise a temporary loan from commercial sources to stay current with our expenses i have to arrange it i regard your personal security with the dendarii as totally insufficient vorkosigan so add some from the embassy if you feel you have to the clone story surely took some of the pressure off the clone story was idiotic snapped galeni coming out of himself it was brilliant said miles offended at this criticism of his creation it completely compartmentalizes naismith and vorkosigan at last it disposes of the most dangerous ongoing weakness of the whole scam my unique and memorable appearance undercover operatives shouldnt be memorable what makes you think that vid reporter will ever share her discoveries with the cetagandans anyway we were seen together by millions on the holovid for gods sake oh theyll be around to ask her questions all right one way or another a slight twinge of fearbut surely the cetagandans would send somebody to pump the woman subtly not just snatch drain and dispose of her not a publicly prominent earth citizen right here on earth in that case why the hell did you pick the cetagandans as admiral naismiths putative creators the one thing theyll know for sure is that they didnt do it verisimilitude explained miles if even we dont know where the clone really came from they might not be so surprised that they hadnt heard of him till now either your logic has a few glaring weaknesses sneered galeni it may help your longterm scam possibly but it doesnt help me having admiral naismiths corpse on my hands would be just as embarrassing as having lord vorkosigans schizoid or no not even you can compartmentalize yourself to that extent i am not schizoid miles bit off a little manicdepressive maybe he admitted in afterthought galenis lips twitched know thyself we try sir galeni paused then chose perhaps wisely to ignore that one he snorted and went on very well lieutenant vorkosigan ill assign sergeant earth to supply you with a security perimeter but i want you to report in no less than every eight hours by secured comm link you may have twentyfour hours leave miles drawing breath to marshall his next argument was bereft of speech oh he managed thank you sir and why the hell did galeni just flipflop like that miles would give blood and bone to know what was going on behind that deadpan roman profile right now miles withdrew in good order before galeni could change his mind again the dendarii had chosen the most distant hardstand of those available for rent at the london shuttleport for security not economy the fact that the distance also made it the cheapest was merely an added and delightful bonus the hardstand was actually in the open at the far end of the field surrounded by lots of empty naked tarmac nothing could sneak up on it without being seen and if anyuntoward activitydid happen to take place around it miles reflected it was therefore less likely to fatally involve innocent civilian bystanders the choice had been a logical one it was also a damned long walk miles tried to step out briskly and not scurry like a spider across a kitchen floor was he getting a trifle paranoid as well as schizoid and manicdepressive sergeant earth marching along beside him uncomfortably in civvies had wanted to deliver him to the shuttles hatch in the embassys armored groundcar with difficulty miles had persuaded him that seven years of painfully careful subterfuge would go up in smoke if admiral naismith was ever seen getting out of a barrayaran official vehicle the good view from the shuttle hardstand was something that cut two ways alas still nothing could sneak up on them unless it was psychologically disguised of course take that big shuttleport maintenance float truck over there for instance speeding along busily hugging the ground they were all over the place the eye quickly became used to their irregular passing if he were going to launch an attack miles decided one of those would definitely be the vehicle of choice it was wonderfully doubtful until it fired first no defending dendarii could be sure he or she wasntabout to randomly murder some hapless stray shuttleport employee criminally embarrassing that the sort of mistake that wrecked careers the float truck shifted its route barth twitched and miles stiffened it looked awfully like an interception course but dammit no windows or doors were opening no armed men were leaning out to take aim with so much as a slingshot miles and barth both drew their legal stunners anyway miles tried to separate himself from barth as barth tried to step in front of him another precious moments confusion and then the nowhurtling float truck was upon them rising into the air blotting out the bright morning sky its smooth sealed surface offered no target a stunner would matter to the method of his assassination was at last clear to miles it was to be death by squashing miles squeaked and spun and scrambled trying to get up a sprint the float truck fell like a monstrous brick as its antigrav was abruptly switched off it seemed like overkill somehow didnt they know his bones could be shattered by an overloaded grocery pallet thered be nothing left of him but a revolting wet smear on the tarmac he dove rolledonly the blast of displaced air as the truck boomed to the pavement saved him he opened his eyes to find the skirt of the truck centimeters in front of his nose and recoiled onto his feet as the maintenance vehicle rose again where was barth the useless stunner was still clutched convulsively in miless right hand his knuckles scraped and bleeding ladder handholds were recessed into a channel on the trucks gleaming side if he were on it he couldnt be under itmiles shook the stunner from his grip and sprang almost too late to cling to the handholds the truck lurched sideways and flopped again obliterating the spot where hed just been lying it rose and fell again with an angry crash like an hysterical giant trying to smash a spider with a slipper the impact knocked miles from his precarious perch and he hit the pavement rolling trying to save his bones there was no crack in the floor here to scuttle into and hide a line of light widened under the truck as it rose again miles looked for a reddened lump on the tarmac saw none barth no over there crouched at a distance screaming into his wrist comm miles shot to his feet zigged zagged his heart was pounding so hard it seemed his blood was about to burst from his ears on adrenalin overload his breathing halfstopped despite his straining lungs sky and tarmac spun around him hed lost the shuttleno therehe started to sprint toward it running had never been his best sport theyd been right the people whod wanted to disbar him from officers training on the basis of his physicals with a deep vile whine the maintenance truck clawed its way into the air behind him the violent white blast blew him forward onto his face skidding over the tarmac shards of metal glass and boiling plastic spewed across him something glanced numbly across the back of his skull he clapped his arms over his head and tried to melt a hole down into the pavement by heat of fear alone his ears hammered but he could only hear a land of roaring white noise a millisecond more and he realized he was a stopped target he jerked onto his side glaring up and around for the falling truck there was no more falling truck a shiny black aircar however was dropping swiftly and illegally through shuttleport traffic control space no doubt lighting up boards and setting off alarms on the londoners control computers well it was a lost cause now to try and be inconspicuous miles had it pegged as barrayaran outerperimeter backup even before he glimpsed the green uniforms within by virtue of the fact that barth was running toward it eagerly no guarantee that the three dendarii sprinting toward them from his personnel shuttle had drawn the same conclusions though miles sprang to hishands and knees the abrupt if aborted movement rendered him dizzy and sick on the second attempt he made it to his feet barth was trying to drag him by the elbow toward the settling aircar back to the embassy sir he urged a cursing greyuniformed dendarii skidded to a halt a few meters away and aimed his plasma arc at barth back off you the dendarii snarled miles stepped hastily between the two as barths hand went to his jacket friends friends he cried flipping his hands palmout toward both combatants the dendarii paused doubtful and suspicious and barth clenched his fists at his sides with an effort elli quinn cantered up swinging a rocketlauncher onehanded its stock nestled in her armpit smoke still trickling from its fivecentimeterswide muzzle she must have fired from the hip her face was flushed and terrorized sergeant barth eyed the rocketlauncher with suppressed fury that was a little close dont you think he snapped at elli you damn near blew him up with your target jealous miles realized because he hadnt had a rocket launcher ellis eyes widened in outrage it was better than nothing which was what you came equipped with apparently miles raised his right handhis left shoulder spasmed when he tried to raise the other armand dabbed gingerly at the back of his head his hand came away red and wet scalp wound bleeding like a stuck pig but not dangerous another clean uniform shot its awkward to carry major ordnance on the tubeway elli miles intervened mildly nor could we have gotten it through shuttleport security he paused and eyed the smoking remnant of the float truck even they couldnt get weapons through shuttleport security it seems whoever they were he nodded significantly toward the second dendarii who taking the hint went off to investigate come away sir barth urged anew youre injured the police will be here you shouldnt be mixed up in this lieutenant lord vorkosigan shouldnt be mixed up in this he meant and he was absolutely right god yes sergeant go take a circuitous route back to the embassy dont let anyone trace you but sir my own securitywhich has just demonstrated its effectiveness i thinkwill take over now go captain galeni will have my head on a platter if sergeant simon illyan himself will have my head on a platter if my cover is blown thats an order go the dreaded chief of imperial security was a name to conjure with torn and distressed barth allowed miles to chivvy him toward the aircar miles breathed a sigh of relief as it streaked away galeni really would lock him in the basement forever if he went back now the dendarii guard was returning grim and a little green from the scattered remains of the float truck two men sir he reported at least i think they were male and there were at least two judging from the number of um parts remaining miles looked at elli and sighed nothing left to question eh she shrugged an insincere apology ohyoure bleeding she closed on him fussily damn if there had been something left to question miles would have been in favor of shoveling it onto the shuttle and taking off clearance or no clearance to continue his investigation in the triumphs sickbay unimpeded by the legal constraints that would doubtless delay the local authorities the london constables could scarcely be more unhappy with him anyway from the looks of things hed be dealing with them again shortly fire equipment and shuttleport vehicles were converging on them even now still the london police employed some individuals an army much larger if less heavily equipped than his own maybe he could sic them on the cetagandans or whoever was behind this who were those guys asked the dendarii guard glancing in the direction the black aircar had gone never mind said miles they werent here you never saw em yes sir he loved the dendarii they didnt argue with him he submitted to ellis first aid and began mentally marshalling his story for the police the police and he were doubtless going to be quite tired of each other before his visit to earth was over before the forensic lab team had even arrived on the tarmac miles turned to find lise vallerie at his elbow he should have expected her since lord vorkosigan had exerted himself to repel her admiral naismith now marshalled his charm struggling to remember just which of his personas had told her what admiral naismith trouble certainly seems to follow you she began this did he said affably smiling up at her with what fragmented calm he could muster under the circumstances the holovid man was off recording elsewhere onsiteshe must be trying to set up something more than an offthecuff spot interview who were those men a very good question now in the lap of the london police my personal theory is that they were cetagandan seeking revenge for certain dendarii operations ah not against them but in support of one of their victims but you had better not quote that no proof you could be sued for defamation or something not if its a quote you dont think they were barrayarans barrayarans what do you know of barrayar he let startlement segue into bemusement ive been looking into your past she smiled by asking the barrayarans i trust you dont believe everything they say of me i didnt they think you were created by the cetagandans ive been looking for independent corroboration from my own private sources i found an immigrant who used to work in a cloning laboratory his memory was somewhat lacking in detail unfortunately he had been forcibly debriefed at the time he was fired what he could remember was appalling the dendarii free mercenary fleet is officially registered out of jacksons whole is it not a legal convenience only were not connected in any other way if thats what youre asking youve been doing some homework eh miles craned his neck over by a police groundcar elli quinn was gesticulating vividly to an earnest constable captain of course said vallerie id like with your cooperation to do an indepth feature on you i think it would be extremely interesting to our viewers ah the dendarii do not seek publicity quite the reverse it could endanger our operations and operatives you personally then nothing current how you came to this who had you cloned and whyi already know from whom your early memories i understand you underwent accelerated growth and hypnotic training what was it like and so on it was unpleasant he said shortly her offered feature was a tempting notion indeed apart from the fact that after galeni had him skinned illyan would have him stuffed and mounted and he rather liked vallerie it was all very well to float a few useful fictions into the air through her but too close an association with him just nowhe glanced across the tarmac at the police lab team now arrived and poking about the remains of the float truckcould be bad for her health i have a better idea why dont you do an expose on the civilian illegal cloning business its been done yet the practices still go on apparently not enough has been done she looked less than thrilled if you would work closely with me admiral naismith you would have some input into the feature if you dontwell you are news fair game he shook his head reluctantly sorry youre on your own the scene by the police groundcar compelled his attention excuse me he said distractedly she shrugged and went to catch up with her vidman as miles jogged off they were taking elli away dont worry miles ive been arrested before she tried to reassure him its no big deal commander quinn is my personal bodyguard miles protested to the police captain and she was on duty manifestly she still is i need her sh miles calm down elli whispered to him or they could end up taking you too me im the bloody victim its those two goons who tried to flatten me who should be under arrest well theyre taking them away too as soon as the forensic guys get the bags filled you cant expect the authorities to just take our word for it all theyll check out the facts theyll corroborate our story then theyll release me she twinkled a smile at the captain who melted visibly policemen are human too didnt your mother ever tell you never to get in a car with strangers miles muttered but she was right if he kicked up much more fuss it might occur to the constables to order his shuttle grounded or worse he wondered if the dendarii would ever get back the rocketlauncher now impounded as the murder weapon he wondered if getting his key bodyguard arrested was step one of a deeplaid plot against him he wondered if his fleet surgeon had any psychoactive drugs to treat galloping paranoia if she did hed probably be allergic to them he ground his teeth and took a deep calming breath a twoman dendarii minishuttle was rolling up to the hardstand what was this now miles glanced at his wrist chrono and realized hed lost almost five hours out of his precious twentyfour fooling around here at the shuttleport knowing what time it was he knew who had arrived and swore in frustration under his breath elli used the new distraction to prod the police captain into motion sketching miles a breezy reassuring salute by way of farewell the reporter thank god had gone off to interview the shuttleport authorities lieutenant bone squeakyclean polished and striking in her best velvet dress greys exited her shuttle and approached the remnant of men left at the foot of the larger shuttles ramp admiral naismith sir are you ready for our appointment oh dear he flashed her a toothy grin from his bruised and dirtsmudged face conscious of his hair matted and sticky with drying blood his bloodsoaked collar and spattered jacket and ripped trouser knees would you buy a used pocket dreadnought from this man he chirped at her it wont do she sighed the bank were dealing with is very conservative no sense of humor not where their money is concerned right he bit short further quips they were too close to nervousinvoluntary he made to run his hands through his hair winced and changed the gesture to a gentle probing touch around the temporary plas dressing and all my spare uniforms are in orbitand im not anxious to go carting around london without quinn at my back not now anyway and i need to see the surgeon about this shoulder theres something still not right throbbing agony if you wanted to get technical about itand there are some new and serious doubts about just where our outstanding credit transfer went oh she said alert to the essential point nasty doubts which i need to check out all right he sighed yielding to the inevitable cancel our appointment at the bank for today set up another one for tomorrow if you can yes sir she saluted and moved off ah he called after her you neednt mention why i was unavoidably detained eh one corner of her mouth tugged upward i wouldnt dream of it she assured him fervently back in close earth orbit aboard the triumph a visit to his fleet surgeon revealed a hairline crack in miless left scapula a diagnosis which surprised him not at all the surgeon treated it with electrastim and put his left arm in an excessively annoying plastic immobilizer miles bitched until the surgeon threatened to put his entire body in a plastic immobilizer he slunk out of sickbay as soon as she was done treating the gouge on the back of his head before she got carried away with the obvious medical merit of the idea after getting cleaned up miles tracked down captain elena botharijesek one of the triumvirate of dendarii who knew his real identity the other being her husband and miless fleet engineer commodore baz jesek elena in fact probably knew as much about miles as he did himself she was the daughter of his late bodyguard and they had grown up together she had become an officer of the dendarii by miless fiat back when hed created them or found them lying around or however one wanted to describe the chaotic beginnings of this whole hideously overextended covert op been named an officer rather she had become one since then by sweat and guts and fierce study her concentration was intense and her fidelity was absolute and miles was as proud of her as if hed invented her himself his other feelings about her were no ones business as he entered the wardroom elena sketched him a greeting that was halfway between a wave and a salute and smiled her somber smile miles returned her a nod and slid into a seat at her table hello elena ive got a security mission for you her long lithe body was folded into her chair her dark eyes luminous with curiosity her short black hair was a smooth cap framing her face pale skin features not beautiful yet elegant sculptured like a hunting wolfhound miles regarded his own short square hands folded on the table lest he lose his eye in the subtle planes of that face still always ah miles glanced around the room and caught the eye of a couple of interested techs at a nearby table sorry fellows not for you he jerked his thumb and they grinned and took the hint and their coffee and clattered out what sort of security mission she said biting into her sandwich this one is to be sealed on both ends from both the dendarii point of view and that of the barrayaran embassy here on earth especially from the embassy a courier job i want you to get a ticket on the fastest available commercial transport to tau ceti and take a message from lieutenant vorkosigan to the imperial security sector headquarters at the embassy there my barrayaran commanding officer here on earth doesnt know im sending you and id like to keep it that way im not anxious to deal with the barrayaran command structure she said mildly after a moment watching her own hands she was i know but since this involves both my identities it has to be either you baz or elli quinn the london police have elli under arrest and i cant very well send your husband some confused underling on tau ceti might try to arrest him elena glanced up from her hands at that why were the desertion charges against baz never dropped by barrayar i tried i thought i almost had them persuaded but then simon illyan had a spasm of twitchiness and decided leaving the arrest warrant outstanding if not actually pursued gave him an extra handle on baz in case of er emergencies it also gives a little artistic depth to the dendariis cover as a truly independent outfit i thought illyan was wrongin fact i told him so till he finally ordered me to shut up on the subject someday when im giving the orders ill see thats changed her eyebrow quirked it could be a long wait at your present rate of promotionlieutenant my dads sensitive to charges of nepotism captain he picked up the sealed data disk hed been pushing about onehanded on the table top i want you to give this into the hand of the senior military attache on tau ceti commodore destang dont send it in via anyone else because among my other suspicions is the nasty one that there may be a leak in the barrayaran courier channel between here and there i think the problems on this end but if im wrong god i hope it isnt destang himself paranoid she inquired solicitously getting more so by the minute having mad emperor yuri in my family tree doesnt help a bit im always wondering if im starting to come down with his disease can you be paranoid about being paranoid she smiled sweetly if anyone can its you hm well this particular paranoia is a classic i softened the language in the message to destangyou better read it before you embark after all what would you think of a young officer who was convinced his superiors were out to get him she tilted her head winged eyebrows climbing quite miles nodded he tapped the disk with one forefinger the purpose of your trip is to test a hypothesisonly a hypothesis mind youthat the reason our eighteen million marks arent here is that they disappeared en route just possibly into dear captain galenis pockets no corroborative evidence yet such as galenis sudden and permanent disappearance and its not the sort of charge a young and ambitious officer had better make by mistake ive embedded it in four other theories in the report but thats the one im hot about you must find out if hq ever dispatched our money you dont sound hot you sound unhappy yes well its certainly the messiest possibility it has a deal of forceful logic behind it so whats the hook galenis a komarran who cares so much the more likely that youre right then i care miles shook his head what after all were barrayaran internal politics to elena who had sworn passionately never to set foot on her hated home world again she shrugged and uncoiled to her feet pocketing the disk he did not attempt to capture her hands he did not make a single move that might embarrass them both old friends were harder to come by than new lovers oh my oldest friend still always chapter six he ate a sandwich and slurped coffee for dinner in his cabin while he perused dendarii fleet status reports repairs had been completed and approved on the triumphs surviving combat drop shuttles and paid for alas the money now passed beyond recall refit chores were all caught up throughout the fleet downside leaves used up spit spat and polish polished off boredom was setting in boredom and bankruptcy the cetagandans had it all wrong miles decided bitterly it wasnt war that would destroy the dendarii it was peace if their enemies would just stay their hands and wait patiently the dendarii his creation would collapse all on its own without any outside assistance his cabin buzzer blatted a welcome interruption to the dark and winding chain of his thoughts he keyed the comm on his desk yes its elli his hand leapt eagerly to tap the lock control enter youre back before id expected i was afraid youd be stuck down there like danio or worse with danio he wheeled his chair around the room seeming suddenly brighter as the door hissed open though a lumenmeter might not have registered it elli waved him a salute and hitched a hip over the edge of his desk she smiled but her eyes looked tired told you she said in feet there was some talk of making me a permanent guest i was sweet i was cooperative i was nearly prim trying to convince them i wasnt a homicidal menace to society and they really could let me back out on the streets but i was making no headway till their computers suddenly hit the jackpot the lab came back with ids on those two men i killed at the shuttleport miles understood the little hesitation before her choice of terms someone else might have picked a breezier euphemismblew away or offed distancing himself from the consequences of his action not quinn interesting i take it he said encouragingly he made his voice calm drained of any hint of judgment would that the ghosts of your enemies only escorted you to hell but no they had to hang about your shoulder interminably waiting until that service was called for maybe the notches danio gouged in the hilts of his weapons werent such a tasteless idea after all surely it was a greater sin to forget a single dead man in your tally tell me about them they turned out to be both known to and desired by the eurolaw net they werehow shall i put thissoldiers of the subeconomy professional hit men locals miles winced good god what have i ever done to them i doubt they were after you of their own accord they were almost certainly hirelings contracted by a third party or parties unknown though i imagine we could both give it a good guess oh no the cetagandan embassy is subcontracting my assassination now i suppose it makes sense galeni said they were understaffed but do you realize he rose and began to pace in his agitation this means i could be attacked again from any quarter anywhere any time by totally unpersonallymotivated strangers a security nightmare she agreed i dont suppose the police were able to trace their employer no such luck not yet anyway i did direct their attention to the cetagandans as candidates for the motive leg of any methodmotiveopportunity triangle they may try to put together good can we make anything of the method and opportunity parts ourselves miles wondered aloud the end results of their attempt would seem to indicate they were a trifle underprepared for their task from my point of view their method looked like it came awfully damn close to working she remarked it suggests though that opportunity might have been their limiting factor i mean admiral naismith doesnt just go into hiding when you go downside tricky as it would be to find one man among nine billion he literally ceases to exist anywhere zip there was evidence these guys had been hanging around the shuttleport for some days waiting for you ugh his visit to earth was quite spoiled admiral naismith was it appeared a danger to himself and others earth was too congested what if his assailants next tried to blow up a whole tubeway car or restaurant to reach their target an escort to hell by the souls of his enemies was one thing but what if he were standing beside a class of primaryschool children next round oh by the way i did see private danio when i was downside elli added examining a chipped fingernail his case is coming up for judicial review in a couple of days and he asked me to ask you to come miles snarled under his breath oh sure a potentially unlimited number of total strangers are trying to off me and he wants me to schedule a public appearance for target practice no doubt elli grinned and nibbled her fingernail off evenly he wants a character witness by someone who knows him character witness i wish i knew where he hid his scalp collection id bring it just to show the judge sociopath therapy was invented for people like him no no the last person he wants for a character witness is someone who knows him miles sighed subsiding send captain thorne betan got a lot of cosmopolitan savoir faire should be able to lie well on the witness stand good choice elli applauded its about time you started delegating some of your work load i delegate all the time he objected i am extremely glad for instance that i delegated my personal security to you she flipped up a hand grimacing as if to bat away the implied compliment before it could land did his words bite i was slow you were fast enough miles wheeled and came to face her or at any rate her throat she had folded back her jacket for comfort and the arc of her black tshirt intersected her collarbone in a kind of abstract aesthetic sculpture the scent of herno perfume just womanrose warm from her skin i think you were right she said officers shouldnt go shopping in the company store dammit thought miles i only said that back then because i was in love with baz jeseks wife and didnt want to say sobetter to never say so it really does distract from duty i watched you walking toward us across the shuttleport and for a couple of minutes critical minutes security was the last thing on my mind what was the first thing on your mind miles asked hopefully before his better sense could stop him wake up man you could fumble your whole future in the next thirty seconds her smile was rather pained i was wondering what youd done with that stupid cat blanket actually she said lightly i left it at the embassy i was going to bring it and what wouldnt he give to whip it out now and invite her to sit with him on the edge of his bed but i had some other things on my mind i havent told you yet about the latest wrinkle in our tangled finances i suspect dammit business again intruding into this personal moment this wouldbe personal moment ill tell you about that later right now i want to talk about us i have to talk about us she moved back from him slightly miles amended his words hastily and about duty she stopped retreating his right hand touched her uniform collar turned it over slid over the smooth cool surface of her rank insignia nervous as lintpicking he drew his hand back clenched it over his breast to control it i have a lot of duties you see sort of a double dose theres admiral naismiths duties and theres lieutenant vorkosigans duties and then theres lord vorkosigans duties a triple dose her eyebrows were arched her lips pursed her eyes blandly inquiring supernal patience yes shed wait for him to make an ass of himself at his own pace his pace was becoming headlong youre familiar with admiral naismiths duties but theyre the least of my troubles really admiral naismith is subordinate to lieutenant vorkosigan who exists only to serve barrayaran imperial security to which he has been posted by the wisdom and mercy of his emperor well his emperors advisors anyway in short dad you know that story she nodded that business about not getting personally involved with anyone on his staff may be true enough for admiral naismith id wondered later whether that incident in the lift tube might have been some kind of test she said reflectively this took a moment to sink in eugh no miles yelped what a repulsively lowdown mean and scurvy trick that would have beenno no test quite real ah she said but failed to reassure him of her conviction with say a heartfelt hug a heartfelt hug would be very reassuring just now but she just stood there regarding him in a stance uncomfortably like parade rest but you have to remember admiral naismith isnt a real man hes a construct i invented him with some important parts missing in retrospect oh rubbish miles she touched his cheek lightly what is this ectoplasm lets get back all the way back to lord vorkosigan miles forged on desperately he cleared his throat and with an effort dropped his voice back into his barrayaran accent youve barely met lord vorkosigan she grinned at his change of voice ive heard you do his accent its charming if um rather incongruous i dont do his accent he does mine that isi think he stopped tangled barrayar is bred in my bones her eyebrows lifted their ironic tilt blunted by her clear good will literally as i understand it i shouldnt think youd thank them for poisoning you before youd even managed to get born they werent after me they were after my father my mother considering just where he was attempting to steer this conversation it might be better to avoid expanding upon the misfired assassination attempts of the last twentyfive years anyway that kind of thing hardly ever happens any more what was that out there on the shuttleport today street ballet it wasnt a barrayaran assassination you dont know that she remarked cheerfully miles opened his mouth and hung stunned by a new and even more horrible paranoia captain galeni was a subtle man if miles had read him aright captain galeni could be far ahead down any linked chain of logic of interest to him suppose he was indeed guilty of embezzlement and suppose he had anticipated miless suspicions and suppose hed spotted a way to keep money and career both by eliminating his accuser galeni after all had known just when miles was to be at the shuttleport any local dealer in death that the cetagandan embassy could hire the barrayaran embassy could hire just as readily just as covertly well talk about thatlatertoo he choked why not now because im he stopped took a deep breath trying to say something else he continued in a small tightly contained voice there was a pause say on elli encouraged um duties well just as lieutenant vorkosigan contains all of admiral naismiths duties plus others of his own so lord vorkosigan contains all of lieutenant vorkosigan plus duties of his own political duties separate from and overarching a lieutenants military duties and um family duties his palm was damp he rubbed it unobtrusively on the seam of his trousers this was even harder than hed thought it would be but no harder surely than someone whod had her face blown away once having to face plasma fire again you make yourself sound like a venn diagram the set of all sets which are members of themselves or something i feel like it he admitted but ive got to keep track somehow what contains lord vorkosigan she asked curiously when you look in the mirror when you step out of the shower what looks back do you say to yourself hi lord vorkosigan i avoid looking in mirrors miles i guess just miles and what contains miles his right index finger traced over the back of his immobilized left hand this skin and thats the last outer perimeter i guess gods she muttered ive fallen in love with a man who thinks hes an onion miles snickered he couldnt help it butfallen in love his heart lifted in vast encouragement better than my ancestoress who was supposed to have thought herself no better not bring that one up either but ellis curiosity was insatiable it was why hed first assigned her to dendarii intelligence after all where shed been so spectacularly successful what miles cleared his throat the fifth countess vorkosigan was said to suffer from the periodic delusion that she was made of glass what finally happened to her asked elli in a tone of fascination one of her irritated relations eventually dropped and broke her the delusion was that intense it was off a twentymetertall turret i dont know he said impatiently im not responsible for my weird ancestors quite the reverse exactly the inverse he swallowed you see one of lord vorkosigans nonmilitary duties is to eventually sometime somewhere come up with a lady vorkosigan the eleventh countessvorkosigantobe its rather expected from a man from a strictly patrilinear culture ysee you do know his throat seemed to be stuffed with cotton his accent wavered back and forth that these uh physical problems of mine his hand swept vaguely down the length or lack of it of his body were teratogenic not genetic my children should be normal a fact which may have saved my life in view of barrayars traditional ruthless attitude toward mutations i dont think my grandfather was ever totally convinced of it ive always wished he could have lived to see my children just to prove it miles elli interrupted him gently yes he said breathlessly youre babbling why are you babbling i could listen by the hour but its worrisome when you get stuck on fastforward im nervous he confessed he smiled blindingly at her delayed reaction from this afternoon she slipped closer to him comfortingly i can understand that he eased his right arm around her waist no yes well maybe a little would you like to be countess vorkosigan she grinned made of glass not my style thanks really though the title sounds more like something that would go with black leather and chromium studs the mental image of elli so attired was so arresting it took him a full half minute of silence to trace back to the wrong turn let me rephrase that he said at last will you marry me the silence this time was much longer i thought you were working up to asking me to go to bed with you she said finally and i was laughing at your nerves she wasnt laughing now no said miles that would have been easy you dont want much do you just to completely rearrange the rest of my life its good that you understand that part its not just a marriage theres a whole job description that goes with it on barrayar downside yes well there might be some travel she was quiet for too long then said i was born in space grew up on a deepspace transfer station worked most of my adult life aboard ships the time ive spent with my feet on real dirt can be measured in months it would be a change miles admitted uneasily and what would happen to the future admiral quinn free mercenary presumablyhopefullyshe would find the work of lady vorkosigan equally interesting let me guess the work of lady vorkosigan would not include ship command the security risks of allowing such a career would appall even me my mother gave up a ship commandbetan astronomical surveyto go to barrayar are you telling me youre looking for a girl just like mom she has to be smartshe has to be fastshe has to be a determined survivor miles explained unhappily anything less would be a slaughter of the innocent maybe for her maybe for our children with her bodyguards as you know can only do so much her breath blew out in a long silent whistle watching him watching her the slippage between the distress in her eyes and the smile on her lips tore at him didnt want to hurt youthe best i can offer shouldnt be pain to youis it too much too little too awful oh love she breathed sadly you arent thinking i think the world of you and so you want to maroon me for the rest of my life on a sorry backwater dirtball thats just barely climbed out of feudalism that treats women like chattelor cattlethat would deny me the use of every military skill ive learned in the past twelve years from shuttle docking to interrogation chemistry im sorry im not an anthropologist im not a saint and im not crazy you dont have to say no right away said miles in a small voice oh yes i do she said before looking at you makes me any weaker in the knees or in the head and what am i to say to that miles wondered if you really loved me youd be delighted to immolate your entire personal history on my behalf oh sure shes not into immolation this makes her strong her strength makes me want her and so we come full circle its barrayar thats the problem then of course what female human in her right mind would voluntarily move to that planet with the exception of your mother apparently she is exceptional but when she and barrayar collide its barrayar that changes ive seen it you could be a force of change like that elli was shaking her head i know my limits no one knows their limits till theyve gone beyond them she eyed him you would naturally think so whats with you and barrayar anyway you let them push you around like ive never understood why youve never just grabbed the dendarii and taken off you could make it go better than admiral oser ever did better than tung even you could end up emperor of your own rock by the time you were done with you at my side he grinned strangely are you seriously suggesting i embark on a plan of galactic conquest with five thousand guys she chuckled at least i wouldnt have to give up fleet command no really seriously if youre so obsessed with being a professional soldier what do you need barrayar for a mercenary fleet sees ten times the action of a planetary one a dirtball may see war once a generation if its lucky or unlucky miles interpolated a mercenary fleet follows it around that statistical fact has been noted in the barrayaran high command its one of the chief reasons im here ive had more actual combat experience albeit on a small scale in the past four years than most other imperial officers have seen in the last fourteen nepotism works in strange ways he ran a finger along the clean line of her jaw i see it now you are in love with admiral naismith of course not lord vorkosigan i am annoyed with lord vorkosigan he sells you short love he let the double entendre pass so the gulf that yawned between them was deeper than hed truly realized to her it was lord vorkosigan who wasnt real his fingers entwined around the back of her neck and he breathed her breath as she asked why do you let barrayar screw you over its the hand i was dealt by whom i dont get it its all right it just happens to be very important to me to win with the hand i was dealt so be it your funeral her lips were muffled on his mouth mmm she drew back a moment can i still jump your bones carefully of course youll not go away mad for turning you down turning barrayar down that is not you never you im getting used to it almost numb am i to sulk he inquired lightly because i cant have it all take none and go off in a huff id hope youd bounce me down the corridor on my pointed head if i were so dense she laughed it was all right if he could still make her laugh if naismith was all she wanted she could surely have him half a loaf for half a man they tilted bedward hungrymouthed it was easy with quinn she made it so pillow talk with quinn turned out to be shop talk miles was unsurprised along with a sleepy bodyrub that turned him to liquid in danger of pouring over the edge of the bed into a puddle on the deck he absorbed the rest of her complete report on the activities and discoveries of the london police he in turn brought her up to date on the events of the embassy and the mission on which hed dispatched elena botharijesek and all these years hed thought he needed a conference room for debriefing clearly hed stumbled into an unsuspected universe of alternative command style sybaritic had it all over cybernetic ten more days miles complained smearily into his mattress until elena can possibly return from tau ceti and theres no guarantee she can bring the missing money with her even then particularly if its already been sent once while the dendarii fleet hangs idly in orbit you know what we need a contract damn straight weve taken interim contracts before in spite of barrayaran imperial security having us on permanent retainer they even like it it gives their budget a break after all the less taxes they have to squeeze out of the peasantry the easier security gets on the domestic side its a wonder theyve never tried to make the dendarii mercenaries a revenuegenerating project id have sent our contract people out hunting weeks ago if we werent stuck in earth orbit till this mess at the embassy gets straightened out too bad we cant put the fleet to work right here on earth said elli peace seems to have broken out all over the planet unfortunately her hands unknotted the muscles in his calves fiber by fiber he wondered if he could persuade her to work on his feet next hed done hers a while ago after all albeit with higher goals in view oh joy he wasnt even going to have to persuade her he wriggled his toes in delight hed never suspected that his toes were sexy until ellid pointed it out in fact his satisfaction with his entire pleasuredrenched body was at an alltime high theres a blockage in my thinking he decided im looking wrong at something lets see the dendarii fleet isnt tied to the embassy though i am i could send you all off elli whimpered it was such an unlikely noise coming from her that he risked muscle spasm to twist his neck and look over his shoulder at her brainstorming he apologized well dont stop with that one and anyway because of the mess at the embassy im not anxious to strip myself of my private backup itstheres something very wrong going on there which means that any more sitting around waiting for the embassy to come through is dumber than rocks well one problem at a time the dendarii money odd jobs hey hey what says ive got to contract out the entire fleet at a time work odd jobs interim cash flow divide and conquer security guards computer techs anything and everything anyone can come up with that will generate a little cash income bank robberies said elli in a tone of rising interest and you say the police let you out dont get carried away but im sitting on a labor pool of five thousand variously and highly trained people surely thats a resource of even greater value than the triumph delegate let them spread out and go scare up some bloody cash elli sitting crosslegged on the foot of his bed remarked in aggravation i worked for an hour to get you relaxed and now look what are you memoryplastic your whole body is coiling back up right before my eyes where are you going to put the idea into action what else most people go to sleep at this point yawning she helped him sort through the pile of uniform bits on the floor nearby the black tshirts proved nearly interchangable ellis was distinguishable by the faint scent of her body lingering in itmiles almost didnt want to give it back but reflected that keeping his girlfriends underwear to sniff probably wouldnt score him points in the savoirfaire department the agreement was unspoken but plain this phase of their relationship must stop discreetly at the bedroom door if they were to disprove admiral naismiths fatuous dictum the initial dendarii staff conference at the start of a mission when miles arrived on fleet station with a new contract in hand always gave him the sense of seeing double he was an interface conscious of both halves trying to be a oneway mirror between the dendarii and their true employer the emperor this unpleasant sensation usually faded rapidly as he concentrated his faculties around the mission in question recentering his personality admiral naismith came very near to occupying his whole skin then relaxing wasnt quite the right term for this alphastate given naismiths driving personality unconstrained came closer he had been with the dendarii an unprecedented five months straight and the sudden reintrusion of lieutenant vorkosigan into his life had been unusually disruptive this time of course it wasnt normally the barrayaran side of things that was screwed up hed always counted on that command structure to be solid the axiom from which all action flowed the standard by which subsequent success or failure was measured not this time this night he stood in the triumphs briefing room before his hastily called department heads and ship captains and was seized by a sudden schizoid paralysis what was he to say to them youre on your own suckers were on our own for a while admiral naismith began emerging from whatever cave in miless brain he dwelt in and he was off and running the news made public at last that there was a glitch in their contract payment inspired the expected dismay more baffling was their apparently serene reassurance when he told them his voice heavy with menacing emphasis that he was personally investigating it well at least it accounted from the dendarii point of view for all the time hed spent stuffing the computers in the bowels of the barrayaran embassy god thought miles i swear i could sell them all radioactive farmland but when challenged they unleashed an impressive flurry of ideas for shortterm cash creation miles was intensely relieved and left them to it after all nobody arrived on the dendarii general staff by being dense his own brain seemed drained he hoped it was because its circuits were subconsciously working on the barrayaran half of the problem and not a symptom of premature senile decay he slept alone and badly and woke tired and sore he attended to some routine internal matters and approved the seven least harebrained schemes for cash creation evolved by his people during the night one officer had actually come up with a security guard contract for a squad of twenty never mind that it was for the grand opening of a shopping mall inwhere the hell was xian he arrayed himself carefully in his bestgrey velvet dress tunic with the silver buttons on the shoulders trousers with the blinding white side trim his shiniest bootsand accompanied lieutenant bone downside to the london bank elli quinn backed him with two of his largest uniformed dendarii and an unseen perimeter before and behind of civiliandressed guards with scanners at the bank admiral naismith quite polished and urbane for a man who didnt exist signed away questionable rights to a warship he did not own to a financial organization who did not need or want it as lieutenant bone pointed out at least the money was real instead of a piecemeal collapse beginning that afternoonthe hour when lieutenant bone had calculated the first dendarii payroll chits would start bouncingit would be just one great crash at an undefined future date hooray he peeled off guards as he approached the barrayaran embassy until only elli remained they paused before a door in the underground utility tunnels marked danger toxic authorized personnel only were under the scanners now miles remarked warningly elli touched her finger to her lips considering on the other hand you may go in there to find orders have arrived to spirit you off to barrayar and i wont see you for another year or ever i would resist that he began but she touched the finger to his lips now bottling whatever stupidity hed been about to utter transferring the kiss right he smiled slightly ill be in touch commander quinn a straightening of her spine a small ironic nod an impressionistic version of a salute and she was gone he sighed and palmed open the intimidating doors lock on the other side of the second door past the uniformed guard at the scanner console ivan vorpatril was waiting for him shifting from foot to foot with a strained smile oh god now what it was doubtless too much to hope that the man merely had to take a leak glad youre back miles ivan said right on time i didnt want to abuse the privilege i might want it again not that im likely to get iti was surprised that galeni didnt just yank me back to the embassy permanently after that little episode at the shuttleport yesterday yes well theres a reason for that said ivan oh said miles in a voice drained to neutrality captain galeni left the embassy about half an hour after you did yesterday he hasnt been seen since chapter seven the ambassador let them into galenis locked office he concealed his nerves rather better than ivan merely remarking quietly let me know what you find lieutenant vorpatril some certain indication as to whether or not its time to notify the local authorities would be particularly desirable so the ambassador who had known duv galeni some two years thought in terms of multiple possibilities too a complex man their missing captain ivan sat at the desk console and ran through the routine files searching for recent memos while miles wandered the perimeter of the room looking forwhat a message scrawled in blood on the wall at the level of his kneecap alien vegetable fiber on the carpet a note of assignation on heavily perfumed paper any or all would have been preferable to the bland blankness he found ivan threw up his hands nothing here but the usual move over miles wriggled the back of galenis swivel chair to evict his big cousin and slid into his place i have a burning curiosity as to captain galenis personal finances this is a golden opportunity to check them out miles said ivan with trepidation isnt that a little um invasive you have the instincts of a gentleman ivan said miles absorbed in breaking into the coded files how did you ever get into security i dont know said ivan i wanted ship duty dont we all ah said miles as the holoscreen began to disgorge data i love these earth universal credit cards so revealing what do you expect to find in galenis charge account for gods sake well first of all miles muttered tapping keys lets check the totals for the last few months and find out if his outgo exceeds his income it was the work of a moment to answer that one miles frowned slight disappointment the two were in balance there was even a small endofmonth surplus readily traceable to a modest personal savings fund it proved nothing one way or another alas if galeni were in some kind of serious money trouble he had both the wit and the knowhow not to leave evidence against himself miles began going down the itemized list of purchases ivan shifted impatiently now what are you looking for secret vices how easy or it would be if compare for example the records of galenis accounts with yours for the same threemonth period miles split the screen and called up his cousins data why not compare it with yours said ivan miffed miles smiled in scientific virtue i havent been here long enough for a comparable baseline you make a much better control for examplewell well look at this a lace nightgown ivan what a confection its totally nonregulation yknow thats none of your business said ivan grumpily just so and you dont have a sister and its not your mothers style inherent in this purchase is either a girl in your life or transvestism you will note its not my size said ivan with dignity yes it would look rather abbreviated on you a sylphlike girl then whom you know well enough to buy intimate presents see how much i know about you already from just that one purchase was it sylveth by chance its galeni youre supposed to be checking ivan reminded him yes so what kind of presents does galeni buy he scrolled on it didnt take long there wasnt that much wine ivan pointed out beer miles ran a cross check about onethird the amount you drank in the same period but he buys bookdiscs in a ratio of thirtyfive tojust two ivan ivan cleared his throat uncomfortably miles sighed no girls here no boys either i dont think eh youve been working with him for a year mm said ivan ive run across one or two of that sort in the service but they have ways of letting you know not galeni i dont think either miles glanced up at his cousins even profile yes ivan probably had collected passes from both sexes by this time scratch off yet another lead is the man a monk miles muttered not an android judging from the music books and beer but terribly elusive he killed the file with an irritated tap on the controls after a moment of thought he called up galenis service records instead huh now thats unusual did you know captain galeni had a doctorate in history before he ever joined the imperial service what no he never mentioned that ivan leaned over miless shoulder gentlemanly instincts overcome by curiosity at last a phd with honors in modern history and political science from the imperial university at vorbarr sultana my god look at the dates at the age of twentysix dr duv galeni gave up a brandnew faculty position at the college of belgravia on barrayar to go back to the imperial service academy with a bunch of eighteenyearolds on a cadets pittance not the behavior of a man to whom money was an allconsuming object huh said ivan he must have been an upperclassman when we entered he got out just two years ahead of us and hes a captain already he must have been one of the first komarrans permitted to enter the military within weeks of the ruling and hes been on the fast track ever since extra traininglanguages information analysis a posting at the imperial hqand then this plum of a post on earth duvie is our darling clearly miles could see why a brilliant educated liberal officergaleni was a walking advertisement for the success of the new order an example miles knew all about being an example he drew in his breath a long thoughtful inhalation hissing cold through his front teeth what prodded ivan im beginning to get scared why because this whole thing is acquiring a subtle political odor and anyone who isnt alarmed when things barrayaran start smelling political hasnt studied history he uttered the last word with a subsiding ironic sibilant hunching in the chair after a moment he hit the file again searching on jack pot eh miles pointed sealed file nobody under the rank of an imperial staff officer can access this part that lets us out not necessarily miles ivan moaned im not contemplating anything illegal miles reassured him yet go get the ambassador the ambassador upon arrival pulled up a chair next to miles yes i do have an emergency access code that will override that one he admitted when miles pressed him the emergency in mind was something on the order of war breaking out however miles nibbled the side of his index finger captain galenis been with you two years now whats your impression of him as an officer or as a man both sir very conscientious in his duties his unusual educational background oh you knew of it of course but it makes him an extraordinarily good pick for earth hes very good very at ease on the social side a brilliant conversationalist the officer who preceded him in the post was a security man of the old school competent but dull almost ahem boorish galeni accomplishes the same duties but more smoothly smooth security is invisible security invisible security does not disturb my diplomatic guests and so my job becomes that much easier that goes double for the er informationgathering activities as an officer im extremely pleased with him whats his fault as a man fault is perhaps too strong a term lieutenant vorkosigan hes rather cool in general i find this restful i do notice that in any given conversation he will come away knowing a great deal more about you than you of him ha what a very diplomatic way of putting it and miles reflected thinking back over his own brushes with the missing officer deadon the ambassador frowned do you think some clue to his disappearance may be in that file lieutenant vorkosigan miles shrugged unhappily it isnt anywhere else i am reluctant the ambassador trailed off eyeing the strongly worded access restrictions on the vid we could wait a little longer said ivan suppose hes just found a girlfriend if you were so worried about that as to make that other suggestion miles you ought to be glad for the man he isnt going to be too happy coming back from his first night out in years to find weve turned his files inside out miles recognized the singsong tone of ivan playing dumb playing devils advocate the ploy of a sharp but lazy intellect to get others to do its work right ivan when you spend nights out dont you leave notice where youll be and when youll return asked miles well yes and dont you return on time ive been known to oversleep a time or two ivan admitted what happens then they track me down good morning lieutenant vorpatril this is your wakeup call galenis precise sardonic accent came through clearly in ivans parody it had to be a direct quote dyou think galenis the sort to make one rule for subordinates and another for himself then no said ivan and the ambassador in unison and glanced sideways at each other miles took a deep breath jerked up his chin and pointed at the holovid open it the ambassador pursed his lips and did so ill be damned whispered ivan after a few minutes of scrolling miles elbowed into the center place and began speedreading in earnest the file was enormous galenis missing family history at last david galen had been the name to which he was born those galens owners of the galen orbital transshipping warehouse cartel strong among the oligarchy of powerful families who had run komarr straddling its important wormhole connections like ancient rhine river robber barons its wormholes had made komarr rich it was from the power and wealth pouring through them that its jewellike domed cities sprang not grubbed up from the planets dire barren soil by sweaty labor miles could hear his fathers voice ticking off the points that had made the conquest of komarr admiral vorkosigans textbook war a small population concentrated in climatecontrolled cities no place for guerillas to fall back and regroup no allies we had only to let it be known that we were dropping their twentyfivepercent cut of everything that passed through their wormhole nexus to fifteen percent and the neighbors that should have supported them fell into our pockets they didnt even want to do their own fighting till the mercenaries theyd hired saw what they were up against and turned tail of course the unspoken heart of the matter was the sins of the komarran fathers a generation earlier who had accepted the bribe to let the cetagandan invasion fleet pass through for the quick and easy conquest of poor newly rediscovered semifeudal barrayar which had proved neither quick nor easy nor a conquest twenty years and a river of blood later the last of the cetagandan warships withdrew back the way they had come through neutral komarr barrayarans might have been backward but no one could accuse them of being slow learners among miless grandfathers generation who came to power in the harsh school of the cetagandan occupation there grew an obsessed determination that such an invasion must never be permitted to happen again it had fallen on miless fathers generation to turn the obsession into fact by taking absolute and final control of barrayars komarran gateway the avowed aim of the barrayaran invasion fleet its lightning speed and painstaking strategic subtleties was to take komarrs wealthgenerating economy intact with minimal damage conquest not revenge was to be the emperors glory imperial fleet commander admiral lord aral vorkosigan had made that abundantly and explicitly clear hed thought the komarran oligarchy supple middlemen that they were were brought into alignment with that aim their surrender eased in every possible way promises were made guarantees given subordinate life and reduced property were life and property still calculatedly leavened with hope for future recovery living well was to be the best revenge all round then came the solstice massacre an overeager subordinate growled admiral lord vorkosigan secret orders cried the surviving families of the two hundred komarran counsellors gunned down in a gymnasium by barrayaran security forces truth or at any rate certainty lay among the victims miles himself was not sure any historian could resurrect it only admiral vorkosigan and the security commander knew for sure and it was admiral vorkosigans word that was on trial the security commander lay dead without trial at the admirals own furious hands justly executed or killed to keep from talking take your pick according to your prejudices in absolute terms miles was disinclined to get excited about the solstice massacre after all cetagandan atomics had taken out the entire city of vorkosigan vashnoi killing not hundreds but thousands and nobody rioted in the streets about that yet it was the solstice massacre that got the attention captured an eager public imagination it was the name of vorkosigan that acquired the sobriquet butcher with a capital letter and the word of a vorkosigan that was besmirched and that made it all a very personal bit of ancient history indeed thirty years ago miles hadnt even been born david galen had been four years old on the very day his aunt komarran counsellor rebecca galen had died in the gym at the domed city of solstice the barrayaran high command had argued the matter of twentysixyearold duv galenis admittance to the imperial service back and forth in the frankest personal terms i cant recommend the choice imperial security chief illyan wrote in a private memo to prime minister count aral vorkosigan i suspect youre being quixotic about this one out of guilt and guilt is a luxury you cannot afford if youre acquiring a secret desire to be shot in the back please let me know at least twentyfour hours in advance so i can activate my retirementsimon the return memo was handwritten in the crabbed scrawl of a thickfingered man for whom all pens were too tiny a handwriting achingly familiar to miles guilt perhaps i had a little tour of that damned gym soon after before the thickest blood had quite dried puddinglike some details burn themselves permanently in the memory but i happen to remember rebecca galen particularly because of the way shed been shot she was one of the few who died facing her murderers i doubt very much if it will ever be my back thats in danger from duv galeni the involvement of his father in the later resistance worries me rather less it wasnt just for us that the boy altered his name to the barrayaran form but if we can capture this ones true allegiance it will be something like what id had in mind for komarr in the first place a generation late true and after a long and bloody detour butsince you bring up these theological termsa sort of redemption of course he has political ambitions but i beg to suggest they are both more complex and more constructive than mere assassination put him back on the list simon and leave him there this time this issue tires me and i dont want to be dragged over it again let him run and prove himselfif he can the closing signature was the usual hasty scribble after that cadet galeni became the concern of officers much lower in the imperial hierarchy his record the public and accessible one miles had viewed earlier the trouble with all this miles spoke aloud into the thick ticking silence that had enveloped the room for the last thirty minutes fascinating as it all is is that it doesnt narrow the possibilities it multiplies them dammit including miles reflected his own pet theory of embezzlement and desertion there was nothing here that actually disproved it just rendered it more painful if true and the shuttleport assassination idea took on new and sinister overtones he might also ivan vorpatril put in just be the victim of some perfectly ordinary accident the ambassador grunted and pushed to his feet shaking his head most ambiguous they were right to seal it it could be very prejudicial to the mans career i think lieutenant vorpatril i will have you go ahead and file a missing person report now with the local authorities seal that back up vorkosigan ivan followed the ambassador out before he closed the console miles traced through the documents pertinent to the tantalizing reference to galenis father after his sister was killed in the solstice massacre the senior galen had apparently become an active leader in the komarran underground what wealth the barrayaran conquest had left to the onceproud family evaporated entirely at the time of the violent revolt six years later old barrayaran security records explicitly traced some of it transformed into smuggled weapons payroll and expenses of the terrorist army later bribes for exit visas and transport offplanet for the survivors no transport off komarr for galenis father though he was blown up with one of his own bombs during the last futile exhausted attack on a barrayaran security hq along with galenis older brother incidentally thoughtfully miles ran a crosscheck rather to his relief there were no more stray galen relations among the earthbound refugees listed in the embassys security files of course galeni had had plenty of opportunity to edit those files in the last two years miles rubbed his aching head galeni had been fifteen when the last spasm of the revolt had petered out was stamped out too young miles hoped to have been actively involved and whatever his involvement simon illyan had apparently known of it and been willing to let it pass into history a closed book miles resealed the file miles permitted ivan to do all the dealing with the local police true with the clone story now afloat he was in part protected from the chance of meeting the same people in both his personas but there was no point in pushing it the police could be expected to be more alert and suspicious than most others and he hadnt counted on being a twoheaded crime wave at least the police seemed to take the military attaches disappearance with proper seriousness promising cooperation even to the extent of honoring the ambassadors request that the matter not be given to the news media the police manned and equipped for such things could take over the routine legwork such as checking the identities of any unexplained human body parts found in trash receptacles etc miles appointed himself official detective for all matters inside the embassy walls ivan as senior man now suddenly found all of galenis normal routine dumped in his lap miles heartlessly left it there twentyfour hours passed for miles mostly in a console station chair crosschecking embassy records on komarran refugees unfortunately the embassy had amassed huge quantities of such information if there was something significant it was well camouflaged in the tons of irrelevencies it simply wasnt a oneman job at two in the morning crosseyed miles gave it up called elli quinn and dumped the whole problem on the dendarii mercenaries intelligence department dumped was the word for it mass data transfer via comm link from the embassys secured computers to the triumph in orbit galeni would have had convulsions screw galeni it was all his fault for disappearing in the first place miles thoughtfully didnt ask ivan either miless legal position if it came to that was that the dendarii were de facto barrayaran troops and the data transfer therefore internal to the imperial military technically miles included all of galenis personnel files too in fully accessed form miless legal position there was that the seal was only to protect galeni from the prejudice of barrayaran patriots which the dendarii clearly were not one argument or the other had to work tell the spooks that finding galeni is a contract miles told elli part of the fleetwide fundraising drive we only get paid for producing the man that could actually be true come to think of it he fell into bed hoping his subconscious would work it out during what was left of the night but woke blank and bleary as before he set barth and a couple of the other noncoms to rechecking the movements of the courier officer the other possible weak link in the chain he sat tight waiting for the police to call his imagination weaving daisy chains of ever more gaudy and bizarre explanatory scenarios sat still as stone in a darkened room one foot tapping uncontrollably feeling like the top of his head was about to blow off on the third day elli quinn called in he snapped the comm link into place in the holovid hungry for the pleasure of seeing her face it bore a most peculiar smirk i thought this might interest you she purred captain thorne was just contacted with a fascinating contract offer for the dendarii does it have a fascinating price miles inquired the gears in his head seemed to grind as he tried to switch back to admiral naismiths problems which had been overwhelmed and forgotten in the past two days uncertain tensions a hundred thousand betan dollars in untraceable cash ah that came to close to half a million imperial marks i thought id made it clear we werent going to touch anything illegal this time were in enough trouble as it is how does a kidnapping grab you she giggled inexplicably absolutely not oh youre going to make an exception in this case she predicted with confidence even verve elli he growled warningly she controlled her humor with a deep breath though her eyes remained alight but milesour mysterious and wealthy strangers want to hire admiral naismith to kidnap lord miles vorkosigan from the barrayaran embassy its got to be a trap ivan jittered nervously guiding the groundcar elli had rented through the levels of the city midnight was scarcely less well lit than daytime though the shadows of their faces shifted as the sources of illumination flitted by outside the bubble canopy the grey dendarii sergeants uniform ivan wore flattered him no less than his barrayaran dress greens miles noted glumly the man just looked good in uniform any uniform elli sitting on miless other side seemed ivans female twin she simulated ease lithe body stretched out one arm flung carelessly and protectively across the back of the seat above miless head but she had taken to biting her nails again miles noted miles sat between them in lord vorkosigans barrayaran dress greens feeling like a piece of wilted watercress between two slices of moldy bread too damn tired for these latenight parties of course its a trap said miles who set it and why is what we want to find out and how much they know have they set this up because they believe admiral naismith and lord vorkosigan to be two separate peopleor because they dont if the latter will it compromise barrayars covert connection with the dendarii mercenaries in future operations ellis sideways glance met miless indeed and if the naismith game were over what future had they or maybe said ivan helpfully its something totally unrelated like local criminals looking for a spot of ransom or something really tortuous like the cetagandans trying to get admiral naismith in deep trouble with barrayar in hopes that wed have better luck killing the little spook than they have or maybe maybe youre the evil genius behind it all ivan miles suggested affably clearing the chain of command of competition so you can have the embassy all to yourself elli glanced at him sharply to be sure he was joking ivan just grinned ooh i like that one the only thing we can be sure of is that its not a cetagandan assassination attempt miles sighed i wish i was as sure as you seem to be muttered elli it was late evening of the fourth day since galenis disappearance the thirtysix hours since the dendarii had been offered their peculiar contract had given elli time for reflection the initial charm had worn off for her even as miles had become increasingly drawn in by the possibilities look at the logic of it argued miles the cetagandans either still think im two separate people or they dont its admiral naismith they want to kill not the barrayaran prime ministers son killing lord vorkosigan could restart a bloody war in feet well know my covers been blown the day they stop trying to assassinate naismithand start making a great and embarrassing public flap about dendarii operations against them instead they wouldnt miss that diplomatic opportunity for anything particularly now with the rightofpassage treaty through tau ceti up in the air they could cripple our galactic trade in one move they could be trying to prove your connection as step one of just that plan said ivan looking thoughtful i didnt say it wasnt the cetagandans said miles mildly i just said that if it was this isnt an assassination elli groaned miles looked at his chrono time for the last check elli activated her wrist comm are you still up there bel captain thornes alto voice lilted back signalling from the aircar that followed with its troop of dendarii soldiers i have you in my sights all right keep us that way you watch the back from above well watch the front this will be the last voice contact till we invite you to drop in well be waiting bel out miles rubbed the back of his neck nervously quinn watching the gesture remarked im really not crazy about springing the trap by letting them take you i have no intention of letting them take me the moment they show their hand bel drops in and we take them instead but if it doesnt look like they want to kill me outright we could learn a lot by letting their operation run on a few steps further in view of the ah situation at the embassy it could be worth a little risk she shook her head in mute disapproval the next few minutes passed in silence miles was about halfway through a mental review of all the branching possibilities they had hammered out for this evenings action when they pulled up in front of a row of ancient threestory houses crammed together along a crescent street they seemed very dark and quiet unoccupied apparently in process of condemnation or renovation elli glanced at the numbers on the doors and swung up the bubble canopy miles slid out to stand beside her from the groundcar ivan ran the scanners theres nobody home he reported squinting at his readouts what not possible said elli we could be early rats said elli as miles is so fond of saying look at the logic the people who want to buy lord vorkosigan didnt give us this rendezvous till the last second why so we couldnt get here first and check it out they have to be set up and waiting she leaned back into the cars cockpit reaching over ivans shoulder he turned his hands palmout in acquiescence as she ran the scan again youre right she admitted but it still feels wrong was it chance vandalism that a couple of streetlights were broken out just here miles peered into the night dont like it elli murmured lets not tie your hands can you handle me all by yourself youre drugged to the eyeballs miles shrugged and let his jaw hang slack and his eyes track randomly and not quite in unison he shambled beside her as her hand pinched his upper arm guiding him up the steps she tried the door an oldfashioned one hung on hinges its open it swung wide squeaking revealing blackness elli reluctantly reholstered her stunner and unhooked a handlight from her belt flashing it into the darkness an entry hall ricketylooking stairs ascended to the left twin archways on either side led into empty dirty front rooms she sighed and stepped cautiously across the threshold anybody here she called softly silence they entered the lefthand room the beam of the handlight darting from corner to corner were not early she muttered not late the address is right where are they he could not very well answer and stay in character elli released him switched the light to her left hand and redrew her stunner youre too tanked to wander far she decided as if talking to herself im going to take a look around one of miless eyelids shivered in acknowledgement until she finished checking for remote bugs and scanner beams he had better keep playing lord vorkosigan in a convincingly kidnapped state after a moments hesitation she took to the stairs taking the light with her dammit he was still listening to the swift faint creak of her footsteps overhead when the hand closed over his mouth and the back of his neck was kissed by a stunner on very light power zero range he convulsed kicking trying to shout trying to bite his assailant hissed in pain and clutched harder there were twohis hands were yanked up behind his back a gag stuffed into his mouth before his teeth could snap closed on the hand that fed him the gag was permeated with some sweet penetrating drug his nostrils flared wildly but his vocal cords went involuntarily slack he seemed out of touch with his body as if it had moved leaving no forwarding address then a pale light came up two large men one younger one older dressed in earther clothing shifted in the shadows faintly blurred scanner shields dammit and very very good ones to beat the dendarii equipment miles spotted the boxes belted to their waistsa tenth the size of the latest thing his people had such tiny power packsthey looked new the barrayaran embassy was going to have to update its secured areas he went crosseyed for a mad moment trying to read the makers mark on them until he saw the third man oh the third ive lost it miless panicked thought gyrated gone right over the edge the third man was himself the altermiles neatly turned out in barrayaran dress greens stepped forward to stare long and strangely hungrily into his face as he was held up by the two younger men he began emptying the contents of miless pockets into his own stunner ids half a pack of clove breath mints he frowned at the breath mints as if momentarily puzzled then pocketed them with a shrug he pointed to miless waist miless grandfathers dagger had been willed explicitly to him the yearold blade was still flexible as rubber sharp as glass its jewelled hilt concealed die vorkosigan seal they took it from beneath his jacket the altermiles shrugged the sheathstrap over his shoulder and refastened his tunic finally he unhooked the scannershield belt from his own waist and slipped it swiftly around miles the altermiless eyes were hot with an exhilarated terror as he paused to sweep one last glance over miles miles had seen the look once before in his own face in the mirrored wall of a tube station no hed seen it on this ones face in the mirrored wall of a tube station he must have been standing feet away that night behind miles at an angle in the wrong uniform the green one at a moment miles was wearing his dendarii greys looks like they managed to get it right this time though perfect growled the altermiles freed of the scannershields sonic muffling we didnt even have to stun the woman shell suspect nothing told you this would work he inhaled jerked up his chin and smiled sardonically at miles posturing little martinet miles thought poisonously ill get you for that well i always was my own worst enemy the switch had taken only seconds they carried miles through the doorway at the back of the room with a heroic twitch he managed to bump his head on the frame going through what was that ellis voice called instantly from upstairs me the altermiles called back promptly i just checked around theres nobody down here either this is a washout you think miles heard her cantering down the stairs we could wait a while ellis wristcom chimed elli came ivans voice thinly i just got a funny blip in the scanners a minute ago miless heart lurched in hope check again the altermiless voice was cool nothing now nothing here either im afraid somethings panicked them and theyve aborted pull in the perimeter and take me back to the embassy commander quinn so soon you sure now yes thats an order youre the boss damn said elli regretfully i had my heart set on that hundred thousand betan dollars their syncopated footsteps echoed out the hallway and were muted by the closing door the purr of a groundcar faded in the distance darkness silence scored by breathing they dragged miles along again out a back door through a narrow mews and into the back seat of a groundcar parked in the alley they sat him up like a mannequin between them while a third kidnapper drove miless thoughts spun dizzily along the edge of consciousness goddamn scanners fiveyearold technology from the rim zone which put it maybe ten years behind earthstheyd have to bite the budget bullet and scrap the dendarii scanner system fleetwide nowif he lived to order it scanners hell the fault didnt lie in the scanners wasnt the formerlymythical unicorn hunted with mirrors to fascinate the vainglorious beast while its killers circled for the strike must be a virgin around here somewhere this was an ancient district the tortuous route the groundcar was taking could be either to confuse him or merely the best shortcut local knowledge could supply after about a quarter hour they dove into an underground parking garage and hissed to a halt the garage was small clearly private with room for only a few vehicles they hauled him to a lift tube and ascended one level to a short hallway one of the goons pulled off miless boots and scannershield belt the stun was starting to wear off his legs were rubbery shot with pins and needles but at least they propped him up they released his wrists clumsily he tried to rub his aching arms they popped the gag from his mouth he emitted a wordless croak they unlocked a door in front of him and bundled him into a windowless room the door closed behind with a click like trap jaws snapping he staggered and stood feet spread a little panting a sealed light fixture in the ceiling illuminated a narrow room furnished only with two hard benches along the walls to the left a doorframe with the door removed led to a tiny windowless washroom a man wearing only green trousers cream shirt and socks lay curled on one of the benches facing the wall stiffly gingerly he rolled over and sat up one hand flung up automatically as if to shield his reddened eyes from some toobright light the other pressed the bench to keep him from toppling dark hair mussed a fourday beard stubble his shirt collar hung open in a v revealing a throat strangely vulnerable in contrast to the usual turtlearmored effect of the high closed barrayaran tunic collar his face was furrowed the impeccable captain galeni rather the worse for wear chapter eight galeni squinted at miles bloody hell he said in a flattened voice same to you miles rasped back galeni sat up straighter bleary eyes narrowing with suspicion oris it you i dont know miles considered this which me were you expecting he staggered over to the bench opposite before his knees gave way and sat his back against the wall feet not quite reaching the floor they were both silent for a few minutes taking in the details of the other it would be pointless to throw us together in the same room unless it were monitored said miles at last for answer galeni flipped an index finger up toward the light fixture ah visual too yes miles bared his teeth and smiled upward galeni was still regarding him with wary almost painful uncertainty miles cleared his throat there was a bitter tang lingering in his mouth i take it youve met my alterego yesterday i think it was yesterday galeni glanced at the light his kidnappers had relieved miles of his own chrono too its now about one in the morning of the start of the fifth day since you disappeared from the embassy miles supplied answering galenis unspoken question do they leave that light on all the time yes ah miles fought down a queasy twinge of associative memory continuous illumination was a cetagandan prison technique for inducing temporal disorientation admiral naismith was intimately familiar with it i saw him for just a few seconds miles went on when they made the switch his hand touched the absence of a dagger massaged the back of his neck do ireally look like that i thought it was you till the end he told me he was practicing testing did he pass he was in here for four or five hours miles winced thats bad thats very bad i thought so i see a sticky silence filled the room well historian and how do you tell a forgery from the real thing galeni shook his head then touched his hand to his temple as though he wished he hadnt blinding headache apparently miles had one too i dont believe i know anymore galeni added reflectively he saluted a dry grin cracked one corner of miless mouth of course there could be just one of me and all this a ploy to drive you crazy stop that galeni almost shouted a ghastly answering smile lit his face for a moment nonetheless miles glanced up at the light well whoever i am you should still be able to tell me who they are ah i hope its not the cetagandans i would find that just a little too weird for comfort in light of my duplicate hes a surgical construct i trust not a cloneplease dont let him be my clone he said he was a clone said galeni of course at least half of what he said was lies whoever he was oh stronger exclamations seemed wholly inadequate yes it made me rather wonder about you the original you that is ah hem yes i think i know now why i popped out with that that story when the reporter cornered me id seen him once before in the tubeway when i was out with commander quinn eight ten days ago now they must have been maneuvering in to make the switch i thought i was seeing myself in the mirror but he was wearing the wrong uniform and they must have aborted galeni glanced down at his own sleeve didnt you notice i had a lot on my mind you never reported this i was on some pain meds i thought it might be a little hallucination i was a bit stressed out by the time id got back to the embassy id forgotten about it and besides he smirked weakly i didnt think our working relationship would benefit from planting serious doubts about my sanity galenis lips compressed with exasperation then softened with something like despair perhaps not it alarmed miles to see despair in galenis face he babbled on anyway i was relieved to realize i hadnt suddenly become clairvoyant im afraid my subconscious must be brighter than the rest of my brain i just didnt get its message he pointed upward again not cetagandans no galeni leaned back against the far wall stonefaced komarrans ah miles choked a komarran plot how fraught galenis mouth twisted quite well said miles thinly they havent killed us yet there must be some reason to keep us alive galenis lips drew back on a deathly grin his eyes crinkling none whatsoever the words came out in a wheezing chuckle abruptly cut off a private joke between galeni and the light fixture apparently he imagines he has reason galeni explained but hes very mistaken the bitter thrust of those words was also directed upward well dont tell them said miles through his teeth he took a deep breath come on galeni spill it what happened the morning you disappeared from the embassy galeni sighed and seemed to compose himself i got a call that morning from an old komarran acquaintance asking me to meet him there was no log of a call ivan checked your comconsole i erased it that was a mistake though i didnt realize it at the time but something hed said led me to think this might be a lead into the mystery of your peculiar orders so i did convince you my orders had to have been screwed up oh yes but it was clear that if that were so my embassy security had been penetrated compromised from the inside it was probably through the courier but i dared not lay such a charge without adducing objective evidence the courier yes said miles that was my second choice galenis brows lifted what was your first choice you im afraid galenis sour smile said it all miles shrugged in embarrassment i figured youd made off with my eighteen million marks except if you had why hadnt you absconded and then you absconded oh said galeni in turn all the facts fit then miles explained i had you pegged as an embezzler deserter thief and allaround komarran son of a bitch so what kept you from laying charges to that effect nothing unfortunately miles cleared his throat sorry galenis face went faintly green too dismayed even to get up a convincing glare though he tried too right said miles if we dont get out of here your name is going to be mud all for nothing galeni braced his back to the wall his head tilting back against it for support eyes closing as if in pain miles contemplated the probable political consequences should he and galeni disappear now without further trace investigators must find his embezzlement theory even more exciting than he had compounded now by kidnapping murder elopement god knew what the scandal could be guaranteed to rock the komarran integration effort to its foundations perhaps destroy it altogether miles glanced across the room at the man his father had chosen to take a chance on a kind of redemption that alone could be enough reason for the komarran underground to murder them both but the existence of theoh god not a clonealtermiles suggested that this slander upon galenis character courtesy of miles was merely a happy bonus from the komarran viewpoint he wondered if theyd be properly grateful so you went to meet this man miles prodded without taking a beeper or a backup yes and promptly got yourself kidnapped and you criticize my security techniques yes galenis eyes opened well no we had lunch first you sat down to lunch with this guy orwas she pretty miles awoke to galenis choice of pronoun back when hed been addressing edged remarks to the light fixture no not a pretty hardly but he did attempt to suborn me did he succeed at galenis withering glare miles explained making this entire conversation a play for my benefit ysee galeni grimaced half irritation half wry agreement forgeries and originals truth and lies how were they to be tested here i told him to get stuffed galeni said this loudly enough that the light fixture couldnt possibly miss it i should have realized in the course of our argument that he had told me entirely too much about what was really going on to dare let me go but we exchanged guarantees i turned my back on him let sentiment cloud my judgment he did not and so i ended up here galeni glanced around their narrow cell for a little time yet until he gets over his surge of sentiment as he will eventually defiance glared at the light fixture miles drew breath cold cold through his teeth must have been a pretty compelling old acquaintance oh yes galeni closed his eyes again as if he contemplated escaping miles and this whole tangle by retreating into sleep galenis stiff halting movements hinted of torture they been urging you to change your mind or interrogating you the old hard way galenis eyes slitted open he touched the purple splotch under the left one no they have fastpenta for interrogation no need to get physical ive been round on it three four times theres not much they dont know about embassy security by now why the contusions then i made a break for it yesterday i guess the three fellows who tackled me look worse i assure you they must still be hoping ill change my mind couldnt you have pretended to cooperate at least long enough to get away said miles in exasperation galenis eyes snapped truculently never he hissed the spasm of rage evaporated with a weary sigh i suppose i should have too late now had they scrambled the captains brains with their drugs if old cold galeni had let emotion ambush his reason to that extent wellit must be a bloody strong emotion the downdeep deadlies that iq could do nothing about i dont suppose theyd buy an offer to cooperate from me miles said glumly galenis voice returned to its original drawl hardly right a few minutes later miles remarked it cant be a clone yknow why not said galeni any clone of mine grown from my body cells ought to lookwell rather like ivan six feet tall or so and not distorted in his face and spine with good bones not these chalksticks unless horrid thought the medics have been lying to me all my life about my genes he must have been distorted to match galeni offered thoughtfully chemically or surgically or both no harder to do that to your clone than to any other surgical construct maybe easier but what happened to me was so random an accidenteven the repairs were experimentalmy own doctors didnt know what theyd have till it was over getting the duplicate right must have been tricky but obviously not impossible perhaps the individual we saw represents the last in a series of trials in that case what have they done with the discards miles asked wildly a parade of clones passed through his imagination like a chart of evolution run in reverse upright ivanish cromagnon devolving through missing links into chimpanzeemiles i imagine they were disposed of galenis voice was high and mild not so much denying as defying honor miless belly shivered ruthless oh yes galeni agreed in that same soft tone miles groped for logic in that case hethe clone my twin brother there he had thought the thought flat out must be significantly younger than myself several years agreed galeni at a guess six why six arithmetic you were about six when the komarran revolt ended that would have been the time this group would have been forced to turn its attention toward some other less direct plan of attack on barrayar the idea would not have interested them earlier much later and the clone would still be too young to replace you even with accelerated growth too young to carry off the act it appears he must act as well as look like you for a time but why a clone at all why a clone of me i believe hes intended for some sabotage timed with an uprising on komarr barrayar will never let komarr go never youre our front gate i know said galeni tiredly but some people would rather drown our domes in blood than learn from history or learn anything at all he glanced involuntarily at the light miles swallowed rallied his will spoke into the silence how long have you known your father hadnt been blown up with that bomb galenis eyes flashed back to him his body froze then relaxed if so grating a motion could be called relaxation but he said merely five days after a time he added how did you know we cracked open your personnel files he was your only close relative with no morgue record we believed he was dead galenis voice was distant level my brother certainly was barrayaran security came and got my mother and me to identify what was left there wasnt much left it was no effort to believe there was literally nothing left of my father whod been reported much closer to the center of the explosion the man was in knots fraying before miless eyes miles found he did not relish the idea of watching galeni come apart very wasteful of an officer from the imperiums viewpoint like an assassination or an abortion my father spoke constantly of komarrs freedom galeni went on softly to miles to the light fixture to himself of the sacrifices we must all make for the freedom of komarr he was very big on sacrifices human or otherwise but he never seemed to care much about the freedom of anyone on komarr it wasnt until the day the revolt died that i became a free man the day he died free to look with my own eyes make my own judgments choose my own life or so i thought life the lilt of galenis voice was infinitely sarcastic is full of surprises he favored the light fixture with a vulpine smile miles squeezed his eyes shut trying to think straight not easy with galeni sitting two meters away emanating murderous tension on redline overload miles had the unpleasant feeling that his nominal superior had lost sight of the larger strategic picture just now locked in some private struggle with old ghosts or old nonghosts it was up to miles up to miles to dowhat he rose and prowled the room on shaky legs galeni watched him through slitted eyes without comment no exit but the one he scratched at the walls with his fingernails they were impervious the seams at floor and ceilinghe hopped up on the bench and reached dizzilyyielded not at all he passed into the halfbath relieved himself washed his hands and face and sour mouth at the sinkcold water onlydrank from his cupped hands no glass not even a plastic cup the water sloshed nauseatingly in his stomach his hands twitched from the aftereffects of the stun he wondered what the result of stuffing the drain with his shirt and running the water might be that seemed to be the maximum possible vandalism he returned to his bench wiping his hands on his trousers and sat down before he fell down do they feed you he asked two or three times a day said galeni some of whatever theyre cooking upstairs several people seem to be living in this house that would seem to be the one time you could make a break then it was agreed galeni was right their captors guard would be redoubled now after galenis attempt not an attempt that miles dared duplicate a beating like the one galeni had taken would incapacitate him completely galeni contemplated the locked door it does provide a certain amount of entertainment you never know when the door opens if its going to be dinner or death miles got the impression galeni was rather hoping for death bloody kamikaze miles knew the fey mood inside out you could fall in love with that gravenarrow optionit was the enemy of creative strategic thought it was the enemy period but his resolve failed to find a practical form though he spun it round and round inside his head surely ivan must recognize the imposter immediately or would he just put down any mistakes the clone made to miles having an off day there was certainly precedent for that and if the komarrans had spent four days pumping galeni dry on embassy procedures it was quite possible the clone would be able to carry out miless routine duties errorfree after all if the creature were truly a clone he should be just as smart as miles or just as stupid miles hung on to that comforting thought if miles made mistakes in his desperate dance through life the clone could make just as many trouble was would anyone be able to tell their mistakes apart but what about the dendarii his dendarii fallen into the hands of aa what what were the komarrans plans how much did they know about the dendarii and how the hell could the clone duplicate both lord vorkosigan and admiral naismith when miles himself had to make them up as he went along and elliif elli hadnt been able to tell the difference in the abandoned house could she tell the difference in bed would that filthy tittle imposter dare seduce quinn but what human being of any of the three sexes could possibly resist an invitation to cavort between the sheets with the brilliant and beautiful miless imagination curdled with detailed pictures of the clone out there doing things to his quinn most of which miles hadnt even had time to try yet himself he found his hands writhing in a whiteknuckled grip on the edge of the bench in danger of snapping his fingerbones he let up surely the clone must try to avoid intimate situations with people who knew miles well where he would be in most danger of getting tripped up unless he was a cocky little shit with a compulsive experimental bent like the one miles shaved daily in his mirror miles and elli had just begun to get intimatewould she wouldnt she know the difference if shemiles swallowed and tried to bring his mind back to the larger political scenario the clone hadnt been created just to drive him crazy that was merely a fringe benefit the clone had been forged as a weapon directed against barrayar through prime minister count aral vorkosigan against barrayar as if the two were one miles had no illusions it wasnt for his own selfs sake that this plot had been gotten up he could think of a dozen ways a false miles might be used against his father ranging from relatively benign to horrifically cruel he glanced across the cell at galeni sprawled coolly waiting for his own father to kill him or using that very coolness to force his father to kill him proving what miles quietly dropped the benign scenarios off his list of possibilities in the end exhaustion overtook him and he slept on the hard bench he slept badly swimming up repeatedly out of some unpleasant dream only to reencounter the even more unpleasant realitycold bench cramped muscles galeni flung across the bench opposite twisting in equal discomfort his eyes gleaming through the fringe of his lashes not revealing whether he woke or dozedthen wavering back down to dreamland in selfdefense miless sense of the passage of time became totally distorted though when he finally sat up his creaking muscles and the waterclock of his bladder suggested hed slept long by the time he made a trip to the washroom splashed cold water on his nowstubbled face and drank his mind was churning back into high gear rendering further sleep impossible he wished he had his catblanket the door clicked galeni snapped from his apparent doze into a sitting position feet under his center of gravity face utterly closed but this time it was dinner or breakfast judging from the ingredients lukewarm scrambled eggs sweet raisin bread blessed coffee in a flimsy cup one spoon each it was delivered by one of the pokerfaced young men miles had seen the night before another hovered in the doorway stunner at ready eyeing galeni the man set the food down on the end of one bench and backed quickly out miles regarded the food warily but galeni collected his and ate without hesitation did he know it wasnt drugged or poisoned or did he just not give a damn anymore miles shrugged and ate too miles swallowed his last precious drops of coffee and asked have you picked up any hint of what the purpose of this whole masquerade is they must have gone to incredible lengths to produce this duplicate me it cant be a minor plot galeni looking a bit less pale by virtue of the decent food rolled his cup carefully between his hands i know what theyve told me i dont know if what theyve told me is the truth right go on youve got to understand my fathers group is a radical splinter of the main komarran underground the groups havent spoken to each other in years which is one of the reasons webarrayaran security a faint ironic smile played around his lips missed them the main body has been losing momentum over the last decade the expatriates children with no memory of komarr have been growing up as citizens of other planets and the older ones have beenwell growing old dying off and with things becoming not so bad at home theyre not making new converts its a shrinking power base critically shrinking i can see that would make the radicals itchy to make some move while they still had a chance miles remarked yes theyre in a squeeze galeni crushed his cup slowly in his fist reduced to wild gambles this one seems pretty damned exotic to betsixteen eighteen years on how the devil did they assemble the medical resources was your father a doctor galeni snorted hardly the medical half was the easy part apparently once theyd got hold of the stolen tissue sample from barrayar though how they did that i spent the first six years of my life getting prodded probed biopsied scanned sampled sliced and diced by doctors there must have been kilograms of me floating around in various medical labs to choose from a regular tissue smorgasbord that was the easy part but the actual cloning was hired out to some shady medical laboratory on the planet of jacksons whole as i understand it that would do anything for a price miless mouth opening gaped for a moment oh them do you know about jacksons whole iveencountered their work in another context damned if i cant name the lab most likely to have done it too theyre experts at cloning among other things they do the illegal braintransfer operationsillegal anywhere but jacksons whole that iswhere the young clone is grown in a vat and the old brain is transferred into itthe old rich brain needless to sayand um theyve done some bioengineering work that i cant talk about and yes and all this time they had a copy of me in the back roomthose sons of bitches theyre going to find out theyre not as bloody untouchable as they think they are this time i miles controlled incipient hyperventilation personal revenge upon jacksons whole must wait for some more propitious time so the komarran underground invested nothing except money in the project for the first ten or fifteen years no wonder it was never traced yes said galeni so a few years ago the decision was made to pull this card out of their sleeve they picked up the completed clone now a young teenager from jacksons whole and began training him to be you why theyre apparently going for the imperium what miles cried no not with me that individual stood right there galeni pointed to a spot near the door two days ago and told me i was looking at the next emperor of barrayar they would have to kill both emperor gregor and my father to mount anything of a sort miles began frantically i would imagine said galeni dryly theyre looking forward to just that he lay back on his bench eyes glinting hands locked behind his neck for a pillow and purred over my dead body of course over both our dead bodies they dont dare let us live i believe i mentioned that yesterday still if anything goes wrong miless gaze flickered toward the light fixture it might be handy for them to have hostages he enunciated this idea clearly emphasizing the plural though he feared that from the barrayaran point of view only one of them had value as a hostage galeni was no fool he knew who the goat was too damn damn damn miles had walked into this trap knowing it was a trap in hopes of gaining just the sort of information he now possessed but he hadnt meant to stay trapped he rubbed the back of his neck in utter frustrationwhat joy it would have been to call down a dendarii strike force on thisthis nest of rebelsright now the door clicked it was too early for lunch miles whipped around hoping for a wild instant to find commander quinn leading a patrol to his rescueno it was just the two goons again and a third in the doorway with a stunner one gestured at miles you come along where to miles asked suspiciously could this be the end alreadyto be taken back down to the garage sublevel and shot or have his neck broken he felt disinclined to walk voluntarily to his own execution something like that must have been passing through galenis mind too for as the pair grabbed miles unceremoniously by the arms galeni lunged for them the one with the stunner dropped him before he was halfway across the floor galeni convulsed teeth bared in desperate resistance then lay still numbly miles allowed himself to be bundled out the door if his death were coming he wanted to at least stay conscious to spit in its eye one last time as it closed on him chapter nine to miless temporary relief they took him up not down the lift tube not that they couldnt perfectly well kill him someplace other than the garage sublevel galeni now they might murder in the garage to avoid having to lug the body but miless own dead weight so to speak would not present nearly the logistic load the room into which the two men now shoved him was some sort of study or private office bright despite the polarized window library data files filled a transparent shelf on the wall an ordinary comconsole desk occupied one corner the comconsole vid was presently displaying a fisheye view of miless cell galeni still lay stunned on the floor the older man who had seemed in charge of miless kidnapping the night before sat on a beigepadded chrome bench before the darkened window examining a hypospray just taken from its case which lay open beside him so interrogation not execution was the plan or at any rate interrogation before execution unless they simply contemplated poisoning him miles tore his gaze from the glittering hypo as the man shifted his head tilting to study miles through narrowed blue eyes a flick of his gaze checked the comconsole it was a momentary accident of posture a hand gripping the edge of the bench that snapped miless realization into place for the man did not greatly resemble captain galeni except perhaps in the paleness of his skin he appeared to be about sixty clipped greying hair lined face body thickening with age clearly not that of an outdoorsman or athlete he wore conservative earther clothes a generation removed from the historical fashions of the parading teenagers that miles had enjoyed in the shopping arcade he might have been a businessman or a teacher anything but a hairy terrorist except for the murderous tension in that in the coil of the hands flare of the nostril iron of the mouth stiffness of the neck ser galen and duv galeni were as one galen rose and stalked slowly around miles with the air of a man studying a sculpture by an inferior artist miles stood very still feeling smaller than usual in his sock feet stubbled and grubby he had come to the center at last the secret source from which all his coiling troubles had been emanating these past weeks and the center was this man who orbited him staring back with hungry hate or perhaps he and galen were both centers like the twin foci of an ellipse brought together and superimposed at last to create some diabolical perfect circle miles felt very small and very brittle galen could very well begin by breaking miless arms with the same absent nervous air that elli quinn bit her nails just to release tension does he see me at all or am i an object a symbol representing the enemywill he murder me for the sake of sheer allegory so ser galen spoke this is the real thing at last not very impressive to have seduced my sons loyalty what can he see in you still you represent barrayar very well the monster son of a monster father aral vorkosigans secret moral genotype made flesh for all to see perhaps there is some justice in the universe after all very poetic choked miles but biologically inaccurate as you must know having cloned me galen smiled sourly i wont insist on it he completed his circuit and faced miles i suppose you couldnt help being born but why have you never revolted from the monster he made you what you are an expansive gesture of galens open hand summed up miless stunted and twisted frame what dictators charisma does the man possess that hes able to hypnotize not only his own son but everyone elses too the prone figure in the vid console seemed to pluck at galens eye why do you follow him why does david what corrupt kick can my son get out of crawling into a barrayaran goonuniform and marching behind vorkosigan galens voice feigned light banter very badly the undertones twisted with anguish miles glowering clipped out for one thing my father has never abandoned me in the presence of an enemy galens head jerked back all pretense of banter extinguished he turned abruptly away and went to take up the hypospray from the bench miles silently cursed his own tongue but for that stupid impulse to grab the last word to return the cut he might have kept the man talking and learned something now the talking and the learning would all be going the other way the two guards took him by the elbows the one on the left pushed up his shirt sleeve here it came galen pressed the hypospray against the vein on the inside of miless elbow a hiss a prickling bite what is it miles had just time to ask his voice sounded unfortunately weak and nervous in his own ears fastpenta of course replied galen easily miles was not surprised though he cringed inwardly knowing what was to come he had studied fastpentas pharmacology effects and proper use in the security course at the barrayaran imperial academy it was the drug of choice for interrogation not only for the imperial service but galaxywide the nearperfect truth serum irresistible harmless to the subject even with repeated doses irresistible and harmless that is except to the unfortunate few who had either a natural or artificiallyinduced allergic reaction to it miles had never even been considered as a candidate for this last conditioning his person being judged more valuable than any secret information he might contain other espionage agents were less lucky anaphylactic shock was an even less heroic death than the disintegration chamber usually reserved for convicted spies despairing miles waited to go gaga admiral naismith had sat in on more than one real fastpenta interrogation the drug washed all reason out to sea on a flood of benign good feeling and charitable cheer like a cat on catnip it was highly amusing to watchin somebody else in moments he would be mellow to the point of drooling idiocy ugly to think of the resolute captain galeni having been so shamefully reduced four times running hed said no wonder he was twitchy miles could feel his heart racing as though hed overdosed on caffeine his vision seemed to sharpen to an almost painful focus the edge lines of every object in the room glowed the masses they enclosed palpable to his exacerbated senses galen standing back by the pulsing window was a livewiring diagram electric and dangerous loaded with deadly voltage awaiting some triggering discharge mellow this wasnt he had to be slipping into natural shock miles took his last breath would his interrogator ever be surprised rather to miless own surprise he kept on panting not anaphylactic shock then just another damned idiosyncratic drug reaction he hoped the stuff wouldnt bring on those ghastly hallucinations like that bloody sedative hed been given once by an unsuspecting surgeon he wanted to scream his eyes flashed whiteedged to follow galens least motion one of the guards shoved a chair up behind him and sat him down miles fell into it gratefully shivering uncontrollably his thoughts seemed to explode in fragments and reform like fireworks being run forward and then in reverse through a vid galen frowned down at him describe the security procedures for entry and exit from the barrayaran embassy surely they must have squeezed this basic information out of captain galeni alreadyit must merely be a question to check the effect of the fastpenta of the fastpenta miles heard his own voice echoing his thoughts oh hell hed hoped his odd reaction to the drug might have included the ability to resist spilling his mind out his mouth what a repulsive image head swaying he stared down at the floor in front of his feet as if he might see a pile of bloody brains vomited there ser galen strode forward and yanked his head up by the hair and repeated through his teeth describe the security procedures for entry and exit from the barrayaran embassy sergeant barths in charge miles began impulsively obnoxious bigot no savoir faire at all and a jock to boot unable to stop himself miles poured out not only codes passwords scanner perimeters but also personnel schedules his private opinions of each and every individual and a scathing critique of the security nets defects one thought triggered another and then the next in an explosive chain like a string of firecrackers he couldnt stop he babbled not only could he not stop himself galen couldnt stop him either prisoners on fastpenta tended to wander by free association from the topic unless kept on track by frequent cues from their interrogators miles found himself doing the same on fastforward normal victims could be brought up short by a word but only when galen struck him hard and repeatedly across the face shouting him down did miles halt and sit panting torture was not a part of fastpenta interrogation because the happily drugged subjects were impervious to it for miles the pain pulsed in and out at one moment detached and distant the next flooding his body and whiting out his mind like a burst of static to his own horror he began to cry then stopped with a sudden hiccup galen stood staring at him in repelled fascination its not right muttered one of the guards he shouldnt be like that is he beating the fastpenta some kind of new conditioning hes not beating it though galen pointed out he glanced at his wrist chrono hes not withholding information hes giving more too much more the comconsole began chiming insistently ill get it volunteered miles its probably for me he surged up out of his seat his knees gave way and he fell flat on his face on the carpet it prickled against his bruised cheek the two guards dragged him off the floor and propped him back up in the chair the room jerked in a slow circle around him galen answered the comconsole reporting in miless own crisp voice in its barrayaranaccented incarnation rang from the vid the clones face seemed not quite as familiar as the one miles shaved daily in his mirror his hairs parted on the wrong side if he wants to be me miles observed to no one in particular no its not no one was listening anyway miles considered angles of incidence and angles of reflection his thoughts bouncing at the speed of light back and forth between the mirrored walls of his empty skull hows it going galen leaned anxiously across the comconsole i nearly lost it all in the first five minutes last night that big dendarii sergeantdriver turned out to be the damned cousin the clones voice was low and tense blind luck i was able to carry off my first mistake as a joke but theyve got me rooming with the bastard and he snores too true miles remarked unasked for real entertainment waitll he starts making love in his sleep damn i wish i had dreams like ivans all i get are anxiety nightmaresplaying polo naked against a lot of dead cetagandans with lieutenant murkas severed head for the ball it screamed every time i hit it toward the goal falling off and getting trampled miless mutter trailed off as they continued to ignore him youre going to have to deal with all kinds of people who knew him before this is done said galen roughly to the vid but if you can fool vorpatril youll be able to carry it off anywhere you can fool all of the people some of the time chirped miles and some of the people all of the time but you can fool ivan anytime he doesnt pay attention galen glanced over at him in irritation the embassy is a perfect isolated testmicrocosm he went on to the vid before you go on to the larger arena of barrayar itself vorpatrils presence makes it an ideal practice opportunity if he tumbles to you we can find some way to eliminate him mm the clone seemed scarcely reassured before we started i thought youd managed to stuff my head with everything it was possible to know about miles vorkosigan then at the last minute you find out hes been leading a double life all this timewhat else have you missed miles weve been over that miles realized with a start that galen was addressing the clone with his name had he been so thoroughly conditioned to his role that he had no name of his own strange we knew thered be gaps over which youd have to improvise but well never have a better opportunity than this chance visit of his to earth has given us better than waiting another six months and trying to maneuver in on barrayar no its now or never galen took a calming breath so you got through the night all right the clone snorted yeah if you dont count waking up being strangled by a damned animated fur coat what oh the live fur didnt he give it to his woman evidently not i nearly peed myself before i realized what it was woke up the cousin did he suspect anything galen asked urgently i passed it off as a nightmare it seems vorkosigan has them fairly often miles nodded sagely thats what i told you severed heads broken bones mutilated relatives unusual alterations to important parts of my body the drug seemed to be imparting some odd memory effects part of what made fastpenta so effective for interrogation no doubt his recent dreams were coming back to him far more clearly than hed ever consciously remembered them all in all he was glad he usually tended to forget them did vorpatril say anything about it in the morning asked galen no im not talking much thats out of character miles observed helpfully im pretending to have a mild episode of one of those depressions in his psyche reportwho is that anyway the clone craned his neck vorkosigan himself weve got him on fastpenta ah good ive been getting calls all morning over a secured comm link from his mercenaries asking for orders we agreed youd avoid the mercenaries fine tell them how soon can you get orders cut getting you out of the embassy and back to barrayar not soon enough to avoid the dendarii completely i broached it to the ambassador but it appears vorkosigans in charge of the search for captain galeni he seemed surprised id want to leave so i backed off for now has the captain changed his mind about cooperating yet if not youll have to generate my returnhome orders from out there and slip them in with the courier or something galen hesitated visibly ill see what i can do in the meantime keep trying doesnt galen know we know the couriers compromised miles thought in a flash of nearnormal clarity he managed to keep the vocalization to a low mumble right well you promised me youd keep him alive for questions until i left so heres one who is lieutenant bone and what is she supposed to do about the surplusage from the triumph she didnt say what it was a surplus of one of the guards prodded miles answer the question miles struggled for clarity of thought and expression shes my fleet accountant i suppose she should dump it into her investment account and play with it as usual its a surplus of money he felt compelled to explain then cackled bitterly temporary im sure will that do asked galen i think so i told her she was an experienced officer and to use her discretion and she seemed to go off satisfied but i sure wondered what id just ordered her to do all right next who is rosalie crew and why is she suing admiral naismith for half a million gsa federal credits who gaped miles in genuine astonishment as the guard prodded him again what miles was confusedly unable to convert half a million gsa credits to barrayaran imperial marks in his drugscrambled head with any precision beyond lots and lots and lots for a moment the association of the name remained blocked then clicked in ye gods its that poor clerk from the wine shop i saved her from burning up why sue me why not sue danio he burned down her storeof course hes broke but what do i do about it asked the clone you wanted to be me said miles in a surly voice you figure it out his mental processes clicked on anyway slap her with a countersuit for medical damages i think i threw my back out lifting her it still hurts galen overrode this ignore it he instructed youll be out of there before anything can come of it all right said the milesclone doubtfully and leave the dendarii holding the bag said miles angrily he squeezed his eyes shut trying desperately to think in the wavering room but of course you dont care anything about the dendarii do you you must care they put their lives on the line for youmeits wrongyoull betray them casually without even thinking about it you scarcely know what they are quite sighed the clone and speaking of what they are just what is his relationship with this commander quinn anyway did you finally decide he was screwing her or not were just good friends caroled miles and laughed hysterically he lunged for the comconsolethe guards grabbed for him and missedand climbing across the desk snarled into the vid stay away from her you little shit shes mine you hear mine mine all minequinn quinn beautiful quinn quinn of the evening beautiful quinn he sang offkey as the guards dragged him back blows ran him down into silence i thought you had him on fastpenta said the clone to galen we do it doesnt sound like fastpenta yes theres something wrong yet hes not supposed to have been conditioned im beginning to seriously doubt the utility of keeping him alive any longer as a data bank if we cant trust his answers thats just great scowled the clone he glanced over his shoulder ive got to go ill report again tonight if im still alive by then he vanished with an irritated bleep galen turned back to miles with a list of questions about barrayaran imperial headquarters about emperor gregor about miless usual activities when quartered in barrayars capital city vorbarr sultana and question after question about the dendarii mercenaries miles writhing answered and answered and answered unable to stop his own rapid gabble but partway through he hit on a line of poetry and ended by reciting the whole sonnet galens slaps could not derail him the strings of association were too strong to break into after that he managed to jump off the interrogation repeatedly works with strong meter and rhyme worked best bad narrative verse obscene dendarii drinking songs anything a chance word or phrase from his interrogators could trigger his memory seemed phenomenal galens face was darkening with frustration at this rate well be here till next winter said one of the guards in disgust miless bleeding lips peeled back in a maniacal grin now is the winter of our discontent he cried made glorious summer by this sun of york it had been years since hed memorized the ancient play but the vivid iambic pentameter carried him along relentlessly short of beating him into unconsciousness there seemed nothing galen could do to turn him off miles was not even to the end of act i when the two guards dragged him back down the lift tube and threw him roughly back into his prison room once there his rapidfiring neurons drove him from wall to wall pacing and reciting jumping up and down off the bench at appropriate moments doing all the womens parts in a high falsetto he got all the way through to the last amen before he collapsed on the floor and lay gasping captain galeni who had been scrunched into the corner on his bench with his arms wrapped protectively around his ears for the last hour lifted his head cautiously from their circle are you quite finished he said mildly miles rolled over on his back and stared blankly up at the light three cheers for literacy i feel sick im not surprised galen looked pale and ill himself still shaky from the aftereffects of the stun what was that the play or the drug i recognized the play thank you what drug fastpenta youre joking not joking i have several weird drug reactions theres a whole chemical class of sedatives i cant touch apparently this is related what a piece of good fortune i seriously doubt the utility of keeping him alive i dont think so miles said distantly he lurched to his feet ricocheted into the bathroom threw up and passed out he awoke with the unblinking glare of the overhead light needling his eyes and flung an arm over his face to shut it out someonegalenihad put him back on his bench galeni was asleep now across the room breathing heavily a meal cold and congealed sat on a plate at the end of miless bench it must be deep night miles contemplated the food queasily then put it down out of sight under his bench time stretched inexorably as he tossed turned sat up lay down aching and nauseous escape even into sleep receding out of reach the next morning after breakfast they came and took not miles but galeni the captain left with a look of grim distaste in his eyes sounds of a violent altercation came from the hallway galeni trying to get himself stunned a draconian but surely effective way of avoiding interrogation he did not succeed their captors returned him giggling vacuously after a marathon number of hours he lay limply on his bench giving vent to an occasional snicker for what might have been another hour before slipping into torpid sleep miles gallantly resisted taking advantage of the residual effects of the drug to get in a few questions of his own alas fastpenta subjects remembered their experiences miles was fairly certain by now that one of galenis personal triggers was in the key word betrayal galeni returned to a thick but cold consciousness at last looking ill fastpenta hangover was a remarkably unpleasant experience in that miless response to the drug had not been at all idiosyncratic miles winced in sympathy as galeni made his own trip to the washroom galeni returned to sit heavily on his bench his eye fell on his cold dinner plate he prodded it dubiously with an experimental forefinger you want this he asked miles no thanks mm galeni shoved the plate out of sight under his bench and sat back rather nervelessly what were they after miles jerked his head doorward in your interrogation personal history mostly this time galeni contemplated his socks which were getting stiff with grime but miles was not sure galeni was seeing what he was looking at he seems to have this strange difficulty grasping that i actually mean what i say he had apparently genuinely convinced himself that he had only to reveal himself to whistle to bring me to his heel as i had run when i was fourteen as if the weight of my entire adult life counted for nothing as if id put on this uniform for a joke or out of despair or confusionanything but a reasoned and principled decision no need to ask who he was miles grinned sourly what it wasnt for the spiffy boots im just dazzled by the glittering tinsel of neofascism galeni informed him blandly is that how he phrased it anyway its feudalism not fascism apart maybe from some of the late emperor ezar vorbarras experiments in centralization the glittering tinsel of neofeudalism i will grant you i am thoroughly familiar with the principle of barrayaran government thank you remarked dr galeni such as they are muttered miles it was all arrived at by improvisation yknow yes i do glad to know you arent as historically illiterate as the average young officer coming up these days so miles said if it wasnt for the gold braid arid the shiny boots why are you with us oh of course galeni rolled his eyes toward the light fixture i get a sadistic psychosexual kick out of being a bully goon and thug its a power trip hi miles waved from across the room talk to me not him huh he had his turn mm galeni crossed his arms glumly in a sense its true i suppose i am on a power trip or i was for what its worth thats not a secret to the barrayaran high command nor to any barrayaran though people from outside your society seem to miss it regularly how do they imagine such an apparently casterigid society has survived the incredible stresses of the century since the end of the time of isolation without exploding in a way the imperial service has performed something of the same social function as the medieval church once did here on earth as a safety valve through it anyone of talent can launder his caste origins twenty years of imperial service and they step out for all practical purposes an honorary vor the names may not have changed since dorca vorbarras day when the vor were a closed caste of selfserving horse goons miles grinned at this description of his greatgrandfathers generation but the substance has altered out of all recognition and yet through it all the vor have managed however desperately to hang on to certain vital principles of service and sacrifice to the knowledge that it is possible for a man who would not stop and stoop to take to yet run down the street for a chance to give he stopped short and cleared his throat flushing my phd thesis yknow the barrayaran imperial service a century of change i see i wanted to serve komarr as your father before you miles finished galeni glanced up sharply suspecting sarcasm but found miles trusted only sympathetic irony in his eyes galenis hand opened in a brief gesture of agreement and understanding yes and no none of the cadets who entered the service when i did have yet seen a shooting war i saw one from street level i had suspected you were more intimately acquainted with the komarr revolt than the security reports seemed to believe remarked miles as a drafted apprentice to my father galeni confirmed some night forays other missions of sabotagei was small for my age there are places a child idly playing can pass where an adult would be stopped before my fourteenth birthday i had helped kill men i have no illusions about the glorious imperial troops during the komarr revolt i saw men wearing this uniform he waved a hand down the piped length of his green trousers do shameful things in anger or fear in frustration or desperation sometimes just in idle viciousness but i could not see that it made any practical difference to the corpses ordinary people caught in the cross fire whether they were burned down by evil invader plasma fire or blown to bits by good patriotic gravitic implosions freedom we can scarcely pretend that komarr was a democracy even before the barrayarans came my father cried that barrayar had destroyed komarr but when i looked around komarr was still there you cant tax a wasteland miles murmured i saw a little girl once he stopped bit his lip plunged on what makes a practical difference is that there not be war i meani meantto make that practical difference a service career an honorable retirement leverage to a ministerial appointmentthen up through the ranks on the civil side then the viceroyalty of komarr suggested miles that hope would be slightly megalomanic said galeni an appointment on his staff though certainly his vision faded palpably as he glanced around their cellroom and his lips puffed on a silent selfderisive laugh my father on the other hand wants revenge foreign domination of komarr being not merely prone to abuse but intrinsically evil by first principle trying to make it unforeign by integration is not compromise its collaboration capitulation komarran revolutionaries died for my sins and so on and on hes still attempting to persuade you to come over to his side then oh yes i believe he will keep talking till he pulls the trigger not that im asking you to um compromise your principles or anything but i really dont see that it would be any extra skin off my nose if you were to say plead for your own life miles mentioned diffidently he who fights and runs away lives to fight another day and all that galeni shook his head for precisely that logic i cannot surrender not will notcan not he cant trust me if i reversed he would too and be compelled to argue himself into killing me as hard as he now feigns to be arguing himself out hes already sacrificed my brother in a sense my mothers death came ultimately from that loss and others he inflicted on her in the name of the cause he added in a flash of selfconsciousness i suppose that makes this all seem very oedipal butthe anguish of making the hard choices has always appealed to the romance in his soul miles shook his head ill allow you know the man better than i do and yet well people do get hypnotized by the hard choices and stop looking for alternatives the will to be stupid is a very powerful force this surprised a brief laugh from galeni and a thoughtful look but there are always alternatives surely its more important to be loyal to a person than a principle galeni raised his eyebrows i suppose that shouldnt surprise me coming from a barrayaran from a society that traditionally organizes itself by internal oaths of fealty instead of an external framework of abstract lawis that your fathers politics showing miles cleared his throat my mothers theology actually from two completely different starting points they arrive at this odd intersection in their views her theory is that principles come and go but that human souls are immortal and you should therefore throw in your lot with the greater part my mother tends to be extremely logical betan yknow galeni sat forward in interest his hands loosely clasped between his knees it surprises me more that your mother had anything to do with your upbringing at all barrayaran society tends to be so er aggressively patriarchal and countess vorkosigan has the reputation of being the most invisible of political wives yeah invisible miles agreed cheerfully like air if it disappeared youd hardly miss it till the next time you came to inhale he suppressed a twinge of homesickness and a fiercer fearif i dont make it back this time galeni smiled polite disbelief its hard to imagine that great admiral yielding to ah uxorial blandishments miles shrugged he yields to logic my mother is one of the few people i know who has almost completely conquered the will to be stupid miles frowned introspectively your fathers a fairly bright man is he not i mean given his premises hes eluded security hes been able to put together at least temporarily effective courses of action hes got followthrough hes certainly persistent yes i suppose so said galeni hm what well theres something about this whole plot that bothers me i should think theres a great deal not personally logically in the abstract as a plot qua plot theres something that doesnt quite add up even from his point of view of course its a scramblechances must be taken its always like that when you try to convert any plan into actionbut over and above the practical problems something intrinsically screwy its daring but if he succeeds hell have it all if your clone takes the imperium hell stand in the center of barrayars power structure hell control it all absolute power bullshit said miles galenis brows rose just because barrayars system of checks and balances is unwritten doesnt mean its not there you must know the emperors power consists of no more than the cooperation he is able to extract from the military from the counts from the ministries from the people generally terrible things happen to emperors who fail to perform their function to the satisfaction of all these groups the dismemberment of mad emperor yuri wasnt so very long ago my father was actually present for that remarkably gory execution as a boy and yet people still wonder why hes never tried to take the imperium for himself so here we have a picture of this imitation me grabbing for the throne in a bloody coup followed by a rapid transfer of power and privilege to komarr say even granting its independence results go on said galeni fascinated the military will be offended because im throwing away their hardwon victories the counts will be offended because ill have promoted myself above them the ministries will be offended because the loss of komarr as a tax farm and trade nexus will reduce their power the people will be offended for all these reasons plus the fact that i am in their eyes a mutant physically unclean in barrayaran tradition infanticide for obvious birth defects is still going on secretly in the back country do you know despite its being outlawed for four decades if you can think of any fate nastier than being dismembered alive well that poor clone is headed straight for it im not sure even i could ride the imperium and survive even without the komarran complications and that kids onlywhatseventeen eighteen years old miles subsided its a stupid plot or or or its some other plot hm besides said miles more slowly why should ser galen who if im reading him right hates my father more than he lovesanybody be going to all this trouble to put vorkosigan blood on the barrayaran imperial throne its a most obscure revenge and how if by some miracle he succeeds in getting the boy imperial power does he then propose to control him conditioning suggested galeni threats to expose him mm maybe at this impasse miles fell silent after long moments he spoke again i think the real plot is much simpler and smarter he means to drop the clone into the middle of a power struggle just to create chaos on barrayar the results of that struggle are irrelevant the clone is merely a pawn a revolt on komarr is timed to rise during the point of maximum uproar the bloodier the better back on barrayar he must have an ally in the woodwork prepared to step in with enough military force to block barrayars wormhole exit god i hope he hasnt made a devils deal with the cetagandans for that trading a barrayaran occupation for a cetagandan one strikes me as a zerosum move in the extremesurely hes not that mad but what happens to your rather expensive clone said galeni puzzling out the threads miles smiled crookedly ser galen doesnt care hes just a means to an end his mouth opened closed opened again except thati keep hearing my mothers voice in my head thats where i picked up that perfect betan accent yknow that i use for admiral naismith i can hear her now and what does she say galenis brows twitched in amusement miles she sayswhat have you done with your baby brother your clone is hardly that choked galeni on the contrary by betan law my clone is exactly that madness galeni paused your mother could not possibly expect you to look out for this creature oh yes she could miles sighed glumly a knot of unspoken panic made a lump in his chest complex too complex and this is the woman thatyou claimis behind the man whos behind the barrayaran imperium i dont see it count vorkosigan is the most pragmatic of politicians look at the entire komarr integration scheme yes said miles cordially look at it galeni shot him a suspicious glance persons before principles eh he said slowly at last yep galeni subsided wearily on his bench after a time one corner of his mouth twitched up my father he murmured was always a man of greatprinciples chapter ten with every passing minute the chances of rescue seemed bleaker in time another breakfasttype meal was delivered making this if such a clock was to be relied upon the third day of miless incarceration the clone it appeared had not made any immediate and obvious mistake to reveal his true nature to ivan or elli and if he could pass ivan and elli he could pass anywhere miles shivered he inhaled deeply swung from his bench and put himself through a series of calisthenics trying to clear the residual mush of drug from his body and brain galeni sunk this morning in an unpleasant mixture of drug hangover depression and helpless rage sprawled on his bench and watched without comment wheezing sweating and dizzy miles paced the cell to cool down the place was beginning to stink and this wasnt helping not too hopefully he went to the washroom and tried the sockdownthedrain trick as he had suspected the same sensor system that turned on the water with a pass of his hand turned it off prior to overflow the toilet worked failsafe the same way and even if by some miracle he managed to get their captors to open the door galeni had demonstrated how poor the chance was of fighting their way out against stunners no his sole point of contact with the enemy lay in the flow of information they hoped to squeeze from him it was after all the only reason he was still alive as levers went it was potentially very powerful informational sabotage if the clone wasnt going to make mistakes on his own perhaps he needed a little push but how could miles work it tanked on fastpenta he could stand in the center of the cell and make spurious confidences to the light fixture a la captain galeni but could hardly expect to be taken seriously he was sitting on his bench frowning at his cold toesthe clammy wet socks were laid out to drywhen the door clicked open two guards with stunners one covered galeni who sneered back without moving the guards finger twitched tensely on the trigger no hesitation there they did not need galeni conscious today the other one gestured miles out if captain galeni was to be stunned instantly there was not a great deal of point in miles tackling the guards unilaterally he sighed and obeyed stepping into the corridor miles exhaled in startlement the clone stood waiting staring at him with devouring eyes the altermiles was dressed in his dendarii admirals uniform it fit perfectly right down to the combat boots rather breathlessly the clone directed the guards to escort miles to the study this time he was tied firmly to a chair in the middle of the room interestingly galen was not there wait outside the door the clone told the guards they looked at each other shrugged and obeyed hauling a couple of padded chairs with them for comfort the silence when the door closed was profound his duplicate walked slowly around miles at the safe distance of a meter as though miles were a snake that might suddenly strike he fetched up to face him a good meter and a half away leaning hipslung against the comconsole desk one booted foot swinging miles recognized the posture as his own he would never be able to use it again without being painfully selfawarea little piece of himself the clone had stolen from him one of many little pieces he felt suddenly perforated frayed tattered and afraid how ah miles began and had to pause and clear his thick dry throat however did you manage to escape the embassy ive just spent the morning attending to admiral naismiths duties the clone told him smugly miles fancied your bodyguard thought she was handing me back to barrayaran embassy security the barrayarans will think my komarran guard is a dendarii and i win myself a little slice of unaccounted time neat no risky remarked miles what do you hope to gain thats worth it fastpenta doesnt exactly work on me yknow in fact miles noticed the hypospray was nowhere in sight missing like ser galen curious it doesnt matter the clone made a sharp throwaway gesture another piece torn from miles twang i dont care if you talk truth or lies i just want to hear you talk to see you just once you you you the clones voice dropped to a whisper twang how ive come to hate you miles cleared his throat again i might point out that in point of fact we met for the very first time three nights ago whatever was done to you was not done by me you said the clone screwed me over just by existing it hurts me that you breathe he spread a hand across his chest however that will be cured very shortly but galen promised me an interview first he wheeled off the desk and began to pace miless feet twitched he promised me and where is ser galen this morning by the way miles inquired mildly out the clone favored him with a sour grin for a little slice of time miless brows rose this conversation is unauthorized he promised me but then he reneged wouldnt say why ahhm since yesterday yes the clone paused in his pacing to regard miles through narrowed eyes why i think it may have been something i said thinking out loud miles said im afraid i figured out one too many things about his plot something even you werent supposed to know he was afraid id spill it under fastpenta that suited me the less you were able to pump from me the more likely youd be to make a mistake miles waited barely breathing to see which way this bait would be taken a whiff of the exhilarated hyperconsciousness of combat thrilled along his nerves ill bite said the clone agreeably his eyes gleamed sardonic spill it then when he was seventeen this clones age hed beeninventing the dendarii mercenaries miles recalled perhaps it would be better not to underestimate him what would it be like to be a clone how far under the skin did their similarity end youre a sacrifice miles stated bluntly he does not intend for you to make it alive to the barrayaran imperium do you think i havent figured that out the clone scoffed i know he doesnt think i can make it nobody thinks i can make it miless breath caught as from a blow this twang bit bonedeep but ill show them ser galen the clones eyes glittered is going to be very surprised at what happens when i come to power so will you miles predicted morosely dyou think im stupid the clone demanded miles shook his head i know exactly how stupid you are im afraid the clone smiled tightly galen and his friends spent a month farting around london chasing you just trying to set up for the switch it was i who told them to have you kidnap yourself ive studied you longer than any of them harder than all of them i knew you couldnt resist i can outthink you demonstrably true alas at least in this instance miles fought off a wave of despair the kid was good too goodhe had it all right down to the screaming tension radiating from every muscle in his body twang or was that homegrown could different pressures produce the same warps what would it be like behind those eyes miless eye fell on the dendarii uniform his own insignia winked back at him malevolently as the clone paced but you can outthink admiral naismith the clone smiled proudly i got your soldiers released from jail this morning something you hadnt been able to do evidently danio miles croaked fascinated no no say it isnt so hes back on duty the clone nodded incisively miles suppressed a small moan the clone paused glanced at miles intently some of his decisiveness falling away speaking of admiral naismithare you sleeping with that woman what kind of life had this kid led miles wondered anew secretalways watched constantly forcetutored allowed contact with only a few selected personsalmost cloistered had the komarrans thought to include that in his training or was he a seventeenyearold virgin in which case he must be obsessed with sex quinn said miles is six years older than me extremely experienced and demanding accustomed to a high degree of finesse in her chosen partner are you an initiate in the variant practices of the deeva tau love cults as practiced on kline station a safe challenge miles judged as hed just this minute invented them are you familiar with the seven secret roads of female pleasure after shes climaxed four or five times though shell usually let you up the clone circled him looking distinctly unsettled youre lying i think maybe miles smiled toothily only wishing the improvised fantasy were true consider what youd risk finding out the clone glowered at him he glowered back do your bones break like mine miles asked suddenly horrible thought suppose for every blow miles had suffered they had broken this ones bones to match suppose for every miscalculated foolish risk of miless the clone had paid full measurereason indeed to hate no miles breathed concealed relief so their medsensor readings wouldnt exactly match it must be a shortterm plot eh i mean to be on top in six months so id understood and whose space fleet will bottle all the chaos on barrayar behind its wormhole exit while komarr rises again miles made his voice light trying to appear only casually interested in this vital bit of intelligence we were going to call in the cetagandans thats been broken off his worst fears broken off im delighted but why in an escapade singularly lacking in sanity should you have come to your senses on that one we found something better ready to hand the clone smirked strangely an independent military force highly experienced in space blockade duties with no unfortunate ties to other planetary neighbors who might be tempted to muscle in on the action and personally and fiercely loyal it appears to my slightest whim the dendarii mercenaries miles tried to lunge for the clones throat the clone recoiled being still firmly tied to the chair miles and it toppled forward mashing his face painfully into the carpet no no no he gibbered bucking trying to kick loose you moron itd be a slaughter the two komarran guards tumbled through the door what what happened nothing the clone pale ventured out from behind the comconsole desk where hed retreated he fell over straighten him back will you fell or was pushed muttered one of the komarrans as the pair of them yanked the chair back upright miles perforce came with it the guard stared with interest at his face a warm wetness rapidly cooling trickled itchily down miless upper lip and threeday moustache stubble bloody nose he glanced down crosseyed and licked at it calm calm the clone could never get that far with the dendarii his future failure would be little consolation to a dead miles though do you ah need some help for this part the older of the two komarrans asked the clone there is a kind of science in torture you know to get the maximum pain for the minimum damage i had an uncle who told me what the barrayaran security goons used to do given that the fastpenta is useless he doesnt need help snapped miles at the same moment that the clone began i dont want help then both paused to stare at each other miles selfpossessed again regaining his wind the clone taken slightly aback but for the outward and visible marker of the damn beard now would be the perfect time to begin screaming that vorkosigan had overpowered and changed clothes with him he was the clone couldnt they tell the difference and untie me you cretins a nonopportunity alas the clone straightened trying to regain some dignity leave us please when i want you ill call you or maybe i will remarked miles sunnily the clone glared the two komarrans exited with doubtful backward glances its a stupid idea miles began immediately they were alone youve got to grasp the dendarii are an elite bunchlargelybut by planetary standards they are a small force small you understand small small is for covert operations hit and run intelligence gathering not allout slogging matches for a fixed spatial field with a whole developed planets resources and will backing the enemy youve got no sense of the economics of war i swear to god youre not thinking past that first six months not that you need toyoull be dead before the end of the year i expect the clones smile was razorthin the dendarii like myself are intended as a sacrifice dead mercenaries after all dont need to be paid he paused and looked at miles curiously how far ahead do you think these days about twenty years miles admitted glumly and a fat lot of good it did him consider captain galeni in his mind miles already saw him as the best viceroy komarr was ever likely to gethis death not the loss of a minor imperial officer of dubious origins but of the first link in a chain of thousands of lives striving for a less tormented future a future when lieutenant miles vorkosigan would surely be subsumed by count miles vorkosigan and need sane friends in high places if he could bring galeni through this mess alive and sane i admit miles added when i was your age i got through about one quarter hour at a time the clone snorted a century ago was it seems like it ive always had the sense that id better live fast if im to fit it all in prescient of you see how much you can fit into the next twentyfour hours thats when i have my orders to ship out at which point you will becomeredundant so soon no time left for experiments no time left for anything but to be right once miles swallowed the prime ministers death must be planned or the destabilization of the barrayaran government will not occur even if emperor gregor is assassinated so tell me he said carefully what fate do you and galen have planned for our father the clones head jerked back oh no you dont you are not my brother and the butcher of komarr was never a father to me how about your mother i have none i came out of a replicator so did i miles remarked before the medics were done it never made any difference to her that i could see being betan shes quite free of antibirth technology prejudices it doesnt matter to her how you got here but only what you do after you arrive im afraid having a mother is a fate you cant avoid from the moment she discovers your existence the clone waved the phantom countess vorkosigan away a null factor she is nothing in barrayaran politics is that so miles muttered then controlled his tongue no time and yet youd continue knowing ser galen means to betray you to your death when i am emperor of barrayarthen we shall see about ser galen if you mean to betray him anyway why wait the clone cocked his head eyes narrowing ha theres another alternative for you miles made his voice calm persuasive let me go now and come with me back to barrayar you are my brotherlike it or not its a biological fact and it wont ever go away nobody gets to choose their relatives anyway clone or no i mean given a choice would you pick ivan vorpatril for your cousin the clone choked slightly but did not interrupt he was beginning to look faintly fascinated but there he is and hes exactly as much your cousin as mine did you realize you have a name miles demanded suddenly thats another thing you dont get to choose on barrayar second sonthats you my twinsixyearsdelayedgets the second names of his maternal and paternal grandfathers just as the first son gets stuck with their first names that makes you mark pierre sorry about the pierre grandfather always hated it you are lord mark pierre vorkosigan in your own right on barrayar he spoke fester and faster inspired by the clones arrested eyes what have you ever dreamed of being any education you want mother will see that you get betans are very big on education have you dreamed of escapehow about licensed star pilot mark vorkosigan commerce farming we have a family wine business from grape vines to export cratesdoes science interest you you could go live with your grandmother naismith on beta colony study at the best research academies you have an aunt and uncle there too do you realize two cousins and a second cousin if backward benighted barrayar doesnt appeal to you theres a whole nother life waiting on beta colony to which barrayar and all its troubles is scarcely a wrinkle on the event horizon your cloned origin wouldnt be novel enough to be worth mentioning there any life you want the galaxy at your fingertips choicefreedomask and its yours he had to stop for breath the clones face was white you lie he hissed barrayaran security would never let me live not alas a fear without force but imagine for one minute it is it could be real it could be yours my word as vorkosigan my protection as lord vorkosigan against all comers up to and including imperial security miles gulped a little as he made this promise galen offers you death on a silver platter i can get you life i can get it for you wholesale for gods sake was this informational sabotage hed meant to set the clone up for a fall if he could what have you done with your baby brother the clone threw back his head and laughed a sharp hysterical bark my god look at yourself a prisoner tied to a chair hours from death he swept miles a huge ironic bow oh noble lord i am overwhelmed by your generosity but somehow i dont think your protection is worth spit just now he strode up to miles the closest he had yet ventured flaming megalomaniac you cant even protect yourself impulsively he slapped miles across the face across yesterdays bruises can you he stepped back startled by the force of his own experiment and unconsciously held his stinging hand to his mouth a moment miless bleeding lips peeled back in a grin and the clone dropped his hand hastily so this one has never struck a man for real before nor killed either i wager oh little virgin are you ever in for a bloody deflowering can you the clone finished gah he takes my truth for lies when i meant to have him take my lies for truthsome saboteur i am why am compelled to speak the truth to him because he is my brother and we have failed him failed to discover him earlierfailed to mount a rescue did you ever dream of rescue miles asked suddenly after you knew who you wereor even before what kind of childhood did you have anyway orphans are supposed to dream of golden parents riding to their rescuefor you it could have been true the clone snorted bitter contempt hardly i always knew the score i knew what i was from the beginning the clones of jacksons whole are farmed out ysee to paid foster parents to raise them to maturity vatraised clones tend to have unpleasant health problemssusceptibility to infection bad cardiovascular conditioningthe people who are paying to have their brains transplanted expect to wake up in a healthy body i had a kind of fosterbrother oncea little older than me the clone paused took a deep breath raised with me but not educated with me i taught him to read a little shortly before the komarrans came and got me the laboratory people took him away it was sheer chance that i saw him again afterwards id been sent on an errand to pick up a package at the shuttleport though i wasnt supposed to go into town i saw him across the concourse entering the firstclass passenger lounge ran up to him only it wasnt him any more there was some horrible rich old man sitting in his head his bodyguard shoved me back the clone wheeled and snarled at miles oh i knew the score but once once just this once a jacksons whole clone is turning it around instead of you cannibalizing my life i shall have yours then where will your life be asked miles desperately buried in an imitation of miles where will mark be then are you sure it will be only me lying in my grave the clone flinched when i am emperor of barrayar he said through his teeth no one will be able to get at me power is safety let me give you a hint said miles there is no safety only varying states of risk and failure and was he letting his old onlychild loneliness betray him at this late date was there anybody home behind those toofamiliar grey eyes staring back at him so fiercely what snare would hook him beginnings the clone clearly understood beginnings it was endings he lacked experience of i always knew said miles softlythe clone leaned closerwhy my parents never had another child besides the tissue damage from the soltoxin gas but they could have had another child with the technologies then available on beta colony my father always pretended it was because he didnt dare leave barrayar but my mother could have taken his genetic sample and gone alone the reason was me these deformities if a whole son had existed there would have been horrendous social pressure put on them to disinherit me and put him in my place as heir you think im exaggerating the horror barrayar has of mutation my own grandfather tried to force the issue by smothering me in my cradle when i was an infant after he lost the abortion argument sergeant botharii had a bodyguard from birthwho stood about two meters tall didnt dare draw a weapon on the great general so the sergeant just picked him up and held him over his head quite apologeticallyon a thirdstory balconyuntil general piotr asked equally politely to be let down after that they had an understanding i had this story from my grandfather much later the sergeant didnt talk much later my grandfather taught me to ride and gave me that dagger you have stuck in your shirt and willed me half his lands most of which still glow in the dark from cetagandan nuclears and stood behind me in a hundred excruciating peculiarly barrayaran social situations and wouldnt let me run away till i was forced to learn to handle them or die i did consider death my parents on the other hand were so kind and careful their absolute lack of suggestion spoke louder than shouting overprotected me even as they let me risk my bones in every sport in the military careerbecause they let me stifle my siblings before they could even be born lest i think for one moment that i wasnt good enough to please them miles ran down abruptly then added perhaps youre lucky not to have a family they only drive you crazy after all and how am i to rescue this brother i never knew i had not to mention survive escape foil the komarran plot rescue captain galeni from his father save the emperor and my father from assassination and prevent the dendarii mercenaries from being put through a meat grinder no if only i can save my brother all the rest must follow im right here now is the place to push to fight before the first weapon is ever drawn snap the first link and the whole chain comes loose i know exactly what i am said the clone you wont make a dead fool of me you are what you do choose again and change the clone hesitated meeting miless eyes directly for almost the first time what guarantee could you possibly give me that i could trust my word as vorkosigan bah miles considered this problem seriously from the clonesmarkspoint of view your entire life to date has been centered on betrayal on one level or another since youve had zero experience with unbroken trust naturally you cannot judge with confidence suppose you tell me what guarantee you would believe the clone opened his mouth closed it and stood silent reddening slightly miles almost smiled you see the little fork eh he said softly the logical flaw the man who assumes everything is a lie is at least as mistaken as the one who assumes everything is true if no guarantee can suit you perhaps the flaw is not in the guarantee but in you and youre the only one who can do anything about that what can i do muttered the clone for a moment anguished doubt flickered in his eyes test it breathed miles the clone stood locked miless nostrils flared he was so closeso closehe almost had him the door burst open galen dusky with fury stormed in flanked by the startled komarran guards damn the time the clone hissed he straightened guiltily his chin jerking up damn the timing miles screamed silently in his head if he had had just a few more minutes what the hell do you think youre doing demanded galen his voice blurred with rage like a sled over gravel improving my chances of survival past the first five minutes i set foot on barrayar i trust said the clone coolly you do need me to survive a little while even to serve your purposes no i told you it was too damn dangerous galen was almost but not quite shouting ive had a lifetime of experience fighting the vorkosigans they are the most insidious propagandists ever to cloak selfserving greed with pseudopatriotism and this one is stamped from the same mold his lies will trip you trap youhes a subtle little bastard and he never takes his eye off the main chance but his choice of lies was very interesting the clone moved about like a nervous horse kicking at the carpet halfdefiant halfplacating youve had me study how he moves talks writes but ive never been really clear on how he thinks and now purred galen dangerously the clone shrugged hes looney i think he really believes his own propaganda the question is do you do you do you thought miles frantically of course not the clone sniffed jerked up his chin twang galen jerked his head toward miles gathering in the guards by eye take him back and lock him up he followed on untrustingly as miles was untied and dragged out miles saw his clone beyond galens shoulder staring at the floor still scuffing one booted foot across the carpet your name is mark miles shouted back to him as the door shut mark galen gritted his teeth and swung on miles a sincere unscientific roundhouse blow miles held by the guards could not dodge but did flinch far enough that galens fist landed glancingly and did not shatter his jaw fortunately galen shook out his fist and did not strike again regaining a thin crust of control was that for me or him miles inquired sweetly through an expanding bubble of pain lock him up growled galen to the guards and dont let him out again until i personally tell you to he pivoted and swung away up the hall back to the study two on two thought miles sharply as the guards prodded him down the lift tube to the next level or at any rate two on one and a half the odds will never be better and the time margin can only get worse as the door to his cellroom swung open miles saw galeniasleep on his bench the sodden sullen despairing ploy of a man shutting out inescapable pain in the only way left to him hed spent most of last night pacing the cell silently restless to the point of being franticthe sleep that had eluded him then was now captured wonderful now just when miles needed him on his feet and primed like an overtightened spring try anyway galeni miles yelled now galeni come on simultaneously he plunged backward into the nearest guard going for a nervepinching grip on the hand that held the stunner a joint snapped in one of miless fingers but he shook the stunner loose and kicked it across the floor toward galeni who was lumbering bewilderedly up off his bench like a warthog out of the mud despite his halfconscious state he reacted fast and accurately lunging for the stunner scooping it up and rolling across the floor out of the line of fire from the door miless guard wrapped an arm around miless neck and lifted him off his feet lurching around to face the second guard the little grey rectangle of the business end of the second guards weapon was so close miles almost had to cross his eyes to bring it into focus as the komarrans finger tightened on the trigger the stunners buzz fragmented and miless head seemed to explode in a burst of pain and colored lights chapter eleven he woke in a hospital bed an unwelcome but familiar environment in the distance out his window the towers of the skyline of vorbarr sultana capital city of barrayar glowed strangely green in the darkness imp mil then the imperial military hospital this room was undecorated in the same severe style he had known as a child when hed been in and out of its clinical laboratories and surgeries for painful therapies so often imp mil had seemed his home away from home a doctor entered he appeared to be about sixty clipped greying hair pale lined face body thickening with age dr galen his name badge read hyposprays clanked together in his pockets copulating and breeding more perhaps miles had always wondered where hyposprays came from ah youre awake said the doctor gladly youre not going to go away on us again this time now are you go away he was tied down with tubes and sensor wires drips and control leads it hardly seemed he was going anywhere catatonia cloudcuckooland gaga in short insane in short is the only way you can go i suppose eh it runs in the family blood will tell miles could hear the susurration of his red blood cells in his ears whispering thousands of military secrets to each other cavorting drunkenly in a country dance with molecules of fastpenta which were flipping their hydroxyl groups at him like petticoats he blinked away the image galens hand rummaged in his pocket then his face changed ow he yanked his hand out shook off a hypospray and sucked at his bleeding thumb the little bugger bit me he glanced down where the young hypospray skittered about uncertainly on its spindly metal legs and crunched it underfoot it died with a tiny squeak this sort of mental slippage is not at all unusual in a revived cryocorpse of course youll get over it dr galen reassured him was i dead killed outright on earth you spent a year in cryogenic suspension oddly enough miles could remember that part lying in a glass coffin like a fairytale princess under a cruel spell while figures flitted silent and ghostlike beyond die frosted panels and you revived me oh no you spoiled worst case of freezerburn you ever saw oh miles paused nonplussed and added in a small voice am i still dead then can i have horses at my funeral like grandfather no no no of course not dr galen clucked like a mother hen you arent allowed to die your parents would never permit it we transplanted your brain into a replacement body fortunately there was one ready to hand preowned but hardly used congratulations youre a virgin again was it not clever of me to get your clone all ready for you my clmy brother mark miles sat bolt upright tubes falling away from him shivering he pulled out his tray table and stared into the mirror of its polished metal surface a dotted line of big black stitches ran across his forehead he stared at his hands turning them over in horror my god im wearing a corpse he looked up at galen if im in here what have you done with mark where did you put the brain that used to be in this head galen pointed on the table at miless bedside squatted a large glass jar in it a whole brain like a mushroom on a stem floated rubbery dead and malevolent the pickling liquid was thick and greenish no no no cried miles no no no he struggled out of bed and clutched up the jar the liquid sloshed cold down over his hands he ran out into the hall barefoot his patient gown flapping open behind him there had to be spare bodies around here this was imp mil suddenly he remembered where hed left one he burst through another door and found himself in the combat drop shuttle over dagoola iv the shuttle hatch was jammed open black clouds shot with yellow dendrites of lightning boiled beyond the shuttle lurched and muddy wounded men and women in scorched dendarii combat gear slid and screamed and swore miles skidded to the open hatch still clutching the jar and stepped out part of the time he floated part of the time he fell a crying woman plummeted past him arms reaching for help but he couldnt let go of the jar her body burst on impact with the ground miles landed feet first on rubbery legs and almost dropped the jar the mud was thick and black and sucked at his knees lieutenant murkas body and lieutenant murkas head lay just where hed left them on the battleground his hands cold and shaking miles pulled the brain from the jar and tried to shove the brainstem down the plasmaboltcauterized neck it stubbornly refused to hook in he doesnt have a face anyway criticized lieutenant murkas head from where it lay a few meters off hes going to look ugly as sin walking around on my body with that thing sticking up shut up you dont get a vote youre dead snarled miles the slippery brain slithered through his fingers into the mud he picked it back out and tried clumsily to rub the black goop off on the sleeve of his dendarii admirals uniform but the harsh cloth scrubbed up the convoluted surface of marks brain damaging it miles patted the tissue surreptitiously back into place hoping no one would notice and kept trying to shove the brain stem back in the neck miless eyes flipped open and stared wide his breath caught he was shaking and damp with sweat the light fixture burned steadily in the unwavering ceiling of the cell the bench was hard and cold on his back god thank god he breathed galeni loomed over him worriedly one arm supporting himself against the wall you all right miles swallowed breathed deeply you know its a bad dream when waking up here is an improvement one of his hands caressed the cool reassuring solidity of the bench the other found no stitches across his forehead though his head did feel like somebody had been doing amateur surgery on it he blinked squeezed his eyes shut opened them again and with an effort made it up on his right elbow his left hand was swollen and throbbing what happened it was a draw one of the guards and i stunned each other unfortunately that left one guard still on his feet i woke up maybe an hour ago it was max stun i dont know how much time weve lost too much it was a good try though dammit he stopped just short of pounding his bad hand on the bench in frustration i was so close i almost had him the guard it looked like he had you no my clone my brother whatever he is flashes of his dream came back to him and he shuddered skittish fellow i think hes afraid hes going to end up in a jar eh eugh miles attempted to sit up the stun had left him feeling nauseous muscles spasmed jerkily in his arms and legs galeni clearly in no better shape tottered back to his own bench and sat some time later the door opened dinner thought miles the guard jerked his stunner at them both of you out the second guard backed him up from behind several meters beyond hope of reach with another stunner miles did not like the looks on their faces one solemn and pale the other smiling nervously captain galeni miles suggested in a voice rather higher in pitch than hed meant it to come out as they exited i think it might be a good time for you to talk to your father now a variety of expressions chased across galenis face anger mulish stubbornness thoughtful appraisal doubt that way the guard gestured them toward the lift tube they dropped down toward the garage level you can do this i cant miles coaxed galeni in a sotto voce singsong out of the corner of his mouth galeni hissed through his teeth frustration acquiescence resolve as they entered the garage he turned abruptly to the closer guard and jerked out unwillingly i wish to speak to my father you cant i think you had better let me galenis voice was dangerous edged at last with fear its not up to me he gave us our orders and left hes not here call him he didnt tell me where he would be the guards voice was tight and irritated and if he had i wouldnt anyway stand over there by that lightflyer how are you going to do it asked miles suddenly i really am curious to know think of it as my last request he sidled over toward the lightflyer his eyes shifting in search of cover any cover if he could vault over or dodge around the vehicle before they fired stun you fly you out over the south coast drop you in the water the guard recited if the weights work loose and you wash ashore the autopsy would show only that youd drowned not exactly a handson murder miles observed easier for you that way i expect these men were not professional killers if miles read them right still there was a first time for everything that pillar over there was not wide enough to stop a stun bolt the array of tools on the far wall presented possibilities his legs were cramping furiously and so the butcher of komarr gets his at last the solemn guard observed in a detached voice indirectly he raised his stunner wait squeaked miles what for miles was still groping for a reply when the garage doors slid open me yelled elli quinn freeze a dendarii patrol streamed past her in the instant it took the komarran guard to shift his aim a dendarii marksman dropped him the second guard panicked and bolted for the lift tube a sprinting dendarii tackled him from behind and had him laid out face down on the floor with his hands locked behind him within seconds elli strolled up to miles and galeni pulling a sonic eavesdroppersensor from her ear gods miles i couldnt believe it was your voice how did you do that as she took in his appearance an expression of extreme disquiet stole over her face miles captured her hands and kissed them a salute might have been more proper but his adrenalin was still pumping and this was more heartfelt besides he wasnt in uniform elli you genius i should have known the clone couldnt fool you she stared at him almost recoiling her voice circling upward in pitch what clone what do you mean what clone thats why youre here isnt it he blew itand you came to rescue medidnt you rescue you from what miles you ordered me a week ago to find captain galeni remember oh said miles yes so i did so we did weve been sitting outside this block of housing units all night waiting to pick up a positive voiceprint analysis on him so we could notify the local authorities they dont appreciate false alarms but what finally came over the sensors suggested wed better not wait for the local authorities so we took a chancevisions of us being arrested en masse for breaking and entering dancing in my head a dendarii sergeant drifted up and saluted damn sir howd you do that he trotted on waving a scanner without waiting for reply only to find youd beaten us to it well in a sense yes miles massaged his throbbing forehead galeni stood scratching his beard and taking it all in without comment galeni could say nothing at noticeable volume remember three or four nights ago when you took me to be kidnapped sos i could penetrate the opposition and find out who they were and what they wanted yeah well miles took a deep breath it worked congratulations you have just converted an absolute disaster into a major intelligence coup thank you commander quinn by the way the guy you walked out of that empty house withwasnt me ellis eyes widened her hand went to her mouth then the dark glints narrowed in furious thought sonofabitch she breathed but milesi thought the clone story was something youd made up so did i its thrown everyone off i expect there washe isa real clone so he claims fingerprintsretinavoiceprintall the same there is thank god one objective difference you radiograph my bones youll find a crazyquilt pattern of old breaks except for the synthetics in my legs his bones have none or so he says miles cradled his throbbing left hand i think ill leave the beard on for the moment just in case miles turned to captain galeni how shall weimperial securityhandle this sir he said deferentially do we really want to call in the local authorities oh so im sir again am i muttered galeni of course we want the police we cant extradite these people but now that theyre guilty of a crime right here on earth the eurolaw authorities will hold them for us itll break up this whole radical splinter group miles tamped down his personal urgency trying to make his voice cool and logical but a public trial would bring out the whole clone story in all its details it would attract a lot of undesirable attention to me from a security viewpoint including you may be sure cetagandan attention its too late to put a lid on this im not so sure yes rumors will float but a few sufficiently confused rumors might actually be useful those two miles gestured to the captured guards are small fry my clone knows more than they do and hes already back at the embassy which is legally barrayaran soil what do we need them for now that we have you back and have the clone the plot is void put this group under surveillance like the rest of the komarran expatriates here on earth and theyre no further danger to us galeni met his eyes then looked away pale profile tense with the unspoken corollary and your career will be uncompromised by a splashy public scandal and you wont have to confront your father i dont know i do said miles confidently he gestured a waiting dendarii over sergeant take a couple of techs upstairs and suck out these peoples comconsole files take a fast scan around for secret files and while youre about it search the house for a couple of antipersonnelscan devices on belts should be stored somewhere take them to commodore jesek and tell him i want him to find the manufacturer as soon as you call the allclear we decamp now that is illegal elli remarked what are they going to do go to the police and complain i think not ahyou want to leave any messages on the comconsole captain no said galeni softly after a moment no messages right a dendarii rendered first aid to miless broken finger and numbed his hand the sergeant was back down in less than half an hour antiscan belts hung over his shoulder and flipped a data disc at miles you got it sir thank you galen had not yet returned all things considered miles counted that as a plus miles knelt by the stillconscious komarran and held a stunner to his temple what are you going to do croaked the man miless lips peeled back in a grin cracking to bleed whystun you of course fly you out over the south coast and drop you in what else nightynight the stunner buzzed and the struggling komarran jerked and slumped the dendarii soldier retrieved his restraints and miles left the two komarrans lying side by side on the garage floor they let themselves out and keyed the garage doors closed carefully back to the embassy then and nail the little bastard said elli quinn grimly calling up the route to their destination from her rented cars console the rest of the patrol withdrew to covert observation positions miles and galeni settled back galeni looked as exhausted as miles felt bastard sighed miles no thats the one thing he is not im afraid nail him first galeni murmured define him later agreed said miles how shall we go in asked galeni as they approached the embassy in the latemorning light only one way said miles through the front door marching pull up at the front elli miles and galeni looked at each other and snickered miless beard was well behind galenis in developmentgalenis after all had a fourday head startbut his split lips bruises and the dried blood on his shirt made up for it miles figured in augmenting his general air of seedy degradation besides galeni had found his boots and uniform jacket back at the komarrans house and miles had not carried off by the clone perhaps miles was not sure which of them smelled worsegaleni had been incarcerated longer but miles fancied hed sweated harderand he wasnt going to ask elli quinn to sniff and rate them from galenis twitching lips and crinkling eyes miles thought he might be undergoing the same delayed reaction of lunatic relief that was presently bubbling up through his own chest they were alive and it was a miracle and a wonderment they matched steps going up the ramp elli sauntered behind watching the performance with interest the guard at the entrance saluted by reflex even as astonishment spread over his face captain galeni youre back and er he glanced at miles opened and closed his mouth you sir galeni returned the salute blandly call lieutenant vorpatril up here for me will you vorpatril only yes sir the embassy guard spoke into his wrist comm not taking his eyes off them he kept looking sideways at miles with a very puzzled expression erglad to have you back captain glad to be back corporal in a moment ivan popped out of a lift tube and came running across the marblepaved foyer my god sir where have you been he cried grabbing galeni by the shoulders he remembered himself belatedly and saluted my absence wasnt voluntary i assure you galeni tugged on one earlobe blinking and ran the hand through his beard stubble clearly a little touched by ivans enthusiasm as i shall explain in detail later right nowlieutenant vorkosigan it is perhaps time to surprise your er other relative ivan glanced at miles they let you out then he looked more closely then stared miles miles bared his teeth and moved them out of earshot of the mesmerized corporal all shall be revealed when we arrest the other me where am i by the way ivans lips wrinkled in dawning dismay miles are you trying to diddle my head its not very funny no diddle and not funny the individual youve been rooming with for the last four dayswasnt me ive been rooming with captain galeni here a komarran revolutionary group tried to plant a ringer on you ivan the sucker is my clone for real dont tell me you never noticed anything well said ivan belief and growing embarrassment began to suffuse his features you did seem sort of um off your feed the last couple of days elli nodded thoughtfully highly sympathetic to ivans embarrassment in what way asked miles well ive seen you manic and ive seen you depressive but ive never seen youwellneutral i had to ask and yet you never suspected anything he was that good oh i wondered about it the very first night and what yelped miles he felt like tearing his hair and i decided it couldnt be after all youd made that clone story up yourself a few days ago i shall now demonstrate my amazing prescience where is he well thats why i was so surprised to see you you see galeni was now standing with his arms crossed and his hand to his forehead supportingly miles could not read his lips though they were moving slightlycounting to ten perhaps why ivan said galeni and waited my god he hasnt left for barrayar already has he said miles urgently weve got to stop him no no said ivan it was the locals thats why were all in such a flap here where is he snarled miles going for a grip on ivans green uniform jacket with his good hand calm down thats what im trying to tell you ivan glanced down at miless whiteknuckled fist yeah its you all right isnt it the local police came through here a couple of hours ago and arrested youhimwhatever well not arrested exactly but they had a detention order forbidding you to leave this legal jurisdiction youhewas frantic cause it meant youd miss your ship you were shipping out tonight they subpoenaed you for questioning before the municipal benchs investigator to ascertain if there was enough evidence to file formal charges charges for what what are you babbling about ivan well thats it why its such a mess somewhere they got this short circuit in their brains about embassiesthey came and arrested you lieutenant vorkosigan for suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder to wit you are suspected of hiring those two goons who tried to assassinate admiral naismith at the shuttleport last week miles stamped in a circle ah ah agh the ambassador is filing protests all over the place naturally we couldnt tell them why we thought they were mistaken miles clutched quinns elbow dont panic im not panicking quinn observed im watching you panic its more entertaining miles pressed his forehead right right let us begin by assuming all is not lost let us assume the lad hasnt panickedhasnt broken yet suppose he has climbed up on an aristocratic high horse and is sneering a lot of nocomments at them hed do that well its how he thinks vor are supposed to act little schmuck assume hes holding out assume away remarked ivan so what if we hurry we can save your reputation said ivan your brother ventured galeni our asses said elli admiral naismith miles finished hes the one at risk now miless gaze crossed ellis her eyebrows arched in dawning worry the key word is cover as inblown or just possibly permanently assured you and i he nodded to galeni have to get cleaned up meet me back here in fifteen minutes ivan bring a sandwich two sandwiches well take you along for muscle ivan was well endowed in that resource elli you drive drive where asked quinn the assizes we go to the rescue of poor misunderstood lieutenant vorkosigan who will return with us gratefully whether he wants to or not ivan better bring a hypospray with two ccs of tholizone in addition to those sandwiches hold it miles said ivan if the ambassador couldnt get him sprung how do you expect us to miles grinned not us admiral naismith the london municipal assizes was a big black crystal of a building some two centuries old a slash of similar architecture erupted unevenly through a district of even older styles representing the bombings and fires of the fifth civil disturbance urban renewal here seemed to wait on disaster london was so filled up a cramped jigsaw of juxtaposed eras with londoners stubbornly hanging on to bits of their past there was even a committee to save the singularly ugly disintegrating remnants of the late twentieth century miles wondered if vorbarr sultana presently expanding madly would look like this in a thousand years or whether it would obliterate its history in the rush to modernize miles paused in the assizess soaring foyer to adjust his dendarii admirals uniform do i look respectable he asked quinn the beard makes you look um miles had hastily trimmed the edges distinguished older hung over ha the four of them took the lift tube to the ninetyseventh level chamber w the reception panel directed them after accessing its files cubicle cubicle proved to contain a secured euronet justicecomp terminal and a live human being a serious young man ah investigator reed elli smiled winningly at him as they entered we meet again the briefest glance showed investigator reed to be alone miles cleared a twinge of panic from his throat investigator reed is in charge of looking into that unpleasant incident at the shuttleport sir elli explained mistaking his choke for a request for an introduction and slipping back into professional mode investigator reed admiral naismith we had a long talk on my last trip here i see said miles he kept his face blandly polite reed was frankly staring at him uncanny so you really are vorkosigans clone i prefer to think of him as my twin brother miles flung off once removed we generally prefer to stay as far removed from each other as possible so youve spoken to him at some length i did not find him very cooperative reed glanced back and forth uncertainly from miles and elli to the two uniformed barrayarans obstructive indeed rather unpleasant so i would imagine you were treading on his toes hes quite sensitive about me prefers not to be reminded of my embarrassing existence ah why sibling rivalry miles extemporized ive gotten farther in my military career than he has in his he takes it as a reproach a slur on his own perfectly reasonable achievements god somebody give me another straight line reeds stare was becoming piercing to the point please admiral naismith captain galeni rumbled thank you quite investigator reedi do not pretend that vorkosigan and i are friends but how did you come by this curious misapprehension that he tried to arrange my rather messy death your case has not been easy the two wouldbe killers reed glanced at elli were a dead end so we went to other leads not lise vallerie was it im afraid ive been guilty of leading her slightly astray an untimely sense of humor i fear its an affliction we all must bear murmured elli i found valleries suggestions interesting not conclusive said reed in the past ive found her to be a careful investigator in her own right unimpeded by certain rules of order that hamper say me and most helpful in passing on items of interest whats she investigating these days inquired miles reed gave him a bland look illegal cloning perhaps you might give her some tips ahi fear my experiences are some two decades out of date for your purposes well thats neither here nor there in this case the lead was quite objective an aircar was seen leaving the shuttleport at the time of the attack passing illegally through a traffic control space we traced it to the barrayaran embassy sergeant barth galeni looked like he wanted to spit ivan was acquiring that pleasant slightly moronic expression hed found so useful in the past for evading any accusation of responsibility oh that said miles airily that was merely barrayars usual tedious surveillance of me frankly the embassy i would suspect of having a hand in this is the cetagandan recent dendarii operations in their area of influencefar outside your jurisdictiondispleased them exceedingly but it was not a charge in my power to prove which was why i was content to leave it to your people ah the remarkable rescue at dagoola id heard of it a compelling motive more compelling i would suggest than the ancient history i confided to lise vallerie does that straighten out the contratemps and are you getting something in return for this charitable service to the barrayaran embassy admiral my good deed for the day no youre right i warned you about my sense of humor lets just say my reward is sufficient nothing that could be construed as an obstruction of justice i trust reeds eyebrows rose dryly im the victim remember miles bit his tongue my reward has nothing to do with londons criminal code i assure you in the meantime can i ask you to return poor lieutenant vorkosigan to the custody say of his commanding officer captain galeni here reeds face was a study in suspicion his alertness multiplied whats wrong dammit wondered miles this is supposed to be lulling him reed steepled his hands leaned back and cocked his head lieutenant vorkosigan left with a man who introduced himself as captain galeni an hour ago aaah said miles an older man in civilian dress greying hair heavyset yes miles inhaled smiling fixedly thank you investigator reed we wont take any more of your valuable time back in the foyer ivan said now what i think said captain galeni it is time to return to the embassy and send a full report to hq the urge to confess eh no no never send interim reports said miles only final ones interim reports tend to elicit orders which you must then either obey or spend valuable time and energy evading which you could be using to solve the problem an interesting command philosophy i must keep it in mind do you share it commander quinn oh yes the dendarii mercenaries must be a fascinating outfit to work for quinn smirked i find it so chapter twelve they returned to the embassy nonetheless galeni to galvanize his staff into an allout investigation of the now highlysuspect courier officer miles to change back into his barrayaran dress greens and visit the embassy physician to have his hand properly set if there was a lull in his life after this mess was cleared up miles reflected perhaps hed better take the time to go get the bones and joints in his arms and hands not just the long bones of his legs replaced with synthetics getting the legs done had been painful and tedious but putting off the arms wasnt going to make it any better and he certainly couldnt pretend he was going to do any more growing somewhat morose with these thoughts he left the embassy clinic and wandered down to securitys office sublevel he found galeni sitting alone at his comconsole desk having generated a flurry of orders that dispatched subordinates in all directions the lights in the office were dimmed galeni was leaning back with his feet on the desk crossed at the ankles and miles had the impression that he would have preferred a bottle of something potently alcoholic in his hand to the light pen he now turned over and over galeni smiled bleakly sat up and took to tapping the pen on the desk as miles entered ive been thinking it over vorkosigan im afraid we may not be able to avoid calling in the local authorities in this i wish you wouldnt do that sir miles pulled up a chair and sat astride it arms athwart its back involve them and the consequences pass beyond our control it will take a small army to find those two on earth now i have a small army miles reminded him which had just demonstrated its effectiveness for this sort of thing i think ha true let the embassy hire the dendarii mercenaries to find our missing persons hire i thought barrayar was already paying for them miles blinked innocently but sir its part of their covert status that that relationship is unknown even to the dendarii themselves if the embassy hires them in a formal contract for this job itcovers the cover so to speak galeni raised his brows sardonically i see and how do you propose to explain your clone to them if necessary as a cloneof admiral naismith three of you now said galeni dubiously just set them to find yourfind ser galen where he is the clone will be too it worked once hm said galeni theres just one thing miles added he ran one finger thoughtfully along the top of the chair back if we do succeed in catching themjust what is it that we plan to do with em the light pen tapped there are said galeni only two or three possibilities one they can be arrested tried and incarcerated for the crimes committed here on earth during the course of which miles observed seriously admiral naismiths cover as a supposedly independent operator will almost certainly be compromised his true identity publicly revealed i cant pretend the barrayaran empire will stand or fall on the dendarii mercenaries but security has found us useful in the past command mayi hope mayregard this as a poor trade besides has my clone in fact committed any crimes he can be held for i think he may even be a minor by eurolaw rules second alternative galeni recited kidnap them and returned them secretly to barrayar for trial evading earths nonextradition status if we had an order from on high my guess is this would be it the minimum proper paranoid security response for trial said miles or to be held indefinitely in some oubliette for mybrother that might not turn out as bad as hed at first think he has a friend in a very high place if he can escape being secretly murdered by someoverexcited underling first en route galeni and miles exchanged glances but nobodys going to intercede for your father barrayar has always taken the killings in the komarr revolt to be civil crimes not acts of war and he never submitted to the loyalty oath and amnesty hell be up on capital charges his execution will inevitably follow inevitably galeni pursed his lips staring down at the toes of his boots the third possibility beingas you saidan order coming down for their secret assassination criminal orders can be successfully resisted miles observed if you have a strong enough stomach for it high command isnt as free with that sort of thing as they were back in emperor ezars day fortunately i submit a fourth possibility it might be better not to catch theseawkward relativesin the first place bluntly miles if i fail to produce ser galen my career will be smoke i must already be suspect for having failed to turn him up any time these last two years your suggestion skirtsnot insubordination that seems to be your normal mode of operationbut something worse what about your predecessor here who failed to discover him in five years and if you do produce him now will your career be any better off youll be suspect anyway in the minds of those who are determined to be suspicious i wish galenis face had an inward look deathly calm his voice a reflective murmur i wish he had stayed dead in the first place his first death was a much better one glorious in the heat of battle he had his place in history and i was alone past pain without mother or father to torment me how fortunate that science hasnt cracked human immortality its a great blessing that we can outlive old wars and old warriors miles mulled over the dilemma in jail on earth galen destroyed both galenis career and admiral naismiths but lived shipped to barrayar he died galenis career would be a little better off but galeni himselfwould not be quite sane miles rather thought the patricide would not have the rooted serenity to serve komarrs complex future needs certainly but naismith would live his thought whispered temptingly left loose the persistent galen and mark remained a threat of unknown and so intolerable proportion if miles and galeni did nothing high command would most certainly take the choice from them issuing whoknewwhat orders sealing the fate of their perceived enemies miles loathed the thought of sacrificing galenis promising career to this crabbed old revolutionary who refused to give up yet galens destruction would also damage galeni just as certainly dammit why couldnt the old man have pensioned himself off to some tropical paradise instead of hanging around making trouble for the younger generation on the grounds no doubt that it was good for em mandatory retirement for revolutionaries thats what they needed now what do you choose when all choices are bad this choice is mine said galeni we have to go after them they stared at each other both very tired compromise suggested miles send the dendarii mercenaries out to locate track and monitor them dont attempt to pick them up yet this will permit you to put all the embassys resources to work on the problem of the courier a purely barrayaraninternal matter on any scale there was a silence agreed galeni said at last but whatever finally happensi want to get it over with quickly agreed said miles miles found elli sitting alone in the embassy cafeteria leaning tired and a little blank over the remains of her dinner ignoring the covert stares and hesitant smiles of various embassy personnel he grabbed a snack and tea and slid into the seat across from her their hands gripped briefly across the table then she rested her chin on her cupped palms again elbows propped so whats next she asked whats the traditional reward for a job well done in this mans army her dark eyes crinkled another job you got it ive persuaded captain galeni to let the dendarii mercenaries find galen just as you found us how did you find us by the way lotta damn work thats how we started by crunching through that awful pile of data you beamed up from the embassy files about komarrans we eliminated the welldocumented ones the young children and so on then we put the intelligence computer team downside to break into the economic net and pull out credit files and into the eurolaw netthat was trickyand pull out criminal files and started looking for anomalies thats where we found the break about a year ago the earthborn son of a komarran expatriate was picked up by the eurolaw cops on some minor misdemeanor and found to have an unregistered stunner in his possession not being a deadly weapon it merely cost him a fine and as far as eurolaw was concerned that was that but the stunner wasnt of earth manufacture it was old barrayaran military issue we began following him both physically and through the computer net finding out who his friends were people who werent in the embassys computer we were following up several other leads at the same time that failed to pan out but this is where i got a compelling hunch one of this kids frequent contacts a man named van der poole was registered as an immigrant to earth from the planet frost iv now during that investigation i did a couple of years back involving the stolen genes i passed through jacksons whole miles nodded in memory so i knew you could buy documented pasts thereone of the little highprofitmargin services certain laboratories sell to go along with the new faces and voices and finger and retinaprints they offer one of the planets they frequently use for this is frost iv on account of the tectonic disaster having wrecked their computer netnot to mention the rest of the placetwentyeight years ago a lot of perfectly legitimate people who left frost iv then have uncheckable documentation if youre over twentyeight years old jacksons whole can fit you right in so whenever i see somebody above a certain age who claims to be from frost iv im automatically suspicious van der poole was galen of course of course my clone was another fine product of jacksons whole by the way ah it all fits how nice my congratulations to you and the whole intelligence department remind me to make that an official commendation when i next make it back to the triumph which is when she crunched a piece of ice from the bottom of her glass and swirled the remainder around trying to look only professionally interested her mouth would taste cool and tangy miles blinked back into professional mode himself conscious of the curious eyes of embassy personnel upon them dunno were sure not done here yet we should certainly transfer all the new data the dendarii collected back to embassy files ivans working now on what we pulled from galens comconsole its going to be harder this time galenvan der poolewill be hiding and hes had a lot of experience at serious disappearing but if and when you do turn him upahreport directly to me ill report to the embassy report what to the embassy elli inquired alert to his undertones miles shook his head im not sure yet i may be too tired to think straight ill see if it seems to make any more sense in the morning elli nodded and rose where are you going asked miles in alarm back to the triumph to put the mass in motion of course but you can tightbeamwhos on duty up there right now bel thorne right all right lets go find ivan we can tightbeam the data swap right from here and the orders as well he studied the dark circles under her luminous eyes and how long have you been on your feet anyway oh about the last um she glanced at her chrono thirty hours who has trouble delegating work commander quinn send the orders not yourself and take a sleep shift before you start making mistakes too ill find you a place to bunk here at the embassy she met his eyes suddenly grinning if you like miles added hastily will you now she said softly id like that fine they paid a visit to ivan harried at his comconsole and made the secured data link to the triumph ivan miles noted happily had lots and lots of work left to do he escorted elli up the lift tubes to his quarters elli dove for the bathroom by right of first dibs while hanging up his uniform miles found his cat blanket bunged lumpily into a dark corner of his closet doubtless where his terrified clone had thrown it his first night the black fur broke into ecstatic rumbling when he picked it up he spread it out carefully on his bed patting it into place there elli emerged from the shower in remarkably few minutes fluffing her short wet curls out with her fingers a towel slung attractively around her hips she spotted the cat blanket smiled and hopped up and wriggled her bare toes in it it shivered and purred louder ah sighed miles contemplating them both in perfect contentment then doubt snaked through his garden of delight elli was looking around his room with interest he swallowed is this ah the first time youve been up here he asked in what he hoped was a casual tone uhhuh i dont know why i was expecting something medieval looks more like an ordinary hotel room than what i would have expected of barrayar this is earth miles pointed out and the time of isolation has been over for a hundred years you have some odd ideas about barrayar but i just wondered if my clone had uh are you sure you never sensed any difference at all during the four days he was that good he smiled wretchedly hanging on her answer what if shed noticed nothing was he really so transparent and simple that anyone could play him worse what if she had noticed a differenceand liked the clone better elli looked embarrassed noticed yes but to jump from sensing there was something wrong with you to realizing it wasnt you maybe if wed had more time together we only talked by comm link except for one twohour trip downtown to spring danio and his merry men from the locals during which i thought youd lost your mind then i decided you must have something up your sleeve and just werent telling me cause id her voice went suddenly smaller fallen out of favor somehow miles calculated and breathed relief so the clone hadnt had time to ahem he smiled wryly up at her you see when you look at me she went on to explain it makes me feelwellgood not in the warm and fuzzy sense though theres that too warm and fuzzy sighed miles happily leaning on her stop it you goof im serious but she slipped her arms around him firmly as if prepared to do immediate battle with any wight who might attempt to snatch him away again good likei can do competent you make me unafraid unafraid to try unafraid of what others might think yourclone good gods what a relief to know thatmade me start wondering what was wrong with me though when i think how easily they took you that night in the empty house i could sh sh miles stopped her lips with one finger there is nothing wrong with you elli he said pleasantly muffled you are most perfectly quinn his quinn see what i mean i suppose it saved your life id been meaning to keep youhimup to date on the hunt for galeni even it if was just an interim noprogress report which would have been his first tipoff that there was a hunt going on which he would have ordered stopped precisely but then when the break in the case came ithought id better be sure save it up surprise you with the final result all wrapped up in a big bowwin back your regard to be frank in a way he kept me from reporting to him if its any consolation it wasnt dislike you terrified him your facenot to mention the rest of youhas that effect on some men yes the face her hand touched one cheek halfconsciously then fell more tenderly to ruffle his hair i think youve put your finger on it what felt so wrong you knew me when i had my old face and no face and the new face and for you alone it was all the same face his unbandaged hand traced over the arch of her brows perfect nose paused at her lips to collect a kiss then down the ideal angle of her chin and velvet skin of her throat yes the face i was young and dumb then it seemed like a good idea at the time it was only later that i realized it could be a handicap for you me too sighed elli for the first six months i was delighted but the second time a soldier made a pass at me instead of following an order i knew i definitely had a problem i had to discover and teach myself all kinds of tricks to get people to respond to the inside of me and not the outside i understand said miles by the gods you would she looked at him for a moment as if seeing him for the very first time then dropped a kiss on his forehead i just now realized how many of those tricks i learned from you how i love you when they came up for air from the loss that followed elli offered rub you youre a drunkards dream quinn miles flopped down with his face in the fur and let her have her way with him five minutes at her strong hands parted him from all ambitions but two those satisfied they both slept like stones untroubled by any vile dream that miles could later remember miles woke muzzily to the sound of knocking at the door go way ivan miles moaned into the flesh and fur he clutched go sleep on a bench somewhere hunh the flesh shook him loose decisively elli hit the light swung out of bed slipping into her black tshirt and grey uniform trousers and padded to the door ignoring miless mumbled no no doan let im in the knocking grew louder and more insistent miles ivan fell through the door oh hi elli miles ivan shook him by the shoulder miles tried to burrow underneath his fur all right ycan have your bed he muttered ydont need me to tuck you in get up miles miles stuck his head out eyes scrunched against the light why what time is it about midnight ergh he went back under three hours sleep hardly counted after what hed been through the last four days displaying a cruel and ruthless streak miles would never have suspected ivan pulled the live far from his twitching hands and tossed it aside you have to get up ivan insisted dressed peel off the face fungus i hope youve got a clean uniform in here somewhere ivan was rooting through his closet here miles clutched numbly at the green cloth ivan flung at him embassy on fire he inquired damn near elena botharijesek just blew in from tau ceti i didnt even know youd sent her oh miles came awake quinn was by now fully dressed including boots and checking her stunner in its holster yes gotta get dressed sure she wont mind the beard though not being subject to beard burn elli muttered under her breath scratching a thigh absently miles suppressed a grin one of her eyelids shivered at him maybe not said ivan grimly but i dont think commodore destang will be too thrilled by it destangs here miles came fully awake he still had a little adrenalin left apparently why then he thought back over some of the suspicions hed included in his report sent with elena and realized why the sector two security chief might have been inspired to investigate in person oh god gotta get him straightened out before he shoots poor galeni on sight he ran the shower on cold needlespray elli shoved a cup of coffee into his working hand as he exited and inspected the effect when he was dressed everythings fine but the face she informed him and you cant do anything about that he ran a hand over his nownaked chin did i miss a patch with the depilator no i was admiring the bruises and the eyes ive seen brighter eyes on a strungout juba freak three days after the supplies ran out thanks you asked miles considered what he knew of destang as they descended the lift tubes his previous contacts with the commodore had been brief official and as far as miles knew satisfactory to both sides the sector two security commander was an experienced officer accustomed to carrying out his varied dutiescoordinating intelligencegathering overseeing the security of barrayaran embassies consulates and visiting vips rescuing the occasional barrayaran subject in troublewith little direct supervision from distant barrayar during the two or three operations the dendarii had conducted in sector two areas orders and money had flowed down and miless final reports back up through his command without impediment commodore destang was seated centrally in galenis office chair at galenis litup comconsole as miles ivan and elli entered captain galeni was standing though extra chairs were available by the wall his stiff posture worn like armor his eyes hooded and face blank as a visor elena botharijesek hovered uncertainly in the background with the worried look of one witnessing a chain of events they had started but no longer controlled her eyes lit with relief as she saw miles and she salutedimproperly as he was not in dendarii uniform it was more an unstated transfer of responsibility like someone ridding herself of a bag of live snakes here this ones all yours he returned her a nod all right sir miles saluted destang returned the salute and glowered at him reminding miles in a faint twinge of nostalgia of the early galeni another harried commander destang was a man of about sixty lean with grey hair shorter than what was middle height for a barrayaran doubtless born just after the end of the cetagandan occupation when widespread malnutrition had robbed many of their full growth potential he would have been a young officer at the time of the conquest of komarr of middle rank during its later revolt combatexperienced like all who had lived through that wartorn past has anyone brought you up to date yet sir miles began anxiously my original memo is extremely obsolete ive just read captain galenis version destang nodded at the comconsole galeni would insist on writing reports miles sighed inwardly it was an old academic reflex no doubt he restrained himself from craning his neck to try and see you dont seem to have made one yet destang noted miles waved his bandaged left hand vaguely ive been in the infirmary sir but have you realized yet the komarrans must have had control of the embassys courier officer we arrested the courier six days ago on tau ceti destang said miles exhaled in relief and was he it was the usual sordid story destang frowned he committed a little sin it gave them leverage to extract larger and larger ones until there was no going back a curious mental judo that sort of blackmail reflected miles in the final analysis it was fear of his own side not fear of the komarrans that had delivered the courier into the enemys hands so a system meant to enforce loyalty ended by destroying itsome flaw there hes been owned by them for at least three years continued destang anything thats gone in or out of the embassy since then may have passed before their eyes ouch miles suppressed a grin substituting he hoped an expression of proper horror so the subversion of the courier clearly predated the arrival of galeni on earth good yeah said ivan i just found copies of some of our stuff a little while ago in that mass data dump you pulled from ser galens comconsole miles it was quite a shock i thought it might be there said miles there werent too many other possibilities once i realized we were being diddled i trust the interrogation of the courier has cleared captain galeni of all suspicion if he was involved with the komarran expatriates on earth said destang neutrally the courier didnt know of it not exactly an affirmation of heartfelt trust that it was quite clear miles said that the captain was a card ser galen thought he was holding in reserve but the card refused to play at the risk of his life it was chance after all that assigned captain galeni to earth galeni was shaking his head lips compressed wasnt it no said galeni still at parade rest i requested earth oh well it was certainly chance that brought me here miles scrambled over the gap chance and my wounded and cryocorpses who needed the attention of a major medical center as soon as possible speaking of the dendarii mercenaries commodore did the courier divert the eighteen million marks barrayar owes them it was never sent said destang until captain botharijesek here arrived at my office our last contact with your mercenaries was the report you sent from mahata solaris wrapping up the dagoola affair then you vanished from the viewpoint of sector two headquarters youve been missing for over two months to our consternation particularly when the weekly requests for updates on your status from imperial security chief illyan turned into daily ones isee sir then you never received our urgent requests for fundsthen i was never actually assigned to the embassy a very small noise as of deep and muffled pain escaped the otherwise deadpan galeni destang said only by the komarrans apparently it was a ploy to keep you immobilized until they could make their attempted switch id guessed as much ahyou wouldnt by chance happen to have brought my eighteen million marks with you now have you that part hasnt changed i did mention it in my memo several times said destang dryly yes lieutenant we will fund your irregulars as usual ah miles melted within and smiled blindingly thank you sir that is a very great relief destang cocked his head curiously what have they been living on the past month itsbeen a bit complicated sir destang opened his mouth as if to ask more then apparently thought better of it i see well lieutenant you may return to your outfit your part here is done you should never have appeared on earth as lord vorkosigan in the first place to which outfitto the dendarii mercenaries you mean sir i doubt simon illyan was sending out urgent inquiries for them because he was lonely its a safe assumption that new orders will be following on as soon as your location is known to hq you should be ready to move out elli and elena who had been conferring in very low tones in the corner during all this looked up brightly at this news ivan looked more stricken yes sir said miles whats going to happen here since you have not thank god involved the earth authorities were free to clear up this aborted bit of treason ourselves i brought a team from tau ceti the team was a cleanup crew miles guessed intelligence commandos ready at destangs order to restore order to a treasonraddled embassy with whatever force or guile might be required ser galen would have been on our mostwanted list long before this if we hadnt believed him already dead galen destang shook his head as though he still couldnt believe it himself here on earth all this time you know i served during the komarr revoltits where i got my start in security i was on the team that dug through the rubble of the halomar barracks after the bastards blew it up in the middle of the nightlooking for survivors and evidence finding bodies and damn few clues there were a lot of new openings for posts in security that morning damn how it all comes back if we can find galen again after you let him slip through your hands destangs eyes fell without favor on galeni accidentally or otherwise well take him back to barrayar to answer for that bloody morning if nothing else i wish he could be made to answer for it all but theres not enough of him to go around rather like mad emperor yuri a laudable plan sir said miles carefully galeni had his jaw clamped shut no help there but there are a dozen komarran exrebels on earth with pasts just as bloody as ser galens now that hes been exposed hes no more threat to us than they are theyve been inactive for years said destang galen clearly has been quite the reverse but if youre contemplating an illegal kidnapping it could damage our diplomatic relations with earth is it worth it permanent justice is well worth a temporary offended protest i can assure you lieutenant galen was dead meat to destang well and so on what grounds would you kidnap myclone then sir hes never committed a crime on barrayar hes never even been to barrayar shut up miles ivan with a look of increasing alarm on his face mouthed silently from behind destang you dont argue with a commodore miles ignored him the fate of my clone concerns me closely sir i can imagine i hope we can eliminate the danger of further confusion between you soon miles hoped that didnt mean what he thought it did if he had to derail destang theres no danger of confusion sir a simple medical scan can tell the difference between us his bones are normal mine are not by what charge or claim do we have any further interest in him treason of course conspiracy against the imperium the second part being demonstrably true miles concentrated on the first part treason he was born on jacksons whole hes not an imperial subject by conquest or place of birth to charge him with treason miles took a breath you must allow him to be an imperial subject by blood and if hes that hes that all the way a lord of the vor with all the rights of his rank including trial by his peersthe council of counts in full session destangs brows rose would he think to attempt such an outre defense if he didnt id point it out to him why not thank you lieutenant thats a complication i had not considered destang looked thoughtful indeed and increasingly steely miless plan to convince destang that letting the clone go was his own idea seemed to be slipping dangerously retrograde he had to knowdo you see assassination as an option sir a compelling one destangs spine straightened decisively there could be a legal problem here sir either hes not an imperial subject and we have no claim on him in the first place or he is and the full protection of imperial law should apply to him in either case his murder would miles moistened his lips galeni who alone knew where he was heading shut his eyes like a man watching an accident about to happen be a criminal order sir destang looked rather impatient i had not planned to give you the order lieutenant he thinks i want to keep my hands clean if miles pushed the confrontation with destang to its logical conclusion with two imperial officers witnessing there was a chance the commodore would back down there was at least an equal chance miles would find himself in very deepdeepness if the confrontation went all the way to a messy courtmartial neither of them would emerge undamaged even if miles won barrayar would not be well served and destangs forty years of imperial service did not deserve such an ignoble end and if he got himself confined to quarters now all alternate courses of action and what was he contemplating for gods sake would be closed to him he did not want to be locked up in another room meanwhile destangs team would carry out any order he gave them without hesitation he bared his teeth in a smile of sorts and said only thank you sir ivan looked relieved destang paused legality is an unusual concern for a covert operations specialist at this late date isnt it we all have our illogical moments quinns attention was now riveted upon him a slight twitch of her eyebrow asked what the hell try not to have too many of them lieutenant vorkosigan said destang dryly my aide has the nontraceable credit chit for your eighteen million marks see him on your way out take all these women with you he waved at the two uniformed dendarii ivan reminded smiled at them theyre my officers dammit not my harem miless thought snarled silently but no barrayaran officer of destangs age would see it that way some attitudes couldnt be changed they just had to be outlived destangs words were a clear dismissal miles ignored them at his peril yet destang had not mentioned yes lieutenant run along captain galenis voice was utmostbland i never finished writing my report ill give you one mark against the commodores eighteen million if you take the dendarii off with you now miless eyes widened just slightly hearing the capital m galeni hasnt told destang yet that the dendarii are on the case therefore he cant order them off can he a head startif he could find galen and mark before destangs team didthats a bargain captain miles heard his own voice saying its amazing how much one mark can weigh galeni nodded once and turned back to destang miles fled chapter thirteen ivan trailed along as miles returned to their quarters to change clothes for the last time back into the dendarii admirals uniform in which hed arrived a lifetime and a half ago i dont think i really want to watch downstairs ivan explained destangs well launched into a bloody reaming bet hell keep galeni on his feet all night trying to break him if he can damn it miles bundled his green barrayaran jacket into a wad and flung it against the far wall but it didnt carry enough momentum to begin to vent his frustration he flopped down on a bed pulled off a boot hefted it then shook his head and dropped it in disgust it burns me galeni deserves a medal not a load of grief wellif ser galen couldnt break him i dont suppose destang will either but its not right not right he brooded and i helped set him up for it too damn damn damn elli handed him his grey uniform without comment ivan was not so wise yeah nice going miles ill think of you safely up in orbit while destangs headquarters crew are cleaning house down here suspicious as hellthey wouldnt trust their own grandmothers were all in for it scrubbed rinsed and hung out to dry in the cold cold wind he wandered over to his own bed and regarded it with longing no use turning in theyll be after me before morning for something he sat down on it glumly miles looked up at ivan in sudden speculation huh yeah you are going to be rather in the middle of things for the next few days arent you ivan alert to the change in his tone eyed him suspiciously too right so what miles shook out his trousers his half of the secured comm link fell onto the bed he pulled on his dendarii greys suppose i remember to turn in my comm link before i leave and suppose elli forgets to turn in hers miles held up a restraining finger and elli stopped fishing in her jacket and suppose you stick it in your pocket meaning to turn it back in to sergeant barth as soon as you get the other half he tossed the comm link to ivan who caught it automatically but then held it away from himself between thumb and forefingers as if it were something hed found writhing under a rock and suppose i remember what happened to me the last time i helped you subrosa said ivan truculently that little sleight of hand i pulled to get you back in the embassy the night you tried to burn down london is on my record now destangs birddogs will have spasms as soon as they turn that up in light of the present circumstances suppose i stick it up your his eyes fell on elli ear instead miles thrust his head and arms up through his black tshirt and pulled it down grinning slightly he began stuffing his feet into his dendariiissue combat boots its only a precaution may never use it just in case i need a private line into the embassy in an emergency i cannot imagine said ivan primly any emergency that a loyal junior officer cant confide to his very own sector security commander his voice grew stern neither would destang just what are you hatching in the back of your twisty little mind coz miles sealed his boots and paused seriously im not sure but i may yet see a chance to save something from this mess elli listening intently remarked i thought we had saved something we uncovered a traitor plugged a security leak foiled a kidnapping and broke up a major plot against the barrayaran imperium and we got paid what more do you want for one week well it would have been nice if any of that had been on purpose instead of by accident miles mused ivan and elli looked at each other across the top of miless head their faces beginning to mirror a similar unease what more do you want to save miles ivan echoed miless frown directed to his boots deepened something a future a second chance a possibility its the clone isnt it said ivan his mouth hardening youve gone and let yourself get obsessed with that goddamn clone flesh of my flesh ivan miles turned his hands over staring at them on some planets he would be called my brother on others he might even be called my son depending on the laws regarding cloning one cell on barrayar said ivan they call it your enemy when its shooting at you you having a little shortterm memory trouble those people just tried to kill you thisyesterday morning miles smiled briefly up at ivan without replying you know elli said cautiously if you decided you really wanted a clone you could have one made without the ah problems of the present one you have trillions of cells i dont want a clone said miles i want a brother but i seem to have been issued this one i thought ser galen bought and paid for him complained elli the only thing that komarran meant to issue you was death by jacksons whole law the planet of his origin the clone clearly belongs to galen jockey of norfolk be not bold the old quote whispered through miless memory for dickon thy master is bought and sold even on barrayar he said mildly no human being can own another galen descended far in pursuit of his principle of liberty in any case said ivan youre out of the picture now high command has taken over i heard your marching orders did you also hear destang say he meant to kill mythe clone if he can yeah so ivan was looking mulish indeed an almost panicked stubbornness i didnt like him anyway surly little sneak destang has mastered the art of the final report too said miles even if i went awol right now it would be physically impossible for me to get back to barrayar beg the clones life from my father have him lean on simon illyan for a countermand and get the order back here to earth before the deed was done ivan looked shocked milesi always figured to be embarrassed to ask uncle aral for a career favor but i thought youd let yourself be peeled and boiled before youd cry to your dad for anything and you want to start by hopscotching a commodore no co in the service would want you after that i would rather die agreed miles tonelessly but i cant ask another to die for me but its irrelevant it couldnt succeed thank god ivan stared at him thoroughly unsettled if i cannot convince two of my best friends im right thought miles maybe im wrong or maybe i have to do this one alone i just want to keep a line open ivan he said im not asking you to do anything yet came ivans glum interpolation id give the comm link to captain galeni but he will certainly be closely watched theyd just take it away from him and it would look ambiguous so on me it looks good asked ivan plaintively do it miles finished fastening his jacket stood and held out his hand to ivan for the return of the comm link or dont argh ivan broke off his gaze and shoved the comm link disconsolately into his trouser pocket ill think about it miles tilted his head in thanks they caught a dendarii shuttle just about to lift from the london shuttleport returning personnel from leave actually elli called ahead and had it held for them miles rather relished the sensation of not having to rush for it and might have outright sauntered if the pressures of admiral naismiths duties now boiling up in his head hadnt automatically quickened his steps their delay was anothers gain a last duffleswinging dendarii sprinted across the tarmac as the engines revved and just made it up the retracting ramp the alert guard at the door put up his weapon as he recognized the sprinter and gave him a hand in as the shuttle began to roll miles elli quinn and elena botharijesek held seats in the rear the running soldier pausing to catch his breath spotted miles grinned and saluted miles returned both ah sergeant siembieda ryann siembieda was a conscientious tech sergeant from engineering in charge of maintenance and repair of battle armor and other light equipment youre thawed out yes sir they told me your prognosis was good they threw me out of the hospital two weeks ago ive been on leave you too sir siembieda nodded toward the silver shopping bag at miless feet containing the live fur miles shoved it unobtrusively under his seat with his boot heel yes and no actually while you were playing i was working as a result we will all be working again soon its good you got your leave while you could earth was great sighed siembieda it was quite a surprise to wake up here did you see the unicorn park its right here on this island i was there yesterday i didnt see much im afraid said miles regretfully siembieda dug a holocube out of his pocket and handed it over the unicorn and wild animal park a division of galactech bioengineering occupied the grounds of the great and historical estate of wooton surrey the guide cube informed him in the vid display a shining white beast that looked like a cross between a horse and a deer and probably was bounded across the greensward into the topiary they let you feed the tame lions siembieda informed him miles blinked at an unbidden mental image of ivan in a toga being tossed out the back of a float truck to a herd of hungry tawny cats galloping excitedly along behind hed been reading too much earth history what do they eat protein cubes same as us ah said miles trying not to sound disappointed he handed the cube back the sergeant hovered on however sir he began hesitantly yes miles let his tone be encouraging ive reviewed my proceduresbeen tested and cleared for light dutiesbut i havent been able to remember anything at all about the day i was killed and the medics wouldnt tell me it bothers me a bit sir siembiedas hazel eyes were strange and wary it bothered him a lot miles judged i see well the medics couldnt tell you much anyway they werent there but you were sir said siembieda suggestively of course thought miles and if i hadnt been you wouldnt have died the death intended for me do you remember our arriving at mahata solaris yes sir some things right up to the night before but that whole day is gone not just the fight ah well theres no mystery commodore jesek myself you and your tech team paid a visit to a warehouse for a qualitycontrol check of our resuppliesthered been a problem with the first shipment i remember that nodded siembieda cracked power cells leaking radiation right very good you spotted the defect by the way unloading them into inventory there are those who might simply have stored them not on my team muttered siembieda we were jumped by a cetagandan hit squad at the warehouse we never did find out if there was any collusion though we suspected some in high places when our orbital permits were revoked and we were invited to leave mahata solaris local space by the authorities or maybe they just didnt like the excitement wed brought with us anyway a gravitic grenade went off and blew out the end of the warehouse you were hit in the neck by a freak fragment of something metal ricocheting from the explosion you bled to death in seconds quite incredible quantities of blood from such a lean young man once it was spread out and smeared around in the fightthe smell of it and the burning came back to miles as he spoke but he kept his voice calm and steady we had you back to the triumph and iced down in an hour the surgeon was very optimistic as you didnt have gross tissue damage not like one of the techs whod been blown most grossly to bits in that same moment id wondered what id done or not done you scarcely had time to do anything you were practically the first casualty siembieda looked faintly relieved and what goes on in the head of a walking dead man miles wondered what personal failure could he possibly fear more than death itself if its any consolation put in elli that sort of memory loss is common in trauma victims of all kinds not just cryorevivals you ask around youll find youre not the only one better strap down said miles as the craft yawed around for takeoff siembieda nodded looking a little more cheerful and swung forward to find a seat do you remember your burn miles asked elli curiously or is it all a merciful blank ellis hand drifted across her cheek i never quite lost consciousness the shuttle shot forward and up lieutenant ptarmigans hands at the controls miles judged dryly some hooted commentary from forward passengers confirmed his guess miless hand hesitated over and fell away from the control in his seatarm that would comm link him to the pilot he would not brassharass ptarmigan unless he started flying upside down fortunately for ptarmigan the craft steadied miles craned his neck for a look out the window as the glittering lights of greater london and its island fell away beneath them in another moment he could see the river mouth with its great dykes and locks running for forty kilometers defining the coastline to human design shutting out the sea and protecting the historical treasures and several million souls of the lower thames watershed one of the huge channelspanning bridges gleamed against the leaden dawn water beyond and so men organized themselves for the sake of their technology as they never had for their principles the seas politics were unarguable the shuttle wheeled gaining altitude rapidly giving miles a last glimpse of the shrinking maze of london somewhere down there in that monstrous city galen and mark hid or ran or plotted while destangs intelligence team quartered and requartered galens old haunts and the comconsole net looking for traces of them in a deadly game of hide and seek surely galen had the sense to avoid his friends and stay off the net at all costs if he cut his losses and ran now he had a chance of eluding barrayaran vengeance for another halflifetime but if galen were running why had he doubled back to pick up mark what possible use was the clone to him now did galen have some dim paternal sense of responsibility to his creation somehow miles doubted it was love that bound those two together could the clone be usedservant slave soldier could the clone be soldto the cetagandans to a medical laboratory to a sideshow could the clone be sold to miles now there was a proposition that even the hypersuspicious galen would buy let him believe miles wanted a new body without the bone dyscrasias that had plagued him since birth let him believe miles would pay a high price to have the clone for this vile purpose and miles might gain possession of mark and slip galen enough cover and funds to finance his escape without galen ever realizing he was the object of charity for his sons sake the idea had only two flaws one until he made contact with galen he couldnt do any deal at all two if galen would make such a diabolical bargain miles was not so sure he cared to see him elude barrayars timecold vengeance after all a curious dilemma it was like coming home to step aboard thetriumph again knots miles had not been conscious of undid themselves in the back of his neck as he inhaled the familiar recycled air and soaked the small subliminal chirps and vibrations of the properly functioning live ship in through his bones things were looking in rather better repair all over than at any time since dagook and miles made a mental note to find out which aggressive engineering sergeants he had to thank for it it would be good to be just naismith again with no problem more complex than what could be laid out in plain military language by hq finite and unambiguous he issued orders cancel further work contracts by individual dendarii or their groups all personnel presently scattered downside on work or leave to go on a six hour recall alert all ships to begin their twentyfour hour preflight checks send lieutenant bone to me it gave him a pleasantly megalomanic sense of drawing all things toward a center himself though that humor cooled when he contemplated the unsolved problem waiting for him in his intelligence division quinn in tow miles went to pay intelligence a visit he found bel thorne manning the security comconsole if manning was the right term thorne was one of beta colonys hermaphrodite minority hapless heirs of a centurypast genetic project of dubious merit it had been one of the lunatic fringes loonier experiments in miless estimation most of the menwomen stuck to their own comfortable little subculture on tolerant beta colony that thorne had ventured out into the wider galactic world bespoke either courage terminal boredom or most probably if you knew thorne a low taste for unsettling people captain thorne kept soft brown hair cut in a deliberately ambiguous style but wore hardearned dendarii uniform and rank with crisp definition hi bel miles pulled up a station chair and hooked it into its clamps thorne greeted him with a friendly semisalute play me back everything the surveillance team picked up from galens house after quinn and i rescued the barrayaran military attache and left to deliver him back to their embassy quinn kept her face quite straight through this bit of revisionist history thorne obediently fastforwarded through a half hour of silence then slowed through the disjointed conversation of the two unhappy komarran guards awakening from stun then the chime of the comconsole a somewhat degraded image resynthesized from the vid beam the slow toneless voice and face of galen himself requesting a report on the guards murderous assignment the sharp rise in tone as he heard of the dramatic rescue insteadfools a pause dont attempt to contact me again cut we traced the source of the call i trust said miles public comconsole at a tube station said thorne by the time we got someone there the potential search radius had widened to about a hundred kilometers good tube system that right and he never returned to the house after that abandoned everything apparently hes had previous experience evading security i take it he was an expert before i was born sighed miles what about the two guards they were still at the house when the surveillance guys from the barrayaran embassy arrived and took over and we packed our kit and went home have the barrayarans paid us for this little job yet by the way handsomely oh good i was afraid theyd hold it up till after wed delivered van der poole too about van der poolegalen said miles ahwere no longer working for the barrayarans on that one theyve brought in their own team from their sector headquarters on tau ceti throne frowned puzzlement but were still working for the time being but youd better pass the word along to our downside people from this point on contact with the barrayarans is to be avoided thornes brows rose who are we working for then for me thorne paused arent you playing this one a tad close to your chest sir much too close if my own intelligence people are to remain effective miles sighed all right an odd and unexpected personal wrinkle has turned up in the middle of this case have you ever wondered why i never speak of my family background or my past wellthere are a lot of dendarii who dont sir quite i was born a clone bel thorne looked only mildly sympathetic some of my best friends are clones perhaps i should say i was created a clone in the military laboratory of a galactic power that shall remain nameless i was created for a covert substitution plot against the son of a certain important man key of another galactic poweryou can figure out who with a very little research im surebut about seven years ago i declined the honor i escaped fled and set up on my own creating the dendarii mercenaries from er materials found ready to hand thorne grinned a memorable event but this is where galen comes in the galactic power abandoned their plot and i thought i was free of my unhappy past but several clones had been run off so to speak in the attempt to generate an exact physical duplicate with certain mental refinements before the lab finally came up with me i thought they were all long dead callously murdered disposed of but apparently one of the earlier lesssuccessful efforts had been put into cryosuspension and somehow he has fallen into ser galens hands my sole surviving clonebrother bel miless hand closed in a fist enslaved by a fanatic i want to rescue him his hand opened pleadingly can you understand why thorne blinked knowing you i guess i do is it very important to you sir very thorne straightened slightly then it will be done thank you miles hesitated better have all our downside patrol leaders issued a small medical scanner keep it on themselves at all times as you know i had my leg bones replaced with synthetics a bit over a year ago his are normal bone its the quickest way to tell the difference between us your appearance is that close said thorne our appearances are identical apparently they are confirmed quinn to thorne ive seen him i see interesting possibilities for confusion there sir thorne glanced at quinn who nodded ruefully too right i trust the dissemination of the medical scanners will help keep things dull carry oncall me at once if you get a break in the case right sir in the corridor quinn remarked nice save sir miles sighed i had to find some way to warn the dendarii about mark cant have him playing admiral naismith again unimpeded mark said elli whos mark or dare i guess miles mark two lord mark pierre vorkosigan said miles calmly anyway he hoped he appeared calm my brother elli alive to the significances of barrayaran clan claims frowned is ivan right miles has that little sucker hypnotized you i dont know said miles slowly if im the only one who sees him that way then maybe just maybe elli made an encouraging noise a slight smile turned one corner of miless mouth then maybe everybodys wrong but me elli snorted miles turned serious again i truly dont know in seven years i never abused the powers of admiral naismith for personal purposes thats not a record im anxious to break well perhaps well fail to turn them up and the question will become moot wishful thinking said elli disapprovingly if you dont want to turn them up maybe youd better stop looking for them compelling logic so why arent you compelled and what do you plan to do with them if you do catch em as for what said miles its not too complicated i want to find galen and my clone before destang does and separate them and then make sure destang doesnt find them until i can send a private report home eventually if i vouch for him i believe a ceaseanddesist order will come through countermanding my clones assassination without my having to appear directly connected with it what about galen asked elli skeptically no way are you going to get a ceaseanddesist order on him probably not galen isa problem i have not solved miles returned to his cabin where his fleet accountant caught up with him lieutenant bone fell on the eighteenmillionmark credit chit with heartfelt and unmilitary glee saved disburse it as needed miles said and get the triumph out of hock we need to be able to move out at a moments notice without having to argue about grand theft with the solar navy ahhm dyou think you can create a credit chit out of petty cash or wherever in galactic funds that couldnt in any way be traced back to us a gleam lit her eye an interesting challenge sir does this have anything to do with our upcoming contract security lieutenant miles said blandly i cant discuss it even with you security she sniffed doesnt hide as much from accounting as they think they do perhaps i should combine your departments no he grinned at her horrified look well maybe not who does this chit go to to the bearer her brows rose very good sir how much miles hesitated half a million marks however that translates into local credit half a million marks she noted wryly is not petty just so long as its cash ill do my best sir he sat alone in his cabin after she left frowning deeply the impasse was clear galen could not be expected to initiate contact unless he saw some way not to mention some reason to control the situation or achieve surprise letting galen choreograph his moves seemed fatal and miles did not care for the idea of wandering around till galen chose to surprise him still some sort of feint to create an opening might be better than no move at all in view of the shrinking time limit get off the damn defensive disadvantage act instead of react a high resolve but for the minor flaw that until galen was spotted miles had no object to act upon he growled frustration and went wearily to bed he woke on his own in the dark of his cabin some twelve hours later noted the time on the glowing digits of his wall clock and lay a while luxuriating in the remarkable sensation of finally having gotten enough sleep his greedy body was just suggesting in the leaden slowness of his limbs that more would be nice when his cabin comconsole chimed saved from the sin of sloth he staggered out of bed and answered it sir the face of one of the triumphs comm officers appeared you have a tightbeam call from the barrayaran embassy downside in london theyre asking for you personally scrambled miles trusted that this was not literally true it couldnt be ivan he would have called on the private comm link it had to be an official communique unscramble and pipe it in here then should i record ahno could the new orders from hq for the dendarii fleet have arrived already miles swore silently if they were forced to break orbit before his dendarii intelligence people found galen and mark destangs grim face appeared over the vid plate admiral naismith miles could hear the quote marks dropping in around his name are we alone entirely sir destangs face relaxed slightly very well i have an order for youlieutenant vorkosigan you are to remain aboard your ship in orbit until i personally call again and notify you otherwise why sir said miles though he could damn well guess for my peace of mind when a simple precaution will prevent the slightest possibility of an accident its foolish not to take it do you understand fully sir very well thats all destang out the commodores face dissolved in air miles cursed out loud with feeling destangs precaution could only mean that his sector goons had spotted mark already before miless dendarii hadand were moving in for the kill how fast was there still a chance miles slipped on his grey trousers hung ready to hand and dug the secured comm link from his pocket and keyed it on ivan he spoke into it quietly you there miles it was not ivans voice it was galenis captain galeni i found the other half of the comm link ah are you alone at present galenis voice was dry conveying through no more than the tone his opinion of both the misplaced comm link story and those who invented it why howd you come by the comm link your cousin handed it to me just before he departed on his duties left for where what duties was ivan swept up for destangs manhunt if so miles could happily throttle him for divesting miless ear on the proceedings just when it might have done the most goodskittish idiotif only hes escorting the ambassadors lady to the world botanical exhibition and ornamental flower show at the university of londons horticulture hall she goes every year to gladhand the local social set admittedly she is also interested in the topic miless voice rose slightly in the middle of a security crisis you sent ivan to a flower show not i denied galeni commodore destang i ahbelieve he felt ivan could be most easily spared hes not thrilled with ivan what about you hes not thrilled with me either no i mean what are you doing are you directly involved with the current operation hardly ah im relieved i was a little afraidsomebodymight have gotten a short circuit in his head about requiring it of you as proof of loyalty or some damn thing commodore destang is neither a sadist nor a fool galeni paused hes careful however im confined to quarters you have no direct access to the operation then like where they are and how close and when they plan to make a move galenis voice was carefully neutral neither offering nor denying help not readily hm he just ordered me confined to quarters too i think hes had some sort of break and things are coming to a head there was a brief silence galenis words drifted out on a sigh sorry to hear that his voice cracked its so damned useless the dead hand of the past goes on jerking the strings by galvanic reflex and we poor puppets dancenothing is served not us not him not komarr if i could make contact with your father began miles it would be useless hell fight and keep on fighting but he has nothing now he blew his last chance hes an old man hes tiredhe could be ready to change to quit at last miles argued i wish no he cant quit above life itself he has to prove himself right to be right redeems his every crime to have done all that hes done and be wrongunbearable i see well ill contact you again if i have anything useful to say theres ah no point in turning in the comm link till you have both halves eh as you wish galenis tone was not exactly fired with hope miles shut down the comm link he called thorne who reported no visible progress in the meantime said miles heres another lead for you an unfortunate one the team from the barrayarans has evidently spotted our target within the last hour or so ha maybe we can follow them and let them lead us to galen afraid not we have to get ahead of them without treading on their toes their hunt is a lethal one armed and dangerous eh ill pass the word thorne whistled thoughtfully your crechemate sure is popular miles washed dressed ate made ready boot knife scanners stunners both hipholstered and concealed comm links a wide assortment of tools and toys one might carry through londons shuttleport security checks it was a far cry from combat gear alas though his jacket nearly clanked when he walked he called the duty officer made sure a personnel shuttle was fueled pilot at the ready he waited without patience what was galen up to if he wasnt just runningand the fact that the barrayaran security team had nearly caught up with him suggested he was still hanging around for some reasonwhy mere revenge something more arcane was miless analysis of him too simple too subtlewhat was he missing what was left in life for the man who had to be right his cabin comconsole chimed miles sent up a short inarticulate prayerlet it be some break some chink some handle the comm officers face appeared sir i have a call originating from the downside commercial comconsole net a man who refuses to identify himself says you want to talk to him miles jerked electrically upright trace the call and cut a copy to captain thorne in intelligence put it through here do you want your visual to go out or just audio both the comm officers face faded as another mans appeared giving an unsettling illusion of transmutation vorkosigan said galen so said miles i will not repeat myself galen spoke low and fast i dont give a damn if youre recording or tracing its irrelevant you will meet me in seventy minutes exactly you will come to the thames tidal barrier halfway between towers six and seven you will walk out on the seaward side to the lower lookout alone then well talk if any condition is not met we will simply not be there when you arrive and ivan vorpatril will die at you are two i must be two miles began ivan your pretty bodyguard very well two the vid blinked blank no silence miles keyed to thorne did you get that bel sure did sounded threatening whos ivan a very important person whered this originate a tubeway nexus public comconsole i have a man on the way who can make it in six minutes unfortunately i know six minutes gives a search radius of several million people i think well play it his way up to a point put a patrol in the air over the tidal barrier file a flight plan for my shuttle downside have an aircar and dendarii driver and guard meet it tell bone i want that credit chit now tell quinn to meet me in the shuttle hatch corridor and bring a couple of med scanners and stand by i want to check something he took a deep breath and keyed open the comm link galeni a pause yes you still confined to quarters yes i have an urgent request for information wheres ivan really as far as i know hes still at check it check it fast there was a long long pause which miles utilized to recheck his gear find lieutenant bone and walk to the shuttle hatch corridor quinn was waiting intensely curious whats up now we have our break of sorts galen wants a meeting but miles galenis voice came back at last it sounded rather strained yo the private wed sent to be driverguard called in about ten minutes ago hed spelled ivan attending on milady while ivan went to piss when ivan didnt come back in twenty minutes the driver went to look for him spent thirty minutes huntingthe horticulture hall is huge and mobbed tonightbefore he reported back to us how did you know i think ive got hold of the other end do you recognize whose style of doing business this is galeni swore quite look i dont care how you do it but i want you to meet me in fifty minutes at the thames tidal barrier section six pack at least a stunner and get away preferably without alerting destang we have an appointment with your father and my brother if he has ivan he had to bring some card to the table or he wouldnt come play weve got one last chance to make it come out right not a good chance just the last one are you with me a slight pause yes the tone was decisive see you there pocketing the link miles turned to elli now we move they swung through the shuttle hatch for once miles had no objection to ptarmigans habit of taking all downside flights at combatdrop speed chapter fourteen the thames tidal barrier know to local wags as the king canute memorial was a vastly more impressive structure seen from a hundred meters up than it had seemed from the kilometershigh view from the shuttle the aircar banked circling the synthacrete mountain ran away in both directions farther than miless eye could follow whitened into an illusion of marble by the spotlights that knifed through the faintly misty midnight blackness watchtowers every kilometer housed not soldiers guarding the wall but the night shift of engineers and technicians watching over the sluices and pumping stations to be sure if the sea ever broke through it would raze the city more mercilessly than any army but the sea was calm this summer night dotted with colored navigation lights red green white and the distant moving twinkle of ships running lights the eastern horizon glowed faintly false dawn from the radiant cities of europe beyond the waters on the other side of the white barrier toward ancient london all the dirt and grime and broken places were swallowed by the night leaving only the jewelled illusion of something magic unmarred and immortal miles pressed his face to the aircars bubble canopy for a last strategic view of the arena they were about to enter before the car dropped toward the nearempty parking area behind the barrier section six was peripheral to the main channel sections with their enormous navigation locks busy around the clock it was just dyke and auxiliary pumping stations nearly deserted at this hour that suited miles if the situation devolved into some sort of shooting war the fewer civilian bystanders wandering through the better catwalks and ladders ran to access ports in the structure geometric black accents on the whiteness spidery railings marked walkways some broad and public some narrow reserved no doubt to authorized personnel at present they all appeared deserted no sign of galen or mark no sign of ivan whats significant about miles wondered aloud i have the feeling it should be obvious its such an exact time elli the spaceborn shook her head but the dendarii soldier piloting the aircar volunteered its high tide sir ah said miles he sat back thinking furiously how interesting it suggests two things theyve concealed ivan around here someplaceand we might do best to concentrate our search below the high waterline could they have chained him to a railing down by the rocks or some damn thing the air patrol could make a pass and check said quinn yes have them do that the aircar settled into a painted circle on the pavement quinn and the second soldier exited first cautiously and ran a fast perimeter scan around the area theres somebody approaching on foot the soldier reported pray its captain galeni miles muttered with a glance at his chrono seven minutes remained of his time limit it was a man jogging with his dog the pair stared at the four uniformed dendarii and arced nervously around them to the far side of the parking lot before disappearing through the bushes softening the north end everybody took their hands off their stunners civilized town thought miles you wouldnt do that at this hour in some parts of vorbarr sultana unless you had a much bigger dog the soldier checked his infrared here comes another one not the soft pad of running shoes this time but the quick ring of boots miles recognized the sound of the boots before he could make out the face in the splash of light and shadow galenis uniform turned from dark grey to green as he entered the lots zone of brighter illumination walking fast all right said miles to elli this is where we split off stay back and out of sight at all costs but if you can find a vantage good wrist comm open elli keyed her wrist comm miles pulled his boot knife and used the point to disengage and extinguish the tiny transmitindicator light in his own wrist comm then blew into it the hiss of it whispered from ellis wrist sending fine she confirmed got your med scanner she displayed it take a baseline she pointed it at him waved it up and down recorded and ready for autocomparison can you think of anything else she shook her head but still didnt look happy what do i do if he comes walking back and you dont grab him fastpenta himgot your interrogation kit she flashed open her jacket a small brown case peeped from an inner pocket rescue ivan if you can then miles took a deep breath you can blow the clones head off or whatever you choose what happened to my brother right or wrong said elli galeni coming up in the middle of this cocked his head with interest to hear the answer to that one but miles only shook his head he couldnt think of a simple answer three minutes left said miles to galeni we better move they headed up a walk that led to a set of stairs stepping over the chain that marked them as closed for the night to lawabiding citizens the stairs climbed the back side of the tidal barrier to a public promenade that ran along the top to allow sightseers a view of the ocean in the daytime galeni who had evidently been moving at speed was breathing deeply even as they began their climb have any trouble getting out of the embassy asked miles not really said galeni as you know the trick is getting back in i think you demonstrated simplest is best i just walked out the side entrance and took the nearest tubeway fortunately the duty guard had no orders to shoot me did you know that in advance no then destang knows you left he will know certainly think you were followed miles glanced involuntarily over his shoulder he could see the parking lot and aircar below elli and the two soldiers had vanished from view seeking their vantage no doubt not immediately embassy security galenis teeth flashed in the shadows is undermanned at present i left my wristcomm and bought cash tokens for the tubeway instead of using my passcard so they have nothing quick to trace me by they panted to the top the damp air moved cool against miless face smelling of river slime and sea salt a faintly decayed estuarial tang miles crossed the wide promenade and peered down over the railing at the synthacrete outer face of the dyke a narrow railed ledge ran along some twenty meters below vanishing away out of sight to the right along an outcurving bulge in the barrier not part of the public area it was reached by keyed extension ladders at intervals along the railing all folded up and locked for the night of course they could fuss with trying to break open and decode one of the locked ladder controlstimeconsuming and likely to light up the alarm board of some nightshift supervisor in one of the distant watchtowersor go down the fast way miles sighed under his breath rappelling high over rockhard surfaces was one of his alltime leastfavorite activities he fished the dropwire spool from its own little pocket on his dendarii jacket attached the gravitic grappler carefully and firmly to the railing and doublechecked it at a touch handles telescoped out from the sides of the spool and released the wide ribbonharness that always looked horribly flimsy despite its phenomenal tensile strength miles threaded it round himself clipped it tight hopped over the rail and danced down the wall backwards not looking down by the time he reached the bottom his adrenalin was pumping nicely thank you he sent the spool winding itself back up to galeni who repeated miless performance galeni offered no comment about his feelings about heights as he handed back the device so neither did miles miles touched the control that released the grappler and rewound and pocketed the spool we go right miles nodded he drew his holstered stunner what did you bring i could only get one stunner galeni pulled it from his pocket checked its charge and setting and you two and a few other toys there are severe limits to what you can carry through shuttleport security considering how crowded this place is i think theyre wise remarked galeni stunners in hand they walked single file along the ledge miles first sea water swirled and gurgled just below their feet greenbrown transluscence frosted with streaks of foam within the circles of light silky black beyond judging from the discoloration this walkway was inundated at high tide miles motioned galeni to pause and slipped forward just beyond the outcurve the walkway widened to a fourmeter circle and deadended the railing arcing around to meet the wall in the wall was a doorway a sturdy watertight oval hatch standing in front of the hatch were galen and mark stunners in their hands mark wore black tshirt and dendarii grey trousers and boots minus the pocketed jackethis own clothes pilfered miles wondered or duplicates his nostrils flared as he spotted his grandfathers dagger in its lizardskin sheath at the clones waist a standoff remarked galen conversationally as miles halted with a glance at miless stunner and his own if we all fire at once it leaves either me or my miles on his feet and the game is mine but if by some miracle you dropped us both we could not tell you where your oxlike cousin is hed die before you could find him his death has been automated i need not get back to him to carry it out quite the reverse your pretty bodyguard may as well join us galeni stepped around the bend some standoffs are more curious than others he said galens face flickered from its hard irony lips parting in a breath of deep dismay then tightening again even as his hand tightened on his weapon you were to bring the woman he hissed miles smiled slightly shes around but you said two and we are two now all the interested parties are here now what galens eyes shifted counting weapons calculating distances muscle odds no doubt miles was doing the same the standoff remains said galen if youre both stunned you lose if were both stunned you lose again its absurd what would you suggest asked miles i propose we all lay our weapons in the center of the deck then we can talk without distraction hes got another one concealed thought miles same as me an interesting proposition who puts his down last galens face was a study in unhappy calculation he opened his mouth and closed it again and shook his head slightly i too would like to talk without distraction said miles carefully i propose this schedule ill lay mine down first then mthe clone then yourself captain galeni last what guarantee galen glanced sharply at his son the tension between them was nearsickening a strange and silent compound of rage despair and anguish hell give you his word said miles he looked for confirmation to galeni who nodded slowly silence fell for the space of three breaths then galen said all right miles stepped forward knelt laid his stunner in the center of the deck stepped back mark repeated his performance staring at him the while galen hesitated a long agonized moment eyes still full of shifting calculation then put his weapon down with the others galeni followed suit without hesitation his smile was like a swordcut his eyes were unreadable but for the baseline of dull pain that had lurked in them ever since his father had resurrected himself your proposition first then galen said to miles if you have one life said miles i have concealedin a place only i know of and if youd stunned me youd never have discovered it in timea cashcredit chit for a hundred thousand betan dollarsthats half a million imperial marks friendspayable to the bearer i can give it to you plus a head start useful information on how to evade barrayaran securitywhich is very close behind you by the way the clone was looking extremely interested his eyes had widened when the sum was named and widened still further at the mention of barrayaran security in exchange for my cousin miles took a slight breath my brother and your promise toretire and refrain from further plots against the barrayaran imperium which can only result in useless bloodshed and unnecessary pain to your few surviving relations the wars over ser galen its time for someone else to try something else a different way maybe a better wayit could scarcely be a worse way after all the revolt breathed galen almost to himself must not die even if everybody in it dies it didnt work so lets do it some more in my line of work they call that military stupidity i dont know what they call it in civilian life my older sister once surrendered on a barrayarans word galen remarked his face was very cold admiral vorkosigan too was full of soft and logical persuasion promising peace my fathers word was betrayed by an underling said miles who couldnt recognize when the war was over and it was time to quit he paid for the error with his life executed for his crime my father gave you your revenge then it was all he could give you he couldnt bring those dead to life neither can i i can only try to prevent more dying galen smiled sourly and you david what bribe would you offer me to betray komarr to lay alongside your barrayaran masters money galeni was regarding his fingernails a peculiar fey smile playing around his lips as he listened he buffed them briefly on his trouser seam crossed his arms blinked grandchildren galen seemed taken aback for a bare instant youre not even bonded i might be someday only if i live of course and they would all be good little imperial subjects sneered galen recovering his initial balance with an effort galeni shrugged seems to fit in with vorkosigans offer of life i cant give you anything else you want of me you two are more alike than either of you realize i think miles murmured so whats your proposition ser galen why have you called us all here galens right hand went to his jacket then slowed he smiled tilted his head as if asking permission disarmingly here comes the second stunner thought miles coyly pretending to the last minute that its not really a weapon miles didnt flinch but an involuntary calculation did flash through his mind as to just how fast he could vault the railing and how far he could swim underwater holding his breath in a strong surf wearing boots galeni cool as ever didnt move either even when the weapon ser galen abruptly displayed turned out to be a lethal nerve disrupter some standoffs said galen are more equal than others his smile tightened to a parody of itself pick up those stunners he added to the clone who stooped and gathered them up and stuck them in his belt now what are you going to do with that said miles lightly trying not to let his eye be hypnotized nor his mind paralyzed by the silver bellmuzzle shiny beads bells and whistles kill you galen explained his eyes flicked to his son and away toward and away he focused on miles as if to steady his high resolve so why are you still talking instead of firing miles didnt speak that thought aloud lest galen be struck by its good sense keep him talking he wants to say more is driven to say more why i dont see how that will serve komarr at this late hour except maybe to relieve your feelings mere revenge nothing mere about it complete my miles will walk out of here as the only one oh come on miles didnt have to call on his acting ability to lend outrage to his tone it came quite naturally youre not still stuck on the bloody substitution plot barrayaran security is all warned theyll spot you at once now cant be done he glanced at the clone you going to let him run you head first into a flashdisposer youre dead meat the moment you present yourself its useless and its not necessary the clone looked distinctly uneasy but jerked up his chin and managed a proud smile im not going to be lord vorkosigan im going to be admiral naismith i did it once so i know i can your dendarii are going to give us a ride out of hereand a new power base ngh miles made a hairtearing gesture dyou think id have walked in here if that were even remotely possible the dendarii are warned too every patrol leader out thereand youd better believe i have patrols out thereis carrying a med scanner first order you give youll be scanned if they find leg bone where my synthetics should be theyll blow your head off end plot but my leg bones are synthetics said the clone in a puzzled tone miles froze what you told me your bones didnt break galen swivelled his head round at the clone when did you tell him that they dont the clone answered miles but after yours were replaced so were mine otherwise the first cursory med scan i got would have given it all away but you still dont have the pattern of old breaks in your other bones no but that would take a much closer scan and once the three are eliminated i should be able to avoid that ill study your logs the three what the three dendarii who know you are vorkosigan your pretty bodyguard and the other couple galen explained vindictively to miless look of horror im sorry you didnt bring her now we shall have to hunt her down was that a fleeting queasy look on marks face galen caught it too and frowned faintly you still couldnt bring it off argued miles there are five thousand dendarii i know hundreds of them by name on sight weve been in combat together i know things about them their own mothers dont not in any log and theyve seen me under every kind of stress you wouldnt even know the right jokes to make and even if you succeed for a time become admiral naismith as you once planned to become emperorwhere is mark then maybe mark doesnt want to be a space mercenary maybe he wants to be a a textile designer or a doctor oh breathed the clone with a glance down his twisted body not a doctor or a holovid programmer or a star pilot or an engineer or very far away from him miles jerked his head at galen for a moment the clones eyes filled with a passionate longing as quickly masked how will you ever find out its true said galen looking at the clone through suddenly narrowed eyes you must pass for an experienced soldier and youve never killed the clone shifted uneasily looking sideways at his mentor galens voice had softened you must learn to kill if you expect to survive no you dont miles put in most people go through their whole lives without killing anybody false argument the nerve disrupters aim steadied on miles you talk too much galens eyes fell one last time on his silent witnessing son who raised his chin in defiance then flicked away as if the sight burned its time to go galen face hardening decisively turned to the clone here he handed him the nerve disrupter its time to complete your education shoot them and lets go what about ivan asked captain galeni softly i have as little use for vorkosigans nephew as i have for his son said galen they can skip down to hell hand in hand his head turned to the clone and he added begin mark swallowed and raised the weapon in a twohanded firing stance butwhat about the credit chit there is no credit chit cant you spot a lie when you hear it fool miles raised his wrist comm and spoke distinctly into it elli do you have all this recorded and transmitted to captain thorne in iq quinns voice came back cheerily thin in the damp air dyou want company yet not yet he let his hand fall stood straight met galens furious eyes and clenched teeth as i said end plot lets discuss alternatives mark had lowered the nerve disrupter his face dismayed alternatives revenge will do hissed galen fire but said the clone agitated as of this moment youre a free man miles spoke low and fast he bought and paid for you but he doesnt own you but if you loll for him hell own you forever forever and ever not necessarily spoke galenis silent quirk of the lips but he did not interfere with miless pitch you must kill your enemies snarled galen marks hand and aim sagged his mouth opening in protest now dammit yelled galen and made to grab back the nerve disrupter galeni stepped in front of miles miles scrabbled in his jacket for his second stunner the nerve disrupter crackled miles drew too late too goddamn latecaptain galeni gaspedhes dead for my slowness my onelastchance stupidityface narrowed mouth open in a silent yell miles sprang from behind galeni and aimed his stunner to see galen crumple convulsing back arching in a bonecracking twist face writhingand slump in death kill your enemies breathed mark his face white as paper right ah he added raising the weapon again as miles started forward stop right there a hiss at miless feethe glanced down to see a thin layer of foam wash past his boots lose momentum and recede in a moment another the tide was rising over the ledge the tide was rising wheres ivan miles demanded his hand clenching on his stunner if you fire that youll never know said mark his eye hurried nervously from miles to galeni from galens body at his feet to the weapon in his own hand as if they all added up to some impossibly incorrect sum his breath was shallow and panicky his knuckles wrapped around the nerve disrupter bonepale galeni was standing very very still head cocked looking down at what lay there or inward he did not seem to be conscious of the weapon or its wielder at all fine said miles you help us and well help you take us to ivan mark backed toward the wall not lowering the nerve disrupter i dont believe you where are you going to run to you cant go back to the komarrans theres a barrayaran hit squad with murder on its collective mind breathing down your neck you cant go to the local authorities for protection you have a body to explain im your only chance mark looked at the body at the nerve disrupter at miles the soft whirr of a rappel spool unwinding was barely audible over the hiss of the sea foam underfoot miles glanced up quinn was flying down in one long swoop like a falcon stooping weapon in one hand and rappeling spool controlled by the other mark kicked open the hatch and stumbled backwards into it you hunt for ivan hes not far i dont have a body to explainyou do the murder weapon has your fingerprints on it he flung down the nerve disrupter and slammed the hatch closed miles leapt for the door fingers scrabbling but it was already sealedhe came close to snapping some more finger bones the slide and clank of a locking mechanism designed to defy the force of the sea itself came muffled through the hatch miles hissed through his teeth should i blow it open gasped quinn landing ygood god no the discoloration on the wall marking high water was a good two meters higher than the top of the hatch we might drown london try to get it open without damaging it captain galeni miles turned galeni had not moved you in shock hm no no i dont think so galeni came out of himself with an effort he added in a strangely calm reflective tone later perhaps quinn was bent to the hatchway pulling devices from her pockets and slapping them to the vertical surface checking readouts electromechanical with a manual override if i use a magnetic miles reached around and pulled the rappeling harness off quinn go up he said to galeni and see if you can find another entrance on the other side weve got to catch that little sucker galeni nodded and hooked up the rappeling harness miles held out stunner and boot knife want a weapon mark had taken off with all the spare stunners still stuck in his belt stunners useless galeni noted youd better keep the knife if i catch up with him ill use my bare hands with pleasure miles added for him silently he nodded they had both been through barrayaran basic unarmed combat school three fourths of the moves were barred to miles in a real fight at full force due to the secret weakness of his bones the same was not true of galeni galeni ascended into the night air bounding up the wall on the almostinvisible thread as readily as a spider got it cried quinn the thick hatch swung wide on a deep dark hole miles yanked his handlight out of his belt and hopped through he glanced back at galens greyfaced body lapped by foam released from obsession and pain there was no mistaking the stillness of death for the stillness of sleep or anything else it was the absolute the nervedisruptor beam must have hit his head square on quinn dragged the hatch shut again behind them and paused to stuff equipment back into her pockets as the doors mechanism twinkled and beeped slid and clanked rendering the lower thames watershed safe again they both scrambled up the corridor a mere five meters farther on they came to their first check a tintersection this main corridor was lighted and curved away out of sight in both directions you go left ill go right said miles you shouldnt be alone quinn objected maybe i should be twins eh go dammit quinn threw up her hands in exasperation and ran miles sprinted in the other direction his footsteps echoed eerily in the corridor deep in the synthacrete mountain he paused a moment listened heard only quinns light fading scuff he ran on past hundreds of meters of blank synthacrete past dark and silent pumping stations past pumping stations lit up and humming quietly he was just wondering whether he could have missed an exitan overhead access portwhen he spotted an object on the corridor floor one of the stunners fallen from marks belt as he ran in panic miles swooped it up with a quick ahha of bared teeth and holstered it as he ran on he keyed open his wrist comm quinn the corridor curved suddenly into a sort of stark foyer with lift tube he must be under one of the watchtowers beware authorized personnel about quinn he stepped into the lift tube and rose oh god which level had mark got off at the third floor he passed opened out onto a glasswalled lobbylooking area with doors and the night beyond clearly an exit miles swung out of the lift tube a total stranger wearing civilian jacket and pants whirled at the sound of his footstep and dropped to one knee the silver flash of a parabolic mirror twinkled in his raised hands a nervedisruptor muzzle there he is the man cried and fired miles recoiled back into the lift tube so fast he rebounded off the far wall he grabbed for the safety ladder at the side of the tube and began slapping up the rungs faster than the antigrav field could lift him he wriggled his facial muscles shot with pins and needles from the nimbus of the disrupter beam the mans shoes miles realized gleaming out from the bottom of his trousers had been barrayaran regulation service boots quinn he yelped into his wrist comm again the next level up opened onto a corridor without gunmen in it the first three doors miles tried were locked the fourth swished open onto a brightly lit office apparently deserted on a quick jog around it miless eye was caught by a slight movement in the shadows under a console he bent down to face two women in blue tidal authority tech coveralls cowering beneath one squeaked and covered her eyes the second hugged her and glared defiantly at miles miles tried a friendly smile ah hello who are you people said the second woman in rising tones oh im not with them theyre um hired killers a just description after all dont worry theyre not after you have you called the police yet she shook her head mutely i suggest you do so immediately ahhave you seen me before she nodded which way did i go she cringed back clearly terrorized at being cornered by a psychotic miles spread his hands in silent apology and made for the door call the police he called back over his shoulder the feint beep of comconsole keys being pressed drifted down the corridor after him mark was nowhere on this level the lift tube grav field had now been turned off by someone the auto safety bar was extended across the opening and the red glow of the warning light filled the corridor miles stuck his head cautiously into the lift tube to spy another head on the level below looking up he jerked his head back as a nerve disruptor crackled a balcony ran right around the outside of the tower miles slipped through the door at the seaward end of the corridor and looked around and up only one more floor above its balcony was readily reachable by the toss of a grappler miles grimaced pulled out his spool and made the toss got a firm hook around the railing above on the first try a swallow a brief heartstopping dangle over the tower dyke and growling sea forty meters below and he was clambering onto the next balcony he tiptoed to the glass doorway and checked down the corridor mark was crouched silhouetted by the red light near the entrance to the lift tube stunner drawn theunconscious miles trustedform of a man in tech coveralls lay sprawled on the corridor floor mark miles called softly and jerked back mark snapped around and let off a stunner burst in his direction miles put his back against the wall and called cooperate with me and ill get you out of this alive wheres ivan this reminder that mark still held a trump card had the expected calming effect he did not fire again get me out of this and ill tell you where he is he countered miles grinned into the darkness all right im coming in he slipped round the door and joined his image pausing only to check for a pulse in the neck of the sprawled man he had one happily how are you going to get me out of this demanded mark well now thats the tricky part miles admitted he paused to listen intently someone was on the ladder in the lift tube trying to climb quietly not near their level yet the police are on their way and when they arrive i expect the barrayarans will decamp in a hurry they wont want to be caught in an embarrassing interplanetary incident which the ambassador would have to explain to the local authorities this nights operation is already way out of control in that anybody saw em at all destang will have their blood on the carpet in the morning the police marks grip tightened on his stunner competing fears struggled for ascendancy in his face yes we could try and play hide and seek in this tower till the police finally get herewhenever or we could go up to the roof and have a dendarii aircar pick us off right now i know which id prefer how about you then i would be your prisoner marks whispering voice blurred with a fearfueled anger dead now dead later whats the difference i finally figured out what use you had for a clone mark was seeing himself as a walking bodyparts bank again miles could tell miles sighed he glanced at his chrono by galens timetable i have eleven minutes left to find ivan a shifty look stole over marks face ivans not up hes down back the way we came ah miles risked a flashpeek into the lift tube the climber had exited at another floor the hunters were being thorough in their search by the time they worked their way up here theyd be quite certain of their quarry miles was still wearing the rappelling harness very quietly careful not to clank he reached out and fastened the grappler to the safety bar and tested it so you want to go down do you i can arrange that but youd better be right about ivan because if he dies ill dissect you personally heart and liver steaks and chops miles stooped checked his connections set the spools rate of spin and stoppoint and positioned himself under the bar ready for launch climb on dont i get straps miles glanced over his shoulder and grinned you bounce better than i do looking extremely dubious mark staffed his stunner back in his belt sidled up to miles and gingerly wrapped his arms and legs around miless body youd better hang on tighter than that the deceleration at the bottom is going to be severe and dont scream going down it would draw attention marks grip tightened convulsively miles checked once more for unwanted companythe tube was still emptyand thrust over the side their doubled weight gathered momentum terrifyingly they fell unimpeded in nearsilence for four storiesmiless stomach was floating near his back teeth and the sides of the lift tube were a smear of colorthen the rappelling spool began to whine resisting its blurring spin the straps bit and marks grip handtohand across miless collarbone began to pull apart miless right hand flashed up to clamp around marks wrist they braked to a demure stop a centimeter or two above the lift tubes bottom floor back in the belly of the synthacrete mountain miless ears popped the noise of their descent had seemed thunderous to miless exacerbated senses but no startled heads appeared in the openings above no weapons crackled miles and mark both nipped back out of the line of sight of the tube into the little foyer off the tidal barriers internal access corridor miles pressed the control to release his grappler and let the spool rewind the falling thread made no noise but the grappler unit clinked hitting bottom and miles flinched back that way said mark pointing right they jogged down the corridor side by side a deep growling vibration began to drown lighter sounds the pumping station that had been blinking and humming when miles had first passed that way was now at work lifting thames water to hightide sea level through hidden pipes the next station down previously dark and silent was now lit preparing to go into action mark stopped here where mark pointed each pumping chamber has an access hatch for cleaning and repairs we put him in there miles swore the pumping chamber was about the size of a large closet sealed it would be dark cold slimy stinking and utterly silent until the rush of rising water thrumming with immense force gushed in to turn it into a death chamber rushed in to fill the ears the nose the darkstaring eyes rushed in to fill the chamber up up not even one little pocket of air for a frantic mouth rushed through to batter and twist the body ceaselessly roiling against the thick unyielding walls until the face was pulped beyond recognition until with the tide the dank waters at last receded leavingnothing of value a clog in the line you breathed miles glaring at mark lent yourself to this mark wiped his palms together nervously stepping back youre herei brought you here he began plaintively i said i would isnt this a rather severe punishment for a man who never did you more harm than to snore and keep you awake agh miles turned his back rigid with disgust and began punching at the hatch lock controls the last step was manual turning the bar that undogged the hatch as miles pushed the heavy beveled door inward an alarm began to beep ivan ah the cry from within was nearly voiceless miles thrust his shoulders through flashed his handlight the hatch was near the top of the chamber he found himself looking down at the white smudge of ivans face half a meter below looking up you ivan cried in a voice of loathing staggering back and slipping in the slime no not him miles corrected me ah ivans face was lined exhausted almost beyond coherent thought miles had seen the same look on men who had been in combat too long miles tossed down his handydandy rappelling harnesshe shuddered recalling that hed almost decided not to include it when hed been kitting up back in the triumph and braced the spool ready to come up ivans lips moved in a mumble but he wrapped the harness sufficiently around his arms miles hit the spool control and ivan lifted miles helped him slither through the hatch ivan stood boots planted apart hands on knees supporting himself breathing heavily his green dress uniform was damp crumpled and beslimed his hands looked like dog meat he must have pounded and scratched scrabbled and screamed in the dark muffled and unheard miles swung the hatch back it clicked firmly he twirled the manual locking bar the alarm stopped beeping safety circuits reconnected the pump immediately began to thrum no greater noise penetrated from the pumping chamber than a monstrous subliminal hiss ivan sat down heavily and pressed his face to his knees miles knelt beside him in worry ivan turned his head and managed a sickly grin i think he gulped im going to take up claustrophobia for a hobby now miles grinned back and clapped him on the shoulder he rose and turned mark was nowhere in sight miles spat and lifted his wrist comm to his lips quinn quinn he stepped out into the corridor looked up and down it listened intently the faintest echo of running footsteps was fading in the distance in the direction opposite the barrayaraninfested watchtower little shit miles muttered to hell with him he rekeyed his comm for the air patrol sergeant nim naismith here yo sir ive lost contact with commander quinn see if you can raise her if you cant start looking for her i last saw her on foot inside the tidal barrier halfway between towers six and seven heading south yes sir miles turned back and helped pull ivan to his feet can you walk he asked anxiously yeah sure said ivan he blinked im just a little they started down the corridor ivan stumbled a bit leaning on miles then steadied i never knew my body could pump that much adrenalin or for so long hours and hours how long was i in there about miles glanced at his chrono less than two hours huh seemed longer ivan appeared to be regaining his equilibrium somewhat where are we going why are you wearing your naismithsuit is mlady all right they didnt get her did they no galen just snatched you this is an independent dendarii operation at present im not supposed to be downside just now destang ordered me to stay aboard the triumph while his goons were trying to dispose of my double to prevent confusion yeah well makes sense that way any little guy they see they know they can fire at ivan blinked again miles right said miles thats why were going this way instead of that way should i walk faster that would be nice if you can they picked up the pace why did you come downside asked ivan after a minute or two dont tell me youre still trying to save that graceless little copys worthless hide galen sent me an invitation engraved on your hide i dont have too many relatives ivan theyre of surprising value to me if only for their rarity they exchanged a glance ivan cleared his throat well so but youre on shaky ground trying to undercut destang sayif his hit squad is that closewheres galen alarm suffused his face galens dead miles reported shortly they were in fact just passing the dark cross corridor to the outer ledge where that body lay ah glad to hear it who did the honors i want to kiss his hand or hers i think youll have the chance in just a moment the quick tap of running footsteps as of a person with short legs was just audible from ahead around the curve of the corridor miles drew his stunner and this time i dont have to keep him arguing maybe quinns spooked him back this way he added hopefully he was getting extremely worried about quinn mark rounded the curve and skidded to a halt before them with a hopeless cry he turned stepped stopped turned again like an animal in a trap the right side of his face was streaked red his ear was edged with oozing yellowwhite blisters and the stench of burnt hair crept faintly through the air now what asked miles marks voice was high and stretched theres some painted lunatic back there after me with a plasma gun theyve taken over the next watchtower did you see quinn anywhere no miles said ivan in puzzlement our guys wouldnt carry plasma arcs on an antipersonnel mission like this would they not in the middle of a critical facility like thistheyd not want to risk damaging the machinery painted said miles urgently like how notnot face paint like a chinese opera mask by chance i dont knowwhat a chinese opera mask looks like panted mark but theywell onehad colors solid from ear to ear the ghemcommander no doubt miles breathed on formal hunt theyve upped the bid it seems cetagandans said ivan sharply their reinforcements must have finally arrived they must have picked up my trail at the shuttleport oh godand quinn went that way miles too turned in a circle and swallowed panic back to the pit of his stomach where it belonged it must not be permitted to rise to the level of his brain but you can relax mark they dont want to kill you the hell they dont he shouted there he is men and tried to blow my head off miless lips peeled back on a dirty grin no no he carolled soothingly merely a case of mistaken identity those people want to kill meadmiral naismith its just the ones on the other end of the tunnel who want to kill you of course he added jovially neither of them can tell us apart ivan made a derisive sputter back this way said miles decisively and led on at a run he swung into the transverse corridor and skidded to a halt before the outside access hatch ivan and mark galloped up behind miles stood on tiptoe and gritted his teeth according to the control readout the tide had now risen higher than the top of the hatch this exit was sealed by the sea chapter fifteen miles slapped his wrist comm channel open nim he called sir theres a cetagandan covert ops squad in tower seven strength unknown but they have plasma arcs yes sir came nims breathless voice we just found them where are you and what can you see i have a pair of soldiers outside each of the three tower entrances with a backup in the bushes in the parking area thecetagandans you say sirjust pumped some plasma blasts out the main corridor as we tried to enter anybody hit not yet were flat any sign of commander quinn yet no sir can you get a fix on her wrist comm its somewhere in the lower levels of this tower she doesnt respond and its not moving stunned dead was her wrist even still in her wrist comm no telling all right miles took a breath put in an anonymous call to the local police tell them theres armed men in tower sevenmaybe saboteurs trying to blow up the barrier make it convincingtry to sound scared no problem sir said nim earnestly miles wondered how nearly the plasma beam had parted nims hair until the constables arrive keep the cetagandans sealed in the tower stun anyone who tries to exit the locals can sort them out later put a couple of point men down in tower eight to seal that end have them work north and drive the cetagandans back if they try to exit south but i think theyll head north he put his hand over the comm and added to mark chasing you he lifted his palm and continued to nim as the police arrive pull back avoid contact with em but if you do get cornered go meekly were the good guys its those nasty strangers inside the tower with the illegal plasma arcs they should be after were just tourists who spotted something peculiar while out for an evening stroll you copy there was a strained grin in nims voice copy sir keep an observer in sight of tower six report when the police arrive naismith out copy sir nim out mark emitted a muffled moan and surged forward to grab miles by his jacket you idiot what are you doing call the dendarii backorder them to clear the cetagandans out of tower seven or i will he made to grab at miless wrist miles held him off and put his left hand behind his back ahah calm yourself theres nothing id like more than a game of stunner tag with the cetagandans since we outnumber thembut they have plasma arcs plasma arcs have more than three times the range of a stunner i dont ask my people to face that kind of tactical disadvantage without dire need if those bastards catch you theyll kill you how much more dire does it have to be but miles said ivan looking up and down the corridor doubtfully didnt you just trap us in the center of a pincers movement no miles grinned exhilarated i did not not while we own a cloak of invisibility come on he trotted back to the t intersection and turned right back toward the barrayaranheld tower six no mark balked the barrayarans might kill you by accident but theyll kill me on purpose the ones back there miles jerked his head over his shoulder would kill us both just to make sure the dagoola operation left the cetagandans more peeved with admiral naismith than i think you have grasped come on reluctantly mark followed ivan bringing up the rear miless heart pounded he wished he felt half as confident as his grin to ivan had suggested but mark must not be permitted to sense his doubt a couple of hundred meters of blank synthacrete jerked past as he ran on tiptoe trying to make as little noise as possible if the barrayarans had already worked their way this far down the tunnel they came to the last pumping station and still no sign of the lethal trouble ahead or behind this pumping station was quiescent again it would be another twelve hours to the next high tide if no unexpected surges came downstream it should stay shut down till then still miles was disinclined to leave it to chance and from the way ivan was shifting from foot to foot watching him with growing alarm hed better be able to offer a guarantee he began looking over the control panels raising one for a look within fortunately it was much simpler than say the control nexus for a jumpship propulsion chamber a cut here then there should disable this pump without lighting up boards in the watchtower he hoped not that anyone in the tower was likely to be paying much attention to their boards just this moment miles glanced up at mark i need my knife please unwillingly mark handed the antique dagger over and at a look from miles its sheath as well miles used the point to pop the hairfine wires his guess as to which ones were which seemed correct he tried to look like hed known it all along he did not hand the knife back when he was done he went to the pumping chamber hatch and opened it no beeping this time his gravitic grappler made an instant handle on the smooth inner surface last problem was that damn manual locking bar if some innocentor notsoinnocentcame along and gave it a twirlah no the same model of tensor field lever ally to the gravitic grappler that quinn had used to open the hatch to the ledge worked here miles blew a breath of relief through pursed lips he returned to the control panel facing the corridor and slapped on his fisheye scan at the end of a row of dials it blended in nicely he gestured toward the open hatch to the pumping chamber as inviting as a coffin all right everybody in ivan went white oh god i was afraid that was what you had in mind mark did not look much more thrilled than ivan miles lowered his voice softly persuasive look ivan i cant force you you can head on up the corridor and take the chance that your uniform will keep you from getting your brains fried by somebodys nervous reflex if you survive contact with destangs hit squad youll get arrested by the locals which probably wont be fatal but id rather you stuck with me he lowered his voice still further and didnt leave me alone with him oh ivan blinked as miles expected this appeal for help had more impact than logic demands or cajolery he added look its just like being in a tactics room its just like being in a trap have you ever been in a tactics room when the powers knocked out they are traps all that sense of command and control is an illusion id rather be in the field he smirked and jerked his head toward his double besides dont you think mark ought to get the chance to share your recent experience when you put it that way growled ivan it has a certain appeal miles lowered himself into the pumping chamber first he thought he could just hear distant footsteps scuffing in the corridor mark looked like he wanted to bolt but with ivan breathing down his neck he had little choice finally ivan with a gulp dropped beside them miles keyed on his hand light ivan the only one tall enough shoved the heavy hatch shut it was profoundly silent for a moment but for their breathing as they squatted knee to knee ivans swollen empurpled hands clenched and unclenched sticky with sweat and blood at least ynow they cant hear us cozy grunted miles pray our pursuers are as stupid as i was i ran past this place twice he opened the scanner case and set the receiver to project the northandsouth view of the stillempty corridor there was a very faint draft in the chamber miles noted anything more would foretell a rush of water through the lines and it would be time to bail out cetagandans or no cetagandans now what said mark thinly he looked like he felt trapped indeed sandwiched between the two barrayarans miles settled back against the slimy wet wall with a false air of ease now we wait just like a tactics room you spend a lot of time waiting in a tactics room if you have a good imagination itspure hell he keyed his wrist comm nim yo sir i was just about to call you nims uneven voice sounded like he was running or maybe crawling a police aircar just landed at tower seven were withdrawing through the park strip behind the barrier the observer reports the locals just entered tower six too have you got anything off quinns wrist comm it still hasnt moved sir has anyone made contact with captain galeni yet no sir wasnt he with you he left about the time i lost quinn last seen on the outside of the tidal barrier at about the midpoint id sent him to look for another way in ah report at once if anyone spots him yo sir damn another worry had galeni run into trouble cetagandan barrayaran or local had he been betrayed by his own state of mind miles now wished hed kept galeni by him as heartily as he wished hed kept quinn but they hadnt yet found ivan then miles hardly could have done otherwise he felt like a man trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle of live pieces that moved and changed shape at random intervals with tiny malicious giggles he unclenched his teeth mark was regarding him nervously ivan was hunkered down not paying much attention to anything by the way he was biting his lips locked in an internal struggle with his newwon claustrophobia there was a movement in the somewhat distorted degree scanner view of the corridor a man loping silently around the curvature from the south end cetagandan point man miles guessed though he wore civilian clothes he had a stunner not a plasma arc in his handapparently the cetagandans were now aware that the locals were on the scene in too great force to silence by a convenient murder and were now thinking of deescalating or at least decapitalizing the situation the cetagandan scouted up the corridor a few more meters then vanished back the way hed come a minute later movement from the north a pair of men tiptoeing along as quietly as a couple of gorillas of that size could move one of them was the numbskull whod managed to appear on a covert op still wearing his regulation service boots he too had exchanged his original weapon for a more demure stunner though his companion still carried a lethal nerve disruptor it looked like it really could be shaping up for a round of stunner tag ah the stunner weapon of choice for all uncertain situations the one weapon with which you really could shoot first and ask questions later holster your nerve disrupter thats right good boy miles murmured as the second man too switched weapons heads up ivan this could be the best show well see all year ivan glanced up his absorbed uncertain smile transmuting into something genuinely sardonic more like the old ivan oh shit miles destang will have your nuts for engineering this at present destang doesnt even know im involved hsh here we go the cetagandan point man had returned he made a comeon motion and was leapfrogged by a second cetagandan on the other end of the corridor beyond their view due to the curve the remaining three barrayarans came jogging that accounted for all the barrayarans that had been in the tower any outerperimeter backup was now cut off from them by the cordon of local police the barrayarans had apparently given up on their mysteriously vanished quarry and were in pullout mode hoping to exit via tower seven as quickly as possible without having to explain themselves to a bunch of unsympathetic earthmen the cetagandans who had actually witnessed the supposed admiral naismith run this way were still in hunting array though their rear guard was presumably closing up with the pressure from the locals coming on strong behind no sign of the rear guard yet no sign of quinn being dragged along as a prisoner miles didnt know whether to hope for that or not it would be very nice to know she was still alive but fiendishly difficult to extract her from the cetagandans clutches before the constables closed in leastcost scenario called for letting her be stunnedarrested with the mob of them and reclaiming her from the police at their leisurebut suppose some cetagandan goon decided in the heat of the final crunch that dead women couldnt talk miles jittered like a boiling kettle at the thought perhaps he should have jacked up ivan and mark and attacked the breakable leading the disabled and the unreliable in an assault on the unknown no but would he have done more done less for any other officer in his command was he so worried about his command logic being ambushed by his emotions that he was now erring in the opposite direction that would be a betrayal of both quinn and the dendarii the lead cetagandan darted into the line of sight of the lead barrayaran they both fired instantly and dropped each other in a heap stunner reflexes muttered miles s wonderful my god said ivan entranced to the point of wholly forgetting his hermetic enclosure its just like the proton annihilating the antiproton poof the remaining barrayarans strung out along the corridor flattened to the wall the cetagandan dropped to the floor and crawled to his downed comrade a barrayaran popped out into the corridor and blitzed him the cetagandans return shot going wide two of the four barrayarans hurried to the unconscious bodies of their mystery opponents one prepared to offer covering fire the other began checking them out weapons pockets clothing he naturally turned up no ids the baffled barrayaran was just pulling off a shoe to dissectmiles felt he would continue on to the body itself momentarilywhen a distorted amplified voice began booming down the corridor from their rear miles could not quite make out the echosplintered words but the sense of it was clearly here halt whats all this then one of the barrayarans helped another load up themstunned one for a shouldercarry it had to have been the biggest man whod been hit boots himself they were close enough to the fisheye that miles could make out the carriers legs shake slightly as he straightened and began staggering south under his burden two men taking the point before and the remaining one the rear guard behind the doomed little army had gone perhaps four steps when another pair of cetagandans appeared around the south curve one was firing his stunner back over his shoulder as he ran his attention was so divided he did not see his partner go down to the barrayaran point mens stunner fire until he tripped over the sprawling body and fell headlong he kept his clutch on his own stunner turned his fall into a controlled roll and snapped off return fire one of the barrayaran point men went down the barrayaran rear guard leapfrogged forward around the burdened middle man and helped his partner zap the rolling cetagandan then ran forward with him hugging the wall unfortunately they overshot the arc of concealment at the same moment as a blast of massed unaimed stunner fire from beyond the curvature was clearing the corridor for some forward push from the unknownspolice combat team miles deduced both from the tactic and the feet that the cetagandan had been firing in that direction men met energy wave with predictable results the remaining barrayaran stood in the corridor bending under the weight of his unconscious comrade and cursing steadily his eyes squeezed shut as if to shut out the sheer overwhelming embarrassment of it all when the police appeared behind him he clumped in a circle to face them and raised his hands in surrender as best he could flipping his empty palms out and letting his stunner clatter to the floor ivans voice was suffused i can just see the vid call to commodore destang now uh sir we ran into this little problem will you come get me he may prefer to desert commented miles the two converging police squads came within a breath of repeating the mutual annihilation of their fleeing suspects but managed to get their true identities communicated just in time miles was almost disappointed still nothing could go on forever at some point the corridor would have become impassable due to the piles of bodies and the havoc trail off according to the typical senescence curve of a biological system choked on its own waste it was probably too much to ask that the police clear themselves as well as the nine assassins out of the path to escape miles was clearly in for another wait blast it creaking miles stood stretched and leaned against the wall with folded arms it had better not be too long a wait as soon as the police combat squad called the allclear the bomb squad and tidal authority techs would appear and start going over every centimeter of the place the discovery of miless little company was inevitable but not lethal as long asmiles glanced down at mark hunkering at his feetno one panicked miles followed marks gaze to the scanner display where the police were checking over the stunned bodies and scratching their heads the captured barrayaran was being properly surly and uninformative as a covert ops agent he was conditioned to withstand torture and fastpenta too there was little the london constables were likely to get out of him with the methods at their disposal and he obviously knew it mark shook his head watching the chaos in the corridor whose side are you on anyway havent you been paying attention asked miles this is all for you mark looked up at him sharply scowling why why indeed miles eyed the object of his fascination he could see how a clone could get to be an obsession and vice versa he jerked up his chin in the habitual tic apparently unconsciously mark did the same miles had heard weird tales of strange relationships between people and their clones but then anyone who deliberately went out and had a clone made must be kinky to start with far more interesting to have a child preferably with a woman who was smarter faster and betterlooking than oneself then there was at least a chance for a bit of evolution in the clan miles scratched his wrist mark after a moment scratched his arm miles refrained from deliberately yawning better not start anything he couldnt stop so he knew what mark was maybe it was more important to realize what he was not mark was not a duplicate of miles himself despite galens best efforts was not even the brother of an onlychilds dreams ivan with whom miles shared clan friends barrayar private memories of the everreceding past was a hundred times more his brother than mark could ever be it was just possible he had underappreciated ivans merits botched beginnings could never be replayed though they could bemiles glanced down at his legs seeing in his minds eye the artificial bones withinrepaired sometimes yeah why ivan put in at miless lengthening silence what piped miles dont you like your new cousin wheres your family feeling one of you is more than enough thanks your evil twin here ivan made a hornedfinger gesture is more than i can take besides you both keep locking me in closets ah but at least i called for volunteers yeah i know that one i want three volunteers you you and you you used to bully me and your bodyguards daughter around that way even before you were in the military back when we were little kids i remember born to command miles grinned briefly marks brows lowered as the apparently tried to imagine miles as playground bully to the very large and healthy ivan its a mental trick miles informed him he studied mark who squatted uncomfortably drawing his head down into his shoulders like a turtle against his gaze was this evil confusion to be sure distortion of spirit as well as bodythough galen could have been only a little more awful as a childs mentor than miless own grandfather but to be properly sociopathic one must be selfcentered to an extreme degree which did not seem to describe mark he had hardly been permitted to have a self at all maybe he was not selfcentered enough are you evil miles asked lightly im a murderer arent i sneered mark what more dyou want was that murder i thought i sensed some element of confusion he grabbed the nerve disrupter i didnt want to give it up it went off marks face was pale in memory white and deeply shadowed in the sharp sideways illumination cast by miless handlight stuck to the wall i meant it to go off ivans brows rose but miles ruthlessly did not pause to fill him in unpremeditated perhaps suggested miles mark shrugged if you were free began miles slowly marks lips rippled free me what chance the police will have found the body by now no the tide was up over the rail the sea has taken it might be three four days before it surfaces again if it surfaces again and a repellent object it would be by then would captain galeni wish to reclaim it have it properly buried where was galeni suppose you were free free of barrayar and komarr free of me too free of galen and the police free of obsession what would you choose who are you or are you only reaction never action mark twitched visibly suck slime one corner of miless mouth curved up he scuffed his boot through the gook on the floor stopped himself before he began doodling with his toe i dont suppose youll ever know as long as im standing over you mark spat the dregs of his hatred youre the free one me miles was almost genuinely startled ill never be as free as you are right now you were yoked to galen by fear his control only equalled his reach and both were broken together im yoked byother things waking or sleeping near or for makes no difference yet barrayar can be an interesting place seen through other eyes than galens the mans own son saw the possibilities mark smirked sourly staring at the wall you making another play for my body for what its not like you have the height myourgenes intended or something and my bones are all on their way to becoming plastic anyway no advantage there id be in reserve then a spare in case of accidents miles threw up his hands you dont even believe that any more but my original offer still stands come with me back to the dendarii and ill hide you smuggle you home where you can take your time and figure out how to be real mark and not imitation anybody i dont want to meet those people mark stated flatly by which he meant his mother and father miles caught that without difficulty though ivan was clearly losing the thread i dont think they would behave inappropriately after all theyre already in you on a fundamental level you ah cant run away from yourself he paused tried again if you could do anything what would it be marks scowl deepened bust up the clone business on jacksons whole hm miles considered its pretty entrenched still what dyou expect of the descendants of a colony that started as a hijacker base naturally they developed into an aristocracy ill have to tell you a couple of stories about your ancestors sometime that arent in the official histories so mark had picked up that much good from his association with galen a thirst for justice that went beyond his own skin even if including it as lifegoals go it would certainly keep you occupied how would you go about it i dont know mark appeared taken aback by this sudden practical turn blow up the labs rescue the lads good tactics bad strategy theyd just rebuild you need more than one level of attack if you figured out some way to make the business unprofitable it would die on its own how mark asked in turn lets see theres the customer base unethical rich people one could hardly expect to persuade them to choose death over life i suppose a medical breakthrough offering some other form of personal life extension might divert them killing them would divert them too growled mark true but impractical in the mass people of that class tend to have bodyguards sooner or later one would get you and it would be all over look there must be forty points of attack dont get stuck on the first one to come to mind for example suppose you returned with me to barrayar as lord mark vorkosigan you could expect in time to amass a personal and financial power base complete your educationreally fit yourself out to attack the problem strategically not just ah fling yourself off the first wall you come to and go splat i will never said mark through his teeth go to barrayar yeah and it seems like all the upperpercentile women in the galaxy are in complete agreement with you you may be smarter than you know miles sighed under his breath quinn quinn quinn where are you in the corridor the police were now loading the last unconscious assassins onto a float pallet the break would come soon or not at all ivan was staring at him miles realized youre completely loony ivan stated with conviction what dont you think its time somebody took those jacksons whole bastards on sure but i cant be everywhere but i could support the project miles glanced at mark if youre all done trying to be me that is are you mark watched the last of die assassins get wafted away you can have it its a wonder youre not trying to switch identities with me his head swivelled toward miles in suddenly renewed suspicion miles laughed painfully what a temptation ditch his uniform walk into a tubeway and disappear with a credit chit for half a million marks in his pocket to be a free man his eye fell on ivans grimy imperial dress greens symbol of their service you are what you dochoose again no barrayars ugliest child would choose to be her champion still not crawl into a hole and be no one at all speaking of holes it was high time to crawl out of this one the last of the police combat team was marching away past the curve of the corridor after the float pallet tidal techs would be all over the place shortly better move fast time to go miles said shutting down the scanner and retrieving his handlight ivan grunted relief and reached up to pull the hatch open he boosted miles through miles in turn tossed him a line from his rappelling spool as before panic flooded marks face for a moment looking up at miles framed in the exit as he realized why he might be last his expression became closed again as miles lowered the line miles plucked his scanner fisheye and returned it to its case and keyed his wrist comm nim status report he whispered weve got both cars back in the air sir about a kilometer inland the police have cordoned off your area the place is crawling with em all right anything from quinn no change give me her exact coordinates inside the tower nim did so very good im inside the barrier near tower six with lieutenant vorpatril of the barrayaran embassy and my clone were going to attempt to exit via tower seven and pick up quinn on the way or at least miles swallowed past a stupidly tightened throat find out what happened to her hold your present station naismith out they pulled off their boots and padded south down the corridor hugging the wall miles could hear voices but they were behind them the t intersection was now lit miles held up his hand as they approached oozed to the corner and peeked around a man in tidal authority coveralls and a uniformed constable were examining the hatch their backs were turned miles waved mark and ivan forward they all flitted silently past the tunnel mouth there was a police guard stationed in the lift tube foyer at the base of tower seven miles boots in one hand and stunner in the other bared his teeth in frustration so much for his optimistic hope of exiting without leaving a trace no help for it maybe they could make up in speed what they were going to lack in finesse besides the man now stood between miles and quinn and thus deserved his fate miles aimed his stunner and fired the constable collapsed they floated up the tube this level miles pointed silently the corridor was brightly lit but there were no subtle peoplesounds that miles could hear he paced off the meters that nim had read out to him and stopped before a closed door marked utility his stomach was turning over suppose the cetagandans had arranged a slow death for her suppose the minutes miles had spent so cool and sensible hiding out had made all the difference the door was locked the control had been buggered miles ripped it apart shorted it out and heaved the door open manually nearly snapping his splayed fingers she lay in a tumbled heap too pale and still miles fell to his knees beside her throat pulse throat pulsethere was one her skin was warm her chest rose and fell stunned only stunned only stunned he looked up at a blurred ivan hovering anxiously swallowed and steadied his ragged breathing it had after all been the most logical possibility chapter sixteen they paused at the side entrance of tower seven to pull their boots back on the park strip lay between them and the city spangled with white sparks and green patches along the illuminated walks dark and mysterious between miles estimated the run to the nearest bushes and triangulated the police vehicles scattered about the parking areas i dont suppose you have your hip flask with you miles whispered to ivan if i had id have emptied it hours ago why i was just wondering how to explain three guys dragging an unconscious woman through the park at this hour of the night if we sprinkled quinn with a little brandy we could at least pretend to be taking her home from a party or something stunner hangovers enough like the real thing itd be convincing even if she started to wake up groggy i trust she has a sense of humor well whats a little character assassination among friends better than the real thing urgh anyway i dont have my flask are we ready i guess no hold it another aircar was dropping down civilian but the police guard at the main tower entrance went to meet it an older man got out and they hurried back to the tower together now ivan took quinns shoulders and mark took her feet miles stepped carefully over the stunned body of the policeman who had been guarding this exit and they all doubletimed it across the pavement toward cover god miles panted ivan as they paused in the greenery to scan the next leg why dont you go in for little petite women itd make more sense now now she only weighs about double a full field pack you can make it no shouting from behind no hurrying pursuers the area closest to the tower was actually probably the safest it would have been scanned and swept before now and pronounced clean of intruders police attention would be concentrated at the parks border which they would have to cross to reach the city and escape miles stared into the shadows with all the artificial lighting about his eyes were not darkadapting as well as hed like ivan stared too i cant spot any coppers in the bushes he muttered im not looking for police miles whispered back what then mark said a man wearing face paint fired at him have you seen anybody wearing face paint yet ah maybe the police nabbed him first before we saw the others but ivan looked over his shoulder maybe markwhat color was the face what pattern mostly blue with white and yellow and black kind of swirling slashes a ghemlord of middle rank right a centurycaptain if you were supposed to be me you should be able to read ghemmarkings forward and backward there was so much to learn anyway ivando you really want to just assume a centurycaptain highly trained sent from headquarters formally sworn to his hunt really let some london constable sneak up and stun him the others were just ordinary soldiers the cetagandans will bail em out later a ghemlordd die before hed let himself be so embarrassed hell be a persistent bugger too ivan rolled his eyes wonderful they wound through a couple hundred meters of trees shrubbery and shadows the hiss and hum of traffic on the main coastal highway came faintly now the pedestrian underpasses were doubtless guarded the highspeed highway was fenced and strictly forbidden to foot traffic a synthacrete kiosk cloaked with bushes and vines hopeful of concealing its blunt utility squatted near the main path to the pedestrian underpass at first miles took it for a public latrine but a closer look revealed only one blank locked door the spotlights that should have illuminated that side were knocked out as miles watched the door began to slide slowly aside a weapon in a pale hand glittered faintly in the blackness mile aimed his stunner and held his breath the dark shape of a man slipped out miles exhaled captain galeni he hissed galeni jerked as though shot crouched and scurried toward them joining them in their concealment on hands and knees he swore under his breath discovering as miles had that this grouping of ornamental shrubs had thorns his eyes took instant inventory of the ragged little group miles and mark ivan and elli ill be damned youre still alive id sort of been wondering about you too miles admitted galeni lookedgaleni looked bizarre miles decided gone was the blank witnessing stillness that had absorbed ser galens death without comment he was almost grinning electric with a slightly offcenter exhilaration as if hed overdone some stimulant drug he was breathing heavily his face was bruised mouth bloody his swollen hand flexed on his weaponlast seen weaponless he was now carrying a cetagandan militaryissue plasma arc a knife hilt stuck out of his boot top have you ah run into a guy wearing blue face paint yet miles inquired oh yes said galeni in a tone of some satisfaction what the hell happened to you sir galeni spoke in a rapid whisper i couldnt find an entrance in the barrier near where id left you i spotted that utilities access over there he jerked his head toward the kiosk and thought there might be some power optic or water line tunnels back to the barrier i was halfright there are utility tunnels all under this park but i got turned around underground and instead of coming out in the barrier i ended up coming out a port in the pedestrian crossing under the channel highway where i found guess who miles shook his head police cetagandans barrayarans close it was my old friend and opposite number from the cetagandan embassy ghemlieutenant tabor it actually took me a couple of minutes to realize what he was doing there playing outerperimeter backup to the experts from hq same as i would have been doing if i hadnt been galeni snickered confined to quarters he was not happy to see me galeni went on he couldnt figure what the hell i was doing there either we both pretended to be out viewing the moon while i got a look at the equipment he had packed in his groundcar he may have actually believed me i think he thought i was drunk or drugged miles politely refrained from remarking i can see why but then he started getting signals from his team and had to get rid of me in a hurry he pulled a stunner on mei duckedhe didnt hit me square on but i lay low pretending to be more disabled than i was listening to his half of the conversation with the squad in the tower and hoping for a chance to reverse the situation the feeling was just coming back to the left half of my body when your blue friend showed up his arrival distracted tabor and i jumped them both miless brows rose how the devil did you manage that galenis hands were flexing as he spoke i dont quite know he admitted i remember hitting them he glanced at mark it was nice to have a clearly defined enemy for a change upon whom miles guessed galeni had just unloaded all the accumulated tensions of the last impossible week and this mad night miles had witnessed berserkers before are they still alive oh yes miles decided he would believe that when hed had a chance to check for himself galenis smile was alarming all those long teeth gleaming in the darkness their car said ivan urgently their car agreed miles is it still there can we get to it maybe said galeni there is at least one police squad in the tunnels now i could hear them well have to chance it easy for you to say muttered mark truculently you have diplomatic immunity miles stared at him seized by berserker inspiration his finger traced over an inner pocket in his grey jacket mark he breathed how would you like to earn that hundredthousand betan dollar credit chit there isnt any credit chit thats what ser galen said you might reflect on what else he was wrong about tonight miles glanced up to check what effect mention of his fathers name had on galeni a cooling one apparently some of the drawn and inward look returned to his eyes even as miles watched captain galeni are those two cetagandans conscious or can they be brought to consciousness at least one is they may both be by now why witnesses two witnesses ideal i thought the whole point of sneaking off instead of surrendering was to avoid witnesses said ivan plaintively i think miles overrode him i had better be admiral naismith no offense mark but you dont have your betan accent quite right you dont hit your terminal hs quite hard enough or something besides youve practiced lord vorkosigan more galenis eyebrows were going up as he grasped the idea he nodded thoughtfully though his face as he turned his gaze on mark was unreadable enough to make mark flinch indeed you owe us your cooperation i think he added even more softly you owe me this was not the moment to point out how much galeni owed mark in return though a brief meeting of their eyes convinced miles that galeni at least was perfectly conscious of the twoway flow of that grim debt but galeni would not fumble this opportunity sure of his alliance admiral naismith said into the tunnel then lead on captain the cetagandan groundcar was parked in a shadowy spot under a tree a few meters to their left as they rose up out of the lift tube from the pedestrian subway to the barrier park still no police guard on this end the end toward the park galeni had informed them had a twoman squad though they had not risked themselves rechecking that fact the scurry through the tunnels had been hectic enough barely dodging a police bomb squad the spreading plane tree shielded the car from view of most of the closed at this hour shops and apartments lining the other side of the narrow city street no insomniac peeping out an upper window could have witnessed galenis encounter miles hoped the highway above and behind them was walled and blind miles still felt exposed the groundcar bore no embassy identification nor any other unusual features to draw attention bland neither old nor new a little dirty definitely covert ops miles raised his brows and whistled silently at the fresh dents in the side about the size of a mans head and the blood spattered on the pavement in the dimness the red color was fortunately subdued wasnt that a bit noisy miles inquired of galeni pointing to the dents mm not really dull thumps nobody yelled galeni after a quick look up and down the street and a pause for a lone groundcar to whisper past raised the mirrored bubble canopy two shapes huddled in the back seat hitched up with their own equipment lieutenant tabor in civilian clothes blinked over his gag the man with the blue face paint sat slumped next to him miles checked one eyelid and found the eye still rolled back he rummaged in the front for a medkit ivan loaded and settled elli and took the controls mark slid in beside tabor and galeni sandwiched their captives from the other side at a touch from ivan the canopy sighed down and locked itself jamming them all in seven was a crowd miles leaned over the back of the front seat and pressed a hypospray of synergine first aid for shock against the centurycaptains neck it might bring him around and certainly would not harm him at this present peculiar moment miless wouldbe killers life and continued health was a most precious commodity as an afterthought miles gave elli a dose too she emitted a heartening moan the groundcar rose on its skirts and hissed forward miles exhaled with relief as they put the coast behind them turning into the maze of the city he keyed his wrist comm and said in his flattest betan accent nim yo sir take a fix on my comm follow along were all done here we have you sir naismith out he settled ellis head in his lap and turned to watch tabor over the seat back tabor was staring back and forth from miles to mark beside him hello tabor said mark carefully coached in his best barrayaran vor tonesdid it really sound that snidehows your bonsai tabor recoiled slightly the centurycaptain stirred staring through slitted but focusing eyes he tried to move discovered his bonds and settled backnot relaxed but not wasting energy on futile struggle galeni reached over him and loosed tabors gag sorry tabor but you cant have admiral naismith not here on earth anyway you can pass the word up your chain of command hes under our protection until his fleet leaves orbit part of the agreed price for his helping the barrayaran embassy find the komarrans who had lately kidnapped some of our personnel so back off tabors eyes shifted back and forth as he spat out his gag worked his jaw and swallowed he croaked youre working together unfortunately growled mark a mercenary carolled miles gets it where he can you made a mistake hissed the centurycaptain focusing on the admiral when you took contract against us at dagoola you can say that again agreed miles cheerily after we rescued their damned army the underground stiffed us did us out of half our promised pay i dont suppose cetaganda would like to hire us to go after them in turn eh no unfortunately i cannot afford personal vengeance at present anyway or i would not have taken employment with he bared his teeth in an unfriendly smile at mark who sneered back these old friends so you really are a clone breathed tabor staring at the legendary mercenary commander we thought he fell silent we thought he was yours for years said markaslordvorkosigan ours mouthed tabor in astonishment but the present operation confirmed his komarran origin mark finished we have an agreement miles spoke up as if unsettled by marks tone glaring from mark to galeni you cover me till i leave earth we have an agreement said mark as long as you never come any closer to barrayar you can have bloody barrayar ill take the rest of the galaxy thanks the centurycaptain was blurring out again but fighting it squeezing his eyes shut and breathing in a controlled pattern concussion miles judged in his lap ellis eyes popped open he stroked her curls she emitted a ladylike burp saved by the synergine from the more usual poststun vomiting she sat up looked around saw mark the cetagandans ivan and shut her jaw with a snap concealing her disorientation miles squeezed her hand ill explain later his smile promised she lowered her brows at him in exasperation youd better she lifted her chin poised before the enemy even in the teeth of her own bewilderment ivan turned his head inquiring out of the side of his mouth of galeni so what do we do with these cetagandans sir drop them off somewhere from how high up there is i think no need for an interplanetary incident galeni was wolfishly cheerful taking his tone from miles is there lieutenant tabor or do you wish the local authorities to be told what the ghemcomrade was really trying to do in the barrier last night no i thought not very well they both need medical treatment ivan lieutenant tabor unfortunately broke his arm and i believe his ah friend has a concussion among other things your choice tabor shall we drop you off at a hospital or would you prefer treatment at your own embassy embassy croaked tabor clearly cognizant of possible legal complications unless you want to try and talk your way out of an attempted murder charge he counterthreatened only assault surely galenis eyes glittered tabor smiled most uneasily looking as if hed like to edge away if only there was room whatever neither of our ambassadors would be pleased quite it was getting near dawn traffic was beginning to increase ivan circled a couple of streets before spotting a deserted autocab stand that did not have a queue of waiting patrons this seaside suburb was far from the embassy district galeni was quite solicitous helping unload their passengersbut he didnt toss the codekey to the centurycaptains hand and foot bonds to tabor until ivan began to accelerate back into the street ill have one of my staff return your car this afternoon galeni called back as they sped off he settled in his seat with a snort as ivan sealed the canopy and added under his breath after we go over it think that charadell work asked ivan in the short rangeconvincing the cetagandans that barrayar had nothing to do with dagoolamaybe maybe not sighed miles but for the main security issuethere go two loyal officers who will swear under chemohypnotics that admiral naismith and lord vorkosigan are without question two separate men thats going to be worth a great deal to us but will destang think so asked ivan i do not believe said galeni distantly staring out the canopy that i give a good goddamn what destang thinks miles found himself in mental agreement with that sentiment but then they were all very tired but they were all here he looked around savoring the faces elli and ivan galeni and mark all alive all brought through the night to this moment of survival almost all where do you want to be dropped off mark miles asked he glanced through his lashes at galeni expecting an objection but galeni offered none with the jettisoning of the cetagandans galeni had lost the hyperadrenal edge that had been carrying him he looked drained he looked old miles did not solicit an objection be careful what you ask for you might get it a tube station said mark any tube station very well miles called up a map on the cars console up three streets and over two ivan he got out with mark as the car settled to the pavement in the dropoff zone back in a minute they walked together to the entrance to the down lift tube it was still nightquiet here in this district only a trickle of people flowing past but morning rush would be starting soon miles opened his jacket and drew out the coded card from the tense look on marks face he was anticipating a nerve disrupter in the style of ser galen right to the last mark took the card and turned it over in wonder and suspicion there you go said miles if you with your background and this bankroll cant disappear on earth it cant be done good luck but what do you want of me nothing nothing at all youre a free man for as long as you can keep so we will certainly not be reporting galens ah semiaccidental death mark slipped the chit into his trouser pocket you wanted more when you cant get what you want you take what you can get as you are finding he nodded toward marks pocket marks hand closed over it protectively what is it that you want me to do mark demanded what are you setting me up for did you really take that jacksons whole garbage seriously what do you expect me to do you can take it and retire to the pleasure domes of mars for as long as it lasts or buy an education or two or three or stuff it down the first waste chute you pass im not your owner im not your mentor im not your parents i have no expectations i have no desires rebel against thatif you can figure out howlittle brother miles held his hands palmout and stepped back mark swung into the lift tube never turning his back why not he yelled suddenly baffled and furious miles threw back his head and laughed you figure it out he called the tube field took him and he vanished swallowed into the earth miles returned to the friends who waited for him was that smart elli breaking off a rapid fillin from ivan worried as he settled in beside her just letting him go like that i dont know sighed miles if you cant help dont hinder i cant help him galens made him too crazy i am his obsession i suspect ill always be his obsession i know all about obsessions the best i can do is get out of his way in time he may calm down without me to react against in time he maysave himself his own weariness flooded in elli was warm against him and he was very very glad of her reminded he keyed his wrist comm and dismissed nim and his patrol back to the shuttleport well ivan blinked after a full minute of wipedout silence from all present where now dyou two want to go back to the shuttleport too yeah breathed miles and flee the planet desertion is not practical im afraid destang would catch up with me sooner or later anyway we may as well all go back to the embassy and report the true report theres nothing left to lie for is there he squinted trying to think for all of me theres not rumbled galeni i do not care for doctored reports anyway eventually they become history embedded sin you know i didnt mean it to work out that way miles said to him after a silent moment the confrontation last night a damned sorry weak apology that sounded for getting the mans father blown away did you imagine you controlled it omniscient and omnipotent nobody appointed you god vorkosigan ghostly faint one corner of his mouth turned up im sure it was an oversight he leaned back and closed his eyes miles cleared his throat back to the embassy then ivan ah no rush drive slowly i wouldnt mind seeing a last bit of london eh he leaned on elli and watched the early summer dawn creep over the city time and all times jumbled and juxtaposed like the light and shadow between one street and the next when they all lined up in a row in galenis security office at the embassy miles was put in mind of the set of chinese monkeys his dendarii chief of staff tung kept on a shelf in his quarters ivan was unquestionably seenoevil from the tight set of galenis jaw as he returned commodore destangs glower he was a prime candidate for speaknoevil that left hearnoevil for miles standing between them but putting his hands over his ears probably wouldnt help much miles had expected destang to be furious but he looked more disgusted the commodore returned their salutes and leaned back in galenis station chair when his eye fell on miles his lips thinned in a particularly dyspeptic line vorkosigan miless name hung in the air before them like a visible thing destang regarded it without favor and went on when i finished dealing with a certain investigator reed of the london municipal assizes at this morning i was determined that only divine intervention could save you from my wrath divine intervention arrived at in the person of a special courier from imperial hq destang held up a data disk marked with the imperial seal between his thumb and forefinger here are the new and urgent orders for your dendarii irregulars since miles had passed the courier in the cafeteria this was not wholly unexpected he suppressed a surge forward yes sir he said encouragingly it appears that a certain free mercenary fleet operating in the far sector iv area supposedly under contract to a subplanetary government has slipped over the line from guerrilla warfare to outright piracy their wormhole blockade has degenerated from stopping and searching ships to confiscations three weeks ago they hijacked a tau cetan registered passenger vessel to convert into a troop transport so far so good but then some bright soul among them hit on die idea of augmenting their payroll by holding the passengers for ransom several planetary governments whose citizens are being held have fielded a negotiating team headed by the tau cetans and our involvement sir sector iv was a long way from barrayar by any measure but miles could guess what was coming ivan looked wildly curious among the passengers happened to be eleven barrayaran subjectsincluding the wife of minister for heavy industries lord vorvane and her three children as the barrayarans are a minority of the two hundred sixteen people being held barrayar was of course denied control of the negotiating team and our fleet has been denied permission by their unfriendly governments to cross three of the necessary wormhole nexuses on the shortest route between barrayar and sector iv the next shortest alternate route would take eighteen weeks to traverse from earth your dendarii can arrive in that local space area in less than two weeks destang frowned thoughtfully ivan looked fascinated your orders of course are to rescue alive the emperors subjects and as many other planetary citizens as possible and to deal such punitive measures as you can compatible with the first goal sufficient to prevent the perpetrators from ever repeating this performance since we ourselves are in the midst of critical treaty negotiations with the tau cetans we dont wish them to become aware of the source of this unilateral rescue effort if ah anything goes wrong your method of achieving these goals appears to be left totally to your discretion youll find all the intelligence details hq had up to eight days ago in here he handed the data disk across at last miless hand closed over it itchily ivan now looked envious destang produced another object which he handed to miles with a little of the air of a man having his liver torn out the courier also delivered yet another credit chit for eighteen million marks for your next six months operating expenses thank you sir ha when youre done youre to report to commodore rivik at sector iv headquarters on orient station destang finished with luck by the time your irregulars next return to sector ii i will have retired yes sir thank you sir destang turned his eye on ivan lieutenant vorpatril sir ivan stood to attention with his best air of eager enthusiasm miles prepared to protest ivans complete innocence ignorance and victimhood but it turned out not to be necessary destang contemplated ivan for a moment longer and sighed never mind destang turned to galeni who stood stiffleggedand stiffnecked miles guessed having beaten destang back to the embassy that morning they had all washed the two embassy officers had changed to clean uniforms and they had all filed laconic reports which destang had just seen but no one had slept yet how much more garbage could galeni absorb before reaching his explosive limit captain galeni said destang on the military side you stand charged with disobeying an order to remain confined to your quarters since this is identical to the charge that vorkosigan here has managed to so luckily evade this presents me with a certain problem of justice theres also the mitigating factor of vorpatrils kidnapping his rescue and the death of an enemy of barrayar are the only two tangible results of last nights activities all else is speculation improvable assertions as to your intentions and state of mind unless you choose to submit to a fastpenta interrogation to clear up any lingering doubts galeni looked revulsed is that an order sir galeni miles realized was about two seconds away from offering to resign his commissionnow when so much had been sacrificedhe wanted to kick him no no wild defenses poured through miless mind fastpenta is degrading to the dignity of an officer sir or even if you dose him you must dose me tooits all right galeni i abandoned dignity years ago except that miless idiosyncratic reaction to fastpenta made that a less than useful offer he bit his tongue and waited destang looked troubled after a silence he said simply no he looked up and added but it does mean that my reports and yours vorkosigans and vorpatrils will all be bundled up together and sent to simon illyan for review i will refuse to close the case i didnt arrive at my rank by shying away from military decisionsnor by involving myself gratuitously with political ones your loyalty like the fate of vorkosigans clone has become too ambiguously political a question im not convinced of the longrange viability of the komarr integration schemebut i wouldnt care to go down in history as its saboteur while the case is pending and in the absence of evidence of treason youll resume your routine duties here at the embassy dont thank me he added glumly as miles grinned ivan choked back an outloud laugh and galeni looked fractionally less black it was the ambassadors request you are all dismissed to your duties miles squelched the impulse to run before destang changed his mind he returned destangs salute and walked normally with the others toward the door as they reached it destang added captain galeni galeni paused sir my condolences the words might have been pulled out of destang with pliers but his discomfort was perhaps a measure of their sincerity thank you sir galenis voice was so devoid of inflection as to be deathly but in the end he managed a small acknowledging nod the locks and corridors of the triumph were noisy with returning personnel the final placement of equipment and repairs by tech teams and the loading of the last supplies noisy but not chaotic purposeful and energetic but not frantic the absence of frantic was a good sign considering how long theyd been on station tungs tough cadre of noncoms had not permitted routine preparations to slide till the last minute miles with elli at his back was the center of a hurricane of curiosity from the moment he stepped on boardwhats the new contract sir the speed with which the rumor mill cranked out speculation both shrewd and absurd was amazing he sent the speculators on their way with a repeated yes we have a contractyes were breaking orbit just as soon as youre ready are you ready mister is the rest of your squad ready then maybe youd better go assist em tung miles hailed his chief of staff the squat eurasian was dressed in civilian gear carrying luggage you just now back im just now leaving didnt auson get hold of you admiral ive been trying to reach you for a week what miles pulled him aside ive turned in my resignation im activating my retirement option what why tung grinned congratulate me im getting married stunned miles croaked congratulations ahwhen did this happen on leave of course shes actually my second cousin once removed a widow shes been running a tourist boat up the amazon by herself since her husband died shes the captain and the cook too she fries a moo shu pork to kill for but shes getting a little olderneeds some muscle the bulletshaped tung could certainly supply that were going to be partners hell he went on when you finish buying out the triumph we can even afford to dispense with the tourists you ever want to try waterskiing on the amazon behind a fiftymeter hoversloop son stop by and the mutant piranhas could eat what was left no doubt the charm of the vision of tung spending his sunset years watchingsunsets from a riverboat deck with a buxommiles was sure she was buxomeurasian lady on his lap a drink in one hand and scarfing down moo shu pork with the other was a little lost on miles as he contemplated a what it was going to cost the fleet to buy out tungs share of the triumph and b the huge tungshaped hole this was going to leave in his command structure gibbering hyperventilating or running around in small circles were not useful responses instead miles essayed cautiously ah you sure you wont be bored tung damn his sharp eyes lowered his voice and answered the real question i wouldnt be leaving if i didnt think you could handle it youve steadied down a lot son just keep on like youve been he grinned again and cracked his knuckles besides you have an advantage not shared by any other mercenary commander in the galaxy whats that miles bit tung lowered his voice still further you dont have to make a profit and that and his sardonic grin was as close as cagey tung was ever likely to admit that he had long ago figured out who their real employer was he saluted as he left miles swallowed and turned to elli well call a meeting of the intelligence department in half an hour well want to get our pathfinders en route as quickly as possible ideally we want to put a team inside the enemy organization before we arrive miles paused as he realized he was now looking into the face of the most wily pathfinder in his fleet for peoplesituations as versus terrainsituations which called for the talents of a certain lieutenant christof to send her ahead out of reach into dangerno nowas compellingly logical quinns best offensive talents were largely wasted bodyguarding it was merely an accident of history and security that threw her into that defensive job so often miles forced his lips to move on as if never tempted to illogic theyre mercenaries some of our group ought simply to be able to join up if we can find someone to convincingly simulate the low criminalpsychotic minds of these pirates private danio passing in the corridor paused to salute thanks for bailing us out sir i really wasnt expecting that you wont regret it i swear miles and elli looked at each other as he lumbered on hes all yours said miles right said quinn next have thorne pull everything there is off the earth comm net on this hijacking incident before we quit local space there might be an odd angle or two not apparent to imperial hq he tapped the data disk in his jacket pocket and sighed marshalling his concentration for the task ahead at least this should be simpler than our late vacation on earth he said hopefully a purely military operation no relatives no politics no high finance straightup good guys and bad guys great said quinn which are we miles was still thinking about the answer to that one when the fleet broke orbit
