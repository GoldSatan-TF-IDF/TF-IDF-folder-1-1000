jonathan kellerman evidence book in the alex delaware series to faye chapter i tell the truth they lie im strong theyre weak im good theyre bad this was a zero job but doyle was getting paid why anyone would shell out fifteen bucks an hour three hours a day five times a week to check out the empty shell of a richidiot monsterhouse was something hed never get the looksee took fifteen minutes if he walked slow rest of the time doyle sat around ate his lunch listened to cheap trick on his walkman thinking about being a real cop if his knee hadnt screwed up the company said go there he went disability all run out he swallowed parttime no benefits paying to launder his own uniform one time he heard a couple of the other guys talking behind his back gimps lucky to get anything like it was his fault his blood level had been which wasnt even close to illegal that tree had jumped out of nowhere gimp made doyle go all hot in the face and the chest but he kept his mouth shut like he always did one day he parked the taurus on the patch of dirt just outside the chainlink tucked his shirt tighter seven am quiet except for the stupid crows squawking richidiot neighborhood but the sky was a crappy milky gray just like in burbank where doyles apartment was nothing moving on borodi lane as usual the few times doyle saw anyone it was maids and gardeners rich idiots paying to live here but never living here one monstermansion after another blocked by big trees and high gates no sidewalks either what was that all about every once in a while some tuckedtight blonde in rodeo drive sweats would come jogging down the middle of the road looking miserable never before ten that type slept late had breakfast in bed massages whatever laying around in satin sheets getting waited on by maids and butlers before building up the energy to shake those skinny butts and long legs bouncing along in the middle of the road some rollsroyce comes speeding down and kaboom wouldnt that be something doyle collected his camouflagepatterned lunch box from the trunk made his way toward the threestory plywood shell the third being that idiot castle thingthe turret unfinished skeleton of a house that wouldve been as big as a as a disneyland castle fantasyland doyle had done some pacing figured twenty thousand square feet minimum twoacre lot maybe two and a half framed up and skinned with plywood for some reason he could never find out why everything stopped and now the heap was all gray warping striped with rusty naildrips crappy gray sky leaking in through rotting rafters on hot days doyle tucked himself into a corner for shade out behind in the bulldozed brown dirt was an old andy gump accidentally left behind chemicals still in the john the door didnt close good and sometimes doyle found coyote scat inside sometimes mouse droppings when he felt like it he just whizzed into the dirt someone paying all that money to build fantasyland then just stopping go figure hed brought a good lunch today roast beef sandwich from arbys too bad there was nothing to heat the gravy with opening the box he sniffed not bad he moved toward the chainlink swing gate what the stupid thing was pulled as wide as the chain allowed which was about two two and a half feet easy for anyone but a fat idiot to squeeze through the chain had always been too long to really draw the gate tight making the lock useless but doyle was careful to twist it up make it look secure when he left each day some idiot had monkeyed with it hed told the company about the chain got ignored what was the point of hiring a professional when you didnt listen to his advice sidling through the gap he rearranged the chain nice and tight leaving his lunch box atop rawconcrete steps he began his routine standing in the middle of the first floor saying hello and listening to his voice echo hed done that first day on the job liked the echo kinda like honking in a tunnel now it was a habit didnt take long to see everything was okay on the first floor space was huge big as a as a some rooms framed up but mostly pretty open so you had clear views everywhere like peeking through the skeleton bones of some dinosaur in the middle of what wouldve been the entry hall was a humongous swooping double staircase just plywood no railings doyle had to be careful all he needed was a fall screw up some other body part here we go pain with every step stairs creaked like a mother but felt structurally okay you could just could imagine what it would be like with marble on it like a big castle staircase nineteen steps each one killed the second floor was just as empty as the first big surprise stopping to rub his knee and take in the western treetop view he continued toward the rear stopped again kneaded some more but it didnt do much good continuing to the back he reached the smaller staircase thirteen steps but real curvy a killer tucked behind a narrow wall you had to know where to find it whoever had paid for all this was some rich idiot who didnt appreciate what he had if doyle had a hundredtha twohundredth of something like this hed thank god every day hed asked the company who the owner was they said dont pry climbing the curvy staircase every step crunching his knee the pain riding up to his hip he began counting out the thirteen stairs like he always did trying to take his mind off the burning in his leg when he called out nine he saw it oh jesus heart thumping mouth suddenly dry as tissue paper he backed down two steps reached along the right side of his gear belt touching air now he was the idiot thered been no gun for a long time not since he stopped guarding jewelry stores downtown company gave him a flashlight period and it was in the trunk of the taurus he forced himself to look two of them no one else one good thing about the turret it was round mostly open to the sky nowhere to hide doyle kept looking felt his guts heave the way they were lying him on top of her her legs up one hooked around his back it was pretty clear what theyd been doing before doyle felt short of breath like someone was choking him struggling to regain his air he finally succeeded reached for his phone right in his pocket at least something was going okay chapter milo calls me in when the murders interesting sometimes by the time i get involved the bodys gone if the crime scene photos are thorough that helps if not it can get even more interesting this scene was a threeminute drive from my house and intact two bodies wrapped around each other in a sick parody of passion milo stood to the side as a coroners investigator clicked off shots we exchanged quiet heys milo s black hair was slicked down haphazardly and his green eyes were sharp his clothes looked sleptin his pallid pitted complexion matched the smoggray sky june gloom in la sometimes we pretend its ocean mist i studied the bodies from a distance stepping as far back as i could careful not to touch the curving plywood wall how long have you been here an hour you dont get to this zip code too often big guy location location location the coroners investigator heard that and glanced back a tall pretty squareshouldered young woman in an olivegreen pantsuit she took a long time with the camera kneeling leaning crouching standing on tiptoe to capture every angle just a few more minutes lieutenant milo said take your time the killspot was the third floor of a construction project on borodi lane in holmby hills massive frameup of an intended mansion the entry big enough to seat a symphony orchestra the killspot looked like some sort of observation room or the turret of a castle massive was the rule in holmby a whole different universe than my white box above beverly glen but walking distance id driven because sometimes milo likes to think and make calls while i take the wheel a few rafters topped the turret but most of the intended roof was open space breeze blew in balmy but not enough air movement to mask the smell of wet wood and rust mold and blood and excreta male victim on top female victim pinned beneath him very little of her showing his black designer jeans were rolled to midcalf one of her smooth tan legs hooked around his waist brown pumps in place on both her feet final embrace or someone wanting it to look that way what i could see of the womans hands were splayed limp flaccidity of death that made sense but the leg propped up didnt fit how had it stayed in place postmortem the mans legs were well muscled coated with curls of fine blond hair black cashmere sweater for him blue dress for her i craned to see more of her couldnt catch anything but dress fabric some kind of shiny jersey hiked above her hips the mans hair was longish light brown wavy a neat ruby hole stippled by black powder punctuated the mastoid bulge behind his right ear blood ran down his neck slanted toward the right continued onto the plywood floor long dark strands of her hair fanned wide on the floor not much blood around her i said wouldnt her legs have relaxed the ci still photographing said if rigors come and gone id think so she worked at the crypt on mission road in east la had managed to maintain the rosycheeked glow of a habitual hiker lots of outdoor death scenes late twenties to early thirties rusty hair tied in a high ponytail clear blue eyes a farm girl working the dark side putting the camera aside she got down low she used two hands to lift the mans midsection gingerly peered through the resulting twoinch space the wraparound leg collapsed like a folding chair improperly set yup looks like she was propped lieutenant looking back at milo for confirmation her hands still wedged between the bodies he said could be the ci raised the male victim a bit higher studied lowered him with tenderness the investigators ive seen are generally like that respectful swimming in more horror than most people encounter in a lifetime never growing jaded she stood brushed dust off her trousers shes not wearing panties and his penis is out obviously theres no erection so theres no way theyd stay connected but there is a crusty whitish stain on her thigh so even if they were posed looks like they consummated kneeling again she pulled the mans crumpled jeans high enough to search his pockets okay here we go hefting a blue vinyl wallet secured by a snap button milo gloved up no car keys nope just this let me tag and then you can go through it i didnt see any civilian cars parked on the street maybe it started as a jacking and everyone ran up here and these two started getting it on i was thinking an intended jacking the bad guy changed his mind milo shrugged sorry lieutenant for shooting my mouth at this point said milo ill take anything i can get im new on the job she said im sure theres nothing i can teach youguess its time to flip them ill do a liver temp and see if we can close in on tod moments later she was cleaning off the meat thermometer milo said and probably somewhere during the last twelve hours im sure the docs will be able to tell you more the male victims face was a husk of the handsome smiling visage on the drivers license in the blue vinyl wallet desmond erik backer thirtytwo years old last february five eleven one seventy brown and brown apartment on california avenue in santa monica an address that put it three blocks from the beach the wallet held two hundred dollars in fifties and twenties two gold credit cards a couple of wheatcolored business cards a photo of a little blond girl around two wearing a lacetrimmed redvelvet dress tag heuer sport watch around left wrist no other jewelry no pale stripe of skin suggesting a wedding band removed discreetly or otherwise milo showed me the handwritten inscription on the back of the childs portrait samantha mo no one else wouldve caught the twitch in his eyelid he flipped to a business card desmond e backer aia gemein holman and cohen architects main street in venice nice watch he said checking the back of the tag for an inscription blank checking the leather label on the jeans zegna the ci said but her dress looks a little lowrent dont you think she inspected the label made in china polyester short and snug could she be a working girl anythings possible milo returned the wallet as he bagged took notes he continued to study the bodies no sign of the female victims purse generic gold hoops in her ears three similarly nondescript silver bangles around one slender wrist light makeup he got down close to her right ear as if wanting to impart some secret she shampooed recently i can still smell it the ci said i also smelled it suave i use it myself expensive she chuckled with my pay scale growing solemn as she took in the dead womans pale face even degraded an extremely nicelooking woman with a taut fullbreasted somewhat lowwaisted body a smooth oval countenance and huge eyes slightly downslanted brown in life filmed the color of dirty pavement by death pink gloss on slack lips clean nails no polish the cis probing had revealed no bullet holes anywhere on her body but the sclera of the womans eyes were marbled and speckled by hemorrhage and her long neck was swollen and bruised and bisected by an angry magenta line the ci pointed out the crusty milky blotch on her thigh checked fingernails doesnt look like anything under there poor thing is it okay if i pull her dress down do that said milo soon as our techies get here and print them and the room you can transport any idea how long thatll take you in a hurry we do have another call but no problem lieutenant your drivers are paid by the hour yes sir anything else nothing comes to mind ms squinting to make out her id badge rieffen lara youre sure theres nothing else i can do for you lieutenant im open to suggestions lara well im just feeling my way around dont want to miss anything youre doing fine okay then to me nice to meet you detective milo said this is dr delaware hes a consulting psychologist psychologist she said for a profile milo knows i rate profiling just below reading tea leaves and political polling something like that glancing at the rickety spiral framework that led down to the second floor he said were okay here lara go take your next call ci rieffen gathered up her stuff and hurried down when her footsteps had stopped echoing he pulled a panatela from a pocket of his forlorn lintcolored windbreaker jammed it in his mouth but didnt light up as his jaw bunched the cigar tilted upward he stared at the bodies some more got on the phone and searched for desmond backers registered vehicle fiveyearold bmw i he put a bolo on it with instructions to transport but not search until processed forensically pocketing his cell he said caught in the act but maybe staged to reconstruct half smile the little death followed by the big one he studied the sky no casings says our boy was careful unless hes nostalgic and likes revolvers no bullet holes anywhere but the one in mr backers head and the diameter says probably small caliber with her purse gone and no vehicle in sight id say a jacking might indeed be part of it except backers wallet is full of cash and that watch is serious money i said maybe this was about her and the purse has nothing to do with robbery such as this early im better with questions than answers join the club now all i need to do is find out who the hell she is any insights wont hold you to them no sign of struggle and a contact wound says the bad guy achieved control early on that could be the result of good planning my bet is they were stagedtheres almost a theatrical quality to the position something personal stranglings about as up close and personal as it gets i said control with a smallcaliber gun shoot him first shes too freaked out to resist just lays there and gets choked out maybe there were two killers repositioning them he said that could be a statementjealous rage exboyfriend follows them here watches them do it goes bananas if this was a trystspot its pretty unromantic no wine no weed no chocolate not even a blanket maybe the bad guy took all that with him getting rid of the evidence or wanting a trophy or both leaving them this way could also be a way of demeaning them further which could mean jealousy or a sadistic psychopath maybe i said but what doesnt fit that is the lack of overkill her not being posed with her legs spread theres something subtle here possibly victimspecific taking her purse points to her being the main target wanting to hold on to a part of her he circled the turret took in the view to the west lit up and blew out a blue stream that ribboned up through the rafters hot date under the stars why here specifically backer was an architect maybe hed worked the site maybe he had a key brought her up here to impress her i designed the taj mahal baby so do me if so backers involvement was at least two years ago because thats when the job went on ice and he wouldnt need a key the chains long enough to swing the gate wide that from the rentacop who discovered the bodies according to him he reported it to his bosses but they shined him on which is consistent with security being a joke one guy seven to ten am nothing on weekends and the most lethal weapon they let him use is a flashlight whyd construction stop guard asked about that too was told to mind his own business i said an abandoned site would suit backer if he liked to party here with this woman or others given the discrepancy between his clothing budget and hers id start with lowerpaid employees of his firm office romance with the receptionist unfortunately shes got a possessive significant other one thing the guard says hes never seen evidence of other trysts were talking the nervouslooking skinny fellow with the limp doyle bryczinski applied to the department got into a serious ta messed up his leg milo made a new friend i said whats his favorite food begrudging me the occasional helpful citizen god forbid bryczinski came across nervous to you when i drove up he watched me when i made eye contact he pretended he hadnt been watching id also be remiss if i didnt point out that you just described bryczinski as a wannabe cop who sounds extremely frustrated about the lack of control in his life guy like that girlfriend throws him over for someone cuter smoother richer in the exact spot you brought her yourself the guy tries to help all of a sudden hes a prime suspect like the song goes i said suspect the one youre with he took a long sour look at the bodies made his way toward the rickety spiral staircase lets get to know ol doyle a little better chapter doyle bryczinski said oh man they look worse worse than when you found them said milo bryczinski turned away theyre more like people and less like i dunno it was like unreal when i found them i mean helluva way to start your day doyle my day starts at four thirty said bryczinski take care of my mother before her attendant shows up at six then i got to drive straight out here head shake then i find this moms sick shes all kinds of sick used to live with my brother then he moved to nome thats alaska he licked his lips small fragilelooking man nervous as a rabbit without a gun hed have trouble controlling anything before bringing him up here milo ran background bryczinski had accumulated several unpaid traffic tickets the disabling traffic accident was a onecar which usually means dui but bryczinskis blood alcohol had fallen short of the criterion when ask to come up for a second viewing he said sure then how come we could use your help doyle the guards limp turned the threestory climb into a plodding ordeal milo let him stand there for a while getting an eyeful of the bodies sweat beaded bryczinskis hairline his back curved in an unhealthy way forty but he looked fifty with wispy sandy hair gone mostly gray and a narrow face sunken in all the wrong places five seven one thirty soaking wet small cheap flashlight hanging from a belt drawn to the last hole no one was serious about keeping this site secure anyway he said youre sure you dont know them bryczinskis eyes narrowed why would i now that you can see their faces i mean i see em but i sure dont know em backing away toward the wall just before he made contact milo took hold of his arm bryczinski tensed hey sorry doyle we need to print everything im sure you know the drill oh yeah sure milo said this kind of situation i have to ask all kinds of questions youre up here more than anyone meaning if anyone comes by messes the place up youd be in the best position to know im here but i aint up here much the guard stamped his foot lightly plywood thrummed once i check up here i dont come back dont like the view im working got no time for views so no one ever messes around up here like who anyone said milo like some homeless guy youre thinking it was one of those idiots they surprised him he went nuts anythings possible doyle well that hasnt happened for a long time said bryczinski chancing another look at the bodies a homeless i mean youve had problems with squatters nah not really about a year agomaybe longer year and a half i come in one morning and find dirt not up here on the second floor someone tracked in soil person dirt you know what i mean someone used the place for a toilet right in the middle of floor two foot of the stairs gross also there was food wrapperstaco bell wax cups greasy paper beans and sauce stains on the floor someone was eating mexican then crapping all over what a mess said milo i called the company they said clean it up with what theres no water one broken hose bib out back but no pressure i said screw that why bother anyway whats to stop the idiot from coming back the next day and doing the same thing did he nope but a little later maybe a month later some mexicans came in and ate again thank god they didnt dump how do you know they were mexicans taco bell wrappers and too much for one person all kinds of people eat at taco bell yeah well said bryczinski all kinds of people dont leave behind mexican money idiot coins pesos whatever i checked them out not worth a thing so i gave them to my niece shes four any other intruders nah thats it no evidence anyone ever came up here to fool around nope that second time i figured some illegal working on one of the other richidiot houses around here had nowhere to go so he slept here big surprise to me is why more idiots dont break in i showed you that chain do you want to know about animals what kind of animals critters said bryczinski savoring the word i find animal dirt all the time rats mice coyotes i know its coyotes because their dirt is these little shriveled things look like dry vienna sausage i seen plenty of coyote dirt back when i lived in fallbrook avocado country said milo huh dont they grow avocados in fallbrook my dad was in the navy we lived in an apartment ah any visitors during the day doyle never place is dead bryczinski flinched so to speak dont get bothered by this but like i said i need to ask routine questions of everyone associated with a homicide the guards eyes narrowed what what were you doing last night youre saying im in some kind of suspicion because i found them not at all doyle i need to be thorough bryczinski swiped his brow with a uniform sleeve whatever last night i was sleeping i get up at four mom wakes me up i hit the hay by nine youre moms sole caretaker idiot cat sure cant do much milo laughed the guard said glad someone thinks its funny milo watched him hobble down the stairs wincing and the diagnosis is i said no shortage of pentup anger but probably not enough physical strength and smarts to pull it off even with a gun you find any kind of link between him and either one of your victims ill change my mind he claims to have only a flashlight but he couldve packed ill have uniforms check the entire property for discarded weapons bryczinskis prints are on file because of the security job maybe theyll show up where they shouldnt be like on the floor right where theyre laying another glance at the bodies cute couple tough luck for ken and barbie i said played with like dolls then discarded he reread desmond backers business card up for venice well take your gondola chapter gemein holman and cohen werent advertising skimpy oxidizediron address numerals were placed low on the buildings façade barely a foot above the sidewalk under that ghc concepts this was the south end of main street where calculated edgy nudges random doyourthing and parkings a challenge milo said use that pay lot on me he flashed his shield to the attendant had to shell out seven bucks anyway the walk back took us past boutiques featuring the kind of clothes you never see anyone wearing sunny weekday morning in venice only a scatter of pedestrians but a piercing parlor was doing brisk business back in his acting days the governor had bought up chunks of main street accumulating rental income that helped finance his new hobby maybe he owned the architectural firms avantgarde charmer a pair of isosceles triangles jousted with each other in precarious tilt the larger one pumpkinorange stucco the other bluish green aluminum a black shroud of solar panel capped the roof a cement trough running along the base was crowded with horsetails planttops lopped with neurosurgical care the triangles overlapped just enough to provide walkspace for the nonobese milo s been working on his weight at a relatively svelte two thirty or so there was no need to turn sideways but he did so anyway bodymemory runs long inside was a courtyard roofed by corrugated metal bordered by an inchdeep rectangular pond too shallow for fish maybe microorganisms frolicked the front door was an oxidizediron slab milo s knock produced no sound no bell he said business is either real good or real bad pounding harder evoked a sorry thud he said this is gonna hurt and poised a foot to kick before he made contact the slab swung inward silently catching him off balance a gorgeous woman with a shaved head watched him stabilize what is it all the warmth of a voicesimulator she was thirtyfive or so with some sort of teutonic accent hemp disks the size of saucers dangled from exquisitely shaped ears nothing overtly medical about her hairlessness lashes and brows were dark and luxuriant the eyes below them a spectacular aqua her skull was smooth round and tan stubbled whiteblond as if rubbed in salt like a minimal frame on a painting the absence of coiffure emphasized everything else about her so did a clinging white tank top ectodermal black tights red spikeheeled boots milo flashed the badge police maam she said and wed like to speak to someone about desmond backer des is in trouble the worst kind of trouble ms desmond did something illegal desmonds dead dead she said and you want to come in she marched back inside left us to follow swinging her hips and stepping high the interior was one big space unfurnished but for a black desk and a rolling chair in a corner white walls high windows carpeting that matched the bald beautys hemp earrings skylights in odd places some of them partially blackened by the solar panel others bore the streaks and splotches of moisture damage the bald woman sat behind the desk laid her palms flat charcoalgray manicure some kind of mesh effect on the nails i have no chairs for you were fine standing maam something criminal happened to des sorry to say maam mr backer was murdered that is bad again the lack of inflection what can you tell us about him ms helga gemein youre one of the partners there are no partners we are dissolved as of when six weeks ago dont ask why why helga gemein was in no mood to joke who murdered des thats what were trying to learn said milo what can you tell us about him he worked here from when we started the firm which was twenty months ago he was a good draftsman with soso design skills he was hired because he was green fresh out of school pardon green no no no helga gemein scolded green environmental des got his degree at cal poly san luis obispo wrote a thesis on bioenvironmental synchrony i thought of the warring triangles out front water so shallow it would evaporate within days the green approach didnt work out said milo of course it works why would you say that the firm dissolved people dont work out said helga gemein modern humanitypostindustrial humanity is a criminal biomechanical disruption of the natural order that is the point of green architecture reshaping sustainable balance between components of the life force of course said milo so what kind of projects did the firm do we planned our mission statement no actual buildings helga gemeins lovely mouth screwed up tight in germany architecture is a subset of engineering the emphasis is upon proper theory and flawless planning we saw ourselves as green consultants what do these questions have to do with des he was murdered at a construction site maam an unfinished house in holmby hills reciting the address on borodi lane so i was just wondering we never intended to involve ourselves with private housing this was largescale housing ms gemein threestory mansion on a couple of acres mr backer was found on the third floor that sounds unspeakably vulgar id ego flashing of the penis id rather design a yurt when did des backer leave the firm when it dissolved did he find another job i wouldnt know he never asked for a reference he packed up his desk and left was he angry why would he be losing his job jobs come and go while he was here what was he involved with des wanted to be involved with the kraeker whats that maam helga gemeins look said if you needed to ask you didnt deserve to know the kraeker is a performance art gallery scheduled to be built in basel by the year my plan is to submit a proposal for heat and light sustainability that would synchronize with the art itself des asked to be assigned to the preliminary drawings obviously a project of that scope would help his career but it never got that far that is not clear once i clean up the mess my partners have left me i may very well assemble another team returning to europe will be a welcome change had enough of la quite is there anything you can tell us about des that could be helpful his sexual appetite was conspicuous milo blinked by conspicuous you mean what i mean said helga gemein is that des was highly motivated toward maximal screwing was his death sexual in nature how do you know that about him maam if youre asking in that peculiarly prudish american way if i speak from personal experience the answer is no my information comes from the other women who worked here each of them discovered that des had requested to screw her requested des was polite he always said please you didnt fire him why would i thats pretty blatant workplace harassment policeman she said one can only be harassed if one contextualizes herself as helpless everyone said yes des is a handsome man in an immature way how exactly did you learn about all this ms gemein that is a voyeuristic question my job can get that way she touched a hemp earring there was a staff meeting des was away from the office on something or another and judah cohen was in milan so no men if you knew anything about women youd know that plus alcohol loosens tongues one of them had seen another go off with des after work and wondered out loud it didnt take long to compare notes everyone agreed he was attentive and reasonably endowed but lacking in creativity i said how many women are we talking about three four women at the meeting but only three were propositioned if you are asking in that american way if i am homosexual i am not though i am not opposed to homosexuality on moral grounds why did i not screw des he did not appeal to me he never came on to you blinking she caressed the top of her head we maintained a professional relationship milo took out his pad could i please have the other womens names helga gemein smiled i will talk slowly number one sheryl passant our receptionist waiting until hed copied number two bettina sanfelice a dull girl who served as an intern number three marjorie holman your former partner correct des didnt see the need for a professional relationship with her marjorie and i disagree on many levels marjorie has no problem mixing business with pleasure youre being simplistic policeman everything is business and everything is pleasure it is marjorie who fails to integrate the two what do you mean she insists on drawing arbitrary boundariescreates imaginary rules so that she can delight in violating them forbidden fruit said milo marjorie is quite the nibbler is she married yes now i must go milo asked her for addresses and phone numbers of the three women marjorie holmans she knew by heart for the others she consulted a blackberry now i will walk you out he showed her the female victims death shot helga gemein examined the image what is this a woman who died along with mr backer so it was sexual why do you say that des with a woman what else could it be milo smiled maybe a meaningful spiritual relationship helga gemein headed for the door we tagged along i said how well did des do his job adequately before we dissolved id contemplated letting him go why the pathetic state of our planet demands better than adequate chapter helga gemein marched through the courtyard and continued north on main good stamina considering those stilettos said milo what a charmer dont think of her as hostile i said just philosophically consistent whats the philosophy humanity is a blot on nature thats kind of psychopathicand she didnt react emotionally to backers death hang out with her no need for airconditioning personal coolant i said theres a green concept for you backer jumps anything with ovaries but doesnt come on to her maybe the jealousy you felt at the scene was anger at being rejected woman scorned those stilettos would set off clacks on plywood he sighted up main crossed his arms over his barrel chest asking women to screw if backers libido was really that overthetop it expands the potential suspect base to every hetero male in la wonderful he scanned the addresses gemein had provided the receptionist and the intern are both out in the valley but naughty ms holman lives right here in venice linnie canal thats about a mile in i said we could walk oh sure and im gonna wear spandex bicycle shorts finding the nearest entrance to the canal district and manipulating the byzantine network of oneways and deadends by car turned a geographic hop into a halfhour excursion once we got within eyeshot of linnie canal the closest parking spot was two blocks east the canals are a century old the product of a feverish mind devolving to yet another patch of highpriced real estate the visionary in question an eccentric named abbot kinney had dug and dredged sinuous waterways dreaming of replicating the original island city a hundred years later most of the quirky original bungalows had been replaced by closeset mcmansions high above footpaths a squaredoff hedge echoed the curves of the canal nice place to stroll but no pedestrians in sight the water was green and opaque flecked with hyacinth and the occasional bit of trash ducks floated by pausing to bob for food a seagull faked a divebomb changed course landed on a nearby roof and squawked a nasal political diatribe maybe he felt the same as helga gemein about humanity milo said always liked it here to visit not to live whats wrong with living here too hard to escape marjorie holmans residence was two steeply pitched stories of whiteclapboard blueshuttered chalet eaves bearded by jigsawed trim a porthole window over the door suggesting the kind of seafood joint where deepfry orders are placed at the counter not exactly postmodern muttered milo whatever the hell that means a wide concrete ramp sloped up to a wooden deck rattan furniture was distributed randomly potted geraniums sat on the rail one corner was taken up by a mammoth gaspowered barbecue with more controls than my seville s dashboard the goofylooking dolphin riding the wall above the grill hadnt weathered well aging flipper on quaaludes french doors made up the wall facing the canal all that glass meant lots of energy loss no solar panels in sight a bell on a leather thong in lieu of an electric buzzer was the sole nod to conservation milo tugged the thong a deep male voice hollered hold on seconds later a man rolled out in a motorized wheelchair a navy tshirt was stretched tight over rhino shoulders and abdominal bulk khaki trousers were barely defined by sticklegs he looked to be sixty or so with a full head of coarse gray hair and a bushy beard to match help you police sir is marjorie holman in police whats going on someone who worked for ms holmans firm was murdered youre kidding rapid eyeblink who desmond backer des you knew him he came over a few times to show marjie drawings murdered thats grotesque how did it happen he was shot mr holman ned a meaty hand shot forward his lips turned down marjies going to be extremely upset by this i should be the one to tell herwhy dont you guys come on in he reversed the wheelchair into the house motored across a big bright room to the bottom of an ornate oak staircase the entire ground floor was open space that maximized light sparse furnishings allowed easy turns of the chair ned holman cupped a hand to his mouth honey could you please come down what is it please come down marjie everything all right ned footsteps thumped im fine just come down hon marjorie holman had bounced halfway down the stairs when she saw us and stopped tall and angular with a bluegray pageboy she had long limbs and a smallish face dominated by owlish blackframed glasses a baggy orange blouse and straightleg jeans said little about the body beneath barefoot pink nails whats going on theyre the police its about des backer he was murdered a hand flew to her mouth oh my god sorry hon said ned holman this was starting out as a nice day marjorie holman shook our hands limply went into the kitchen and fortified herself with a tall pour of sapphire gin from a frosted blue bottle two long swallows brought a flush to her cheeks she stared out the window at a coral tree in flaming bloom her husband rolled to her side rubbed the small of her back im okay ned turning and facing us can i get you something wheeling himself to the fridge ned holman grabbed a handle retrofitted low yanked the door open pulled out a bottle of budweiser a quick fingerflick popped the cap he caught it in one hand rolled it between sausage fingers milo said no thanks both holmans drank he drained his beer first she made it through half the gin before setting the glass down i need some airyoull be okay if i take a breather ned of course she motioned us out of the house hurried down the ramp turned right on the footpath additional gulls had assembled in the water a grumpy quorum marjorie holman set out at a slow pace walked close to the hedge brushing her hand along the top im still in shock my god when did this happen last night maam he was carrying business cards we just talked to ms gemein helga she said that must have been interesting how so ms holman oh come on she said if you talked to her youre not seriously asking that she is an interesting woman do you suspect her should we ms holman well she said helga is devoid of normal human emotion but i cant say she ever displayed any hostility to des in particular she was hostile in general utterly asocial thats part of why were no longer partners what exactly happened to des he was shot by an unknown assailant good god maam if theres something to know about helga gemeinor anyone elsenows the time to tell us plainly put helga is a weirdo detective but do i have a specific reason to think shes a murderer no i dont what i can tell you is shes a fraud so anything she says is suspect the firm never got off the ground because she conned me and judah cohenthe third partner conned how there was no there there no real interest in green architecture to use your terminology there was alleged interest said marjorie holman in germany architecture is a branch of engineering and thats what helga is a structural engineer with precious few skills at that she doesnt have to work because her father owns shipping companies gets to play intellectual and global thinker judah and i met her at a conference in prague where she claimed to have all sorts of backing for an integrated approach to numerous projects judah and i are veterans wed both made partner at decentsized firms but felt it was time for a change helga claimed to already own office space right here in venice all we had to do was show up and use our brains later we found out shed sublet the building had been chronically late with the rent everything else she told us was baloney as well all she wanted to do was talk about ideas judah and i had both burned bridges were stuck its a mess in architecture youre gehry or meier or youre drafting plans for room additions in san bernadino her nostrils flared helga tired of the game walked in one day and announced we were kaput quote unquote theatrical said milo you better believe it that explain the shaved head probably said marjorie holman when we met her in prague she had long blond hair looked like elke summer she comes here shes yul brynner head shake shes one big piece of performance art i hate her guts wish i could tell you she was murderous but i honestly cant say that tell us about des nice kid we hired him right out of school he graduated at thirty i said late bloomer thats this generation adolescence lasts forever ive got two sons around dess age and both of them are still trying to figure it out milo said the murder took place at a construction site on borodi lane in holmby hills that ring a bell no sorry in holmby it would have to be a house your basic thirtyroom mcpalace had des found a job at another firm if he did he wasnt carrying their card if he wasnt working there i cant imagine what hed be doing a plastic kayak lay across the walkway we bypassed it milo said in terms of a personal relationship between yourself and mr backer there was none ms gemein claimed otherwise maam marjorie holmans hands curled but her stride didnt break ms holman nasty bitch nasty lying bitch maam sharp inhalation i have nothing to apologize for were not judging ms holman of course you are judgings your job only as it applies to murder maam marjorie holmans laughter was brittle unsettling well then were all peachydandy here because whatever i did or didnt do with des has nothing to do with murder were more interested in did than didnt maam she didnt answer milo let it ride and the three of us kept walking five houses later she said you met my husband hes been that way for six years im not going to make tawdry excuses but neither am i going to apologize for having needs of course maam dont patronize me detective im not a moron six more houses she picked up speed a tear track darkened her cheek once thats all it was ned doesnt know and theres no reason to tell him i agree maam he was tender it was almost like being with another woman not that id know about that it was a crazy thing to do i regret it but at the time drying her tears with her sleeve one of my sons is the same age as des and if you dont think that made me feel sleazy youre wrong it was never going to happen again and i was not going to torture myself she stopped short touched milo s wrist i want to make one thing clear detective des did not exploit me nor am i some desperate cougar it just happened one time said milo you want me to take a lie detector fine just as long as ned doesnt find out all we want to do is find out who killed des i cant help you with that did anyone at the firm have conflict with him no not helga i wish i could say yes but not even her she told us she was never intimate with des are you shocked i doubt helga has the capacity for intimacy she also said des slept with every other woman at the firm i cant speak to that she said you could ms holman that she learned about all of this because you and ms sanfelice and ms passant talked about it openly at a staff meeting marjorie holman rocked on her heels walked with her head down oh jesus she let out a strange giggle and threw up her hands martinis and estrogen what can i say staff meeting with alcohol staff meeting at a restaurant without getting into details if you could tell us where you and des trysted why is that your business were searching for patterns ms holman what kind of patterns des frequenting construction sites she went pale maam this is humiliating another brittle laugh you want the dirty details fine one night three four months ago des and i were working late looking back he probably planned it hed heard about the kraekerthats an art gallery in switzerland we were supposedly going to be involved in another of helgas fantasies she never even filled out the preliminary formsyou dont care about that you want sleaze des wanted me to put in a good word for him with helga i said i would we were hungry so we went out to dinner des said he had a construction site he wanted me to see because of its design if that makes a pattern fine milo said where was the site oh lord santa monica near the water gardens off twentysixth street and colorado des said a film studio was beginning a project that was aiming for complete sustainability down to blackwater and graywater management it was after dark we drove over in separate cars i had no reason to think it would turn outwhen i got there i was confused it was just an open empty lot there was a trailer set up as an office nothing educational designwise and i was peeved at des for dragging me out there he said hold on theres something you need to see and took me behind the trailer her hair hadnt moved but she smoothed it i suppose i was ready to be led by the nose des took hold of my shoulders and said i know this is wrong and it may cost me my job but i find you crushingly attractive ive been thinking about you since i met you and god help me id love to screw you she straightened her collar adjusted her necklace as if primping for a portrait that sounds vulgar in the retelling but you had to be there guys trust me it was alluring ten more minutes of strolling produced an easytoverify alibi for the previous night the holmans had attended an experimental music concert at disney hall with another couple followed by a late dinner at providence on melrose seafood orgy guys after wed gorged ourselves silly we headed clear across town to vibrato in beverly glen thinking wed catch some jazz but the show was over so we went home i went to bed and ned stayed up reading the way he usually does he lives for books and language hes an esteemed linguist used to teach at the u used to do all sorts of things frown that was my pathetic play for sympathy not that i need any its poor des who does what can you tell us about dess background said milo personal not professional we never talked about things like that never talked much period he was a lovely boy gentle considerate i cant see why anyone would want to kill him milo showed her the dead womans picture whosmy god shes do you recognize her ms holman absolutely not thrusting the photo back the other women at the firmsheryl and bettina single or married single reason i ask maam is we need to check out irate boyfriends husbands she stared at us ned not a chance for a husband to be irate he needs to be aware and ned isnt even if he did find out hes not exactly in a position to do anything about it is he the flippant cruelty of the last sentence hung in the air speaking of which id best be getting back gentlemen ned might need freshening up chapter marjorie holman sprinted up the ramp to her deck milo said freshening him up hubby as houseplant some nest of vipers ol des got himself into we headed back to the car crossed a footbridge above still green water i said sounds like ol des dove into the nest with enthusiasm if he took passant and sanfelice to construction sites were talking predictable highrisk behavior come away with me to le beeg deeg mon amour might as well wear a stalk me sign so maybe this will boil down to another jealous domestic and no matter what holman says we coulda just met the main players a mister bitter over his plight missus thinks hes greenery but there could be plenty of animal left charming helga called holman a nibbler of forbidden fruit its possible her flings werent limited to backer all the more reason for pentup anger but right now the only lothario i care about is backer mr smooth coming out and asking for it aint exactly suave let alone three women in the same office but it worked so what do i know i said sounds like backer had a nose for emotional vulnerability think about the holmans house neds got no access to the second floor where marjie sleeps shes an architect if anyone could figure out a way to get him up there its her theyve chosen to live physically segregated lives its not just a matter of sex its intimacy and thats what she says she got from backer he tries a little tenderness she falls right in my question is if her needs were being met why limit it to a onenight stand he rolled his shoulders she lied to us and she and backer had something serious going on that would threaten ned holman bigtime on top of being humiliated hes left alone physically and emotionally weve both seen enough domestic homicides to know the pattern the jealous spouse focuses first on eliminating the outside threat maybe i was wrong about jane doe being the target what if the goal was to eliminate backer after all and jane was collateral damage or he said jane was more than a fling for backer or both she and marjie thought they were number one meaning a woman scorned grimacing just what i need a bigger suspect pool freshening the poor guy up why wouldnt she design him an elevator or something plus i said her alibi for last night is meaningless she went to sleep got up the same goes for neds physical limitations because he couldve paid to get the job done either of them couldve a pro job would also be consistent with careful planning positioning the bodies just so he worried a pendulous earlobe stunningly shakespearean alex now all i need is something remotely close to evidence say documentation of a torrid romance between marjie and backer and either one of the holmans paying a killer for hire hell long as were dreaming i wouldnt mind a warm spot in warren buffetts heart right now ill settle for finding out who jane doe is as i drove away he phoned the crypt learned the bodies were still in the delivery bay waiting processing he squinted at his timex damn numerals keep getting smaller two fifteen lets see if we can find bettina sanfelice and sheryl passant if theyre working as well as living in the valley theres time to make it over the hill before the rush also i know an italian place you up for it sure as we rolled out of the canal district he said some victim ive got that mix of glands and charisma he shoulda run for office the clownshow that poses as the california legislature had finally bucked phonecompany lobbyists long enough to pass a handsfree law the system id installed delighted milo because he can sit back and smoke and grunt and stretch and scan the streets for bad guys while he chats as i approached lincoln avenue he began punching in numbers no one picked up at sheryl passants van nuys apartment but bettina sanfelices north hollywood landline was answered by a slurryvoiced woman who said yeah is this bettina no does bettina live there whos this la police lieutenant milo sturgis who he repeated taking pains to go slow police yes maam tinas okay i need to talk to her about a case a case what case someone she worked with was murdered who desmond backer dont know him maam im her mother shes out could you please tell me where how do i know youre not some maniac ill give you my number at the police station and you can verify how do i know youre not giving me some phony number feel free to look it up west la division on butler i should do all the work maam said milo i appreciate your caution but i need to talk to bettina silence mrs sanfelice she went to tgi fridays which one all the way in woodland hills i dont know the address she likes the burgers youd never catch me wasting gas for that what was she wearing how would i know she doesnt live with you she sure does cause she still dont have no job that dont mean i pay attention to her clothes click he phoned detective moe reed asked for dmv statistics on the intern the young cop said i was just about to call you loo prints on backer and the female vic got run through afis but unfortunately nothing kicked back i already knew that you did its been that kind of day he spelled sanfelices name seconds later reed said sanfelice bettina morgana thirty years old five five hundred and ten brown brown wears corrective lenses no wants or warrants heres the address living at moms when shed had her license renewed three years ago anything else loo ill let you know milo hung up i hear intern i figure a college kid shes way past that unemployed stuck with that loving maternal entity like you said emotional vulnerability ol des had a helluva nose the freeway was starting to clog up so i took ventura boulevard to woodland hills the tgi fridays was like any other which is the point chain restaurants are easy targets of ridicule for expenseaccount gourmets documentary filmmakers living off grant money and trustfund babies for folks saddled with budgets and faced with a world that seems increasingly unpredictable theyre temples of comfort milo and i had grown up in the midwest and wed both flipped burgers in high school the smell of the grill still evokes all sorts of memories how i react depends on what else is going on in my life today the aroma was pretty good milo inhaled deeply home sweet bacon the interior was vast chocked with corporate oak stenciled mirrors notevenclosetotiffany lamps redshirted servers mostly hanging around because of the three pm offhour a bar ample enough to intoxicate half the valley ran the length of the room the layout made it easy to spot every customer a scatter of blearyeyed truckers with no idea what time it was a mom and a grandmom teaming up to handle a whining kid in a booster chair two young women in a booth midway down sipping tall pink drinks and picking at a plate of fries a kid in a red shirt said two for lunch were joining friends both women were pale thin wore drab shortsleeved tops jeans and careless ponytails other than platinum hair on one they each matched bettina sanfelices stats milo said the blondes wearing glasses so im betting thats her now all i need to do is separate her from her friend and get her to blab about her sex life any suggestions as to the proper approach there is none i said your optimism is a blessing neither woman noticed until we got within three feet then both looked up milo smiled at the blonde bettina sanfelice the brownhaired woman said thats me in a tiny tentative voice smallboned but fullfaced she had closeset mocha eyes and puffy cheeks and looked like a child whod just been punished the whitesauceslicked fry shed been reaching for dropped back onto her plate not a potatosomething pale green and breadeddeepfried string bean milo bent to make himself smaller showed his card rather than the badge recited his title as if it were no big deal bettina sanfelice was too stricken to speak but the blonde said police as if he were joking she had good features but grainy skin with some active blemish dark circles under her eyes that heavy makeup failed to mask milo kept his focus on bettina sanfelice im so sorry to tell you this maam but were investigating the death of someone you worked with sanfelices mouth dropped open her hand shot forward rocked her drink it wouldve spilled if i hadnt caught it death by homicide im afraid sanfelice gasped who milo said a man named desmond before backers surname had been fully pronounced both women shouted des the kid in the red shirt looked over a hard look from milo caused him to veer toward the bar the bespectacled blonde said i have just got totally nauseous bettina sanfelice said des omigod the blonde removed her glasses i need a bathroom she slid out of the booth you also knew des maam same as tina did the blonde trotted toward the restrooms moving clumsily in ultratight jeans and ratty sneakers the kid in the red shirt dared to come over everything okay milo expanded like a balloon everythings grand just go about your business now was the time for the badge gawking the kid turned heel milo said your friends pretty upset bettina sheryls got a iffy stomach thats sheryl passant nod omigod who hurt des thats what were trying to find out mind if we join you um not budging milo smiled thanks for the compliment but i need a little more room than that bettina oh sorry sanfelice scooted over and he wedged beside her milo s presence turned her tiny an abused child i settled across from them milo pointed at the pink drink i know its a shock feel free oh no thanks but she grabbed the glass with both hands took a long noisy sip frozen strawberry margarita said milo frozen strawtini des is really dead omigod thats so i cant believe it tina anything you can tell us about des would be really helpful you and sheryl both worked with him right uhhuh at ghcthats a architectural firm sheryl got me the job you and sheryl are old friends from junior high we tried out for the army but we changed our mind because of eyerack instead we enrolled in jc but we didnt like it so we went to itt to learn computers but we didnt like that so we switched to business technology at briar secretarial sheryl got a job right away she can type fast but im slower so i switched to computer graphics my dream is to design furniture and draperies but theres nothing right now so when sheryl got the job at ghc she told me they needed a intern maybe i could get to do design did you uhuh i mostly ran errands answered the phone when sheryl was tied up which didnt happen too much there really wasnt nothing to do was des working at ghc when you and sheryl got hired no he came later like a week later we said finally a guy blushing mr cohens a guy hes old how old like sixty hes like a grandpa a voice to our left said he is a grandpa used to bring his rugrat grandkids in and would go off all day with them sheryl passant looked down on us oracle on the mount i got up to let her in no more ponytail her blond hair was long and loose and streaming and her glasses were gone she slid in why were you talking about mr cohen bettina sanfelice said were talking about des sher to find out who killed him us what can we tell them milo said for starts what kind of guy des was sheryl did he have enemies whod want to hurt him passant shifted closer her thigh pressed against mine i scooted an inch away she frowned flipped her hair des had no enemies none at all des was really mellow i cant see anyone hating him not even helga the nazi helga the gestapo girl said sanfelice giggling then turning grave sorry we just she didnt treat us good just getting our paychecks was a hassle sheryl i mean i was just an intern so i didnt get paid at all which totally sucked said passant you did the same job as me teen you shouldve gotten paid the same as me helga sucks milo said wasnt the firm a partnership marjie and mr cohen didnt control the money she did the building was hers the idea was hers everything was hers she was always talking like she was the one whod made up green like al gore had never existed you think she killed des you think she couldve the women looked at each other sanfelice stirred her drink passant said im not saying shed have done it but shes not like a regular person you know different said sanfelice shes from europe the redshirted kid reappeared this time bearing two plates bacon burgers oozing with molten white and orange cheese salads the size of a babys head a haybale of onion rings um do you guys still want this bettina sanfelice said i was hungry but now im also feeling nauseous sheryl passant said yuck do we still have to pay milo said put the food down son and give me the check heres your tip in advance forking over bills the kid said sweet a few minutes of routine questions produced nothing new about desmond backer whom the women described as nice and totally hot the shock had worn off and they both seemed pleased at the attention bettina sanfelice studied her burger its probably gross but im going to try sheryl passant said not me moments later a grin as she bit in wiped her chin guess i lied milo let them eat offered drink refills they declined sanfelice wholeheartedly passant with some regret milo stared at me i raised my eyebrows he cocked his head to the side and when i didnt respond said my partners gonna ask you some questions now theyre a little personal so sorry but we really need to ask waving the redshirted kid over he ordered an extralarge coke both women had stopped eating sheryl passants thigh pressed hard against mine chapter bettina sanfelice said personal milo s eyebrows said take it from here sheryl passant said they mean sex teen because des was a horner from day one right like he was put on this earth to do it the corners of her mouth turned up as she bent over her straw conspicuous slurp i said helga and marjorie holman both told us about a meeting where des was discussed by all of you passant grinned where we all admitted doing des bettina sanfelices hand shot to her mouth stop being dorky teen you did him we all did him so what omigod sanfelice hung her head passant laughed i have always been her bad influence thats why her mom has always hated me put a horn like des with a bunch of girls what do you thinks going to have happened i said helga said it didnt happen with her thats because shes never been humanstop spazzing teen its biology sanfelice said i need to go to the bathroom in a sec hon said milo no argument passant said the moment you met des it was pretty clear he was after one thing i said marjorie said he was pretty direct just came out and asked at first i thought it was gross like are you kidding but the way he did it made it not gross how so not pushy kind of friendly des made it all real friendly her foot rested on mine pressure just short of pain i slid away she smiled was it a onetime thing or did seven times for me lucky seven bettina sanfelice gasped i know i told you three teen didnt want to freak you out but it was seven now youre gonna ask why wasnt it eight i dont know it just kind of stopped like hed become my brother or something i said too friendly yup did des take you anywhere in particular coffee she said sometimes food back to caressing my shoe with her sneaker afterward was there a particular place for before she faced me you really are personal no there wasnt any one place he took me to sites building sites he just called them sites like unfinished buildings or sometimes there was just dirt sometimes parts of buildings when there was just dirt he had a blanket in his car basically he got off doing it outdoors a lot of people do i said where were these sites i dont know the street it was dark they were all in the valleyis that where he got killed in the valley no i said well with me it was always in the valley hed pick me up at my apartment say he had a new site bettina sanfelice mumbled unintelligibly sheryl passant said now you can tell them about des and you i said i think we know enough you said it was two teen remember what i said when you told me that two for the road you said he took you to sites also sanfelice whimpered i said were fine tina passant reached across the table for her friends hand chill teen no ones going to tell your mom they dont care about us they care about who killed des any ideas about that both women shook their heads i said marjorie holman told us she and des had a onenight stand do you think thats true passant said could be shes old and baggy how did you guys come to be discussing des we all had been drinking you drink you talk it wasnt a business meeting thats what she called it the notz guess it was because there wasnt any businessit wasnt like a real job you know no assignments we just came in every day and mostly sat around except when the nazi wanted to talk about stuff no one understood one day she came in and said theres no coherence we need coherence sanfelice said cohesiveness theres no cohesiveness means the same teen anyway helganotz said we need to have something social to get cohesiveness so we went out for drinks just the women i said girls night out gerrrrls niyett ote like it had been something shed heard in a chick movie or something like she had been trying to be american you know but what the hey shes paying why not she found a place near the airport you heard planes coming in they served these humongous margaritas remember those glasses like for a plant teen rubbing my leg for emphasis howd the topic turn to des backer it had just kinda happened you remember how teen head shake passant said i guess we had been talking about stuff and that started it to talking about guys and that started it to talking about it being a girls night out and that started to someone saying i wonder how des would have liked this being with all these girls who said that bettina sanfelice said sheryl i did yes passant grinned if she says i said it then i said it i was pretty much happytime happy i dont worry about what people think anyway always just say whats in my head i said so you brought up des and and everyone piled on like truth or dare without the dare everyone piled on except helga everyone with a beating heart i said what did helga do during the discussion sat back and listened i started and told them about des and me and then tina broke in and said i was with him too now that had freaked me out because tina had always been the shy one and shed never told me nothing to her friend nothing like four margaritas to get truth past the dare huh go girl sanfelice stared at the table i said so marjorie holman spoke last it was almost like she had been feeling left out you know wanted to be young like us younger and hotter and doing it with des still she was your boss that was pretty uninhibited she drank more than anyone and she wasnt the real boss anyway helga was and the way she said itmarjoriewas weird not coming out more like a something weird bettina sanfelice said she said that experience is common to yours truly as well when i figured it out it really shocked me ms holman always seemed so stern passant said stern with her legs wide open and she even got into more details winking she said he did her standing up behind a trailer facing her it was real friendly almost like they were having a conversation except they werent bettina sanfelice said she made it sound like his being inside her was a surprise the three of us stared at her she burst into tears retched and slapped her hand to her mouth and motioned frantically with the other milo scooted out and she ran to the bathroom sheryl passant said she always had a bad stomach i said she said the same about you me no way ive liked chili and spicy my whole life after marjorie told you about des what else did she say nothing she just shut up and drank some more we had to sit there a long time until she could drive helga left first me and tina and ms holman sat there looking at each other like no one had anything to say anymore there was csi miami on a big plasma and we just watched then we all drove home what happened the next day what do you mean no mention of the discussion nope her hand dropped to fool with her napkin again this time she lingered at my crotch i shifted away im going to make sure bettinas okay dont bother shes okayall right fine but shes really okay it took nine minutes for sanfelice to emerge from the ladies room her steps were wobbly and her eyes were raw when she saw me she gasped you all right im terrible she said that was terrible sorry i didnt intend for it to get that detailed with sheryl it would have to she likes to show off her dads a drunk and he beat her mom all the time sheryl never did well in school and her mom died a few years ago my mom says shes a slut but shes had it hard glancing toward the booth you wont tell my mom right chapter passant and milo werent talking passant looked bored when bettina sanfelice settled back in milo said a woman died with des omigod and ive got a picture of her its not disgusting or bloody but it was taken after death can you handle looking at it passant said i just saw it teen its no big deal and you dont know her sanfelice took a deep breath how can you be sure i didnt know her so no way you did that makes no sense sher show it to me sir milo produced the death shot sanfelice studied smiled triumphantly ive seen her with des passant said sure you have milo said where and when bettina just once sir it was after work des and me were the last ones in the office i was sweeping up and des was drawing stuff on the computer our cars were parked in the lot out back and we walked out together tapping the image with a finger she was there standing next to his car waiting for him he wasnt surprised or anything was he happy to see her he wasnt happy or unhappy kind of in the middle passant murmured once upon a time sanfelice said i definitely saw her i can tell you what she was wearing sir tight jeans and a black tank top she had a real good body i remember thinking des had himself a hot one glaring at passant as opposed to passant huffed and slurped her drink i said did des address her by name nope they didnt talk at all he just kind of nodded at her and she nodded back did they leave together i cant say for sure i drove off first and didnt see sheryl passant picked up the photo i wouldnt call her hot milo said how long ago did this happen bettina i cant tell you exactly when but it was way before ghc closed down id guess two months maybe a little longer like two and a half anything else you can tell us bettina no sir okay thanks youve been really helpful if you think of anything else heres my card she wont think of nothing trust me said passant and give me one of those too we watched them leave passant yammering as sanfelice stomped ahead of her milo said blondie was nudging up against you pretty blatantly you have no idea i said serious footsies beyond oh ill send the department a bill for freelance decoy work did passant have anything to add when you got her alone nada shes an airhead though she did try to fool with my desert boots if only she knew huh what about sanfelice over by the john please dont tell mom looks like des was a creature of habit that kill me signs looking bigger and brighter okay were outta here italian youre hungry i assumed you were yeah i could ingest we could even stay here alternatively we could go for the mixed antipasto that headcheese with delicate but smoky overtones the fried artichokes romanstyle nice salad with thinsliced parmesan and pepperoncini and intensely cured black olives the big hot bowl of baked ziti with the bread crumbs sprinkled on top if theres still room theres always the doublecut veal chop with the sicilian sauce wedge of spumoni triple espresso pump in the caffeine sliding his bulk out of the booth not that ive been thinking about it out in the parking lot i said nice lateral pass on the interview he grinned nice catch i figured psychological sensitivity was called for flattered it had nothing to do with the fact that i dont sleep with women that never occurred to me no who is more aware than i of your painful shyness to be honest alex if we were dealing with men ida come out and asked because men cant wait to talk about their sex lives i figured women were different it would be like oral surgery but go know sorry for your having to deal with blondies lack of filter mercy me the trauma i said wheres the selfhelp group he laughed turned serious a married woman old enough to be his mama a wild girl and a shy nerdy type guy was all over the map what strikes me i said is that none of them seem particularly impacted by his death there was initial shock but once that wore off all three discussed him objectively same way they did at the cocktail lounge he meant very little to them emotionally and probably vice versa but what if jane doe was different someone don juan actually got involved with maybe when you factor in the zip code he did take her on a fancy date several plates full of italian food later i drove back to the city over benedict canyon while milo phoned a judge known to skim rather than read and requested a victim search warrant for desmond backers residence the next call was to santa monica pd making nice with the dayshift homicide lieutenant by promising not to tie up her detectives and convincing her to send a locksmith to backers apartment as soon as possible we reached santa monica at the end of a nice beach day tourists and wildeyed homeless people divvied up ocean front boulevard backers building on california was four stories of rainstreaked white stucco pimpled by juliet balconies too small to be functional and bottomed by a subterranean lot the view was the massive fivestory condo across the street three blocks east of the beach bought you the smell of the ocean but no big blue kiss the buildings interior was cool and gray and sterile the locksmith was already in place at the door to backers secondfloor flat looking sleepy he said murder case huh and opened his bag milo gave him latex gloves and sheathed his own hands and mine the locksmith said must be a biggie and got to work the deadbolt yielded quickly a receipt was signed the locksmith tossed his gloves onto the hallway carpet and left i waited until milo called out the allclear desmond backer had been trained in structural design and aesthetics but hed lived in a plainwrap onebedroom onebath had made no attempt to personalize brown cloth sofa and matching love seat in the living room cheap bamboo tables framed generic photographs of trees lakes foxes owls eagles a cinderblockandglassshelf bookcase housed

knives in a block yesterdays paper still folded and rubberbanded no disorder no obvious blood no womans presence same for the puny dim bedroom nearly filled by a kingsized bed in a black wood frame a single high window framed the blue flank of the building next door a birch cube nightstand hosted a gooseneck lamp a box of tissues two more books on forestry no dresser but part of the closet was sectioned into drawers not a lot of clothes but what was there was high quality two cashmere sweaters navy and chocolate brown same style as the black one worn by backer on his last breathing night italian loafers and a pair of new balance running shoes milo inspected the soles of the runners sand in the grooves probably jogged on the beach a youbuild desk next to the closet hosted a silver imac and a second adjustable lamp in a top drawer milo found condoms boxes of them in a variety of brands styles and colors below all that several pages printed from the internet straight sex athletic positions women in ecstasy genuine or not nothing cruel or outré i said he practiced safe sex but left semen on janes thigh and no condoms at the scene milo scratched his nose maybe a box of rubbers was another takehome goodie for baddie janes purse whatever bedding backer brought the bmw i said interesting haul he got down and peered under the bed i said catching backer in the act of unpeeling a condom would be a perfect time to make your move zoned out offguard offbalance he said here comes the big death the alternative is backer didnt glove up with jane because he did have something special with her he thought about that returned to the closet checked a high shelf then the floor beneath some long coats slid out a box drawing pads pencils erasers pens last years tax return a few credit

significant other she was just another bootycutie he took holman to santa monica stayed in the valley with passant so maybe she lives near holmby but her clothes say not as a residentan au pair or something time to revisit the hood but first this shangrilas parking amenities the buildings sublot was onethird full and backers bmw was easy to spot milo gloved up again peered through the windows tried the doors found them locked ran his flashlight over the interior nothing looks off but lets see what the techies have to say i said backer and jane got to borodi some other way she drove why not a smooth guy like uncle desi could probably get women to do all sorts of things and if i had any idea who the hell she is i could look for her goddamn car you up for another visit to the scene why

call until late the plan is we grab something at cedars cafeteria food is cozy love hurts darling a single uniform remained at the construction site leaning against his cruiser and talking on his cell phone yellow tape ran along the fence the chain was still loose enough to allow a walkthrough milo sat up and shot his jaw oh gimme a break jabbing his finger at the parking ticket pinned under one of the unmarkeds windshield wipers before i cut the engine he was out ripping the summons free the patrolman lowered his phone milo strode over to him were you here when they papered me silence you just let it happen the uniform was young smoothfaced muscular a ramosmartinez you know the traffic nazis sir theyre on commission sir cant talk them out of nothing did you try ramosmartinez hesitated decided against lying no sir i was keeping my eye on the scene gee thanks officer sorry sir i thought thats what i was supposed to do sir thats a lot of sirs how long you been out of the service eight months sir overseas anbar eyeraq sir all right you get a pass but next time speak up for truth and justice got it yes sir anything happen while i was gone not much sir not much or nothing pretty quiet overall sir said ramosmartinez that security guard came back said he was still officially on the job i told him he could stand out on the street but couldnt gain access or park his car anywhere on the street he usually pulls up here on the dirt wanted to again i told him it was part of the scene he decided to leave god forbid he should get cited silence he put up any fuss no sir you pick up any ulterior motive on his part like wanting to get back in there and alter evidence he didnt argue sir guess guarding it nows kinda horse after the cart sir milo stared at him my dad says that all the time sir can i assume your fellow officers searched the entire premiseshouse and yardas i instructed yes sir thoroughly i was part of that we found some soda cans toward the back of the property dented and rusty like theyd been there for a while they were tagged and bagged appropriately and sent to the lab sir no weapons or narcotics or blood or nothing like that sir cs techies said nothing interesting up in that room either sir milo turned to me wheres the nearest hardware store nothings really close maybe santa monica near bundy back to ramosmartinez officer heres what i need you to do drive to the hardware store at santa monica near bundy buy a goodquality padlock and the shortest chain you can find and bring all that back asap fishing out his wallet he handed bills to the young officer right now sir before now officer put a move onpretend its a codetwo dont call in to report your location either anyone fusses blame it on me no sweat sir said ramosmartinez i dont mind fuss that so yes sir takes a lot to get me worried sir the day had remained warm and the turret shouldve reflected that instead it felt chilly and dank and my nose filled with stink that didnt exist the same stench id carried around for days after my first visit years ago to the crypt on mission road some old cluster of olfactory brain cells activated by memory milo slouched and chewed his dead cigar okay were here give me some thunderous insight if the killer stalked backer and jane im wondering why he chose to strike here the staircase is pretty well hidden and hed have to sneak his way up in the dark be careful not to make noise if backer and jane were close to the staircase hed risk being seen or heard well before getting to the top and with them higher than him hed be at a serious disadvantage one good shove and our boys tumbling he said so maybe our boy knew backer and jane came up here regularly to mess around and had the lay of the placepun intended hell alex if the two of them were bumping around heavybreathing that wouldve blocked out footsteps familiarity with the site could also mean someone whod worked here a tradesmen assigned to the job maybe someone who knew backer through construction if you find a history of violence stalking sexual offenses youve got something to work with janes jealous sigoth just happens to be joe hardhat that or someone whod seen des with jane and grew obsessed with her jobs been dormant for two years were talking a tradesman who moved on maybe not far enough he looked at his watch you go on home im gonna do my own walkthrough of the grounds stick around until ramosmartinez brings the lock and chain keeping doyle bryczinski out keeping everyone the hell out he said besides im a prince among men why not pretend to have a castle robin was waiting for me in the living room all sixtythree inches of her curled on the couch listening to stefano grondona play bach on old guitars a white silk dress played off against her olive skin auburn curls fanned on the cushion blanche snuggled against robins chest knobby blond head resting near robins left hand both of them smiled it can be jarring when a french bulldogs flat face takes on an unmistakably human expression and some people startle when blanche switches on the charm im used to it but it still makes me wonder about the standard evolutionary charts i said hey girls and kissed them both lips for robin top of the head for blanche unlike our previous dog a feisty brindle male frenchie named spike blanche has no jealousy issues i gave her batears a scratch you look tired baby im fine do you mind going out i was still stuffed with italian said not at all we drove to a place at the top of the glen where good jazz was mixed with decent food and a generous bar the band was offset and the standin sound track was lowvolume sax something braziliantinged maybe stan getz we drank wine settled in robin said whats the case i told her holmby thats close no danger rob this was personal i summed up backers proclivities the interviews of holman sanfelice and passant she said they all sound like soap opera characters don juan and his fan club if he was a woman hed be labeled a slut or a courtesan i said or ambassador to a major ally its always a matter of pay grade borodi lane is serious pay grade alex maybe he took jane there because she was a rich girl her clothes didnt say that i was wondering about someone who worked in the neighborhood anyone who spent time there knew the job was inactive and security was lax the food came the band approached the stage robin took hold of my hand guess i should give you credit for what not being a don juan that deserves a prize fine ill take what i can get hey she said stroking my cheek handsome dude with a fancy degree and no mortgage not to mention other ahem attributes you could be partying like its bring on the platform shoes thats the seventies dear see i said im out of touch would never survive the meat market oh youd thrive sweetie it would be one thing if you were a twerp with no libido but i know otherwise thats me i said sexual superman with the morals of a saint you laugh she said i smile chapter we drove home well fed and watered as i held the door open robin said nice place youve got here don we disrobed in the dark collapsed under the covers afterward she said that was great but next time platform shoes i awoke at four eighteen was at my desk five minutes later pupils constricting as the computer screen filled with light plugging in the borodi address produced a fouryearold squib in la design quarterly masterson and associates century city will be the architects for a mammoth project planned in holmby hills this fall the squarefoot residence sits on a acre lot on borodi lane and will be the la piedàterre for an unnamed foreign investor marjorie holmans dismissive comment about helga gemein flashed in my head no need to work daddy was a german shipping tycoon a stretch but you needed to be at that level for a project of that scope i searched some more pairing gemein and borodi found nothing five hours later i was in milo s office and he was shaking his head already checked the assessor nada what about the building permit theres a perfectly legit fouryearold permit on file and that century city outfitmastersonwere the architects but the property owner of record is a corporation called dsd incorporated massachusetts avenue washington dc and for the last thirtynine months that address matches the headquarters of a soybean industry lobbyist who never heard of dsd no corporate listings anywhere maybe they were a sleazeball hedge fund that went poof i said the article said foreign investor so dsd was a holding company set up as some kind of tax dodge does that bother me not unless it relates to two bodies in a turret he opened a desk drawer slammed it shut wheeled his chair back the three inches allotted and knuckled his eyelids his windowless cell was ripe with stale tobacco and fumes from the burnt coffee cooked up in the big detective room hed fetched two cups had finished his mine cooled untouched life was too short i said any word on the autopsy bodies are stacked up in the fridge closet like firewood coroners not seeing this as high priority because cause of death is pretty obvious i bitched but theyve got a point the xray of backers head shows bullet frags in his brain and janes a clear strangulation what they didnt find was any sign of sexual assault oh yeah just in case i was getting the least bit cheerful the only prints that show up in backers car are his and janes but since shes not on record big damn deal she doesnt have a single distinguishing scar deformity or tattoo though she did get a nose job a long time ago ive been trolling the doe network and every other missing persons database but so far nothing even allowing for a bigger schnoz and backers hard drive turned out to be more of the same porn ecology architecture sounds like a woody allen film i said sounds like a tragedy ive already left two messages with those hoohhah architects still waiting to hear back lets go see what the neighbors have to say this time he drove in case the parking nazis return youve gotten yourself immunity he produced the crumpled ticket tore it into shreds and dropped them in the trash im a scofflaw but for the crime scene borodi lane was stately and sunsplotched he stopped to check the new chain snug i still dont get the point of a halfday patrol nothing on the weekend i said people capable of building houses like this rarely deal with the daytoday being across the ocean would make it even harder to stay in touch some underling probably told a subordinate to order a plebe to maintain security but keep an eye on the budget a peon lower down the ladder tried to earn brownie points by skimping besides what was to steal rotten wood unnamed foreign investor okay lets get to know the good folk of borodi lane six pushes of gate buzzers produced three noanswers and an equal number of spanish housekeepers answering the intercom milo coaxed the maids outside showed them jane does picture perplexed expressions head shakes the seventh house was an unfenced brick tudor generous but not monumental fronted by a cobbled motor court bentley benz range rover audi a young brunette in lavender velour sweats answered the door freckles struggled through matte foundation long silky hair was tied up carelessly is this about the murder yes maam maam im twentyfive milo smiled i vaguely remember being twentyfive she extended a hand amy thal this is my parents place before they left they told me what happened mom didnt even want me to stay but i told her to chill i always housesit the cats when they go to paris when did your parents leave early this morning widening smile dont worry theyre not fugitives from justice the trip was planned months ago but if you want to interrogate them i can give you the number even the address of their apartment ernest and marcia thal rue sainthonoré i guess its possible theyre traveling as bonnie and clyde she giggled milo didnt sorry i dont mean to make light of it to be honest its a little scary though i guess its not hugely surprising a murder something creepy happening there thereve been problems before that entire dump is a problem just sitting there gathering mold no security lights at night the chains wide open anyone can walk in everyone hates it my dad wanted to sue whoever owns it who owns it ive heard some arab she said or maybe a persian some mideast type im not sure no one seems to be able to find out its not that were prejudiced were certainly not that placepointing up the blockthat big apricot thing is owned by the nazarians and theyre persians and theyre great people i just dont see the point of framing up and not following through for two whole years no one does any neighborhood rumors about why its just sitting there sure money isnt it always about money so why not sell as in to someone wholl actually build something tasteful yeah it is a little overthetop said milo a little said amy thal its gross im not talking sizewise whore we kidding this isnt south central but the style no one can figure it out that stupid third floor stuck up there like a wart im a design studentfashion not interiorbut you dont need design training to recognize awkward and ostentatious and plain old buttugly i dont know design from badgers and chipmunks said milo and even i can tell amy thal smiled badgers and chipmunks thats cutecoatis and raccoons too anyway thats all i can tell you lieutenant im just doing the parentals a favor because one of the felines is almost nineteen and we dont want her stumbling into the pool could i show you a picture of who one of our victims there was more than one two said milo oh youre not saying it was some psycho manson thing are you nothing like that out came jane does photo amy thal wrinkled her nose oh wow ms thal i cant be sure but i think ive seen her around not regularly she doesnt live here could she work here i doubt it everyone knows everyone elses staff and ive only seen her twice and she just looked like she didnt belong taking another look it definitely could be her when and where did you see her when would that be not recently a month ago i really cant say where would be right there walking near that dump thats what caught my eye no one walks here there are no sidewalks smile which is the point keep the riffraff out god forbid it should be a real neighborhood i didnt grow up here we used to live in encino my brothers and i had sidewalks for lemonade stands rode our bikes once the parentals had empty nest they decided fourteen thousand square feet for two people was a nifty idea shrug its their money dropping her eyes to the photo once more im really feeling it was her i saw i remember thinking she was cute but her clothes werent you saw her twice but close togetherlike twice in the same week walking said milo not for exercise she wasnt dressed for that had on heels and a suit not a good one a little tailoring wouldve improved it significantly what else can you remember let me think the suit was gray the way it didnt move with her said it had a lot of poly in it walking but not for exercise strolling past then stopping and strolling back like she was waiting for someone you have no idea at all who she is unfortunately not too bad she said no id really messes you guys up right i tivo csi forensic files new detectives was there a car nearby not that i noticed hmm guess thats another reason she stood out what normal person doesnt drive we crossed the street tried one more house no one home talking to four more maids one genuine liveried butler and two personal assistants on the next block produced no further recognition of jane doe back in the unmarked milo gave masterson and associates another try connected this is lieutenant sturgis i called yesterday about a crime scene on borodi laa crime scene a construction project and your firm is listedmaam this is a homicide case and i need toyes you heard me correctly homicidewhat i need to know isokay ill wait a minute passed two three six disconnection gunning the engine he drove looked back at rutted dirt and curling plywood the girdle of yellow tape mans home is his castle until it aint chapter masterson associates architecture design development shared the sixth floor of a heartless tower on century park east with two investment firms the companys lobby was a duet of pale wood and stainless steel sealed by a wall of glass poured cement floor the seating was black denim cushions set into cshaped graygranite cradles milo said kinda homey norman rockwell would drool a window on the other side of the glass offered a view clear to boyle heights and beyond it took a while to find the call button a tiny stainlesssteel pimple blending mischievously with the surrounding segment of metallic wall milo pushed no sound a female voice lightly accented said masterson hi again lieutenant sturgis i gave your message to mr kotsos then its mr kotsos ill talk to im afraid you should be if i have to come back itll be with a subpoena hunching like an ape he beat his chest sir and ill be needing your name for the paperwork silence one second shed underestimated but not by much twelve seconds later a pudgy little man came out beaming gentlemen so nice markos kotsos deep voice starting somewhere in the digestive tract and emerging belchlike different accent from the receptionist thicker mediterranean given the coldblooded lobby and what he did for a living id expected a wraith dressed in allblack sporting porschedesign eyeglasses and a complex wristwatch markos kotsos had on an intensely wrinkled white caftan over baggy brown linen pants sandals without socks a steel rolex middleaged five five two hundred pounds give or take he wore his toodark hair in a modified perm deep tan too saffron around the edges not to be enhanced by bronzer he dropped into one of the granite chairs folded his hands atop an ample lap sorry for any inconvenience gentlemen what can i do for you taking care of business in the lobby because no visitors were expected milo said were here because of a elena told me a murder on borodi kotsos sighed that project was ill fated from the beginning believe me we regret taking it on who was the client who was murdered milo said id prefer to ask the questions sir ah of course said kotsos silence sir kotsos shook his head sadly im afraid i cannot help you with specifics there was a confidentiality agreement between the client and us following cessation of construction milo said who sued who kotsos licked his lips stumpy fingers drummed a larded thigh it is extremely unusual for us to take on residential projects extremely we are as much developers and conceptualizers as we are architects thus the projects we choose to accept are massively scaled complex more often international than not middle east international kotsos crossed a leg held on to the heel of his sandal youve been to our website yes so you know that dubai has been a major focus of our work because it is a fascinating locale where financial realities intersect with aesthetic adventurousness in a quite unique manner good ideas and the bucks to make them happen kotsos smiled which is why the al masri majestic hotel will be unique and spectacular an aweinspiring feat of structural engineering ten stars and beyond we are drilling a quarter mile into the gulf in order to support pylons the size of buildings the rendering was pretty impressive said milo smoooth operator the reality will be groundbreaking lieutenant literally and figuratively we have found a way to support a carrying weight of unprecedentedbut you dont care about that youre here about a murder transforming the word into something trivial at a project with which we havent been involved in years milo said desmond backer not an eyeblink who one of our victims one there is more two sir so sorry no i dont know the name he was an architect there are many architects said kotsos milo said this one died at your project former project the permit was pulled by dsd incorporated if thats what the record says then it is true any reason for us to believe otherwise hesitation no sir the record speaks for itself tell us about dsd kotsos shook his head im sorry as i told you the terms of the confidentiality you cant even say who they are im sorry milo said that was a civil agreement this is criminal lieutenant i would truly love to help you but the terms are absolute and the stakes are sizable big money silence milo said you sued dsd for a substantial unpaid balance they settled but are paying in installments will use any excuse to stop payment kotsos sighed again it is not simple is there any reason we should suspect dsdor anyone connected to dsdof criminal behavior kotsos thought awhile brightened and clapped his hands together okay i tell you this because i do not want you thinking i am hiding anything important in terms of murder i cannot honestly point a finger at anyone absolutely not if i could i would no one likes murder life is precious if on the other hand you are investigating financial smiling and running a finger across his mouth i have said enough milo produced his notepad homicide mr kotsos financial doesnt interest me now how about some names of people who worked for dsd kotsoss head shake seemed genuinely rueful heres another name for you mr kotsos helga gemein who is that desmond backers boss the firm is gemein holman and cohen never heard of them said kotsos theyre into green architecture kotsos snorted silly stuff green is silly isolating green as a profound concept as if its new lieutenant is pretentious and idiotic the greeks and the romansand the hebrews and the phoenicians and the babyloniansevery civilization of note has integrated natural elements into design from solomons temple to the mayan pyramids that is the natural human way it is in our chromosomes and shall we discuss the renaissance would you consider the trilevel church in rome anything other than deliciously synchronous and organic despite the unexpected turns of events that led to its sequential nature you took the words out of my mouth kotsos said what i am saying lieutenant is that everything good about design relates to harmony all this flabber about natural materials is air waving pudgy hands cement is natural it comes from sand sandstone is natural does that mean cement and sandstone are the optimal materials for every purpose shall we use sandstone for our pylons in dubai throaty laugh any architect deserving of his degree considers his surroundings and attempts to integrate leaning toward us do you know what green has become lieutenant what sir a cult of the ignorant using recycled cardboard as if it is platinum exposing ducts planting grass on the roof substituting raw wood for fine finishes reprocessing sewer water entitles one to a badge of ascetic honor a cult lieutenant selfconsciously ironic and aesthetically phony smog doesnt bother you kotsos said ugly will not solve smog there is nothing new under the sun the only meaningful question is who gets to hold the reflective lens passion had propelled him closer to the edge of the chair pink had spread under his tan milo said so youve never heard of gemein holman and cohen i have not where are they located venice i go to venice italy now if youll excuse me youre a large firm said milo how many partners do you have i have never counted there are no names listed on your door this said kotsos is not a primary office what is it we interview clients from the west coast here would dozens of partners worldwide be a fair estimate quite fair toss in a bunch of assistants and were talking a lot of people mr kotsos so if desmond backer applied for a job you wouldnt necessarily be aware of that kotsos laced his fingers if he was hired by this office i would know what if you turned him down kotsos tugged at his caftan one moment six minutes later he was back there is no record of anyone named backer applying for anything however in all honesty i cannot eliminate the possibility we dont keep paper records of rejects crooked smile all in the interest of saving trees so that we may slice them up for veneer now if youll do any of your international projects include germany mr kotsos its all on the website i really need to go there is a plane to athens departing tonight and i have not yet packed rebuilding the acropolis kotsos guffawed that would be a nice challenge but no i am traveling for mamas cooking tomorrow is her birthday she hates restaurants spanakopita keftedes skordalia kotsoss eyelids half lowered you are a gourmet lieutenant more like a gourmand kotsos regarded his own paunch two sumos facing off i agree lieutenant there is no substitute for the occasional bacchanalia nice talking to you one more thing out came the death photo markos kotsos narrowed his eyes placed goldframed pincenez on the bridge of a meaty nose frowning he reached into a pant pocket brandished a white remote the size of a matchbook nothing on the face but a single red button he jabbed the glass door clicked open you had best come in we followed kotsoss bouncy waddle up a makassar ebony corridor lined with muralsized photos and renderings of mastersons projects resorts office complexes government towers in hong kong singapore the emirates oilrich sultanates like brunei and sranil despite all the talk of harmony the buildings were an ominous collection looming megaliths sharknosed skyeaters crenellated monsters armored with steel and gold plating slathered with quarriesful of marble granite onyx in some cases the design aesthetic began by recalling classical motifs but shifted quickly to a cold brutal forecast of a darwinian future spoils to the victor higher and wider is better audacious is divine against all that for all its palatial presumptions the house on borodi was puny classical pretense that didnt fit neither did a confidentiality agreement to recover fees that would pale in comparison with mastersons typical commissions kotsos picked up his pace janes photo still in hand flapping against his hip we hurried past a dozen unmarked office doors silence behind each one maybe good soundproofing but it felt more like noonehome at the end of the hallway blocking straight access to kotsoss corner suite sat a young strawhaired woman wearing a formfitted plumcolored suit from the thirties black desk pink laptop her fingers kept moving before she deigned to look up elena said kotsos showing her the picture what was this womans name not missing a beat elena said brigid ochs milo said youve got a good memory i do said elena brassy slavic voice edged with disdain kotsos said she is dead elena so i gather milo said tell us about her whats to tell she was a disaster how so she was hired for backup nothing complicated just relief on the phone and allpurpose assistance when i travel with mr kotsos or have to be away from my desk for any reason her résumé was impressive executive sec at ebay and microsoft and two venture capital firms in los gatos and she appeared bright and eager later we found out everything was forged so much for that agency kotsos looked stunned elena i never knew no need i protect you milo said which agency kersey and garland we no longer use them what was their excuse for not vetting her properly they were as much victims as we were snort if theyd bothered to actually check her references a lot of trouble couldve been avoided what specifically did brigid do wrong maam elena turned to kotsos brace yourself i caught her going places she shouldnt be going tapping the rim of the laptop oh no said kotsos not to worry she got nothing cybersnooping said milo there was no reason for her to be anywhere near the files her job was to meet my needs howd you catch her keystroke buddy program she said every move she made was traced i do it routinely to ensure confidentiality back to kotsos you see no worry he said yes yes thank you milo said whered she go other than company files nowhere said elena and she got no further than addresses which she could find anyway in public records because i passwordprotect each and every file but that was not the point she had no business sticking her nose in who was hired to replace her no one i dont want help its not worth the time and effort to train someone milo said what else can you tell us about her poor taste in clothes said elena taking in his rumpled poly tie saggy chinos and smiling kotsoss wrinkled outfit didnt draw a glance poor taste how bad fabrics poor silhouette careless fit with outlets and the internet theres no excuse for not dressing well i shouldve known her carelessness would extend to work sounds like she was more devious than careless yes i suppose youre right what about desmond backer who an architect who died with her an architect said elena perhaps she had some sort of fixation markos kotsos said but of course architects are dashing fellows elena smirked your limo to lax and your pickup in athens are confirmed i have ordered irises for your mother blue i assume thats okay perfect thank you milo said could we please have an address for that agency not necessary said elena take the elevator to the ground floor as we waited by the elevator a nervous fellow in pinstripes passed by tugging at his hair milo said know anything about masterson the banker stopped frowned muttered ghost town and continued ding we boarded i said mastersons basically a west coast clearinghouse office just kotsos and that little battleax maybe they launder money for an oil cartel or run an international human smuggling ring or lobby for some cannibalistic dictatorship the question is what was brigid ochs curious about dsd used to be headquartered in dc the smell of international intrigue grows more intense he rubbed his face with friends like you kersey and garland executive search and human resource consultants was tucked into a corner past the groundfloor snack bar not far from the public restrooms the weary older woman who sat at the front desk looked at janes photo oy her again now what jody millan on her desk plaque framed shots of facepainted costumed grandchildren cluttered her desk milo said again thats brigid ochs we dropped her shes been dropped permanently maam pardon someone murdered her jody millan went white my god thats a whatever you call it morgue shot i wasnt wearing my glasses you recognized her without them that much i could see but out came halfspecs oh my god im getting nauseous who did it thats what were here to find out maam then you came to the wrong place she hasnt been with us for months after lying about her credentials to get the job at masterson she sent you here said the woman the russian shouldve figured ill bet she enjoyed pointing the finger one little slipup she couldnt wait to fire us elena i got her that job and it sure as hell paid off didnt it what do you mean she started as the bosss secretary ended up snagging him the boss being mr kotsos shes mrs kotsos the fourth said millan and no doubt determined to be the last wicked smile are you checking her out she was furious at brigid is there anything interesting in her past millan picked up a pencil honestly no she was crackerjack worked for a top exec at kinsey and did a bangup job and i suppose she had a right to be upset still brigid was extremely convincing its not as if elena picked anything up herself brigid was a good actress this town we get plenty of that youd be amazed at the bs i get handed but brigid didnt come across that way not at all i said she wasnt theatrical just the opposite quiet well mannered didnt play herself up at all such a pretty girl but she didnt make the most of it almost like she wanted to avoid attention i know we shouldve run a background but elena was impatient needed someone now could we see the application sorry we dont keep records once they leave us recycling theres no need to hold on to trash i can tell you what she claimed because i interviewed her personally guess i shouldnt claim credit for that but im not going to beat myself up she came across bright calm articulate eager to please i dont get deeply into personal data but i do like to get a feel for the person so i asked her about her background the basics of her social life she said she was single and happy to be so i took that as maybe she was recently divorced or out of a bad relationship she said she grew up in the pacific northwest claimed to work for one of bill gatess top assistants then said she moved to los gatos and spent some time at a tech venture capitalist then on to ebay where she did website organization her skills seemed perfect for what elena claimed she needed claimed trust me nothing will make that woman happy said millan truth is she doesnt want anyone else up there but her and kotsos though if you ask me hes gay odd couple said milo hey she said this is la i said mastersons office seems pretty laidback its a tomb said jody millan once in a blue moon you see someone but the only two constants are kotsos and elena the only business ive seen is rich foreigners out to lunch kissing up shamelessly milo said what kind of rich people mostly arabs sometimes theyre wearing those robes and headdresses like sheikhs maybe they are sheikhs have you sent kotsos any other people temps she said before elena girls got a work ethic ill grant you that so brigid ochs was the first postelena hire elena said business had grown to the point where she needed backup because she and kotsos were traveling more together head shake i pride myself on reading people well but i really got taken everything brigid told me turned out to be baloney down to her social security number brightening that i might still have not that its going to help you why not after i found out id been conned i ran a trace the number matches a poor little girl born the same year brigid claimed in new jersey a kid who died at age five hold on she entered a back office returned with a postit here you go sara gonsalves did you confront brigid wouldve liked to but the number she gave me was disconnected where was her address santa monica turned out to be a mail drop and she was long gone she died with another person a man named desmond backer dont know him was brigid involved in criminal activity theres no evidence of that well said jody millan she certainly wasnt an upstanding citizen we took the stairs to the sublot brigid ochs said milo whats the chance thats her righteous name i said whoever she was she was obviously curious about the borodi project and dsd international intrigue okay time to call in some favors he flipped through his notepad found a number punched and left a vague message for someone named hal as we got in the car he tried moe reed got voice mail settled for his other occasional d one backup sean binchy and asked him to run brigid ochs through the databases including social security binchy phoned back in ten minutes nothing on her anywhere loot there is a brigitte oake spelled like the tree but with an e at the end incarcerated at sybil brand awaiting trial for cocaine possession with intent extensive record for solicitation and drugs but shes fortynine social security was kind of anal said the number had been retired due to misuse i tried to get confirmation about that fiveyearold sara gonsalves but its like she never existed for some reason i got the feeling theyd been told not to cooperate but maybe im being paranoid trust your instincts sean im learning to do that loot chapter a mile before the station milo detoured to a taco joint on santa monica inhaled two burritos slathered christmas style with red sauce and salsa verde gulped a megacoke then a refill all that green talk is making me conserve energy onward no callback from hal the fed a note from binchy said no luck on the internet milo googled brigid ochs anyway did the same for dsd inc whole lot of zeros i said maybe it wont be about high intrigue and brigid wanted mastersons address list so she could help backer apply for a job there along the way the two of them have funtime in highend piles of wood how do most employees abuse the office computer porn maybe plywood was hers he sat back twisted an ear until it turned scarlet lets try backers sister again he dialed hung up scott and ricki and samantha and bark bark bark the backward directory yielded a name flatt scott a that pulled up a onepage family website showcasing the same holiday photos wed seen in backers apartment a few more of little samantha now around three and travel shots from half a dozen national parks plus hawaii london amsterdam scott and ricki flatt were both elementary school teachers i said schools out of session they get summers off could be anywhere gonna be a helluva welcome back he spun in his chair nearly collided with the wall mumbled theres a metaphor for you brigid told the employment agency shed grown up in the pacific northwest skillful liars embed truth in their stories maybe that part was real and this is about old friends reuniting recalling the good old days when she and des used to park under the stars under the stars is one thing alex why a damn construction site maybe the two of them were wild kids enjoyed trespassing nostalgia huh reach your thirties nothing exciting in your life nostalgia can take on a certain charm reliving the past could explain backer going beyond the usual shortterm shag he phoned information probed for backer or ochs listings slammed down the receiver shaking his head called the port angeles police and talked to a friendly bassovoiced cop named chris kammen kammen knew nothing helpful promised to ask around bootycalls for nostalgias sake strong chemistry can linger i said but if brigid was involved with another man chapter two could get complicated alleged brigid who knows what her real name is im thinking its time to go public any reason i shouldnt he was back on the phone to parker center before i finished saying not that i can see three underlings later he was transferred to deputy chief henry weinberg the dc mainlined smug sounds like youre nowhere fast its a tough one thought that was the kind you liked up to a point the point where youre nowhere fast eh i suppose i can find it within myself to put someone on it but no stations going to flash a morgue shot on screen too damn real for civilians you have an artist who can make her look alive ill find one do your homework first said weinberg then talk to me milo s obvious first choice was petra connor because shed worked as a commercial artist before joining the department had serious talent a call to her office at hollywood division revealed she was in cabo for r and r with her livein eric stahl additional poking around produced the name of officer henry gallegos from pacific division whose aa in art from santa monica college made him rembrandt gallegos was off for the day at disneyland with his wife and twin toddlers but agreed to be in by six pm if traffic wasnt too crazy nothing fancy lieutenant right just make it so she doesnt scare anyone broke my finger last week playing ball said gallegos but i can still do pretty good that night at home i checked the late news for the story got a headful of politics and natural disasters a horrific child abuse case that made me turn off the tube and hope i wouldnt be asked to get involved i played guitar and read psych journals and hung with blanche and listened to a disk of anat cohen wailing on her clarinet and saxophones replaying cry me a river a couple of times because that was a great song period robin and i ate chicken and mashed potatoes took a long bath did lots of nothing when she yawned at midnight i joined her and managed to stay asleep until seven am i found her eating a bagel and drinking coffee in the kitchen the tv was tuned to a local affiliate morning show pretty faces prattling about celebrities and recipes and the latest trends in downloadable music she said you just missed that girls face in the news good rendition i dont know what she actually looks like but the overall draftsmanship was okay in that sidewalkartist way i surfed channels finally found an endofbroadcast segment henry gallegos wouldnt be giving up his day job but the resemblance was good enough i tried milo s desk phone hed installed the recorded message that thanked tipsters in an appropriately professional tone and promised to get back as soon as possible the onslaught had apparently begun i finished a couple of reports emailed invoices to attorneys took a run showered milo called just as i was getting dressed tipstorm fortyeight helpful citizens in the first hour including twentytwo flagrant psychotics and five psychics posing as helpful citizens hey i said politicians rely on the psychotic vote he laughed binchy and reed and i have been talking to a slew of wellmeaning folk absolutely convinced brigid is someone they know unfortunately none of the facts fit and theyre all wrong the only decent bit of possible is a youguessedit anonymous tip from a pay phone listen a burst of static was followed by ambient hum rising traffic noise drowned out the first few words that girl at that unbuilt house shaky male voice old or trying to sound old tensecond gap then she been with monte i said those hesitations sound like fear it could be real too scared to use his own phone and leave a name gee thanks and just to keep you current my most weakwilled judge said nyet to subpoenaing the holmans financials so its air sandwich for brunch could you play the message again when the tape ended i said he knows this monte well enough to use a name has seen her with monte but doesnt know her well enough to use her name maybe ive been wrong the two of them had no relationship and thisll turn out to be one of those wrongtime wrongplacers bite your tongue right now im going with mr tipster being too freaked to give me everything he knows damn pay phoneguy was lucky to find one that works where is it venice boulevard near centinela lots of apartments all around i said he sounded elderly the precell generation brigids been seen at borodi by herself maybe she had some connection to itworked for one of the subs and she was the one who initiated the tryst with backer and maybe she knew monteor he knew her because your guess about a tradesman was right on im going downtown get a handson with all the permits for the job who knows maybe itll be constructive at two pm he showed up at my house lugging his scarred vinyl attaché case the customary kitchen scrounge produced last nights chicken and mash a bottle of ketchup stalks of celery in need of viagra everything ingested at warp speed while standing at the counter then chased with a carton of orange juice when he offered blanche a scrap she turned away picky she doesnt want to deprive you empathic she takes the psych boards this year im predicting a pass stooping to pet he sat at the table unlatched the case the general contractor was an outfit named beaudry out in la canada they specialize in big projects got a website full of em not including borodi another confidentiality agreement i pressed a vp couldnt pry a damn thing out including any subs and no knowledge of anyone named monte as if hed tell me different the attaché case rattled twitching atop the table like a frog in a nasty experiment he pulled out his cell phone sturgis youre kidding on my way standing and brushing bits of chicken from his shirt bit of conflict at the dream palace scraps of yellow tape blew in the breeze two uniformed patrolmen held doyle bryczinski by his skinny arms thirty feet up another pair of cops restrained a welldressed whitehaired man who wasnt going down easy shouting one foot stomping the uniforms looked bored bryczinski said hey lieutenant could you tell them this is my turf milo addressed a female officer tagged briskman whats up this one and that one took issue with each others presence loud issue a neighbor phoned we got it as a possible assault when we arrived they were just about ready to tussle no way i tussle said bryczinski why would i tussle hes an old fart this is my turf milo placed a finger near bryczinskis lips hold on doyle can they at least let go of me my arms hurt and i need to get off the leg milo glanced past bryczinski at something big and greenhandled lying just outside the fence bolt cutters doyle just in case in case of what an emergency i put that chain there doyle i wasnt going to cut nothing it was just in case i had to go in for what what i said an emergency such as i dunno another crime a fire why would there be another crime or a fire doyle there wouldnt im just saying saying what i like to be prepared if i search your car doyle am i going to find anything criminally usefulor flammable no way do i have permission to search your car hesitation doyle sure go ahead let go of him guys so he can give me his car key milo rummaged in the taurus came back nothing iffy doyle but im gonna have these officers bring you to my office so we can chat some more i didnt do nothing lieutenant i cant leave im on the job the jobs temporarily suspended doyle what about my car i leave it there ill get a ticket ill put a sticker on the windshield bryczinskis eyes watered if i dont work companyll can my ass well talk at the station doyle everything works out youre back here today but dont mess with neighbors he aint a neighbor hes a maniac claims he owns the place and tried to hit me upside the head when i told him to buzz off charles ellston rutger the man cleared his throat for the third time smoothed back thin white hair cast a derisive look his houndstooth sport coat was highgrade cashmere with working leather buttons suede elbow patches and a cut that said tailormade but the lapels were several decades too wide knifepressed cream slacks broke perfectly over spitshined oxblood loafers his shirt was onceblue pinpoint oxford faded to lavendergray and frayed along the rim of the collar a gold gizmo shaped like a safety pin held the collar in place elevating the windsor knot of a pinegreen foulard patterned with bugles and foxhounds more fabric erosion fuzzed the tie same for a canaryyellow pocket square charles rutgers drivers license made him sixtysix skin as cracked and dry and blotched as the seats of a convertible left open to the elements would have made me guess older hed lied about his height and weight adding an inch or two subtracting the fifteen pounds that strained the buttons of the sport coat the white hair slicked back waxy and furrowed by comb marks was topped by a yellowish sheen heavy eyelids were specked with tiny wens south pasadena address not the fashionable part of that city an apartment unit the single vehicle registered in his name was a fifteenyearold maroon lincoln town car the very same sedan parked haphazardly near the fence bit of a drive from south pasadena mr rutger this is my homestead i can get here in my sleep plummy voice vaguely midatlantic explicitly disapproving you say you own this property i dont say it basic decency says it when i heard about what happened i rushed right over howd you find out the news of course charles ellston rutger tugged his lapels straight the registered owner is a company named dsd towelheads said rutger and i wont shrink from saying so they bomb us and then we kowtow utter rubbish arabs said milo who else oil money otherwise known as blood money came into play oh did it in my day theyd have been told what for not allowed to buy property covenants we called them and a good thing they were turning back toward the framework monstrosity this was a lovely neighborhood put beverly hills and those people to shame those people being beverly hills people hollywood now its them with their oil can you give us names of people associated with ds i cant give you something i never knew said rutger the entire transaction was manipulated by slick jew lawyers youd think theyd avoid each other like the plague jews and towelheads but when it comes to money theres common ground sir said milo were investigating a murder so if theres something you can i know what youre investigating i just told you i heard it on the news and rushed right over absolutely why mr rutger why yes sir why not last i heard this was still a free country mr rutger this is a serious case and i dont have time neither do i officer why did i rush over because ive been violated again again this place was mine officer they took it from me and now blood has spilled barbarians tell me how they took it from you sir tell said rutger i could write you a book in fact ive been thinking about doing just that pillage of the innocent it could be a bestseller given the way people feel about them how about a summary mr rutger why would you want that so i can understand fine fine heres your summary a tragedy that symbolizes everything vulgar this country has become when i was a boy a beautifully proportioned home sat here a lovely georgian revival designed by paul williams not that youd know who that is top architect in the forties and fifties said milo black so he couldnt live in most of the neighborhoods where he worked rutger smoothed his tie be that as it may he knew how to design a home my father paid for it with honest work not by manipulating currency or moneychanging or scheming what business was your father in honest business my sister and i grew up in bucolic splendor not that she cares so what do they do demolish our lineage and put up that his chin quivered visigoths you were opposed to selling dsd the property but your sister disagreed rutger glared havent you been listening they stole it from under me how no answer sir no need to get into any of this officer id like to anyway bully for you but i do not wish to discuss personal matters homicide makes everything public mr rutger that does not concern me more chin calisthenics rutgers eyes filled with tears ripping the pocket square loose he dabbed blasted dust i said you came here because you felt your familys memory was being sullied all over again rutger stared at me youre jewish arent you my father used to play golf with rabbi magnin now there was a shrewd man used family money to build that temple of his big money from san francisco his brothers were haberdashers knew how to turn a nice profit milo said are you making an actual claim of ownership to this property mr rutger i would if i could find a knight errant willing to do battle a lawyer to take your case cowards said rutger okay sir you need to avoid any more confrontationshold on let me finish yes its a free country but freedom means responsibility youre an educated man you know that rutger humphed last i heard this was still a free country sir this is a crime scene no unauthorized entry will be tolerated thats what he saidthat fool in a uniform he was rude and uncouth and i was compelled to take action holding up two fists he refolded the handkerchief repeated until hed produced a perfect dimple im leaving now officer but i will not accept any arbitrary pronouncements banning me from my i have no objection to your driving by mr rutger but please dont stop and try to enter for any reason and if you do observe something out of the ordinary call me heres my number rutger regarded the business card as if it were tainted sir said milo just like that rutger snapped his fingers you command and i obey mr rutger im defining limits to avoid future misunderstanding you may drive by to your hearts content but do not try to enter the property charles ellston rutger drew himself up jacket buttons battled his belly at this time i see no reason to return good choice sir this is america i dont need you to define my choices chapter rutgers town car rumbled off squeaking on bad bearings and belching exhaust milo exhaled well that was different he phoned in rutgers name several moving violations nothing criminal crazy old coot but for all his attachment to this heap i dont see him having the stamina to climb those stairs with a weapon dominate and doublemurder agreed i said and despite his age he doesnt sound like our tipster we drove back to the station where he let doyle bryczinski simmer in an empty interview room and searched the county assessor for the borodi propertys previous owners only one the lanyard a rutger family trust established twenty years previously the trust had sold the place fourteen years later the transaction handled by laurence rifkin esq of rifkin forward and levitsky beverly hills their website pegged them as tax and estate lawyers milo said start at the top phoned and asked for rifkin a mellow baritone came on the line surprisingly quickly larry rifkin here police whats going on milo summed up rifkin chuckled im not laughing about murder im laughing at theater of the absurd good old charlie youve got a history with him i cant believe hes still claiming he was defrauded he was the one who pushed the sale in the first place lieutenant on top of being crazy he must be going senile so any claim of fraud is groundless groundless its insane heres what it boils down to lanyard their fathercharlies and leonas thats charlies sistermade some money in manufacturing and investments but by the time hed died hed lost quite a bit in the market and once debts were settled there wasnt much estate left you know the rich my treasures your junk paintings charlie thought were priceless turned out to be piddling same for a bunch of supposedly rare books that werent first editions the only sizable asset was residential real estate three houses worth maybe five mil at the time the place on borodi was the biggestticket item lan built it back in the forties got paul williams to design the place was gorgeous theres also a chalettype weekend place with a dock on lake arrowhead and a threeacre spread in palm springs lan died ten years ago made it to ninetyone but barbarahis wifedied when she was much younger so everything went to the kids leonas a doctor oncologist lovely lady lan was a perceptive man and named her the executor technically that was logical but it accomplished the obvious family strife charlie strife wemy dad was still alive headed the firmtried to talk lan out of designating leona suggested we should execute or lan could find someone at one of his banks he wouldnt hear of it and charlie went ballistic nuclear pitting one sib against the other is always a disaster and these sibs never had much in common to begin with not that leona didnt try to make nice with charlie you wont meet a more reasonable human being but charlies another matter you dont need to be a psychologist to see why he resents leona shes everything he isnt smart accomplished happily married a gem charlie never got it together charlie has spent nearly seventy years in a dreamstate delusional thats another name for it said rifkin i can tell you all this because we dont represent him and nothings confidential in fact he became our adversary has threatened to sue us numerous times over what over he needs money and thinks leona will give it to him if he makes enough noise who represents him no one he files his own paper thinks hes smarter than everyone else needless to say he gets wiped out every time likes to think hes a lawyer and a stockbroker and a financial advisor and a freelance investor you name it prior to the house being sold he was trying to syndicate the sale of an island off belize lost everything he put into it hes been married four times no kids is basically broke and stuck in a onebedroom in south pas sad but its his own doing leona has tried to be fair offered to set up a trust for him managed by professionals so he can build up a little net worth he accuses her of trying to control him shes never taken a cent as executor has been scrupulous about everything being divvied up fiftyfifty which brings me back to my original point it was charlie who spearheaded selling the properties thats why his bitching about it is so crazy leona didnt want to sell absolutely not her idea was to keep everything in trust for future generations set up a separate management account to take care of expenses but charlie has no kids so he figured she was bypassing him for her heirs i understand that objection said rifkin but its not as if charlie wasnt making money from borodi the house was renting out at twenty grand a month and after tax and management fees he was still netting six figures who were the tenants various industry people needing temporary quarters during shoots not starsproducers directors payments came directly out of the film budgets everything was smooth until charlie started dropping in at the house and demanding to see if they were keeping it up to his specifications needless to say no one wanted to put up with that so byebye studio rental deals which charlie needed a lot more than leona whatever he gets hold of slips right through his fingers so he agitated to sell not just borodi all three properties one of those outoftheblue demands hes impulsive thats his basic problem selling directly contravened the substance and spirit of lans trust leona wouldve been in her rights to tell charlie to screw off but she didnt want to fight so she compromised she was steadfast about palm springs and arrowheadlikes to use both places on weekends and so do her kids and she felt the value of a twoplusacre lot in holmby would keep climbing it paid to wait but charlie kept nagging so she caved the records ive got said it sold for eight million dollars said milo i know what youre thinking said lawrence rifkin four mil each is nothing to sneeze at maybe charlie was the smart one especially given his age the problem is lieutenant once the trust was broken the inheritance tax kicked in toss in commission and other fees and charlie and leona ended up with closer to one and a half million each milo said im still not sneezing no of course not said rifkin not quite convincingly but thats nothing longterm for someone like charlie who still thinks hes a financial genius it didnt take long for him to plow through most of it and start howling that we sold too cheap unfortunately for him hed been involved every step of the way and we had documentation how much is most of it all but half a mil then he had the gall to ask us to represent him so we could cook his books and beef up the deduction meanwhile hes still threatening to sue us refusing him politely took some selfcontrol so he had a half million left he goes to europe several times a year flies firstclass stays at the crillon eats at michelin star restaurants if hes got a hundred k left id be shocked i cant believe hes still screaming about the sale its been a while since i last heard from him and i figured hed finally moved on how long id say two years hold on and ill tell you precisely here it is twentyeight months ago charlie bitching that he needed a new car and leona was refusing to pay for one why should she hes a lousy driver no sense cracking up another one but it wouldnt have mattered if leona had bought him a brandnew rolls every time he gets what he wants he comes back for more as i said he lives in a dreamstate hearing about that murder probably got him fantasizing about being lord of the manor or he just wanted to prevent himself from feeling like an ass so he twisted reality because leona was right eight mil was a fair prize then but the value of the lot has skyrocketed if they sold today theyd probably get twentyfive mil with a nice house on it even without a house lieutenant a parcel that size is highly desirable the folks they sold it to dsd said milo tell me more about them silence mrrifkin im been forthright lieutenant within the limitations of my professional standards charlies fair game for discussion but dsd isnt theres an agreement confidentiality binding confidentiality can you tell me why mr rifkin certainly not lieutenant thats the point everyone dsd has done business with seems to be held to secrecy no reply mr rifkin are we talking some bigtime political types silence foreign intrigue mr rifkin im sorry lieutenant a criminal investigation trumps a civil agreement sir youve gone to law school lieutenant milo wiped his face lets shift gears for a moment sir is there anything you think i should know about charlie or anyone else as it relates to murder you think charlie couldve killed someone two people were murdered may i ask how they were killed gunshot and strangulation well said rifkin charlie does own firearms but the ones i know about are antiques inherited from lan would he use them if he got angry enough i suppose his temper is nasty and he is unstable what about strangulation doesnt that take strength lieutenant strength and persistence then i doubt it charlies health is subpar liver heart prostate diabetes arthritis leona pays his medical bills and theyre extensive and i have to be honest hes a blowhard but ive never actually known him to follow through on anything is there anything about the sale to dsd that could conceivably link to murder rifkin said good try lieutenant milo said all this hushhush is making dsd look more and more suspicious be that as it may lieutenant good luck with your murders doyle bryczinski was on his third can of up milo sat down close scooted closer okay doyle whats the story about what going back there with those bolt cutters nothing sir bolt cutters and talk about crime and fire isnt nothing im sorry sir milo s big hand landed on bryczinskis scrawny shoulder doyle if theres something you want to tell me nows the time to help yourself what do i need help with think about it doyle im thinking i dont need help whyd you go back its my place thats all your place my job i know it better than anyone exactly said milo huh what strikes me doyle is that doing a murder there would be tough for someone who wasnt familiar with the place it gets real dark at night that rear staircase is hidden away youd have to know where to find it be supercareful walking up those wooden stairs without being heard though your shoes do look pretty quiet theyre okay only i never did nothing and no matter any shoes ida been heard why my legs fucked up it drags even with those quiet shoes they got soft soles said bryczinski but also steel arches real heavy to lift milo eyed the soda can if youre thirsty feel free im okay lets go back to the night of the murders and where you were zactly what i told you sleeping and taking care of your mother buying the diapers for my mom this time i got the receipt pulling a scrap from his shirt pocket nine fortyeight like i told you im at the cvs milo examined the date you found the receipt because youve been working on an alibi doyle you asked me all those questions the first time said bryczinski so i looked for the receipt now you got it milo waved the paper this is okay as far as it goes doyle but it really doesnt mean much you coulda gone home driven back maybe coulda but didnt bryczinskis eyes remained calm monte said milo what whos monte doyle aint that a card game its also a mans name not any man i know why the cutters doyle what i said an emergency its a crime scene doyle its a crime scene now but its not gonna be a crime scene forever you dont give me the key to that chain i got to get in emergency said milo like the place burns down what i said was just in case the place burns down i need the job want to do it right you think of it as your place i know it better than anyone they didnt who those two look what happened to them said bryczinski reaching for the soda can he took a long slow sip their fault im not saying that im saying it was stupid to go in there at night whats your theory about the murders doyle they went up there to fool around i dunno maybe some psycho crashed the party thats my point way the chain was before anyone could get in so you should be happy i put on a new one leave the key ill say thank you now i need to get back there can i have that ride happy to arrange it doyle if you take a polygraph before you leave bryczinskis eyes widened company gave me a poly when they hired me i passed with honors ask em for a copy so you wouldnt mind doing it again bryczinski thought hell why not if it dont take too long detective three delano hardy was the closet to a polygraph specialist the day shift had going he hadnt administered the test in over a year wasnt even sure where the gear was but he agreed to look for it ninety minutes later the procedure was over and hardy stepped out of the room shaking his head a little jumpy on baseline but im not seeing deception not even close sorry milo took the printout thanks for trying amigo milo and del had partnered a long time ago until del s devout wife had objected to her husband working with a homosexual del said no sweat big guy good luck a uniform drove bryczinski back to borodi i scanned the poly results milo said you see something nothing but truth i said especially given the anxious baseline hes not a cold psychopath able to fake the machine milo said but he is overinvolved with that site him and charlie rutger must be the edifice complex we returned to his office where he picked up a fresh message slip well well well professor ned holman wants to talk he returned the call professor lieutenant sturgis yes sir of course i remember that so no prob i can be at your house inall right yes i know where it is an hour would be fine dropping the receiver in its cradle he said first time we met him he was all mellow now just the opposite definitely something on his mind wonder what his baseline is chapter ned holman had chosen to meet at a public parking lot in playa del rey the westernmost tip of the district where the neighborhood turns to a village and the ocean washes past dreamily just a few miles past the bird marsh where the bodies of four women had shown up last year minus right hands and facing east milo and moe reed had closed that case solved two other homicides in the process not a word about it as we sped past like a lot of driven people he prefers the agony of living in the moment holmans van was pulling into a handicapped slot just as we arrived other than us no other vehicles the vans door glided back a ramp slid out by the time we were out of the unmarked holman had rolled down in his chair and was watching the breakers he wore gray sweats that accentuated the heft of his upper body and tried to do the same for wasted legs his beard was neatly trimmed his hair plastered down hard to resist the breeze we positioned ourselves between his chair and the sand thanks for coming gentlemen this is a place i go to relax whats on your mind professor holman watched a solitary beachcomber parallel the tideline fishing through sand with a metal detector stopping to inspect something shiny the man tossed it back holman said i see them out here all the time no one ever finds anything smiling maybe everythings already been discovered oh i dont know sir said milo my job im learning new stuff all the time good for you holman licked his lips this is extremely difficult but i feel i need to thick fingers drummed the wheels of his chair i want to be clear at the outset i love my wife she takes good care of me tightening up on the last three words why should i complain if she has needs holmans barrel chest heaved like many people in our situation marjie and i engage in mutual deception she pretends not to miss what we had i pretend not to know shes pretending inhaling thirtyeight years has cemented our relationship makes sense said milo so i dont blame her said holman i wont claim it doesnt bother me but im not tormented the beachcomber picked up something else held it to the light discarded it holman watched with satisfaction grew grim the ones that peeved me were socalled friends of mine and even there i know im being irrational two guys in particular part of our social group after my accident my relationship with them changed because it had been based on tennis basketball squash all that good stuff a heron soared west needlenosed bluegray pterodactyl with a sixfoot wingspread stalking my koi pond the bird would be the enemy out here a magnificent creature ned holman said im running on because i want you to understand marjie shes not some slattern shes a fine woman a buttonpress rotated the chair away from us we shifted to face him western light limned his bulky frame with a bright silver aura sometimes when she goes out i follow her he said not every time not even most of the time i dont know why i do it perhaps its because when she leaves the house grows silent in a rather repugnant way somewhat like a mortuary i suppose and being alone makes me feel moribund marjie makes it easy shes a creature of habit always ends up in the same place places milo looked at me i said wheres that professor holman in the common parlance notell motels said holman washington boulevard near the marina any of four classy establishments i station myself across the street used to convince myself i was doing it for marjies sake so shed be safe of course thats rubbish i do it for the illusion of control though i will say im tiring of it perhaps someday marjie will tire as well i said four motels but there was an exception holmans bright blue eyes fixed on mine im rambling along and you already know the punch line yes there was an exception id decided not to say anything but then it bothered me and i felt incumbent to tell you we appreciate that i hope so id already known about him and marjie im referring to backer of course how did i know because im not an unperceptive dolt there was an office gettogether for the firm cheap wine and stale crackers marjie thought it would be good for me to get out while nibbling i caught her and backer exchanging a glance nothing flagrant but ive had training in picking up nuance and men whove been with marjie get a certain look does that sound paranoid i said theres paranoia and theres reasonable anxiety yes well im not anxious not anymore the games become part of our domestic routine and i find it calms me comfort of the familiar in any event i know a meaningful glance when i see one i wont say it didnt surprise me backer was younger than marjies usual companion that i found a bit disconcerting but as i thought about it what difference did it make this isnt about her feelings for me it never is its about physicality and who better than a younger man so when she told me the following week that shed be staying late at the office i said to myself aha and followed and sure enough backers car was out back and shed parked right next to him the parking lot was small i clearly couldnt stay there and finding parking on main street even with a handicapped sticker isnt easy plus my hot rods not exactly inconspicuouscould i trouble one of you to fetch water from the van its in a holder just right of the armbrake i went over and retrieved a black plastic squeeze bottle the vans interior was spotless but stale smelling no obvious evidence of extreme cleanup when i got back holman was saying so i decided to circlethank you swigging and licking his lips it didnt take long for backers bmw to pull out and head north i followed made sure to allow several car lengthssomething ive picked up from police shows am i right milo smiled good technique professor holman professor emeritus lieutenant thats latin for hasbeen be that as it may when backer reached wilshire and kept going i was surprised he turned east and continued beyond westwood didnt turn until comstock then headed north again to sunset you see where im going with this milo said borodi lane when i saw the news this morning i was stunned mulled for a while and decided i needed to call you good citizen and all that we really do appreciate it sir do i get extra points for humiliation a psychic purple heart perhaps neither of us replied holman said back to borodi lane youll be wanting to know exactly when this occurred correct yes sir and i can tell you precisely april second right after april fools at nine twentyeight pm i keep a log of marjies adventures but this turned out not to be marjies adventure i shouldve known she really is a creature of habit no reason for her to break the pattern she already had behind a construction trailer in santa monica no sense stomping her husbands toehold on dignity milo said backer was there with another woman that woman said holman the one whose face was in the news and yes im certain because she and backer went out to eat afterward and i got a good look at her not your wife but you continued following because in the beginning i was pretty sure but couldnt be certain it was dark when they left they hustled quickly into backers car the woman appeared shorter than marjie different hair different walk but i wasnt close enough to be confident of my judgment so i stayed on their trail whered they go for dinner beverly hills kate mantilini doheny and wilshire fortunately they got a window seat and i was able to cruise by and felt tremendous relief then i realized marjie was still out there and suddenly i needed to know where she was so i called her landline at the office and she answered said she was working on a proposal that would probably end up nowhere because helga never followed through on anything milo said backers car was at the office but you didnt see the woman back there but she mustve been nearby lieutenant because she wasnt inside the office with backer and marjie how do you know this morning marjie and i were watching the news and the womans face came on marjie didnt react in the least i know my wife gentlemen if shed met her shed have said something and shed also have told you when you questioned her so my guess is the woman was either waiting outside the office not in the lot or near it or she was already at borodi when backer arrived was another car parked nearby if there was said holman i didnt notice but i wasnt paying attention to cars he turned to watch the diminishing form of the beachcomber milo said what else can you tell us about backer and this other womans behavior nothing youre sure it was the woman you saw on tv im absolutely certain the image on tv was a line drawing but to my eye a rather good resemblance sheswas a goodlooking woman youngthirty thirtyfive to me thats young good figure great figure voluptuous but taut as if she worked out not too tall id say around five four well below marjies five seven i said when you saw her and backer in the restaurant window what was their demeanor they didnt seem particularly enthralled nor were they miserable two people reading menus i guess id say bland did you ever see the woman again never what about backer him i saw a few times said holman at the office coming and going blinking i have to say marjie having anything to do with him surprised me he didnt seem her type how so shallow how so holmans jaw set his beard bristled no doubt my opinion is informed by the fact that im fairly certain he boffed my wife but id like to think im also a decent judge of character i dont want to talk ill of the dead but to be frank he struck me as a superficial little twit the type who spends too much time at the mirror milo said you didnt like him i didnt know him well enough not to like him milo studied him holmans eyebrows rose youre kidding about what professor youre actually wondering if i couldve done it well im flattered gents that youd think me capable but why would i bother nine men in five years have bedded my wife what reason would i have to wreak vengeance on one particular horny little twit holmans lips clamped tight no i didnt care for backer he was fluff but i dont care for most people and whatever i felt about him did not rise to the level of violence milo said professor we really do appreciate your coming forward most people would have taken the easy way out is there anything else youd like to tell us no sir said holman now youre going to leave and im going to stay here and watch the ocean milo gunned the unmarked past the marsh continued east on culver what just happened helpful selfdemeaning citizen or smart guy playing with us maybe neither i said then what professor holman found a way to unload a whole lot of pentup misery while feeling momentarily heroic free therapy so who bills him you or me you can have it i said poor bastard but he did just admit to being a chronic stalker which fits our jealousy scenario a bunch of middleaged lotharios with his wife is one thing backers youth and vitality pushed him over the edge he kept churning it over and over the rage didnt fade so he hired a hit man who he was able to tip off about borodi being a nookiespot for backer then why call for a meet where he gives himself a motive and admits he resented backer hes an intellectual alex thinks hes smarter than us a linguist to bootwhat do those guys do manipulate language but maybe he just screwed himself by giving me grounds for a warrant on his financials he phoned john nguyen asked the deputy da what he thought nguyen said iffy at best but you can try who do you have in mind milo said judge ferencz turned me down any suggestions not really what about judge hawkins john hawkins died last month damn nguyen said your warmhearted sympathy toward his loved ones is overwhelming if you want i can ask around thanks john im talking a few calls not worth a thanks at lincoln milo switched the police radio to felony muzak too early for waves of afterdark violence but plenty of minorleague infractions to keep uniforms busy i said if holmans not the killer he still gave you something useful backer and brigid were at borodi two months ago lending support for a longterm relationship and suggesting it was a habitual spot for them maybe shes using a false identity out of selfdefense not criminality as in running from a rabidly jealous ex meaning dont lose sight of her as the prime victim okay time for hal again who exactly is he homeland security owes me more than one favor punch punch punch voice mail his second message was more detailed click holman doesnt shake out dirty theres still the fact that brigid was snooping in mastersons files and scoping out borodi by herself i said the elusive dsd inc whom everyone seems to think are arabs and that worries me all i need is some jealous emir as a prime suspect two traffic lights later backing away from all that ive got plenty of mundane local issues to deal with like finding out if any nonantiques are registered to loony charlie rutger scanning the moniker files for particularly nasty montes somehow getting lists of subs who worked borodi and checking for violent felony backgrounds abundance of riches i said id rather have cash chapter reed and binchy listened to their instructions out in the hall because four people cant fit in milos office sean i need you to pay a personal visit to an outfit downtown called beaudry construction the object is to get their employment list going five years back im talking names of every single yahoo who worked for them not just at the borodi site in a perfect world youll find our boy monte beaudrys going to jerk you around because everyone connected to the job signed confidentiality forms but nguyen tells me that doesnt hold water in a criminal case so we can subpoena them said binchy once we have a case we can problem is we need the list for that but threaten them with whatever you think will work they still dont budge contact the state compensation board and backreference the job for tax paper you up for all that someone else mightve taken offense sean flexed a doc marten you bet loot you can go now sean on my way loot reed had watched the exchange expressionless his blond crew cut was fresh he had on the usual blue blazer khakis white shirt and rep tie milo turned to him moses any theories about how we might break through that confidentiality bullshit and find out who these dsd yokels are the general feeling is theyre arabs but no one can say why ive already tried the internet zippo reed said i could coldcall all the middle east consulates ask to speak to someone associated with dsd see if anyone reacts if that doesnt work i move on to the embassies in dc why dont you start with dc in case some consulate type sets off an alarm see if you can find some old directories for when dsd was there maybe the numbers listings been forwarded will do loo in terms of your internet search did you check oilbusiness sites no do it your time situation okay got plenty of time said reed only one case pending that stupidguy shooting on pico two fools in a bar thought you closed it so did i loo turns out its more complicated because they ran the thread and the bullet angles dont fit exactly im not such a big thread fan but if it looks like science juries love it right i got my confession all nailed theres no doubt whodunit but the da wont proceed until everythings buttoned down im waiting for the autopsy to verify the fleshtroughs my vic was supposed to be on the table last week but hes still in the fridge i drive down there this morning thinking im going to pick up the autopsy report all i leave with is excuses das got you being an errand boy reed shrugged whatever gets the case moving crypt must be crazy busy said milo im having trouble getting my female vics autopsy done theyre busy and it just got worse loo one of their cis was murdered last night few blocks away while i was there sheriffs homicide was interviewing i know some of those guys who was it someone named bobby said reed bob norchow no something hispanic milo shook his head what happened from what i picked up attempted robbery gone bad its a tough neighborhood guess no ones immune anyway ive got time loo anything else matter of fact there is im trying to trace a tip that came in from a pay phone on venice boulevard your old turf who at pacific should i call sergeant sunshines okay sunshine said milo hope he brings a glow to my damn day sergeant patrick sunshine recommended milo talk to the car covering that sector of venice a patrolman named thorpe answered thats one of the last coiners still works mostly transient dopers use it once in a while street girls when they dont want to run up their hours milo said my tipster was a male older or trying to sound like it pointed me at someone named monte monte said thorpe nope doesnt ring a bell what time did the tip come in milo checked the stillthin murder book just after six pm could be anyone want me to ask around that would be great thanks phone booth said thorpe darn things on its last legs bet the phone company kills it like all the others chapter i woke up at four am inspired minutes later i was at the computer five hours later i was headed toward milos office he was away from his desk a report from the fingerprint lab sat next to the murder book desmond backers latents had been found on a wall of the turret just to the right of the top step and near the bottom frame of a window hole brigid ochs still listed as jane doe had left palm prints on the floor backers could be explained as reaching for support while he climbed the rickety stairs then sauntering over to enjoy the view the only explanation i could find for hers was a sexual position milo plodded in drinking coffee morning zippitydonothing to you as well he sat drank no ones budging on telling me who dsd is and i cant find a judge who disagrees no callback from hal which isnt his usual style no weapons registered to charles rutger other than flintlocks and muskets classified as antiques he might be nuts but hes never been in criminal trouble lab sent over prints from the scene but they dont mean much just read the report i offered my interpretation sounds about right his phone rang he clicked to conference sturgis a woman said this is dr jernigan from the coroners returning your call thanks for getting back doctor i was wondering if youve had a chance to autopsy my victims the holmby double she said gunshot for your male strangulation for your female that was quick thanks no autopsy was done said jernigan not necessary we also did a rape kit on your female no sexual assault so the semen on her leg what semen there was a stain on her leg i saw it at the scene not when i inspected the body how do you know it was semen im not an expert exactly was it something else doctor silence there was no stain of any kind lieutenant sorry to cut this short but i need to go no autopsy necessary said milo youve been doing this for a while lieutenant so you know we dont cut unnecessarily i xrayed both of them theres a bullet in his head that well pull out soon as we can no metal in her and ruptures in all the right places for all the talk about a crime drop were swamped because the powersthatbe refuse to hire any more staff and the bodies are still coming in faster than we can process twenty minutes ago i received four little kids from a house fire in willowbrook and they do need to be opened up to check for soot in the lungs trust me were taking your case seriously the bullet will be pulled okay thanks sorry about bobby you knew bobby only bobby i know is bobby norchow norchow retired last year this is bobby escobar bright kid spent a couple of years with us then left to get a masters in bio at cal state i heard he got shot near the crypt few blocks away vacant lot thats actually county property said jernigan he was here working we gave him a little space so he could have peace and quiet he had three little kids including a baby oh man oh man indeed for three years he goes through dbs pockets now hes one hows the investigation going sheriff assigned a couple of rookies and theyre calling it robbery gone badhey how about a quid pro you solve bobby and we grant you autopsies on demand for the next five years even when the body doesnt merit it dropping her voice wish i wasnt kidding bye lieutenant he hung up stretched his neck produced crackle and pop welcome to my world i said maybe i can cheer you up sranil whats that an oilrich island near indonesia never heard of it and the government is one of mastersons clientsmajor medical center still on the drawing board given how intimidated everyone seems by the gag agreement and the rumors of dsd being middle eastern i went searching for petrovips whod lived in la within the last ten years coreferenced with masterson no arabs came up but asian royalty did prince tariq of sranil aka teddy by forbess last count his older brother the sultan is worth twelve billion the countrys muslim so maybe thats the source of the confusion according to the blogosphere teddy came here five years ago to go to law school got called back to sranil around two years ago that fits the borodi construction schedule perfectly why was he called back the prevailing wisdom is he partied too much spent too much of his brothers money and guess what the sultans name is daoudhes the sixth of seven daouds in the royal lineand his palaces official name is dar salaam daoud dsd got a full official name for teddy i pulled out my notes tariq bandar asman kuamah majur he swiveled logged onto the departments database like hes gonna be in herewell looky here still on the books for im counting twentysix parkers and three speeders most are on the strip heres one in bhnorth beverly drive another on rodeo dayton the shopping district five different vehicles ferrari lamborghini rolls wonder why he didnt weasel out of it using diplomatic immunity maybe he didnt want to bother or he got booted back home before the traffic nazis came after him too many toys huh sultan controls the purse strings seems to and there could be a personality conflict the sultans devout shows relative restraint for someone that wealthy only a dozen rollsroyces three according to the royal website i said and two are classics he inherited from his grandfather but were not talking the simple life the royal palace is something out of a storybookthink taj majal on steroids that mean a turret whole bunch of turrets the royal site also claims the sultan opens the place to the public several times a year same for his yachtused for charitable fundraisers and a hefty percentage of oil profits gets reinvested in infrastructure and hospitals i cant judge the truth of any of that because freedom of the press is nil but the sultan could have good reason to share the wealth two competing rebels groups are camped in the jungles of indonesia itching to get their hands on his fossil fuel one bunch thinks hes insufficiently religious the others maoist so far theyve spent more time beheading each other but it pays to be careful bread and circuses he said brother teddys profligate ways would be bad pr ergo confidentiality pledges its clearly in mastersons best interest to keep the sultan happy the sranil project is one of their biggest massive healthcare complex a med school stateoftheart research labs luxury residential towers for imported doctors and nurses a complete city based on health care really phase one is an oncology center i called my old department head at western pediatric and hes actually been to sranil as a consultant described the island as a strange placeskyscrapers rising from the sand everything spookily clean and organized but relatively primitive tribes still living in the central jungle he also told me the sultan has personal motivation for that cancer center one of his children was diagnosed with neuroblastoma as an infant sent to england for treatment but died theres no reason to believe any of his other kids will get sick but the sultans being careful help your own buy some international goodwill in the process keep the savages from your door he said so whats prince teddy doing with himself nowadays since he returned hes completely off the radar anything come up about why the borodi property hasnt been sold maybe the sultan hasnt gotten around to it twelve bil he said whats twenty million give or take he swung his feet off the desk interesting alex thanks appreciated the question is does it relate to the murders a knock on the doorjamb made us both turn moe reed said i mightve found something on dsd milo said dar salaam daoud reeds eyes got big so you know about the murder what murder the guy who owned the property on borodi flipping pages of his pad tariq asman allegedly killed someone if my source is credible milo eyed the young detective id invite you in but youve been pumping too much iron and those biceps wont fit the three of us moved to an empty interview room still reeking of intimidation milo made sure the taping system was off shoved the table into the center drew curtains across the mirror lets hear it moses reed said i called embassies in dc got nowhere until i reached the israeli embassy and some guy barks dsd thats not arab its sranil when i asked what sranil was he hung up so i went online learned about sranil including the fact that the indonesians dont like it worry it could be used one day as a base for insurgents so i figured maybe i could take advantage of that and went over to the indonesian consulate its a suite in an office building in midwilshire youd never know from the outside the front office was full of cute girls friendly smiling all of them shined me on claimed theyd never heard of sranil so i leave and when i get to my car one of the girls runs out and says ill tell you about that place but dont come back real nervous and shes taken off her id badge anyway she made it clear she doesnt like the sranil tribe they were barbaric heathens before they became muslims the sultan pretends to be some righteous religious dude meanwhile hes covering up for his brother tariq whos a major lowlife she says thats what youre here about right which takes me by surprise but i say sure thats when she gets into it telling me how theres a rumor tariq killed some foreign party girl in la it got covered up he split i tried to get details out of her but she said she had no firsthand knowledge its just what she heard heard where around said reed thats all shed say and she doesnt like sranil so she could be badmouthing them sure i couldnt find anything on the web about any murder foreign girl as in nonasian said milo as in european she thought swedish but couldnt pinpoint think it means anything loo milo filled him in on my research interesting said reed but im not seeing any obvious link to the borodi murders me neither moses but the fact that our female vic was snooping in mastersons files and mastersons in cahoots with the sranilese government is a start lets try to find out if the rumor about prince tariq has any substance look at unsolveds during the period he lived in la spread a wide net but focus on foreign female vics i said our female victim was a goodlooking woman she couldve been a party girl too friend of the victim said reed maybe shes foreign herself and thats why she faked her identitysome sort of immigration issue milo said cheap clothes says maybe the party was over maybe she was aiming for a big score the borodi site definitely interested her in addition to going there with backer she was spotted hanging around by herself what if the site was a previous crime scene loo tariq brought a girl up there and something went wrongcouldve even been an accident she falls down the stairs or out of a window hole or he really is a scumbag either way hes gone but brigid knows what happened decides to profit if she knew where it happened why bother to snoop in the files okay maybe she knew about the place in general but needed details said reed or she was searching for other real estate tariq owned thinking he might be back and she could get to him i said blackmail could be involved but there could also be a personal component avenging a friend that would explain her bringing backer up there to have sex milo said screw you tariq so to speak but they got spotted twelve bil would make it easy to hire a highgrade hit man sultans already rescued baby bro from one murder whats a couple more ten thousand miles away reed said plus hes a dictator used to having his way i said a dictator who opens his palace to the peasants because he knows hes on shaky sand a fuss about teddy murdering a girl and getting away with it could shift the sands uncomfortably milo got up paced its a great story and i hope to hell its wrong because how could we ever get to someone like that theres also the same big question if borodi was a crime scene why hasnt the sultan unloaded it and why have a lame unarmed wimp guard it parttime reed said what if the bodys buried there all the more so moses dig it up dump it move on why hold on to the place reed had no answer for that and neither did i i pulled out my cell phone seconds later i was hanging up from a frosty chat with elena kotsos shes certain brigid wasnt european pure american which she clearly considers an insult milo sat back down moses stretch that net to the entire state and thanks for coming up with this you done good its my job loo hey kid remember what i always tell you take all of the credit none of the blame better than prozac lad now be off chapter milo ran image searches for the sultan and prince tariq two smallish men who resembled each other with boyish faces cleft chins thin precise mustaches full regalia both of them smiling determination in the sultans eyes despite the show of perfect white teeth discomfort in his brothers milo printed kept surfing female scandinavian murder victim us a young woman from goteborg missing three years seemed promising inge samuelsson had worked as a bar hostess in various european and asian cities tried las vegas vanished but the final citation was happy news shed shown up in new zealand living on a commune tending sheep lucky her said milo south pacific plus all that lanolin the phone rang sean binchy said hey loot finally got employment records out of beaudry they really stonewalled until i threatened to go to the press call them constructiongate creative sean i was actually joking but they bit a couple of suits went into an office and they mustve called a lawyer because they came out announcing the gag agreement didnt apply to subcontractors theyd give me names when they found them but it would take a while there was no central list i said you guys do government projects ive got friends at ins theyre pretty interested in illegals working construction and they went back to check again and said guess what we do have a list problem is they keep all their old records in costa mesa im heading there right now but with traffic its going to be a while time for some ska punk sean pardon play a cd go back to your roots itll lighten the journey ive got a bunch of downloads third day mercyme switchfoot thats all faithbased loot i could use some faith right now sean milo returned to the screen broadened his search to female victims throughout europe had plodded through a nonproductive list when delano hardy stuck his head in and handed him a message slip showed up in my box thanks del why i get your stuff is beyond me were nowhere near each other alphabetically its happened before last week said hardy bunch of solicitations for those fictitious charities pretend to be raising money for cops and firemen those i tossed thanks again del hey youd do the same for me hardy left and milo read the slip sat up and punched air and said welcome back teach backers sister ricki is home from yosemite and wishes to talk i said recess is over ricki flatts voice said she was expecting bad but not that bad milo tried to be gentle but theres no easy way and she wept for a long time he stretched to turn the volume down on the conference setting but it was already on low she said oh god desi i dont understand was it a mugging some random thing tensing up i was sure on random milo heard it too his eyebrows climbed were still trying to sort things out ms flatt so anything you can tell us would be helpful youre in la what could i tell you did your brother have any enemies maam of course not ratcheting up her pitch on not ms flatt your brother didnt die alone a woman was with him and we still havent identified her if we knew who she was it would speed up the investigation i know this is a tough time for you but if i could scan her photo and email it to you that would help of course do it said ricki flatt im sitting here and not moving not even to unpack ten minutes later oh my god thats doreen doreen who what was her last name doreen fredd two ds i think though how i remember that i couldnt tell you she and desi knew each other back in high school when we lived in seattle thats where desi and i grew up her nose is differentsmallerbut its definitely her anything romantic between them they were more like friends but i really cant say im three years older than desi didnt get into his personal business doreen fredd milo entered the name into the databases what else can you tell me about her ms flatt she and desi used to go hiking together they all dida group of kids they liked the outdoors one time i was already in college visiting home for midsemester break desi and his hiking group came in and doreen had poison ivy or some bad rash our dad tended to her he was firefighter with paramedic trainingbut you dont care about that youre saying desi was dating her in la there appears to be a romantic connection doreen she said and shes also my god anything else you want to tell us ms flatt not really tight voice for the third time nothing at all maam silence ms flatt what happened to desi was it in any way political milo sat up political how forget that im not making sense do you need me to identify the body lieutenant no maam we know its your brother and verification can be made using photos but i would like to talk to you some more ill come out she said to handle arrangements ive done it before my parents i never thought id be doing it for my baby brotherhow did you connect desi to me phone messages maam oh that mustve been the times desi called to talk to sammy daughter if i can catch a flight ill leave tonight lieutenant ill have to make sure scotts okay with that oh god im going to have to explain to sam this is unreal ms flatt could you please clarify that remark about it being political silence maam lets talk in person lieutenant ive got so many things to do ncic had nothing to say about doreen fredd neither did dmv social security any other port in cyberspace still a phantom milo logged off and sister ricki gets all squirrelly about something political this is starting to smell real bad alex turning to his phone he punched numbers so hard the apparatus jumped hal this is milo for the third time is it my breath or are you on some sort of overpriced taxpayer junket and cant be bothered to help the locals ive got a name for my jane doe no thanks to you doreen fredd spelling it with exquisite enraged enunciation and guess what hal even with that shes a ghost not even an ssn so now im thinking your not calling back isnt negligence its proactive deception which is bullshit hal you owe me bigtime on that aeromexico thing and i need you to come through all in the name of god country and my ready access to the chief hal who will not be happy to learn that no good deed has yet again gone unpunished slam he slumped ready for my closeup mr demille i said ready access to the chief the federal government understands entitlement ends justifies the means political the obvious link is teddy but what the hell would a newly graduated architect have to do with sranil maybe he had a previous life as what a superspy as something political i said or maybe given his libido hed partied with teddys alleged victim whom he met through doreen the two of them cooked up the blackmail scheme leaned too hard and paid for it pretty damn stupid to think they could go up against someone that powerful how much of your job revolves around smart people big guy and backer being involved could explain how brigdoreen ended up at masterson teddys name doesnt appear on any of the borodi paperwork but that design journal listed the firms involvement in a piedàterre for a foreign owner backer was an architect thats his type of reading material he does background doreen worms her way in to get the details the two of them somehow send a message to tariq or the sultan one of them makes a call and a local pro is hired or even someone flown in for the job morons he said thinking they could play in that league then they have the nerve to go up there again for fun under the stars fouling the rich bastards nest in the process freuds probably got a name for that huh der payback tight lips parted slightly emitting something close to a smile he pressed psychic delete and turned grim again desi and doreen hugging a tree plotting chapter at six twenty just as we were leaving for dinner john nguyen dropped in the deputy da was dressed for court in a navy pinstripe white shirt blue tie american flag lapel pin four evidence boxes were stacked on a wheeled luggage rack nguyens posture was as straight as ever but his eyes drooped john whats up nguyen unclasped the top case pulled out a sheaf of printouts and dropped it on milos desk mr and mrs holmans financials you owe me milo scanned the face page howd you pull it off been doing a robberygangbang trial for three days running brandnew judge absurdly biased toward our side so i figured she might go for your spurious logic licking a finger nguyen slashed air vertically score one j n i got one of my eager new interns to push everything through with the banks which id like to point out is normally your responsibility not mine not to mention significantly below my pay grade but you put in the time on the marsh murder trial so consider it an advance christmas gift milo flipped pages your stocking stuffers on the way john dont see anything interesting thats cause there isnt any said nguyen hes a retired professor shes an unfamous architect their income expenditures retirement fund et cetera are all commensurate with a cautious mature lifestyle meaning they can probably keep their house and continue to have health insurance if they dont get really sick or go out to eat too often this is definitely all of it john what some secret bank account for paying hit men they budget tighter than my exwifesnever mind nguyen moved toward the door i can lead a judge to warrant dude but i cant stop the stink we walked a couple of blocks to café moghul the indian place that serves as milos supplementary office he tips huge is dramatically omnivorous and the owners are convinced his grumpymastiff demeanor wards off danger the bespectacled woman who works the front always beams when he lumbers through the door begins piling on the food before his chair warms tonight was lamb beef turkey lobster three kinds of naan a garden plot of vegetables he bore down as if tackling a massive culinary puzzle i said hail to the sultan of west la he wiped sauce from his face keep your geography straight rajah for one brief cinderella moment then the pumpkin appears then its back to untouchable midway through his fourth bowl of sweet kir rice pudding sean binchy strode in brighteyed and cheerful as ever give me some good news kid then you can eat no thanks loot beckys cooking tonight and thats always a treat more like good news and bad news i got lots of names of construction workers but no montes or anything close whats the good news im going to analyze it supercarefully uttered with absolute sincerity thats great sean binchy said anything with an m for starts and if that doesnt produce ill just check every single name for felony records like you always say tortoise beats hare he left milo said tortoise sometimes gets squashed in the middle of the highway by an eighteenwheeler but sure keep the faith kid he phoned me at eight the following morning sister rickis due in my office in an hour ill be there thought you might also want to know that doreen fredd is indeed a real person i searched genealogy sites last night found a distant cousin living in nebraska emailed the photo family hasnt seen doreen for years but verified that she got sent to seattle when she was a teenager naughty girl ended up in a group home why seattle the family originally hailed from tacoma where doreens daddy worked at a gas station and mommy clerked at a food store nice people according to the cousin but major alkies no parental supervision doreen started running away at an early age finally the court declared her incorrigible the home worked out for a while but doreen split from there too she stepped off the map no ones heard from her in all this time she was an only child and both parents are dead is the group home still in business it is but theres been half a dozen changes of ownership no staff remains from when doreen was there all the old records have been destroyed her hooking up with des backer makes sense though i backtraced his parents residence south seattle only a few blocks from the home cute girl cute guy chemistry kaboom chemistry reignited years later i said the wrong kind of explosion i showed up for the meet with ricki flatt on time found her talking to milo des backers sister was faded by grief and fatigue long curly hair was tied back carelessly she wore a baggy gray sweater unsuitable for the weather mommy jeans white tennis shoes a huge canvas purse the color of smog lowered her right shoulder an overnight bag of matching hue sat on the floor milo lifted the suitcase and escorted her to the same room wed used to powwow with moe reed he offered her coffee something to eat she touched her belly i couldnt hold anything down please tell me what happened to my brother mr backer and doreen fredd were found murdered in an unfinished house in a neighborhood called holmby hills ever hear of it i havent your brother never mentioned holmby hills never where is it its an extremely highend area just west of beverly hills theres an indication your brother and ms fredd had been to that location before an unfinished house a construction project something desi was working on instead of answering milo said so your brother and ms fredd hung out in high school nod and during the plane ride i remembered something else one time when she was at our house my dad made a comment to mom about her being troubled it was good she was aiming for wholesome activities you didnt say if the project was one of desis it doesnt appear that way maam this was what youd call a supermansion then for sure it wouldnt be desis not into that kind of thing he wouldve considered it grotesque but if he wasnt working on it why would he be there thats what were trying to figure out ms flatt this hiking group desi and doreen had how many people are we talking about just a few other kids i really wasnt paying attention and to your knowledge desi and doreen werent romantically involved i thought about that said ricki flatt maybe i really cant say desi had so many girls who liked him they were always calling him dad used to joke he needed a personal secretary do you have any knowledge of his other recent girlfriends head shake sorry i wasnt involved in my brothers personal life back then and that didnt change after we grew up did you know that doreen lived in a group home not far from your house no but you must mean hope lodge that place was the talk of the neighborhood my friends joked about it called it ho lodge because the girls were wild im not saying they were but you know how kids talk thats probably why my dad said she had problems was he worried about her being a bad influence on desi ricki flatt smiled my parents made a big thing about desi and me developing our own sense of right and wrong but even if they had tried to rein desi in it wouldnt have worked my brother did exactly as he pleased milo said did desis strong will lead to anyi have to ask thisiffy behavior what do you mean anything out of the ordinary if you consider leaving home after high school and hitting the road for ten years out of the ordinary sure ten years said milo ten lost years said ricki flatt basically desi disappeared once in a while wed get postcards from where all over the country national parks that kind of thing not overseas no what did desi do to support himself he said odd jobs temporary stuff that gave him time to explore nature figure life out postcards said milo no visits back home once twice a year hed pop upchristmas thanksgiving birthdays he looked great really happy and that reassured my parents he was reviving the whole sixties thinglong hair beard hemp sandals but always clean and well groomed dad said he looked like hollywoods idea of jesus you mentioned handling your parents affairs so i assume gone lieutenant four years ago they were vacationing near mount olympia decided to explore and drove onto a dirt access road that passed through a heavy logging area a load of huge pines came loose from a truck bed and crushed their car we wanted to suescott and i and desbut the lawyers said our case was weak because the road was chained and warning signs were all around dad had lifted it and driven through anyway in the end we settled for a hundred thousand the lawyers took forty percent and we split sixty with des hed cleaned up his act and started architecture school said it would help with tuition and living expenses what made it horribly ironic is were from an old logging family four generations my grandfather was a master sawyer and dad did some logging before he became a firefighter im sorry maam it happened before sam was born thats what hurts the most mom and dad wouldve loved sam tears she adored desi and now hes gone how did desi react to losing your parents terribly said ricki flatt he got this empty look in his eyes walked around for weeks as if he was in a trance the walking wounded scott called it ive never seen my brother like that generally hes open and mellow and accessible he drew into himself i remember thinking this isnt healthy he needs to deal with it do some serious grieving or hes going to break down i was sure hed drop out of school but he didnt he stuck with it and graduated with honors milo tapped his pen on a corner ms flatt that remark you made yesterday on the phone about it being political were still curious about that ricki flatts eyes jumped all over the place forget that that was silly i shouldnt have said anything but you did maam she untied her hair shook it loose fastened it tighter ricki we have no interest except solving your brothers murder thumping both elbows on the table she pressed her palms to her cheeks her fingertips trailed above her ears as if blocking out noise see no hear no milo said the only thing weve heard remotely political about your brother is he was into green architecture the whole environment thing ricki flatts left cheek twitched milo edged closer did he get radical with that spend those ten years doing things that might be considered illegal i dont know how he spent them but youre worried desi used to talk about what burning down the house she said that was the name of a song he liked when he visited hed sometimes go off on speeches about the beauty of untouched wilderness about greedy people who raped the land and built monuments to their ego what they needed he said was a good lesson monuments said milo like the one he died in and now youre worried he put himself in a bad position ricki flatt looked up oh god i shouldve known something bad was going to happen when he gave me the money desis never been able to hold on to money hes never cared about money no need for milo to press he gave her a tissue waited until shed patted her eyes dry all right she said this is what happened des showed up six months ago with fifty thousand dollars in cash two big suitcases full he asked me to hold it for him i gave him a spare key to the unit were talking last january said milo new years weekend scott and i were about to leave for a trip to new mexico and des showed up no advance notice did he say where he got the money i know i shouldve asked scott was furious with me said it had to be drug money or something else illegal and id gotten us in way over our heads i said that made no sense desi had never used dope or alcohol took care of his body scott told me i was being naïve desi had been on the road for years we had no clue about what hed done we got into a big fight scott demanded i call desi back insist he take the suitcases shrill laughter it was pretty darn dramatic of course i finally agreed so you called your brother ricki flatt hung her head i lied to scottonly time ive ever done that why for the life of me i wish i could tell you i just couldnt bring myself to confront desi theres something about my brother that makes you want to say yes to him hes so sweet and directin high school he was voted most popular it wasnt just girls who loved him everyone did i said charisma yes but for me it was more than that with mom and dad gone there was no one else i guess i kept hoping wed reconnect be some kind of family sam seemed to be a vehicle for that burying her face in her hands she mumbled milo said you still have the money youre worried its political ricki flatt looked up when desi brought it to me he seemed nervous made me promise not to ask questions i keep thinking it was payment for something wrong burning down the house maybe not literally she said but something why else would he hide the money i promise to send it back to you as soon as i get back home but please dont tell scott i kept it where is it our storage unit scott and i rented one after mom and dad passed for their stuff i couldnt bear to get rid of anything i tucked the suitcases in back behind moms piano scott never goes in there so desi had a key to the unit i gave him one they were his parents too whens the last time you actually saw the money the last time she said had to be a couple of weeks after i stored it so five months ago give or take i went in there and counted it id never counted it initially why once again i dont know fifty thousand in fiftydollar bills bound neatly do you really think it has something do with what happened to desi moneys the most common motive we see ricki oh god i told scott he was being paranoid but now im getting sick she grabbed milos wrist is my family in danger i would hope not said milo but we do need to get the money in a secure place i promise ill send it straight to you i was going to stay for a few days to arrange for desi to be flown back but ill leave today have the suitcases shipped first thing in the morning please dont touch them said milo we need to process them first process fingerprinting that kind of thing ill arrange for everything after you sign some forms releasing the contents of the storage bin for inspection is there anything else in your unit that belonged to desi no said ricki flatt ill fill out anything you need draw you a diagram showing where i put them i just want them out of there ill handle it ricki are scott and sam in danger please i need an honest answer ive got no indication your familys a target really really thank god gazing up at the ceiling what did you get me into desi chapter ricki flatt filled out the search authorization milo asked her where she was staying i came straight from the airport did you rent a car i took the shuttle to westwood then a cab ill get you a place theres a victim compensation fund but itll mean more forms and take a while to get compensated i dont care about that her hands waved restlessly milo called sean binchy over from the big droom binchy was still poring over lists of construction workers with nothing to report find ms flatt a clean safe place to bunk down binchy lifted her luggage the star inn on sawtelle has the triple a rating cable and wireless and theres an ihop right up the block whatever said ricki flatt after the two of them left i said political as in baby brother might be an ecoterrorist it would take more than backer spouting off for her to worry about that yeah she knows more said milo but pushing her right now didnt feel right ill have sean keep an eye on her make sure she sticks around backers lost decade preceded his parents death but their being crushed by logs couldve kicked up his motivation fifty grand to blow something up like a big house but he never got to it on the other hand the money could be from dope or a blackmail payoff or he won big at the tables and gave it to ricki to avoid the taxman we returned to his office where milo called officer chris kammen the port angeles cop agreed to watch the flatt residence as much as we can and to handle the search of the storage unit as soon as the paperwork came in two suitcases what color look for the ones behind the piano stuffed with cash fifty grand said kammen his whistle pierced the room so the husbands out of the loop huh flatt doesnt know his wife held on to the money shes playing nice and i want to stay on her good side domestic issues said kammen fun a fourth try at federal hals office left milo redfaced disconnected number this is starting to feel personal i said sure but maybe its not you its doreen fredd what the hell was this girl into she knew backer years ago if he was into bad stuff shed be a good choice to gather info problem child becomes an undercover fed or her problems got her into a situation where she needed to trade favors id look into major ecovandalism in the pacific northwest during backers years on the road shes finking on backer and screwing him gives a whole new meaning to undercover that part could still be chemistry i said good technique on her part too given backers proclivities guys into blowing stuff up then becomes an architect and learns to build stuff dont tell me freud didnt have a word for that moe reed stuck his head in someone to see you loo better be important fbi important depends what they have to say said milo but he was up in a flash a short solidly built darkhaired woman arrived moments later lieutenant gayle lindstrom i was referred by a mutual friend gray pantsuit black flats molasses accent with an edge maybe northern kentucky or southern missouri fair skin and blue eyes were clear her chin was prominent and square nice to meet you special agent lindstrom lindstrom grinned my mom always told me i was special realitys a little different her bag was as large as ricki flatts black leather authoritative straps and buckles mutual friend said milo now who might that be yesterday he was hal today she shrugged you guys love that dont you what topsecret clandestine hoohhah only when it gets the job done she studied me we need to talk in private lieutenant this is dr delaware our psychological consultant you have your own profiler now better said milo weve got someone who knows what hes doing looks like i caught you on a bad day said lindstrom not hard to do she offered me a cool firm palm nice to meet you doctor no offense but i need to speak to lieutenant sturgis in private milo said thats not how its gonna be a long whispered phone call later and i was authorized gayle lindstrom peered into milos office kind of cozy for three milo said ill find us space i like indian food lieutenant he glared at her lindstrom said sorry i couldnt resist not hungry he marched up the corridor lindstrom said oh well and followed back to the same interview room i wondered if it ever got used for suspects gayle lindstrom sniffed the air milo said this is as fresh as its gonna get im busy talk lindstrom said enough icebreaking guys dont coddle me cause im a girl coaxing a smile out of milo he hid it with the back of his hand yawned okay okay she said what do you know about ecoterrorism milo said uhuh this isnt going to be some theoretical discussion you want what we know you better fill in the blanks desmond backers lost decade smells real bad doreen fredd was a naughty girl who ended up as either a confederate or your informant go lindstrom nudged her bag with one foot im here because the bureau figured it was only a matter of time before you figured out some of whats going on some dont swell my head if you knew all of it you wouldnt be trying to reach hal who by the way cant help you hes homeland security so hes concentrating on people with dark skin and funny names so is the bureau for that matter which is part of the problem before we were geared up to spend serious time and money on locally grown lunatics who in my humble opinion pose just as serious a danger to public safety as some guy named ahmed everything stopped to look for ahmed were just like you lieutenant chronically underfunded with our hands out to politicians who have the attention span of gnats on crack the hot topic of the moment gets the appropriation and everything else gets shoved to the bottom shelf ecoterrorists have committed hundreds of violent acts with plenty of fatalities were talking nasties who believe humanitys a plague and have no problem spiking trees to mutilate loggers fanatics who burn down other peoples houses because they dont approve of the square footage nothings happened on a grand scale yet and theyve got the secret sympathy of some mainstream environmental groups who condemn violence but continue to wink and nod but my judgment is its only a matter of time before the country regrets not dealing with the problem desmond backer was a serious ecoterrorist lindstrom toed her bag again its a delicate situation not for me personally were talking events that precede my tenure with the bureau she unclasped the bag pulled out lip balm twisted her mouth into a disapproving little bud and lubricated basic delay tactic id learned a whole bunch of them working as a psychologist milo said lost my script whats my next line the overview im about to give you lieutenant is based on summaries of files transferred to me by predecessors whove been transferred they get transferred to ahmed but youre dealing with homegrown naughties no one cares about gayle lindstroms half smile would have intrigued da vinci milo said you dont play well with others so youre on timeout she laughed lets just say ive been assigned to look into years of ecocrimes and write reports unlikely to be read my instructions are to concentrate on the pacific northwest because thats where fuzzies and trees tend to inspire the most passion that led me to your homicide victims desmond backer and doreen fredd met in seattle he grew up there and shed been sent to a group home for problem girls she utilized legitimate passes from the home as well as illicit exits to associate with backer and his friends climbing out the window said milo or just sneaking out the back door the place wasnt exactly supermax lockdown like many teenagers fredd and backer and their friends appear to have filled some of their free time with various vegetative hallucinogens alternative music video games they also spent time engaged in apparently wholesome activities such as hiking camping environmental cleanups volunteer wildlife rescue unfortunately some of that may have been a cover for arson and other acts of vandalism were they ever arrested insufficient evidence said lindstrom but their proximity to several trashed homesites is revealing what exactly do you have on them what the local police had on them was wordofmouth then a dead boy they killed someone not directly but they have moral culpability out came his pad name of the victim vincent edward burghout known as van seventeen when he burned to death inside an unfinished mansion in bellevue washington by now youve probably heard of bellevue because its where hightech zillionaires are building castles back then that had just started and it was basically a nice lowcrime suburb of seattle one of the first techiemonarchs to see the potential of lakeside living bought ten acres and started building a twentythousandsquarefoot monstrosity it had gotten as far as the framing the night van burghout sneaked in and set several fires he destroyed a good part of it but also immolated himself wemy predecessorsfound his technique especially interesting have you ever heard of vegan jello sounds disgustingly healthy not if youre made of wood said lindstrom or flesh and bones its basically homemade napalmsoap and petroleum triggered by a delayed ignition device any idiot can get the recipe off the internet or in one of those treasonous loonytracts put out by the paranoid press fortunately few idiots actually go as far as to whip the stuff up but over the years we have had incidents and the mortality rate is high often to the perpetrators youre talking a highly incendiary concoction and if your timers off youre toast or in van burghouts case crumbs there was nothing left of the kid they idd him because hed gotten teeth knocked out playing basketball and part of an upper bridge survived the blast she fooled with the tube of lip balm mr hightech collected insurance donated the land to the city for a park moved to oregon and built an even bigger monstrosity on a thousand acres everyone walks away happy said milo except vans parents who pointed fingers at vans friends maybe because they couldnt accept their son being a solo pyromaniac but that doesnt make them wrong i said van was the victim of bad influences exactly but like i said there was logic to that vans grades were barely passing and the local law got a clear picture of him as impressionable but they got nowhere and called the bureau in thats how the bureau came to acquaint itself with desmond backer and doreen fredd and their pals how many pals the burghouts gave the locals four names in addition to van backer fredd a boy named dwayne parris a girl named kathy vanderveldt we tried to talk to them as well as to their teachers and friends tried these were middleclass kids with oodles of parental and community support so we got no direct access everything was filtered through lawyers were talking upstanding folk well respected in their community claiming their kids were angels i said doreens parents stepped forward no she was the exception her parents were drunks living out of state seemed barely in touch with what doreen had been doing also doreen was gone by the time we began investigating yet another rabbit said milo lindstrom said sure we got suspicious about the timing but splitting was her habitual pattern and everyone we talked to said they couldnt imagine doreen involved in anything violent just the opposite she was passive gentle into poetry blue skies green trees little cutiepie mammals the folks at hope lodgethe homehad nothing bad to say about her either poor doreen was a victim of family dysfunction not a wild girl i said did they change their minds when they found out shed been sneaking out to meet up with the others not according to what ive read doctor my predecessor described the people running the place as idealists which is bureau code for stupid naïve dogooder we were able to get a warrant for doreens room because a lot of hope lodges funding came through government grants unfortunately nothing funny showed up there and we brought in dogs the works milo said no warrants for the others not even close we went judgeshopping but the one we thought might work with us said he wouldnt authorize a witch hunt we put out a nationwide alert for doreen placed the other kids under surveillance for a couple of months it came to nothing there were no more fires in bellevue or anywhere else in the greater seattle area we moved on but at some point you found doreen and managed to turn her lindstrom pinched her upper lip balanced the lip balm tube between two index fingers is this the point where i say oh sherlock and go all wideeyed milo said why else would you be here gayle lindstrom removed her gray suit jacket underneath was a red tank top square shoulders thick but firm arms its kind of dry in here dont you think must be your ac could i trouble you for some coffee chapter detectiveroom brew has the refreshing tang of roofing tar and a methlike ability to scrape the nerves raw special agent gayle lindstrom downed half a cup without complaint rubbed her eyes stretched and yawned and stretched again milo goes through a similar act when hes faking casual lindstrom needed more practice taking another sip she finally gave the expected grimace set the cup aside yes doreen finally surfaced i had nothing to do with it but it still makes me cringe reaching for the cup she deliberated another swallow decided against it nothing the bureau did pulled her in her own stupidity did she did a bad thing and got caught said milo she got busted for prostitution and dope five years ago want to take a wild guess where seattle heart of the city downtown i wouldnt be surprised if she never left even though she spun us all kinds of tales about hitchhiking around the country living off the land none of her details came together correctly and what i get from her file is the bio of a naturalborn compulsive liar i said des backer traveled around the country for ten years did she claim to be with him as a matter of fact she did doctor not as a constant companion off and on she spun weird yarns about living in forests eating roots and shoots foraging for wild mushrooms whatever but like i said when it came to closing the deal on the finer points as in dates towns cities states she fell apart bureau shrinks labeled her a histrionic personality milo said they examined her ive seen no clinical report i said meaning the diagnosis probably came from reviewing the file do you disagree with the diagnosis doctor i dont know enough to agree or disagree lindstrom frowned no offense but the psych stuff doesnt really matter does it same for fredds naturegirl tales maybe part of it was true maybe she was double triple quadruplebluffing the point is no ecocrimes during that period can be traced to her so either she was real good at covering her tracks or she and the other seattle kids werent any big deal in the first place i said five years ago des backer was in architecture school doreens turning to prostitution around then says theyd probably parted ways well before and im just trying to nail down the time line i wont argue with your logic milo said so she gets busted for hooking howd that lead to federal snitch lindstrom said i havent said anything about turning her her identity was erased cut the crap lindstrom played with a strap of her tank top yes we turned her but it wasnt the prostie part that scared her it was the dope were talking kilos of weed pills in neat little bags plus some chunks of rock enough to put her away for a real long time she was a majorleague dealer the stuff was found in the basement of a rooming house where she habitually took johns downtown seattle not far from the pike market she just happens to be rooming with all that sitting on top of it said lindstrom literally one of those underthebed trapdoors right below her bounceforbucks mattress doreens bad luck was popping pills in front of a john who turned out to be undercover seattle vice she claimed it was advil and that was later verified but meanwhile the room got seriously tossed the city had just instituted one of those temporary moral crusadestoo many tourists hassled by lowlifesso warrants were a snap doreen claimed she had no idea the hatch existed in the first place had never even looked under the bed maybe thats even true lots of girls used the same room and the building was owned by a couple of cambodian restaurateurs suspected of bringing in all sorts of bad stuff by the time the bureau got called in they were gone and wrapped in layers of paper that deadended in phnom penh our plan was to confiscate the entire property under the rico statutes but seattle pd claimed the prize as theirs theres a cute little shopping center there now designer coffee sushi bar italian café with great pastries yuppie gym tanning salon too which could come in handy in drizzle city youve visited recently i was there yesterday trying to learn what i could about doreen after we found out what happened to her here whatd you learn not a thing smile i did have a good panini at the italian place how long since you had contact with doreen i never had contact with her said lindstrom i inherited her and a bunch of others like her if that sounds defensive it is bunch of snitches living off tax dollars who end up burning you business as usual gayle the skin above lindstroms neckline turned rosy like it never happens to you guys i happen to know for a fact that six years ago one of your best female vice ds was set up as a pimp in an apartment in hollywood not some decoy thing lapd had a genuine d two hiring and working reallife hookers on the street running everything real businesslike keeping books recording income all so you could pull in highprofile johns because a feminist on the city council screamed loud enough to get heard so what happens to your grand plan the street girls your d is supposed to boss slip her a roofie strip her naked take pictures of her being ganged by some of their thug boyfriends put the photos online and abscond to mexico with the cash theres police work at its best milos expression said hed never heard any of it before gayle lindstrom said news to you huh well then thank the lapd obstruction squad my point is milo we all win some lose some and we all cover our collective butts yes the bureau thought doreen might be useful because during the same period she claimed to be naturegirling with backer the whole ecocrazy scene had heated up in a really nasty way im talking two small children of a genetics researchertoddlers for gods sakewith thirddegree burns after animal liberation nuts set fire to the family house because daddy ran rats im talking a bunch of loggers near the washingtoncanadian border getting blinded and losing limbs due to tree spikes a ronald mcdonald house sprayed with threatening graffiti then overrun with live rats with families living there families of kids with cancer for gods sake all because someone doesnt like big macs these people are lunatics and theyre vicious and in addition to that at least a dozen residential construction projects had been turned to charcoal so why wouldnt we try to use doreen everyone knew the dope really wasnt hers why not deal i said what made you think doreen had anything to offer she told my predecessors that she did started spilling the minute they had her in lockup claiming all sorts of insider knowledge about the most radical fringe of the movement people shed come into contact with during her years on the road what made her credible was her insistence on getting a pass for herself on anything she talked about implying she had been more than a bystander milo said but lindstrom turned to him youre enjoying this way too much but fine ill open a vein for you we protected her and she screwed us over happy father oshaughnessy how many hail marys do i need to do milo didnt answer she said looking back its easy to see the pattern but at the time what was the pattern once fredd was cleared of the dope charge she put off blabbing by claiming she was scared for her life needed a new id a safe house in another city a spending allowance that took months once she was set up she faked depression said she had no energy to deal with life made suicidal noises bureau assigned a physician to give her a full checkup and a review by a shrink i said not the one who labeled her histrionic no a doc who thought she was a sociopath but we needed to go along with it not confront her several more months then she brought up a new medical issue plastic surgery said milo lindstrom glared dont play with me am i repeating stuff you already know it came up on her external exam at the morgue whyd doreen want her nose nubbed all of a sudden what do you think im scared i need to change my appearance des backers sister recognized her even with the nose so why didnt she go for something that really worked like i said hindsights twentyten for all i know she just wanted to look cuter and use our tax dollars to pay for it i said surgery then recuperation a few more months of delay by the time she got talking over a year had passed it started off promising she spit out all sorts of horrendous stuff including nonsense about an interface between domestic econuts and foreign terrorists some major armageddon conspiracy but like i said it all deadended milo said she give you anything righteous like most liars she spiced up her bullshit with morsels of reality piddling stuff but just enough to keep us going like what false reports of endangered species sightings in order to halt public projectsphony dna smeared on trees that kind of thing nonviolent fishhuggers setting out in canoes and cutting up nets greenies perched in old venerable trees so they wouldnt get chopped down for shopping centers whichoff the recordi cant say bothers me giant redwood gets that old for gods sake let it live out its golden years in peace and when i drive through miles of clearcut dirt where a forest used to be it doesnt make me feel patriotic in any event doreen snitched minor league nothing came of it but it took us a while to chase down all her bum leads did you go back and question her about the dead kid in bellevue you bet we did said lindstrom she never wavered from her initial story she was snugly bedabye at hope lodge the night it happened was sure none of her pals were involved theyd never do something like that she did mention backer being her travel companion i said but she didnt incriminate him in anything doctor in fact each time we brought his name up she made him out to be johnny appleseed not some maniac firebomber still we checked him out and like you said he was in architecture school channeling his green impulses in a socially acceptable manner milo said how soon after you gave her deep cover did she split shes been off our screen for thirty months two weeks and three days said lindstrom you want hours and minutes ill go back to my federal cubicle and use a calculator i was assigned her fileand othersa little over a year ago have been staring at her face with nowhere to go all of a sudden there she is on the evening news and i just about spew my lean cuisine your artist did a pretty good job my name was on the screen too gayle so instead of picking up the phone you tell hal to stonewall no choice the directive came from on up when milo didnt respond she said like its different with you im sensing a theme here gayle everyone does it as a defense what do you want from me said lindstrom flash back to your hollywood d all roofied up with her legs spread and guess what you wont find a trace of those dirty pictures anywhere on the web any written record of the operation period what comes from on top filters down to the peons our job is to clean up messes fine said milo kafkas god and were all cockroaches but even bugs know how to be social why did your bosses want to obstruct me they wanted to make sure everything was squared up before we interfaced as in cleaning doreens file of anything useful so as not to look stupid as in getting my own facts straight as in a sudden trip to seattle yesterday morning in a coach seat next to a snoring fat guy if i hadnt bugged hal would we be sitting here gayle i cant answer theoretical questions said lindstrom point is im here and i told you what i know about doreen if it helps you close her out ill celebrate along with you because one of my assignments is to get her the hell off my desk then write a bullshit report im a cockroach enabler first enable some more as in telling me what you can about doreens murder doreen and backer were enjoying sexual congress in a big house and got surprised in the act ouch said lindstrom mode he was shot once in the head probably a she was strangled forensics his and her prints in expected places no one elses nothing at backers crib no crib at all for doreen because some unnamed government agency helped her go byebye and let her stay underground even after she screwed them why once you realized shed conned you didnt you put her factoids back in place its not done that way she was an embarrassment so no sense calling attention to her before the next begging session at congress whatever said lindstrom i really wish youd stop bitching because i didnt cause any of this all im after is enough data to write her damn epitaph what else do you have nada she toed her bag closer i did some checking and the owner of the property might be of interest really said milo grinning his hands had curled into massive fleshmitts pink and glossy and twitching like a pair of christmas hams revivified by some mad scientist gayle lindstrom watched them fascinated milo stood special agent lindstrom i believe were through here oh jesus she said whats with you first you say youve told me everything then you toss in your own little morsel to spice up the bullshit unlike the bureau i dont have years to put up with gamers lindstroms jaw jutted i never used the word everything well that sure clarifies it he said heading for the door gayle lindstrom said i am not gaming you i didnt say anything in the beginning because i assumed you knew about the owner after you didnt say anything i thought you didnt so i told you okay silence i didnt think i had to spoonfeed you basic who owns the property gayle you really dont know milo smiled cmon said lindstrom just like you im a salaried employee far from the top of the food chain you want to keep picking at me i cant stop you but it wont close your double homicide you want me to go first fine prince tariq of sranil aka teddy milo sat back down more coffee gayle were nothing if not hospitable lindstrom gaped not that it matters but i only learned about him right before i came over here you dont consider him a suspect not directly i mean hes back in sranil milo said hes alleged to have killed another girl lindstrom sat up who where when dont know dont know around two years ago its still at the rumor level a foreign national maybe a party girl maybe swedish whos your source someone who heard a rumor who milo shook his head weve got secrecy issues too for all i know its baloney but the timings right just when construction stopped on teddys shack and he rabbited back home right after then doreen ends up there lindstrom shook her head im not seeing any obvious link anything related to sranil ever come up in doreens stories nope and that i can be sure of because soon as i found out about teddy owning the property i reread every damn word in her file but she did talk about foreign terrorists confederating with local econuts it never came to anything plus she never mentioned anything about asians or swedes or ugandans or lithuanians just ahmed said milo quote unquote alqaeda types sranils muslim gayle and the sultans got two groups of extremists itching to cut his head off and get control of all his oil one of thems fundamentalist interesting said lindstrom youre really thinking this could be political god i hope not doreen ever travel abroad never even had a passport same question gayle i just told youoh no lieutenant sturgis as far as my peon status can carry me im unaware of the bureau or anyone else furnishing her funny travel papers milo said so someone upstairs couldve granted it sure but why would the bureau help her evade when we were paying her to blab and she hadnt come through the only time she couldve traveled abroad wouldve been between splitting on us and now exactly said milo lindstrom thought about that okay ill make some calls promise to give you righteous info fair enough he nodded after doreen asked to be moved away from seattle whered you safehouse her sorry not authorized but trust me it wasnt anywhere outside the continental us smiling think acres of plains not a mountain in sight milo said not here in la not even close seeing as you just read every damn word of the file is there anything in there about a galpal who had traveled abroad or came from abroad swedish party girl negative yet again said lindstrom youll have to believe me on this but that file contains squatall international intrigue associated with doreen fredd and youve got no serious evidence prince teddy actually offed anyone but even if he did how would it connect to doreen and backer two years later burning down a big showy house i can believe they probably did that back in bellevue and god knows how many other times but targeting teddy specifically this turning into some obnoxious deal im not seeing it milo said what if doreen and backer somehow found out about the alleged murder and tried to cash in from what you know about her would that make sense blackmail sure why not she wasnt a woman of high character she sat forward she and backer hooked up more for old times sake decided to do more than eat dandelions and screw hey anythings possible but theres nothing along those lines that i can help you with does the name monte appear anywhere in your files nope who is he maybe no one gayle obviously you think hes someone what happened to the other two kids doreen and backer hung with back in seattle dwayne parris and kathy vanderveldt they both went off to college and got on the straight and narrow she was premed he was prelaw tell me about monte just a name that came up in a tip as someone who mightve known doreen might that mean you dont think the tips solid milo gave her the details geezer without a cell she said monte nope doesnt ring a bell but the moment i get back ill reread the file just in case it slipped by me were talking sevenhundredplus pages doreen was smalltime but she merited an encyclopedia one thing were good at is churning paper lindstrom smiled poor trees chapter we stood in front of the station and watched lindstrom drive away in a governmentissued chevy milo said how much of that was real who knows a woman exited the staff parking lot crossed the street and brushed by us setting off a zephyr of chanel no thin pinchfeatured with a wellstyled mop of flamecolored hair sharpened by a deep green suit and a yellow scarf patterned like a rattlesnake she carried a bag even larger than lindstroms maintained a highstepping walk as she flung the station door open i said it probably is in lindstroms best interests to cooperate you clear doreen she makes headway on her pile of punishment the station door opened and the redhead charged toward us bag swinging hair bouncing lieutenant sturgis clarice jernigan from the coroners doctor i was testifying around the corner thought i might as well talk to you in person the receptionist told me id walked right by you khaki eyes studied me this is dr delaware our psych consultant we can sometimes use help on suicides would you mind if i talked to the lieutenant in private milo said anything i know dr delawares going to know theres nothing psychological about what i have to say lieutenant sorry doc it aint done that way dr clarice jernigan slid her bag to the sidewalk sure what the hey i opened mr backers head and retrieved bullet frags definitelys labs trying to reassemble so if you get a weapon they can run a match thanks i also decided to do an autopsy on your jane doe after all as id assumed no big surprise in terms of cod manual strangulation the finger marks are obvious but no prints or dna so maybe your bad guy gloved up this was a healthy young woman who met a rather unpleasant demise literally at the hands of another weve got a name for her now doc doreen fredd two ds jernigan whipped out a blackberry entered the information my report will be forthcoming meaning whenever i can get to it milo said thats what you needed to tell me facetoface jernigan threw back her shoulders what i need to tell you is i made an error and preferred not to address that fact over the phone looking at me i settled my gaze on the parking lot and pretended to be elsewhere milo waited i dont see it as a major faux pas but you might as well know in case it impacts how you direct your investigation as i told you the rape kit was negative and my initial evaluation was no sexual assault but after opening her up i did find an abrasion in the vaginal lining just under five inches in she tossed the snake scarf over her shoulder so why didnt i spot it initially because it was on the roof of the vaginal vault kind of tucked away a smallish but rather nasty snag wound consistent with insertion of a hard objectno jokes please something with a pointed extension on the upper surface my guess confirmed by my toolmark analyst is the barrel of a handgun with a sharp sight initially i assumed a because of backer but after checking barrel lengths i cant see any entering that deeply without inflicting serious external damage to the labia so were leaning toward a largercaliber revolver with a longer barrel and a prominent sight such as a charter arms bulldog in fact we tried out a bulldog and it fit quite nicely with the abrasion two guns said milo little one for shooting big one for raping to me lieutenant that smells of intimidation rage or maybe just plain sadism and of course now you need to consider two offenders do you concur dr delaware makes sense then were all on the same page jernigan checked her watch needless to say my initial hypothesis will not appear in the report and id appreciate if the same goes for yours absolutely doctor just to reassure you i took another look at mr backer as well examined his anus and his mouth for any sign of assault by firearm or anything else pristine on all counts so whatever additional psychopathology was at play seems to have been reserved for ms fredd with two ds have a nice day gentlemen hows it going on bobby escobar so far lieutenant its going nowhere angry smile are you volunteering your services that deal still stands i dont think the sheriffs would appreciate my meddling doc no doubt said jernigan then again things get bad enough everyone wants a bailout when she was gone he said when she admitted goofing i was expecting something about the vanished sperm stain i said maybe theres just so much she can own up to gun rape he said two offenders or a single dominant blitz artist who managed to cow backer and doreen all by himself someone with big bucks could afford to hire a team teddy andor the sultan dispatched a hit squad he pressed his palms together looked up at the sky what did i do to offend you herr kafka sean binchy showed up at milos office brandishing a list of felons culled from beaudry constructions subcontractor list nine names no montes or close binchy had run down seven of the miscreants ruled them out was headed to lancaster to check out the last twoa pair of cementworker brothers arrested for stealing tools from a previous job milo said hows ricki flatt doing got her set up in the star inn paid for full cable all the movie channels that should do it sean one question loot my dad used to be a contractor before he got into amway i worked summers for him nothing fancy just remodels room additions but whenever the residents werent living on the premises dad fenced the job tight it was my job to check at the end of each day but that place anyone could walk right in it was like asking for trouble not that theres anything left to steal but still i agree kid any theories about why its almost like whoever owned it had lost interest in the place said binchy but then why not just sell it make some money maybe theyre rich enough not to care about a few million but i just dont see the point of letting it sit there anyway im sure im not telling you anything new let me go check out those two thieves when he was gone milo said like we never thought of it still obvious doesnt mean irrelevant i said maybe theres a body buried there and it has something to do with sranils culture as in letting nature take its course something akin to zen theyre muslims alex there could be something like that in islam letting a body rot to the point where it cant be idd the lots worth eight figures even for a billionaire that aint lehman stock the sultans a religious man i said articles of faith can go a long way he faced his computer pounded keys five hits later we were both reading an essay by a yale scholar of emergent and divergent cultural forces named keir macelway citing the sultanate as an example of a postmodern society where relatively enlightened islamic mores and laws including a liberal and flexible interpretation of sharia have supplanted a centuriesold naturebased tribal animist religion however vestiges of prior beliefs and rituals remain sometimes melding with the modern muslim approach among these are sun and water rites the worship of specified trees and shrubs and fishing calendars based on astrologic configurations preserved as nostalgic folktales but revered nonetheless in some cases such as sutma contracted from the animist sutta anka enmaliterally washing away mortal sinancient customs persist in sranilese society the origins of sutma remain unclear mcguire and marrow hypothesize that a passive approach to the treatment of deserved death arose as a reaction to cannibalism specifically as a means of preventing the consumption of enemy flesh following battles because illness had been observed following cannibalistic victory feasts ribbenthal attempts to link sutma to buddhist influence though evidence of any extensive interface between sranilese animism and buddhism remains evasive wildebrand attributes the belief to a generalized idealization of nature and presents as proof the ascendency of salisthra the guardian spirit of the forest to the top of the animist pantheon whatever its roots sutma has proved resilient impressively so in an age where other animist elements have ceded dominance to monotheistic religions in contrast with western norms advocating quick burial and the hindu belief in purification through immolation sutma insists upon unfettered exposure to the elements of any organic material construed as being linked to maliciousness insincerity or sinfulness in order for the sinner to gain access to the afterlife though not practiced as extensively as it was by sranilese island tribes when the merest accusation of immorality could lead to prolonged often demeaning public postmortem displays sutma occasionally emerges when a violent crime has taken place most commonly in remote villages when inhabitants seek out the comfort of maranandi muru the old way milo saved printed sighed teddy kills a girl in that house so the sultan sees that goddamn pile of wood as sinful organic material i said hes making sure his brother reaches the afterlife teddy met up with some family justice justice in this world compassion for the next he looked up professor macelways yale extension talked briefly and amicably to a startled scholar of emergent and divergent cultural forces macelway confirmed it in some animist cultures murderers huts were left fallow milo said guess the sultans a traditionalist so where do backer and doreen figure in to the tune of fifty gs what if backer and doreen were paid by someone to burn the place down in order to jeopardize teddys celestial journey they couldnt get to him directly because hes either dead or under royal protection back home in sranil but knowledge of sutma would present a partial alternative keep the bastard out of heaven someone who believes in the old ways or doesnt but knows the royal family does with no ability to exact physical revenge keeping teddy in perpetual limbo could be a potent psychological second choice and it would explain why doreen hacked into mastersons file pinpointing teddys real estate so he can dangle over the pits of hell forever thats the case theyd have to know something about sranilese culture didnt take you long to get the basic facts the information age okay lets go with this for arguments sake someone pays backer and doreen fifty gs to whip up some vegan jello then why didnt they just do the job why keep visiting and using it as a lovenest that couldve started as scoping out the job i said figuring out where to stick the explosives time their escape but once there they decided to mix business with pleasure because that was backers thing love under the stars in the company of plywood and drywall and rebar that might go back to his adolescence if he started early as a teenage firebug sex and kaboom couldve formed an interesting mix coupla exdelinquents warming up the grill with a little body heat delinquents who got away with something spectacular i said thats a huge high and people who go through tremendously arousing experiences young often develop intense bonds to those experiences pheromones and accelerant he said then ten years of godknowswhat what do you think of the fact that backer turned outwardly respectable but doreen ended up selling her body maybe he was less burdened by guilt and she had enough conscience to want to punish herself or he was smarter and better educated came from an intact supportive home and made smarter decisions whatever diverged them they reunited here in la chemistry smile organic chemistry for all we know despite backer earning a degree he never abandoned his sideline and someone out to avenge teddys victim made contact unfortunately for him and doreen the sultan found out their bodies left in the turret could be a warning to anyone else considering messing with sutma he stood raised his arms touched the low ceiling desi and doreen play with the big boys pay for it with a bullet and a chokeout with time taken out to jam a bigger gun where it was never meant to go whats that got to do with the old ways that was intimidation just as jernigan suggested to control the sceneor to obtain information what doreen and backer knew who else was involved the element of surprise was a big part of the hit that sperm stain on doreens thigh suggests backer was pulled off her just as he came they were both overpowered he was interrogated shot leaving a cowed terrified doreen and just in case that didnt impress her out came the big gun you have that way he said drawing ugly pictures perfectly put thousands of sleepless nights proved it i smiled he got on the phone moses busy good cmere and start working on your charisma chapter moe reed said sure accepting the assignment to revisit the indonesian consulate without emotion as he headed for the door milo said dont you want to know why i figure something came up on that deadgirl rumor you want me to press my source for details nothing came up moses thats why i need you to press consulate closes at four ill be there by three she comes out by herself ill try to get some facetime she doesnt ill tail her till i get a clean opportunity whats your sources name

not to tell dr wilkinson reeds love interest was a physical anthropologist in the bone lab liz is cool and the girls probably muslim they dont drink good point said milo okay candys still dandy you want me to go easy or hard on her said reed i want you to do what it takes to squeeze out every bit of info shes got on prince teddy and that swedish girl im thinking ill go real slow not threaten her unless im smelling bullshit then its full press keep doing that moses doing what thinking said milo be the guy who stands out from the crowd i drove away from the station with milo in the sevilles passenger seat fidgeting rubbing his face growling about la traffic all those scofflaw morons who kept cellphoning look at that idiot weaving look at that braindead asshole stopped at a green whats a matter dont we have a shade you like loser the star motor inn sat on a gray block of sawtelle between santa monica and olympic ricki flatt answered the door wearing the same highwaisted jeans and an oversized black carlsbad caverns tshirt her hair was loose and frizzy her mouth small behind her the bed was made up to military specs images flashed on a tv screen not much larger than my computer monitor lieutenant may we come in of course the room smelled of lysol and pizza no sound from the tv the show was a cooking demonstration a fluorescenteyed woman so thin her clothes bagged bouncing with joy as she stirfried something carrots celery and a lump of what looked like yellow playdoh one of milos rulestoliveby is never trust a skinny chef sometimes he applies that to detectives to any profession at random depending on how the days going one time i couldnt resist and asked about personal trainers he said im talking real jobs not sadists his mood during the drive had grown progressively more foul youd never know it from the way he handled ricki flatt sliding a chair close to hers leaving me to perch on a corner of the bed he unholstered his softest smilethe one he uses with little kids and old ladies with blanche too when he thinks no ones looking get any sleep ricki not much anything you need please tell me no thanks lieutenant did you get into the storage unit havent heard back from port angeles pd yet i just hope scott doesnt find out i held on to the money i explained that to them it makes me nervoushaving it in my possession itll be out of your life soon is it drug money lieutenant no evidence of that i really dont see it desi was never into drugs milo shifted closer ricki were working really hard to figure out who murdered desi but honestly were knocking our heads against the wall if i ask you questions you may find upsetting can you handle them questions about what desis early days when he was seventeen that far back yes ricki flatts eyes tangoed youre talking about the bellevue fire milo began to blink managed somehow to curtail the reflex he moved even closer to the bed we need to talk about the bellevue fire ricki howd you find out doing our homework someones murdered you go into their childhood we go as far back as we need to ricki flatt picked at the bedcovers milo said the fires been on your mind thats what you meant by political not really she said she hugged herself rocked im sorry lieutenant im not trying to be evasive but i just cant accept the fact that my brother was some sort of paid arsonist but fifty thousand thats why i didnt sleep last night and the bellevue house was huge and so was where desi was i cant bring myself to say it where it happened two huge houses said milo i drove by last night in a cab to that place even with just the framework i could tell it was massive i kept telling myself it meant nothing what connection could there be tell me what you know about the bellevue fire ricki that boyvince he wasnt murdered he burned himself up it was basically an accident van burghout van she said trying on the name you didnt know him well im sure i saw him if he came to the house with desi but he never registered desi was popular there were always kids over and when the fire happened i was at college out of town no u of w she said geographically not far but i was into my own life the arson file names van as one of desis hiking companions then i guess he was did your family discuss the fire we probably talked about it it was a big local story but as i said i wasnt living at home ricki flatt folded her lips inward fighting tears milo placed a hand atop hers she lost the battle and burst out sobbing rather than hand a tissue to her he dabbed ricki flatt said now im a traitor to who ricki my family i just lied we didnt talk about the fire it wasnt supposed to be talked about ever you parents said that unspoken rule lieutenant something i just knew not to talk about that wasnt my parents usual way thats why ive always suspected desi was involved those kinds of secrets said milo every family has them but being honest doesnt make you a traitor not now thats for sure silence you want justice for desi ricki would your parents have had a problem with that no answer would they ricki slow head shake tell me what you know i dont know anything she said i just feel it always have apart from your parents clamming up what gave you the feeling for a start desis books he had these counterculture books in his room how to build homemade weapons how to disappear and hide your identity techniques of revenge the anarchist cookbook a whole shelf of that above his computer your parents were okay with that what i told you was true mom and dad were all about developing our own sense of morality though one time i did hear dad make a comment being a firefighter he still had that lawandorder thing going on i overheard him telling desi those books wouldve been branded as treasonous in other societies and desi answering that those societies deserved to disappear because without free speech nothing mattered and dad coming back that free speech was important but it ended where someones chin met someones fist and desi ending the argument the way he usually did by being charming youre absolutely right pops dad laughed and it never came up again that was my brother all honey no vinegar unlike me he never wasted energy arguing with mom and dad he was the easy kid no overt rebel said milo so he got to hold on to his treasonous books and his foldouts from hustler no matter how gynecologic and how much mom considered herself a feminist and his che poster and whatever else he wanted im sure mom and dad never imagined him doing anything more with those books than reading until the fire the weekend after the fire i was home for the weekend getting my laundry done ms independence mom and dad were at work but desi was home so i knocked on his door he took a really long time to unlock didnt seem thrilled to see me wasnt the least bit warm which was odd generally wed share a big hug but this time he looked flustered like id interrupted something my first thought was something adolescentyou know what i mean those hustler foldouts he was seventeen blushing then i saw that his room had been completely rearranged even the bed was in a new place desi was always neat but now it looked downright compulsive a lot less stuff in the room including the books all gone and in place of the che poster hed hung a photo of moose in the forest i made some wisecrack about redecorating had he turned gay or something instead of laughing like he normally wouldve he just stood there then he edged me away from the door not by touching me by inching forward so i was forced to leave or bump into him then he closed the door behind him and we both went to the kitchen and he was the same old desi smiling and funny i said focusing on you instead of his room desi was great at that he could make you feel you were the center of the universe then hed ask for something and you just said yes no hesitation did you ever bring up the fire not with desi just with mom she got a strange look in her eye changed the subject that whole weekend was strange all three of them nervous i felt like a stranger but in the beginning i didnt connect it to the fire it was only after i found out that desi and some of his friends were questioned by the police that things started to click milo said were you ever questioned no and i wouldnt have said anything i had nothing to offer anyway she wadded a tissue released her fingers and watched it open like a timelapse flower i said did desi keep anything suspicious in his room besides books if he did i wouldnt know he had a lock on his door and used it liked his privacy sure but what teenager doesnt i figured it was because of all those girls he took in there was doreen one of them probably but only one he might as well have had a revolving door and no my parents never objected desi would play music to block out the sound but sometimes you could hear the bed knocking against the wall mom and dad just continued to read or watch tv pretended not to hear so your parents were used to looking the other way youre saying that made it easier for them to cover for desi when he did something really bad long exhalation maybe milo said after the fbi questioned desi you started to wonder the fbi all i heard about was the police the fbi actually came to the house they did ricki talked to your parents as well as desi unbelievable only reason i found out the police were involved was by reading the dailythe u of w paper something to the effect that no progress had been made but local kids were being questioned and desis name was mentioned did i say anything no milo said what do you know about desis ten years on the road just what i told you yesterday doing the hippie thing retrohippie said ricki flatt original hippie was my parents generation then all of a sudden he shaves his beard cuts his hair buys nice clothes enrolls in architecture school i remember thinking so now he wants to build not destroy the fire stayed on your mind im not moral enough to be haunted by it but every so often it would creep into my mind because that boy had died and the police had suspected my brother enough to question him and my parents had acted so weird do you have any idea how desi reconnected to doreen none whatsoever he never mentioned her he never brought up any woman lieutenant i just assumed he was being himself meaning playing the field and keeping it casual did he mention any women from his years on the road not a one the fifty thousand youre pretty convinced he was into something seriously illegal thats a lot of cash ricki she grew silent milo said a couple of other kids in desis hiking group were also questioned after the fire dwayne parris and kathy vanderveldt anything you remember about them i wouldnt know them if you showed me a picture i was three years older to me they were all a bunch of stupid kids you mentioned before that desi was into health did he ever mention vegan jello sure he did huh why said ricki flatt what does food have to do with it vegan jellos homemade napalm ricki it mightve been used in the bellevue fire she went white oh my god what did desi say about vegan jello i i dont know its just something i heard him mention its really that yes ricki i honestly thought it was food some crazy organic thing did he talk about it before the bellevue fire or after let me think let me think all i can recall is desi and some friends in the kitchen having a snack before maybe before a hikei think they were packing trail mix water bottles and then someone maybe it was desi maybe it was someone else i really dont recall said something why dont we pack vegan jello and everyone started laughing was doreen there was she there probably i cant be sure maybe not i dont know wincing vegan jello now i have to think about my brother in a whole new way chapter milo closed the motel door on a fetal ricki flatt sweet dreams unlikely back in the car he said those parents had to know their boy was involved in torching that house i said firefighter dad too much to handle backer does godknowswhat for ten years then decides to be an architect what the hells that i destroy i build the whole god thing or a stab at atonement fifty grand says he felt no guilt wonder if anything in san luis got the vegan jello treatment while backer attended cal poly its robins hometown ill ask her i instructed the voicerecognition system to phone cutie she said ive never heard of anything but ill ask mom robins relationship with her mother is to be kind complicated i said selfless public service she laughed if we keep it at serious crime well be fine milo said im in debt to you kid bring wine the next time i cook for you what did i give you the last time orchid plant also lovely but dont you want something you can share find me a mansion arson in san luis two to six years ago and ill bring you a case of the best pinot i can find back to you on that big guy she called back three minutes later moms never heard of anything like that and neither has my friend rosa whos lived there her entire life and knows everything if youd like i can do a newspaper search id have to put you on regular payroll kiddo like you keep threatening to do with alex point taken he said anyway not necessary i can push keys whens my blueeyed boy coming home right now if you want him i always want him but dont let me hinder your investigation if only there was one that bad hey he said were walking talking breathing im grateful robin said i dont like that kind of talk from you i shouldnt get philosophical not on my watch milo lapsed into that same morose silence back at his office he flung his jacket atop a file cabinet and began the search for mansion arsons throughout the state any eco torchjobs long list quite a few big houses went up during that time frameheres an entire luxury housing project in colorado animal research labthat one was high school kids who got stopped early wheeling away from the screen its all over the country alex but if theres a pattern im not seeing it and if backer was a pro youd think something remotely incendiary would show up in his apartment but the bomb dogs found zilch meaning a backer was an architect nothing more b he did like playing with fire but put off buying his equipment until shortly before the gig or c he kept a storage locker full of combustible goodies and please dont remind me about none of the above sean binchy rang in from lancaster hey loot those two thieving brothers are alibied clean for borodi though if you ask me theyre still up to no good there was a truck without tags in their driveway they definitely didnt want me looking at it closely what next go home just forget about the truck notify the locals and call it a day regards to your wife absolutely said binchy im sure she sends them back milo said cant you just see me explaining this to the brass revenge by sutma interruptus assuming there ever was a murdered swedish girl assuming someone cared enough about her to burn down the house assuming backer and fredd were involved and dallied around before trying to blow the place up and got offed before they could follow through i said if there was a swedish girl and someone cared enough to avenge her they mightve also contacted the swedish consulate about her being missing he looked up the local number had a civilized chat with a man named lars gustafson who had no personal knowledge of any swedish citizen in jeopardy two to three years ago but promised to check milo phoned moe reed find that indonesian girl just about to call you loo i was there when they closed up but she wasnt at work today hope talking to me didnt spook her because i didnt get a name or an address stupid huh i was trying to keep her mellow judgment call moe dont get an ulcer ill be there tomorrow before they open up need anything else go home sure theres nothing i can do get some sleep in case there is moses he hung up sighing i said what a good dad grumbling he logged onto an online yellow pages searched for storage facilities in la county a minority refused to divulge client information but most were surprisingly cooperative call after call his torso sagged with each negative the sum total no units registered to desmond backer milos eyes closed his breathing slowed grew shallow his big head flopped back in the chair and his arms dangled when the snoring reached nuclearblast level i saw myself out robin was working her laptop on the living room couch blanche napped on an ottoman her little barrel chest heaving not up at milos level but moving some audio needles with her snuffles and snorts opening one eye she smiled dove back into some wonderful canine dream the screen was full of google hits mansion arson the keywords i sat down robin kissed me continued scrolling playing nancy drew couldnt think what to cook leftovers or out out sounds good my soul mate nothing turns up in san luis but plenty of fireworks in other cities someone builds a dream someone else cant wait to take it down how ugly years ago a psychopath burned our first house to the ground we rebuilt agreed the net result was an improvement neither of us talks about it anymore but a fire station is perched at mulholland a short drive to the north and another sits to the south near beverly glen and sunset meaning a fair bit of nights are broken by sirens generally the banshee howls are shortlived we touch feet in mutual reassurance go back to sleep sometimes robin sits up shivering and i wrap my arms around her and before long mornings arrived sour and disorienting she closed the laptop stood stroked blanche okay ill get dressed chinese italian thai indian how about croatian whats croatian cuisine lets fly to zagreb and find out she said italians fine hon anythings fine long as i get out of here let me freshen up we ended up eating fishandchips at a stand on pch in malibu watched the sky waver between coral and lilac soaking in the final morph into indigo as the sun went offshift when we returned home i ran a bath the tubs not meant for two but if someones careful not to bump their head on the faucet it works out that kind of togetherness sometimes leads to more tonight it didnt and we read and watched tv and went to bed just before midnight when i woke to reverb shrieks i thought i was dreaming woke expecting the din to fade full consciousness amplified the noise robin said thats the fifth one theyre heading south three seventeen am siren number six wailed dopplered someones lifes going to change alex we slid under the covers touched feet gave it our best shot moments later i turned the tv on and we trolled for news through a swamp of infomercials and reruns of crap that shouldnt have aired in the first place if something newsworthy was occurring on the westside none of the networks or the cable news outlets had picked it up the internet had la current events blog operating in real time some insomniac plugged into the emergency bands holmby hills conflagration unfinished construction project borodi lane robins breath caught i held her tighter reached for the phone punched milos cell number he said im on my way there call you when i need you when not if i got dressed made coffee told robin she should try to get some sleep oh sure she said hanging on to my arm mugs in both our hands we plodded through the house stepped out onto the front terrace frosty dark morning warmish for the hour but we shivered above the tree line the southern sky was dusted with gray the sirens had waned to distant mousesqueaks the air smelled scorched robin said bad news travels fast chapter borodi lane was blocked by cruisers and a huffing hookandladder a uniform scowled as i rolled to the curb barely edging past sunset a skeptical call to milo produced a reluctant nod but you need to keep your car there sir and walk i continued toward the scene breathing heat firewood flamesuppressing chemicals a hydrocarbon stench evoking the worlds biggest filling station the asphalt was slick with washoff static and buzz kept up a magpie routine red engines and hardhatted firefighters were everywhere several more explanations before i was allowed to reach the property what was left of prince teddys dream was black and stunted where the ground wasnt ash it was soup a white coroners van was pulled up to the open gate the chain milo had supplied was on the ground marked by a plastic evidence cone and sliced through cleanly into two pieces as firefighters streamed in and out a pair of morgue attendants hauled out a gurney bearing something small and lumpy and wrapped in plastic i looked for milo spotted him near an lafd ambulance wearing a limp black raincoat jeans and muddy sneakers staring at the ruins to his right on the ground several objects sat on a black tarp too dim to make out as i stepped next to him he fished out a maglite aimed downward partially melted glass bottle from the shape and scorched wire around the neck probably champagne a single intact wine goblet a butter knife with a handle melted to blob a metal tin with an ornate label i bent to read foie gras imported from france milo s beam shifted to a longbarreled revolver clearly antique wooden grip scorched through engraved metal blackened next to the gun sat a pair of bolt cutters seared to well done i said someone was having a party probably mr charles ellston rutger he said probably bodys unrecognizable but rutgers lincoln is parked around the corner and there was a solid gold calling card in the ash with his name engraved on it plus some dental bridges came out half baked same for a gold collar pin and initialed platinum cuff links he cursed dressing for success idiot cut the chain climbed up to the turret with his dom whatever goddamn goose liver and no doubt some other comestibles that got vaporized i said picnic under the stars he kicked a clump of mud off a sneaker tip cretin probably convinced himself he owned the place again who knows how many other times he went up there when there was no chain i warned him but of course he cant listen cause im a dumb public servant and hes a goddamn aristokook talk about bad timing charlie threename story of his life i said wouldnt be surprised if the arsonist saw the broken chain took advantage howd the fire start what the arson guys telling me so far is someone wadded charges of something highly combustible probably petroleumbased in at least eight spots distributed methodically throughout the ground floor very well thought out was his description petroleumbased as in vegan jello flavor of the month the neighbors heard only one explosion whole place went up like kindling so it looks like a single timer coulda been a disaster if the winds were strong and the flames jumped to neighboring foliage the fact that the lot had been stripped down to bare dirt actually helped ground floor ignites flames shoot up through all that open space oxygen feeds it meanwhile rutgers stuck on top with the stairs burned out wouldnta made a difference alex this was sudden intense immolation no chance for escape rutgers drinking champagne stuffing his face no ones the boss over him so now hes toast scratch that crumbs a stocky grayhaired man wearing a yellow helmet a blue lapd windbreaker and jeans approached us wiping a sooty sweaty face were going to be here for a while milo you can go unless you want to stick around better you than me said milo this is dr delaware our psych consultant doctor captain boxmeister from the arson squad don said boxmeister id shake your hand but mines filthy this was some conflagration reminds me of youknowwhich jungle milo huh vegan jello havent heard that in a while yeah it sure works like napalm you mind continuing with the murder part of it so we can concentrate on the arson which isnt to say we wont be collaborating milo said sounds good don that fed i mentioned said jellos an ecoterrorist faverave used to be milo but we dont see that kind of bigscale looniness on the westside except for occasional threats to animal researchers all we had last year was a wimpy amateur fire set in one of the us med labs and we caught the fool worked there sweeping floors no affiliation with any groupone of those guys youd know about doc shitforbrains thought hed liberated all the little mickeys but what he ended up with was rodent flambé and thirddegrees on both arms i think it stays quiet here because no one expects houses in holmby or bh or bel air to be anything but gross you start eliminating ostentatiousness on the gold coast you get the gobi desert bite your tongue don boxmeister grinned pulled out a notepad and pen tell me again which oil type owned this barbecue prince tariq of sranil not the mideast asia its near indonesia ill look it up said boxmeister so youre thinking your original vics also planned to torch the place but got interrupted by someone they had an accomplice who finished the job and roasted whatshisname rutger in the process thats a good summary don political that sucks if you dont mind id prefer to keep a lid on that part of it no sense getting the neighbors thinking alqaedas lurking near their tennis courts good idea said milo especially because all ive got are guesses i said how was the body positioned there was no body doc just bones and ashes and some dental plates did the fire move it boxmeister thought that high up probably not where in the turret was it found right in the middle not near the stairs was he trying to escape doesnt look like it quiet killer i said rutger had no idea or he knew but couldnt do a damn thing about it no traces of a cell phone were found milo said phone wouldve survived the blast some part of it probably would said boxmeister tell you one thing im going to look into the composition of that liver can anything that can survive something like this im stockpiling a womans voice argumentative caused the three of us to turn a young brunette in the grip of a female officer pointed at milo slim longhaired the housesitting daughter whod spotted doreen fredd on borodi amy thal she wore a red silk robe over pajamas and fuzzy pink slippers protested as the cop held her back milo jogged over excused the officer returned with thal highintensity lights turned her freckles to braille dots don this is ms thal a cooperative neighbor amy captain boxmeister from the arson squad boxmeister said id shake your hand but mines filthy amy thal rubbed the arm the cop had held i tried to explain to her that i knew you had something to say its not like im some lookyloo this is my frickin neighborhood sorry said milo whats up amy i saw another woman i didnt recognize yesterday jogging past this place at least three times sniffing burnt air this is crazy whats going on lieutenant tell me about the woman blond long hair tight bod she looked like a runner at the time i didnt think much of it but now im wondering because she kept running back and forth and why do that when there are all sorts of interesting runs you can take i mean cross the street and go by the playboy mansion or spellings old place go down to comstock and run around the park why keep passing back and forth i mean its suspicious right three times said milo three times i saw lieutenant couldve been more i was in the living room stretched out on the couch reading generally its real quiet so anything that moves you notice yesterday i saw a huge coyote just ambling past like he owned the street was there anything strange about her she seemed kind of intense but thats runners right i wouldnt have given it a second thought but now what do you guys think we think we appreciate your coming forth amy boxmeister nodded anything more you can say about what she looked like maam black tights bare tummy sports bra decent face at least from a distance maybe real boobs but with a sports bra i cant be sure milo said what kind of blond ultra said amy thal platinum she nodded long and shinyand no ponytail like most girls do when they run she just let that sucker flap in the breeze like look at me i am soooo silky she reminded me of that comedy thing a while back my dad used to love to watch them my mom always got pissed off because she thought it wasnt humor that got his interest the swedish bikini team i think they sold beer or something don boxmeister said old milwaukee amy thal said it was years ago i was a kid dad loved them this girl was like that okay id

too bad her infos useless hottie jogging in holmby big shock don the girl this prince is reputed to have offed was swedish oh boxmeisters smile was sheepish back up the tape erase our firebugs a lady out for personal revenge then how do your first two vics figure in like you said they couldve been in it together or she was a family member of the swedish vic hired them they got killed she decided to finish the job youre seeing her as why they got killed thats kinda thin milo didnt answer boxmeister slapped his back look on the bright side be nice to have a goodlooking suspect in the box for a change just in case blondie has nothing to do with it though ill be doing it oldschool combing the files for any serious pro torches recently paroled or released let you know if i come up with something and you find anything pointing to anita ekberg you call me pronto we watched him leave milo said how early do you think diplomat types get to work chapter the swedish consulate rents space on the seventh floor of a highrise at wilshire near westwood consular assistant lars gustafson was at his desk at eight thirty took milo s call with puzzlement but agreed to meet in an hour out in front please lieutenant the faintest trace of accent any reason we cant come up lets enjoy the nice weather ill be there promptly how will i know you ill do my best to look swedish milo hung up aw shucks thought id get a look at the furniture bet it aint ikea we were in place by nine twentyfive watching the revolving door accept people dressed for business at nine twentynine am a throng emerged and dispersed the man who stayed behind was around thirty tall athletically built wearing a fitted brown suit yellow shirt butterscotch shoes blond and blueeyed but his hair was kinky his skin milkchocolate his features those of a masai warrior mr gustafson lars energetic pump flash of diplomatic teeth custommade for news conferences and lunch with genteel old ladies i have researched your issue lieutenant there have been no complaints by any swedish citizenat home or hereregarding missing persons or homicides i did find a case involving a danish citizen who was thought to have disappeared in san diego however she showed up and the matter was resolved a love triangle no royalty involved muslim or otherwise thank heavens the muslim thing bothers you gustafson smiled nothing bothers us we are neutral the danes on the other hand remember those mohammed cartoons that why you didnt want us up in your office no no heaven forbid gentlemenplease forgive me if i seemed unwelcoming but the consul general felt police officers could serve as a distraction from the daily challenge of stamping visas gustafson kept smiling but the wattage went out of it we do attempt to be useful lieutenant next week were hosting a dinner for over two dozen nobel laureates in any event i have nothing to tell you good luck milo took out his pad how about some details on the danish case a woman named palma mogensen was working as an au pair for a family in la jolla when she met an american marine in oceanside unfortunately she was already married to a danish man and after she stopped returning her husbands emails he showed up things get nasty oh no said gustafson everyone talked it out and the couple returned to copenhagen civilized said milo we try to be good influences lieutenant you and the danes all of us who must contend with endless night it breeds a certain patience gustafson headed back toward the revolving door managed to sidle in as the mechanism remained in motion milo said swedish danishtime for a pastry we found a coffee shop in the village two bear claws and a crèmefilled chocolate eclair for him a coffee for me later we were back in the station parking lot jogging he said sports bra this is gonna be another washout day he was wrong one message slip atop his computer barely legible scrawl he squinted put on reading glasses frowned now its mrs holman wanting a meeting punching numbers ms holman lieutenant sturgis i got yourabout that really why dont you tell me what it is you sure we can meet but if you could just fill me in beforeyou sound upset ms holman yes of course we appreciate leads i can be there in thirty forty minutes that work for you fine then youre sure theres nothing you canall right then ms holman im on my way he placed the phone in its cradle as if it were breakable thats one very uptight architect and her voice says shes been working on the gin she knows something about the fire claims to but wouldnt say what i guess i should call boxmeister i guess i wont another pretty day at the canals marjorie holman was out on her front porch wearing a black sweater and slacks and looking like a model for a highend retirement community next to her stood a tall whitehaired goateed man close to seventy his gaunt frame was a wire hanger for a black suit and turtleneck milo muttered looks like a funeral no sign of professor ned holman his wife waved us up impatiently the man in the black suit didnt budge even when we were two feet away his eyes were blue and worldweary stick limbs a long neck and a beak nose evoked an egret mournful bird on a bad fishing day this is judah cohen said holman my former partner husky voice the slight slurring milo had picked up over the phone mr cohen lieutenant cohen studied the floorboards whats on your mind ms holman she hooked a thumb inside no trace of her husband or his chair on the ground floor milo said professor holman okay ned hes at the doctor one of his checkups i use a specialneeds van service because i never know how long its going to take marching to the sink she poured sapphire and ice cubes into a glass anyone joining mejudah how about you glenlivet not today thanks said cohen he sat on the edge of an overstuffed sofa shifted position cupped his hands over a bony knee from the look in his eyes nothing would make him comfortable holman returned with her drink perched next to cohen judah and i have some serious suspicions helga had something to do with that fire cohen winced it didnt get past holman would you care to take over judah youre doing fine marjie so were together on this we are well then onward as i told you the first time helga boondoggled usgot us to leave some very nice professional situations under pretense of establishing a groundbreaking greenarchitecture firm she claimed that her father was a wealthy industrialist owned a shipping company money was not going to be a problem however money turned out to be a serious problem as in helga did nothing but talk failed to follow through on financing the firm at the time judah and i were puzzled now it becomes clear helga never had any sort of serious intention judah and i were part of a coverup milo said of what ill get to that holman sipped an inch of gin i need to do this in an organized manner lieutenant where was i the ruse one day helga announced that funding hadnt developed she was disbanding the firm returning to germany have a nice day turning to cohen he said bit of a shock you always were the master of understatement dear basically helga played us for the fools we apparently were cohen said no sense beating ourselves up helga had valid credentials and her technical knowledge was solid she was an engineer judah not a spark of creativity be that as it may said cohen the manner in which she described the initial project was valid conceptually as well as structurally milo said the kraeker gallery both architects stared at him holman said how do you know about that helga told us did she then you were played as well yes its an actual place and yes they are taking bids on a major expansion but helga never applied to be part of the bidding process and they have never heard of her when did you find out a few days ago lieutenant when it became clear that helga had no intention of compensating us for our time and loss of prior employment we cant find her said cohen or rather our attorney cant holman said dont ask why we didnt check her out more thoroughly a partnership like a marriage is based on trust milo didnt blink i was willing to bet on his internal dialogue motels on washington boulevard holman said while she was truthful about her educational credentials she lied completely about other things such as first off shes not german shes austrian and her fathers not a shipping tycoon hes a banker is gemein her real name reluctant nod what should have tipped us off was her take on green hatred for humanity rather than feed and save the planet the womans a total misanthrope and as time went on she felt freer to share her opinions on how the evolutionary process had failed when it produced human beings how homo sapiens disrupted the crucial balance what the world really needed was a good plague or a world war which coming from a teutonic type is pretty damn breathtaking she turned to cohen he said rather impolitic milo said could we talk about the fire im coming to that said holman this needs to be logical so that youll understand were not just a couple of disgruntled malcontents where was ihelgas lies the home address she gave us here in la was phony as we learned when we tried to serve her with papers youre suing her damn right we are professional alienation breach of contract anything else our lawyer can come up with where was the phony address brentwood as to why we didnt find it odd that helga never had us over we believed she was all business and that was fine we were motivated to create something important correct cohen nodded finishing her drink she returned to the kitchen poured a refill cohen watched her with sadness turned to us it might be helpful for you to know that helga hired des backer before she talked to us she presented him as a rising star whom shed met looking for young architects with green credentials we did check those credentials top of the class his professors had nothing but praise for him however when our attorney recontacted them none had ever spoken to helga nor had des asked them for letters of recommendation so she found him some other way holman said given the advantage of hindsight its clear dess work product was nil smirking in terms of architecture cohen said our attorneys had someone go through the office computers des did a lot of gazing at pornography as well as surfing through some disturbing websites which brings us to the fire milo said arson websites ecoterrorist websites congratulatory photographs of vandalized luxury housing and animal research labs chat strings of people who believe the ends justifies the means well need those office computers sorry we need them said marjorie holman our attorney has instructed us to place all the furniture and equipment in storage so we can show that helga clearly abandoned the office criminal trumps civil but milo didnt push it those websites were sent to helga we had no idea the two of them had any relationship beyond the firm on the contrary helga claimed not to even like des even though she hired him cohen said helga was good at putting thingsand peoplein boxes acceptable professionally said milo unacceptable personally holman said there was no personally the woman is coldblooded as was her version of green cohen said the unfortunate truth is a strong misanthropic streak exists within the green community but its a minority view and helga seemed to take it to the extreme plagues and wars holman said des sent her jpegs of burnedout buildings and she sent him lols and happy faces singing the praises of selective pyrotechnics as a tool of biological cleansing milo had her repeat that scribbled in his pad cohen said what was surprising was des mirroring helgas point of view he had seemed so sociable and humanistic talked about his niece wanting to build a better world for her holman said shes capable of anything probably killed des simply because she felt like it or maybe he was supposed to burn down that house chickened out and she executed him for disloyalty to the fatherland whatever milo said whos your attorney holman said mannyemmanuel forbush cohen said forbush ziskin and shapiro heres their number thank you sir what else holman said thats not enough its a good start ms holman then get going with it run that bitch into the ground and do the world a favor making progress on the booze slur she drank spilled gin on her lap cohen handed her a tissue she ignored him drank some more milo said any idea where helga is maam for all i know shes back in shwitzerland why switzerland because thats where shes from thought she was austrian she was born in austria but the family moved to spritzshwitzlerland her father owns a bank there manny found that out easily enough do you have the banks name why would i judah cohen said ggialter privatbank zurich the address is a postfacha post office box holman stared at him you should go on jeeepardy milo said a bank with no office im sure theres an office said cohen but perhaps theyre all about investing have no interest in walkins apparently its not unusual in zurich according to emmanuel forbush hes sent several certified letters but no answer so far feels a civil suit will take years to unravel we need to be patient if we choose to persist holman said oh we choose all right cohen didnt answer milo said years to unravel unless helga can be tied in to a criminal case holman said she is a criminal catch the bitch before she braids her hair and puts on lederhosen and disappears into the land of cuckoos and chocolate milo stood marjorie holman said exactly time to get a move on judah cohen said good luck chapter emanuel forbush esqs baritone boomed through the car speakers ive been expecting your call guess you want the computers that would be helpful sir no problem lieutenant pick them up at your convenience of course we will be keeping copies of every single word of data dont imagine youll mind without our coming forward youd be in the dark sitting on evidence in a criminal case could have caused problems mr forbush if you ever found out thanks for the vote of confidence mr forbush no no im noti just want to make sure our civil case is preserved you really think a civil suits worth the effort sir why wouldnt it be it just doesnt sound as if the stakes are that high for all the trouble well i suppose ill have to be the judge of that i suppose you will sir lieutenant said forbush i dont want to get off on a bad foot with you sorry if i came on too strong no problem mr forbush ill send a detective for those computers today great so hows marjie doing i just watched her down two stiff drinks and my guess is they werent her first this morning forbush tsktsked thats always been an issue for marjie poor kid youre friends ned and i go way back we used to play squash hell of an athlete damn tragedy marjies had a lot to deal with a victory would be good for her thats why i took on the case friend in need said milo the only kind that counts said forbush milo hung up laughed one of neds old squash buddies shouldve asked him about the current décor of washington boulevard notells he took on the case to keep the sheets hot cohens along for the ride they squeeze out a settlement its found money for him so now ive got dead ends in sranil and in zurich i said maybe youre in luck and helgas still in la or was this morning what do you mean shes a goodlooking wellbuilt woman in her thirties with nordic features cover that bald dome with a platinum wigsomething that flaps in the breezeand all a witness would focus on would be blond blond blond amy thals jogger he said yeah she does have that valkyrie thing going on not swedish i said swiss what if reeds source was almost there seen one european seen em all including the girl teddy supposedly offed he rubbed his face his vic was helgas sister or a close friend she comes to la to get revenge starts a shell firm for cover looks for teddy tries to find his local address by having doreenwho she met through backer maybe on some anarchist chat linecomb through mastersons files her primary goal was to kill teddy but she found out he was out of her reach in sranil either hiding in the palace or dead so she settles for burning down his house pays backer and fredd fifty thousand to do the job not much bang for all that buck alex if she banked on teddy being dead messing with his sutma wouldve been emotionally appealing the sultans religious so the thought of his brother dangling in perpetual purgatory would be unsettling you fuck with my family i fuck with yours with backer and fredd gone helga cases out the place herself decides on a doityourself maybe she arrived this morning with her own bolt cutters saw the gate open and walked right through meanwhile rutgers snarfing bubbly and liver making himself easier to ignite so who killed backer and doreen the sultans hit squad or helga herself because she learned how to go kaboom from hanging with them decided they were expendable if helga is involved i dont see her acting alone overpowering two people by herself even with two guns would be tough for a woman even a strong one and using a gun to rape doreen doesnt fit everyone says she hates people alex even so i said that scene reeked of male helgas more social than she lets on has a pal or this whole damn theorys one big housemansion of cards he phoned captain don boxmeister at the arson squad left a message followed up with a call to special agent gayle lindstrom connected gave her a recap asked her to research helga gemein she said is she a swiss citizen or austrian it makes a difference tactically they both extradite gayle they do but the swiss make it a lot more difficult prying out a swiss citizen is going to be hell i dont know where her passports from either way said lindstrom she could be already gone sitting in the international terminal as we speak gayle so how about dispensing some of your guys in dark glasses and walkietalkies ill get an airport check going soon as i

source came to work this morning but she was with a bunch of other girls and i couldnt isolate her shes due out soon for lunch milo said dont waste time on subtle moses just pull her aside what i need

stem of a cobaltblue cocktail the only gemein caught drinking shed separated herself physically standing half a foot apart the clan the mutation milo switched to ncic ran a search on dahlia gemein pulled up nothing there or on the doe network any mp or crime file but the web spat back another photo dated the same year as the kraeker gala snapped at the record launch party of a rapper named reepel malibu party house broad beach id heard about the place closed down after a torrent of neighbor complaints in that one dahlia gemein wore a pink string bikini and stood flanked by two men in flowered bathing shorts the guest of honor obese and cornrowed and a babyfaced muscular asian man identified as teddy km milo shot a fist into the air flipped through his pad and shouted punched the air harder dig this alex km as in tariq kuamah majur something real he studied the shot girl like this isnt going to be a throwaway someones bound to report her missing so why isnt she in the database maybe someone forgot to enter it human error oh come now a call to missing persons revealed that dahlia gemeins disappearance had never been reported followups everywhere else confirmed the same milo slumped for all we know shes not missing she and teddy fell in love she went back to sranil with him is living the life of a princess and there goes helgas motive he checked with moe reed your source

know why im here milo said just what i told you ati youre helping us and we really appreciate it theres nothing i can help you with milo wheeled his chair closer this doesnt need to be stressful ati i sat just inside the open door moe reed stood behind me young guy with a fondness for aqua velva my father had slapped it on religiously cursing as the alcohol ignited boozeinspired shaving nicks if

secretarial i wasnt getting any secretarial jobs so i registered at a website okay asian dolls its not what it sounds they just linked visiting businessmen with presentable young ladies suitable to be taken to social events that sounded like a direct quote milo said helping them feel at home mostly it was japanese guys said ati meneng when japanese girls were available they got first dibs but when they werent it opened up to all the girls they were mostly nice the guys i mean older mostly i never had problems it was totally a positive experience for me it was an honest business the woman who ran it mae fukuda died a few years ago her kids didnt want to keep it going some of those other businesses are sleazy thats why im at the consulate totally bored asian dolls said milo that wouldnt seem to include dahlia dahlia didnt need to work she had tons of money gazing at the floor okay i know how i met her a party after that we started to hang out she got me into some cool places what kind of cool places vip rooms at clubs private partieslike at the playboy mansion we went to three separate parties at the playboy mansion it was incredible hef wasnt there he let them use his house to raise money for charity we got to swim in the grotto whered you meet dahlia a club in chinatown which one madame chiangs milo said hill street in the big mall right big restaurant downstairs upstairs banquet room uhhuh great dim sum at lunch it closed down a few years ago if you say so so howd you come to be there ati it was a business party jewelry i went with a businessman from cambodia he gave me a gold chain to keep mostly he talked to other jewelers and i could do what i wanted who else was at the party jewelry guys armenians israelis chinese persians some white guys the speaker was a white guy from the mayors office or something like that welcoming the jewelry business to la what brought dahlia there she was with one of the white guys he sold watches remember his name never knew it said ati meneng older white hair fat swedish like her dahlia told you she was swedish uhhuh actually she was swiss huge black eyes expanded to cartoon proportions yeah thats what it was you probably think im stupid its an easy mistake to make said milo dahlia didnt like to talk about it being swiss why not she said it was a boring place to live thats why she sometimes said she was from other places such as i dont remember maybe swedenmaybe thats where i got it she only told me about being swiss after we hung out for a while the guy she was with that night she said she knew him from back home he was a big watch dealer knew her father because her father collected watches had hundreds of them in little boxes that kept moving to keep them winded she was at the party to do him a favor the watch guy being his arm candy we all were the men were really into business the girls were mostly left alone and a whole bunch of us ended up at the bar thats where i met dahlia we were both getting drinks and hers was weird bright blue i said something about it looking like dishwashing liquid she laughed we started talking before she left she said its been fun lets hang and she gave me her number you guys hit it off said milo easy with dahlia said ati meneng she was pure sunshine even though she was rich she was cool about it i didnt even know until wed hung out awhile howd you find out i mean i kind of suspected it because she didnt have a job and she drove a porsche boxster really cool little red one when i found out for sure was when she took me to her house real nice and all done up she said her parents bought it for her cause they hated her interesting way to show hatred said milo im sure they didnt really hate her she just meant they needed space from each other she had problems with them she didnt like to talk about it just said they were all religious and stuff they sent her to catholic schools she kept running away taking trains to germany and france going to clubs meeting guys she never went to college like her sister did and that made them mad she just liked to ski and swim and travel on trains and hang out when she told them she wanted to see hollywood they were happy to see her go bought her a house to her that meant stay away as long as you want howd she feel about that she laughed about it that was dahlia she used to say maturity was highly overrated how long were you guys friends half a year maybe a little longer we actually didnt hang out that much because i had to work sometimes dahlia would call mostly shed wait until i called and if she was free wed hang out she had platinum cards was real generous but i didnt take advantage being with her gave me a chance to dress up be my best you know her eyes welled what else did she tell you about her family thats it did she say what her father did to make all that money oh yeah he owned a bank it was like in the family for generations how many siblings did she have just her sister dahlia was the younger one she said her sister was the smart serious one studied to be an architect or something the two of them get along she never said they didnt she didnt talk much about her sister so her parents bought her a house and she took that as their wanting her to stay away i used to say maybe you should call them try to reconnect cause i did that with my father hes real oldschool wanted me to marry an indonesian guy stay at home and raise kids when i got those commercials he refused to watch but now we get along did dahlia take your advice if she did she never said howd she meet prince teddy at first she didnt know he was a prince she found out after theyd been dating uhhuh guess she liked him for himself how they meet at the le beverlyits a hotel in beverly hills small from the outside you cant tell it looks like an apartment building dahlia had a pass to get into the private bar its up at the third floor i was supposed to go to a party but my date canceled and i was bummed and bored and i called dahlia and she said lets go to bh well have some fun shed been there before i could tell cause the bartender knew her drinkblue lagoon they mix it with a special orange liqueur thats colored blue dahlia said she liked the taste but mostly used it like an accessory fashion accessory she had these incredible blue eyes liked to wear colors that brought them out mostly red and yellow but also a bit of blue here and there like jewelry you know she said the blue lagoon worked like jewelry helped bring peoples attention up to her eyes she was like that artistic her house was full of her paintings all blue these wavy designs like the ocean you know so said milo you and dahlia were in the private room of the le beverly i was drinking my mojito and dahlia was drinking her blue lagoon and the only other people were some asian guys across the room playing backgammon dahlia made a joke about their being asian i take you to this great place to get away from work and it ends up looking just like work i laughed and she laughed and then one of them came over and for a second i thought they heard us and were ticked off but the guy was smiling saying women are beautiful when theyre happy if youd agree to join us wed be highly proud something like that kind of lame he had an accent but you could understand him we figured he was the assistant because he was the smallest of them and not the most handsome and the worst dressed the other two guys were younger taller real handsome in zegna suits later i found out they were the bodyguards and he had come over himself prince teddy he just called himself ted youd never know he was anything important he just had on a sweater and jeans and he looked real young shorter than dahlia but she said sure and we got up and joined them without asking me but that was okay mostly i let dahlia make the decisions it was her got me in there in the first place so you joined ted and his bodyguards we didnt know they were bodyguards we just thought they were three guys they ordered some bar food and more drinks put their backgammon away no one was nasty or gross it was nice and polite the bodyguards youd never know they were bodyguards they didnt act tough they acted like his friends just guys hanging out rich guys she blinked yeah i guess so being in the private lounge but thats not what got dahlia to join them money didnt impress her she had her own she told me afterward she thought he was cute and sweet and real smart i guess he was smart he could talk about all sorts of things like what nature travel i really wasnt listening dahlia reported to you afterward he said the next morning said ati meneng coloring yeah okay she went home with him but it wasnt like she ditched me when we were in the ladies room she told me shed decided to do it but only if i was okay with it he seemed like fun she wanted some fun she insisted on giving me cab money i had an early audition anyway was that pretty typical for dahlia going with guys she just met black eyes sparked she was not a slut of course not said milo im just asking if she made quick decisions no said ati meneng shed dance with guys kiss them on the dance floor even sometimes shed go off to a private vip room but i never saw her leaving for a whole evening with a guy never she mustve really liked teddy once they started dating i hardly ever saw her but i was cool with that everyone has their own life eventually she told you who he was that was maybe weeks after i cant remember we hadnt seen each other and all of a sudden dahlia called to catch up said he was out of town lets go to spago she thought it was funny what was how we thought he was the assistant and he turned out to be from one of the richest families in the world she said he still didnt like to dress up sometimes he rented a cheap car and drove to mcdonalds and ate cheeseburgers next day hed be in his gulfstream thats a jet flying anywhere he wanted she flew in it too said it was all pimped up black wood black everything inside whered he fly dahlia mostly vegas but one time hawaii he liked to gamble dahlias only thing was when she was with him she didnt drink cause he was muslim he wasnt drinking that night at the le beverly diet coke she said his thing was diet coke but he wasnt whack about it you know religion i mean basically she thought he was a cool little guy thats what she called him my cool little guy she ever talk about problems in the relationship he could get grumpy had a temper but not to worry he was already a member of the blushing she drew hair across her face milo said member of what it was just a joke a joke about what no answer milo said what club was teddy a member of the hair fell away not a real club just a joke the three f club she said it was the only way to a mans heart three fsfeed em flatter em fuck em dont write that down i dont want my parents to see it you see paper and pencil anywhere ati im just saying so dahlia never complained about teddy being aggressive or violent with her never just grumpy with a temper nothing whack like any guy but you told detective reed he hurt her because i believe he did you

she say she was traveling with teddy back home she said his home sranil she frowned my parents told me about it its a weird place full of like oldfashioned peasants indonesias modern sranils just an

reed i didnt think youd believe any of it period mostly i forgot about it then you showed up and it was like something clicked inside my head you know milo said you told detective reed about a swedish girl but you didnt use dahlias name i didnti wasnt sure its not like i was still thinking about it i used to think about it then it stopped then he showed up i shouldnt have said anything no no you

we were going dancing but she never came back and she left her car at her house and when i looked in through the window all her stuff was still in there you went over because you were worried tears turned the black eyes to pondstones i kept calling her cell was disconnected she had no more internet for iming her house was dark my mind started running i mean i liked him the couple of times i met him but i didnt really know him and what my parents said that started to bother me about people from sranil superstitious peasants cannibals rituals you know scary said milo really scary so i stopped thinking about it i wouldve called her family but i didnt know how to reach them i figured if she stayed away long enough theyd do something even though her parents wanted her gone she just said that said ati meneng it probably wasnt even true families love each other like her sister dahlia said they were different but they still loved each other the serious sister dahlia said she even thought about becoming a nun then she became an architect built houses speaking of houses said milo do you remember the address of dahlias never knew the address dahlia always drove me there and took me home she liked to drive real fast said in germany there were roads with no speed limits she used to go a hundred miles an hour what neighborhood was the house in brentwood could you find it for sure milo stood lets do it right now cant think of a better time ati chapter the house that evoked ati menengs thats it was a minicolonial wedged between two much larger mediterraneans twentyminute drive from the station nice section of brentwood a short walk to the country mart one symmetrical story was faced with white clapboard leadpane windows were grayed by curtains and sideburned by black shutters a red door was topped by a fanlight the lawn was compact and trimmed the empty driveway spotless two blocks away was the vacant lot helga gemein had given her partners for her nonexistent residence milo said youre sure ati totally i remember the door i told dahlia a red door could mean good luck in asia dahlia laughed and said i dont need luck im adorable okay thanks for all your help detective reed will take you back she turned to reed you can just take me to my car or we could have lunch i could call in sick reeds voice was flat whatever you want ati meneng said i guess im hungry theyll probably yell at me anyway milo ran the address taxes were paid by oasis finance associates an investment firm in provo utah a call there elicited the guarded admission from the controller that the owners were nonuscitizens who wish to retain their privacy swiss or asian said milo pardon swiss or asian which is it this is important its a murder investigation mr babcock the victims a woman named dahlia gemein gemein said the controller then you already know ill take that to mean swiss you never heard it from me milo clicked off i said daddy gemeins held on to the house two years after dahlia disappeared maybe its the familys west coast getaway as in sister gets to live here too milo said kinda cute and traditional for helga but with daddy paying the bills shes flexible gloving up he loped up the driveway paused to peer through windows continued to the garage tried the door locked but he managed to budge it an inch from the ground squint through the crack standing he dusted himself off little red boxster red motorcycle looks like a kawasaki be interesting if either was spotted on or near borodi he called don boxmeister gave him the info perfect timing the arson squads canvass was in full swing and a red bike had been spotted the day before the fire three blocks west of borodi parked illegally on a particularly dark section of street the neighbor whod seen it hadnt bothered to call it in boxmeisters other nugget was forensic initial analysis of residue found at the scene was consistent with vegan jello and scorched wires suggested electronic timing devices milo gave boxmeister ati menengs story then hung up and searched the inside cover of a notepad where he keeps a list he doesnt want on his computer phone numbers of cooperative judges each time he begins a new pad he recopies meticulously running his finger down the smallprint backslanted columns he said this is your lucky day judge lavigne lavigne was available in chambers and milo went fullbore making more of the blond jogger than was justified by the facts labeling the red kawasaki as rocksolid physical evidence emphasizing helga gemeins virulent hatred for humanity and evasive behavior when initially questioned he tossed in speculation about international terrorist links maybe even neonazi connections exactly your honor like baadermeinhof all over again meaning the houseand im looking at it right nowcould be a source of weapons explosives bomb timers all of which has been implicated in the arson as well as the multiple murders top of that the suspect may already be gone we really need this warrant now it was as good a performance as ive seen and within seconds he was winking and giving the thumbsup love that guy hell draft it himself all i need to do is get it picked up and filed a call to sean binchy took care of the trip to the criminal courts building binchy was still at manny forbushs law office soon as he had the dupes of ghcs hard drives hed head downtown we waited for the locksmith and the bomb squad and the explosives dogs milo s cell battery was depleted and he switched to my car phone to get his messages lots of bureaucratic trash and one that mattered officer chris kammen of the port angeles washington police department kammens basso rattled the handsoff speaker hey hows it going we went over to that storage unit at four am these people are neatfreaks just about the most organized junk pile ive ever seen which is why im confident telling you there are no suitcases full of money not behind the piano or anywhere else youre kidding wish i was said kammen fortunately for you the facilitys got afterhours video that actually works unfortunately for you it doesnt tell much at eleven fortythree pm a male caucasian in a dark hoodie used a key to gain entry and came out ten minutes later carrying what my grandma would call two stout valises im getting a copy of the tape to send you but trust me its not going to accomplish diddly all you got is shadows and blur the hood covers his face completely how do you know hes caucasian white hands he didnt bother gloving said milo apparently not maybe thats because finding his prints in the bin wouldnt be suspicious mrs flatt was really nervous about mr flatt finding out she held on to them maybe he did kammen said i wondered the same thing so first thing i did was look flatt up and trust me its not him hes a big boy six six used to play basketball for pa high power forward good outside shot i remember the name now we used the gate as a frame of reference to get a measure on hoodie and hes closer to five ten definitely a male why you got a bad girl in your sights square in our sights looks like she burned down the big house early this morning the same one said kammen where the bodies were yup whoa its complicated out in la what time did the house fry three am then hoodies not your torch no way he could be here close to midnight and get back in time you cant get a direct flight out of here that late and even if you made it to seattle what with drive time and airport time and twoplus hours of fly time ill send you the tape so you can judge for yourself but this is a guy unless your bad girl has broad shoulders and humongous hands and walks like a guy chuckle then again youre in la milo said im sure youre right but our girl does have theoretical access to a private jet oh said kammen yeah youre la but even so it would be a hell of a squeeze tell you what though ill call general aviation at our airport see who flew in and out and from where thanks hell of a thing someone beating us to the storage bin we wouldve gone in at a normal time but we didnt want the husband to show up cant help it if the gods werent smiling bye the car grew silent i said two people do the murder two people manage the arson and recover the money maybe helgas not as antisocial as she claims dick and jane murder duet down from a quartet helga paid backer and doreen to torch teddys real estate gave them a cash deposit meaning the total payment might have been more sixfigure job no shortage of motivation said milo helga hires them but in the process learns enough about arson to make the two of them unnecessary and gets rid of them then she sends her buddy to get the dough back how would she know where backer stashed it thats the kind of info a fellow might divulge when bargaining for his life or watching his girlfriend get raped by a gun same for the location of the storage locker key if backer was carrying it on his person that made it even easier helluva lot of effort to burn down a heap of wood reaching back he retrieved his attaché case found the gemein family photo i said helga lied to everyone about applying for the kraeker expansion contract the place means something to her maybe because that party was the last time the family was together as cold as she is she loved her sister dahlia may have been the only person she ever loved take that away you focus your anger destroy what you can sutma for all we know helgas got a secret religious side gets off on visions of teddy never entering heaven he studied the shot some more look at how theyre positioned dahlias standing away from the rest of them but shes also standing closer to helga than to mom maybe thats cause mom looks like shes got all the charm of frozen halibut dad on the other hand is more cod and helgas our shark grinning hows that for dimestore psychoanalysis what im wondering is whether the revenge plot is helgas thing or a family affair we cant eliminate mom and dads involvement and one way or the other its family money that funds helgas lifestyle dahlias too including this house which is immaculately maintained be interesting if the neighbors remember any of the gemeins living here well start canvassing soon as the house is cleared another glance at the little colonial only thing missing is the picket fence checking his watch he followed up with the bomb squad they were a couple of minutes away arriving with hightech toys and three of their best canines a couple of minutes turned into fifteen then twentyfive milo fidgeted smoked made another call one of the hightech toys needed lastditch tinkering milo spat out an expletive bounded out of the car and began knocking on doors i caught up ten minutes later three neighbors had confirmed that helga gemein lived in the house but theyd seen no sign of any other occupants a rangy woman sucking on a pink nat sherman said she changes her looks one day its blond the other day its brunette next time its red i figured her for an actress or trying to be back at the car milo said whole collection of wigs so why the hell would she shave her head in the first place maybe a rite of selfdenial i said giving up hair for lent or until she got the job done the bomb squad arrived checked out the perimeter returned to the front the red door was unlocked and pushed open with a long pole everyone standing back no explosion a lieutenant stuck his head in ventured inside came out giving the thumbsup the dogs ambled in the dogs were interested chapter dahlia gemein was gone but the house remained hers in spirit lacy linens pastel walls a cheerful country kitchen that looked as if it had never been used cute little wicker tables were crowded with cute little glass figurines clear preference for dolphins and monkeys half a dozen amateurishly daubed pale blue abstractions bore a dahlia signature a tiny golden sun dotted the i drawers and closets were filled with expensive clothing much of it bearing german or french labels no family photos but two nail holes in the center hallway said something had been removed despite the girlie décor the house felt hollow temporary the dogs had sat down in nearly every room prompting a fivehour search that unearthed nothing in the furnished spaces but a vacuum of an empty bedroom produced coppery lint among the meager dust barely visible to the eye the snippets of metal had been sucked up from the crack between the floor and the shoe molding the bomb techs best guess was granulated waste from clipped wires and when the dogs really took a liking to the adjoining bathroom a forensic plumber was summoned it didnt take long for him to find remnants of a petroleumbased gelatinous substance rubbery remnants scraped from the drainpipe of the sink like someone washed their hands of the stuff opined a bombsquad cop like that gal in the play lady macbeth milo said that assumes our gal feels guilty more likely she just wanted to be squeakyclean after a hard days work the bomb guy said youre figuring this was her chem lab youre not id expect more trace no matter how well she scrubbed up the dogs like it here the dogs can sniff half an atom divided by a zillion she tracks in a molecule theyll react to me this feels more like the place she came home to after the chem lab if i were you id keep looking maybe tube your suspect on the six oclock and see if anyone recognizes her milo phoned public affairs a lieutenant there said this is something im going to have to check out with the bosses why foreigner big money you really need to ask ambitious fingerprinting and dna swabbing by the crime lab techies continued into the evening plenty of hits in all the expected places at least six different print patterns but a predominance of two if dahlia and helga gemein were ever found chemistry would confirm what was already known the vins of the boxster and the bike in the garage matched vehicles dahlia gemein had registered three years ago the paper on both had lapsed dmv had sent a couple of reminders before consigning the matter to the black hole of government records nothing but oil stains in the otherwise spotless garage the dogs walked through the space nonchalantly the bomb guy said she wanted to set up shop this would be a perfect place id definitely be looking elsewhere milo gave a courtesy call to gayle lindstrom was pleased to get voice mail he tried reed finished with meneng long finished and back at the station loo howd lunch go i suggested a coffee shop she pushed for the pacific dining car on sixth ran up an eightydollar bill surf and turf plus all the trimmings but no new info big appetite for a small girl she doggiebagged nearly all of it talked the whole time about wanting to be an actress said reed i think she gave it all up to you milo said the good news is one way or the other youll get reimbursed for the grub the bad news is the other might mean uncle milo shelling out no way loo it was my decision you bet way moses uncle milo takes care of his troops the other good news is i wont snitch to dr wilkinson about you chomping steak with a hottie i had soda water said reed the eighty was all her shell probably get a week of calories out of that doggie bag so what do you want me to do next start a real estate search for any properties owned by the sultan of sranil we already know teddy has nothing obvious on file local or national start local work your way out im sure his imperial poobah is layered up thicker than a sherpa in winter but we need to try start with masterson tell the battleax who works the phones that someones on the rampage against their star client but dont say who also have sean do a few drivebys on borodi and the surrounding streets just in case la balda returns to the scene you figure she mightve gotten a sexual thrill from the torch this was personal moses theres all kinds of thrills he got out to check on the crime scene techs an hour or so more as he returned to the car officer chris kammen rang in no planes from southern california had flown in last night to the general aviation section of the port angeles airport kammen had taken the extra step and checked with seatac not a single flight to la burbank or ontario departed late enough to accommodate the luggage thiefs nearmidnight departure from the storage unit let alone the drive to seattle so youre definitely dealing with two separate suspects hoodboy couldve blown into our town at any time were no la but we dont have the available manpower to search every dark corner specially without what the city council calls a compelling reason fair enough said milo once i get a suspect we can crossreference hey said kammen optimism i once read about that milo s second try at public affairs was met with a secretarys curt were working on your request working how youll be notified in due time lieutenant clicking off he muttered time to polevault over their little peaheads and dialed deputy chief weinberg to press for a news feed featuring helga gemeins photo toning down the spiel hed given judge lavigne he made it through one sentence before weinberg broke in pa already called me dont play games no ones told me anything sir guess theres nothing to tell said weinberg the answers no you cant be serious sturgis given what we found at the house it seems the next logical step a foreign national from a prominent family youre asking me to create an international terrorist scare on the basis of copper dust its more than a scare sir my suspects already killed three people i havent heard evidence linking her to any murders even on your arson its all air a woman jogging pardon me if im not awestruck and even if she did do the torch what does that come down to getting rid of an eyesore the neighbors are happy to see gone wire dust and something goopy in a pipe for all we know its rubber cement she liked putting together model airplanes the dogs reacted sir i love dogs said weinberg but theyre not infallible what if she spilled kerosene trying to clean off beach tar believe me that would make them sit on their little canine rumps but in this case you cant seriously expect me to have this womans face plastered all over the evening news based on what youve given me you have nothing concrete against her and we are not talking suicide belts at disneyland okay lets forget the terrorism angle even the murders and just describe her as an arson suspect you dont have enough sturgis besides if the arsons the big deal i need to be talking to the arson squad i can have captain boxmeister make the if he asks the same question ill give him the same answer a few bubbles in a pipe and some wire shavings add up to crap bring me fingerprints body fluids something serious before i have embassies driving me nuts fbi and homeland security think shes serious enough to look for theyre involved fbi came to me just like that all of a sudden those morons have esp i called homeland for info and they called the feds and you didnt think to let me know sir i wanted to wait until i had something substantive to tell you then why the hell are we talking now the sum total seems substantive to me said milo then you need to back away and get some perspective clenching his jaws milo middlefingered air okay sir ill keep digging i know youre going to be badmouthing me the minute this conversation terminates brass is always the big bad enemy said weinberg but tryi know its hard but try anywayto pull yourself away from the moment and see the bigger picture by your own account this woman comes from megabucks is a respected professional and has no criminal record what you have on her is hearsay twice removed on a good day her sister could very well be alive whats your evidence any kind of crime was perpetrated against the sister by some oil sheikh no less this is the stuff of migraines sturgis cut the fantasy and get back to shoe leather im sure youve worn out your share of desert boots milo s gaze dropped to todays footwear crepesoled brown sailcloth oxfords long in need of resoling anything you say sir dont patronize me sturgis wasnt trying to sir may i call you should what you deem substantive comes up have i ever been unresponsive to your needs detective no sir ill start eroding my shoes and lets hope nothing gets blown up in the interim silence sir let me make something clear said weinberg i find no merit in your request but in the name of esprit de corps im going to talk to the chief about a news feed just in case in case what sir porkers are spotted soaring in the western sky thank you sir think nothing of it said weinberg because thats what its going to amount to i hadnt heard from milo by ten the following morning figured the night hadnt gone well robin said weve got steaks lets feed him i tried all his numbers got no answer until nearly six pm he was curt subdued all business none of it encouraging gayle lindstrom had followed through with disappointing results no sign of helga gemein at any airport commercial or private nor was she listed on any passenger manifests moe reeds calls to masterson had remained unanswered and hed followed up with a visit the firms glass doors were locked if elena kotsos or her husband was on site they werent letting on real estate searches throughout california had produced nothing reed was working on nevada but as the day progressed and government offices closed down options were fading no better luck on the lush streets of holmby hills where sean binchy had prowled wearing skater duds starting at the wheel of his private drive an camaro inherited from his father then repeating the circuit twice on inline skates id done a driveby myself on the way to the station huge houses towering trees no people as if helga gemeins dream of a humanfree world had come to pass milo s expanded doortodoor had boiled down to reassuring the neighbors they were safe a few additional residents had seen helga entering or exiting the little white house but no one had exchanged a single word of conversation with the blondbrunetteredheaded women they described as kind of cold frosty distant off in her own world one man was sure helga drove a midsized american sedan make unknown black dark blue dark gray i dont really remember no one had ever seen des backer or doreen fredd near the house ditto prince teddy dahlia gemeins picture evoked vague recollections of blond and pretty and cheerful one neighbor thought shed favored the red motorcycle theyre sisters pretty different milo said one shred of theoretical hope computer labs sending over the transcripts of ghcs hard drives pages of printout i could use some help going through it i figured you and i could grab some dinner at moghul go back to the office and analyze unless youve got plans robin and i were talking barbecue i called to invite you oh havent checked messages thanks but gotta pass take a break for a steak i said or two appreciate the offer but i wont be my usual fun self and i need to watch my cholesterol all of a sudden better late than never well i said moghuls good with veggies i was thinking tandoori lamb spinach with cheese maybe some lobster someones bred lowcholesterol sheep and crustaceans so i lied sup with your true love i hung up talked to robin she said like theres a choice grills still cold anyway go by six forty milo and i were sifting through ghcs download history and every bit of email generated during the architectural firms brief life bettina sanfelice and sheryl passant had spent most of their screen time searching ebay and discount fashion sites and gossip blogs both of them loved johnny depp judah cohen hadnt logged on once marjorie holman had used her keyboard sparingly researching green architecture sites news outlets checking her finances which were as conservative and modest as john nguyen had reported using a separate screen name shed arranged regular trysts with six different men among them mannyforbush at forbushziskinshapironet helga gemein and desmond backer conducted infrequent but telling exchanges cyber pen pals during working hours they typed away as they sat in the communal office the correspondence was focused coolly exchanged information about explosives incendiary devices the goals and techniques of ecoterrorism nostalgic reflections about ugly days gone by milo had cited the baadermeinhof gang while spinning for judge lavigne but the reference was prophetic one week prior to the killings of desmond backer and doreen fredd helga gemein had invoked the murderous german band eight times describing them without a trace of irony as refreshingly nihilistic and efficient helga the wonder years my regret is having been born too late backer for me it was the weathermen if only huh helga knowing which way the wind blows backer bill and bernadette and now theyre mainstream sellouts helga inevitable blood thins backer good old days blood was thick and hot the wind was gonna blow hard and hot emphasis on blow lol helga again that with you its always carnality backer got something better lol too bad its not with u helga from what i see youve got your hands full backer hands and other body parts lol helga enough i dont lol about stupidity backer meant to talk to you about that helga about what backer ur state of mind helga my mind is fine backer ur never helga whats to about backer hmmmm how about big goboom helga that one small step backer for the elimination of mankind helga wish i believed in god backer why helga i could say godwilling milo put the pile aside squared the corners creepy i said theres a flirtatious quality to it initiated by backer but she went along with it guy never stopped trying guess his batting average proved it was a good strategy except with helga the one who got away he said shes a cold one alex shed contemplated becoming a nun maybe shes one of those people with a low libido or she decided to suppress her urges or shes doing it with another guy and decided to be loyal helga and hoodie i said its possible but ill bet sex is low priority for her he smiled i could tell you about nuns the joys of parochial school some of them were angels greatest women i ever met a few were monsters about as warm and cuddly as helga can you imagine her with a metaledged ruler guess she found her own religion first commandment lose the hair in a lot of cultures hairs a symbol of sensuality fundamentalists tend to cover their women and keep their own hair short buddhist monks shave their heads its all about pruning vanity and focusing on nirvana sista skinhead aiming for a nopeople nirvana she finds common ground with mr happyface horndog poor fool had no idea helga was using him he flicked the transcripts i think i finally get backer doing doreen at borodi there never was any distinction between business and pleasure for ol des it was all about fun shaking his head in flagrante destructo he locked up we took the stairs down passed the clerk out front and were at the door when a shout brought us to a halt the clerk stood and brandished the phone call for you lieutenant sturgis who a hand clamped over the receiver nearwhispered reply god delivering the tablets from mount sinai that was moses whatever here take it milo accepted the phone sturgisevening sir yes i did yes he did i see thank you sir i hope so too sir he hung up the clerk said is he mad he sounded mad when i told him you werent in your office hes peachy good good im hearing bad talk about budget cuts im new and i really need this job ill put in a good word for you the clerk brightened you could do that if the topic comes up leaving the man to puzzle that out we left the station and stepped out into warm night air cruisers pulled in and out of the staff lot a uniform stood near the fence smoking and texting on his iphone a shabbylooking man stepped out of the bailbond office half a block up and slouched toward santa monica a woman walking her dog saw him and crossed the street when she spied the badge clipped to milo s jacket pocket she relaxed traffic hummed the air smelled like hot tar milo breathed in deeply spread his arms wide i love when something finally happens weinberg changed his mind screw weinberg that was no chief with a small c his holiness in all his celestial glory turns out he thinks putting helgas face on the news is a capital idea as long as it leads somewhere and you dont end up making me look like a histrionically overreacting conspiracynut paranoid schizo loonytune congratulations i said now all you have to do is get that passport photo already delivered to the networks he said palace guards move fast you bet he said lighting up a cigar miss skinhead debuts at ten sports and weather to follow chapter robin and i watched the news in bed blanche wedged between us dozing and alternating between snorts and squeaks flicks of her left batear the story was the final segment of a slow news day someone not looking for it mightve missed it twelve seconds total half of that featuring a cloudy passport shot of a barely recognizable helga gemein with bluntbangs black hair no mention of nationality terrorism murder just a woman considered a person of interest in an arson case anyone with information was requested to call lieutenant miller sturgis at now on to tonights caughtintheact feature with celebrity heiress roma sheraton found shopping for jeans on robertson with no makeup and looking as if she just woke up on the wrong side of the bed for more on that heres entertainment reporter mara stargood i clicked off robin said miller sturgis even the chief has limitations the phone rang i said she looked like bettie page milo said howd you know it was me the ring tone was kind of weepy and the receiver sagged ghost of salvador dalí yeah itll probably come to nothing but he was wrong by ten oclock the following morning fifty tips had come in only one was good but who needed quantity when you had quality hiram kwok operated a secondhand furniture store on western avenue between olympic and pico the hipperthanthou vintagecraving renaissance that had sparked la brea s discount casegoods emporiums had eluded western half the blocks storefronts were dark shuttered or blocked by accordion gates kwoks space was a pack rats paradise crammed with velveteen and carelessly gilded almostwood chipped crockery limp lamp shades ratty furs fake tiffany glass that didnt even come close a barely negotiable aisle had been cleared through ceilinghigh stacks of treasure kwok was fiftyish thin and hollowcheeked with sparse gray hair and nicotine teeth a photo of a handsome asian kid in fulldress marine corps regalia hung above the formica folding table kwok used as a desk milo said your boy kwok said over in iraq right now they say hes coming home next month then heading to dubai guess we got to protect them arabs you must be proud of him he has a head for business knows computers i wanted him to take over so i can retire but he said it put him in a bad mood business being around too much junk so youre here about her huh what a bitch no big shock she did bad things come on ill show you her place leading us through the shop he encountered the sides of a disassembled crib shoved them aside continued to the back door we exited into a pitted alley that looked out to block walls of neighboring properties a toyota camry took up one slot of kwoks threespace lot hiram on the license plate multiple alarm warnings on the side windows heavyduty crooklock on the steering wheel more security than the mansion on borodi kwok continued walking south stopped at the rear of the adjoining shop no cars no painted slots weeds poked through the pavement most of the back wall was a corrugated aluminum garage door manual a pull handle bolted by a serious combination lock hiram kwok said she keeps no regular hours but is in and out all the time i always knew when she was here because she was an inconsiderate pain in the butt leaving her car parked so it stuck out into my area look at the layout she had tons of her own space why the hell did she have to invade mine and when her buddies were around it became a worse problem i asked her nice at first she looked at me like i was retarded finally moved the car but the next time same damn thing over and over like she was trying to annoy me what kind of car did she drive buick lesabre i know the license plate by heart kwok rattled off numbers milo copied i know it by heart because i called it in to you guys had to be twenty times know what they told me disputes between private property owners needed to be settled privately and now she burned something down you guys need to change procedures milo nodded tell me about her buddies two of em yuppies said kwok mr pretty boy and miss pretty girl in the bmw what they were doing with her i could never figure out i even wondered about a porno shoot something like that why because its a hidden place having to go in through the back and those two looked like actors good looking too good looking said kwok like they spent a lot of time in front of the mirror especially him also the two of them didnt fit with her she was like one of those goths you know what im talking about allblack clothes the wigs said milo that bettie page wig they showed on tv was a favorite you know who bettie was right hottest pinup in the history of the world once in a while i find her memorabilia sells immediately the goth thing one of my daughters went through that a phase so i know all about it she was too oldthe germanto be acting like that but she did unlike the other two the other two were preppiesken and barbie you know it just didnt fit so i figured porno turns out it was even worse huh a sixpack photo lineup wouldve been optimal procedure but all milo had were photos of des backer and doreen fredd hers postmortem kwok nodded yup thats them so theyre all in it together right now were unraveling their relationship bunch of firebugs planning whoknowswhat right next door thats just great said kwok you noticed when you got here that the whole front of her window is blacked over from the street it looks closed weve got lots of backdoor tenants heremusicians use the place five to the north for rehearsals theres a girl they say her brothers a movie star i forgot his name uses hers for a photography lab but none of them causes problems i tried to tell the traffic cops something was off about her they couldnt care less i said off how way she walked talked when i tried to tell her about the parking situation she just looked through me like i didnt exist like i was nothing to her whens the last time you saw her here not for a while id have to say a month what exactly did she burn down were still working on that said milo meaning none of my business fine just as long as she doesnt come back and blow me up if you do see her again heres my card mr kwok youre not going to keep an eye out for hersurveillance well be doing everything to catch her sir kwok hadnt taken the card milo held it there youll take me more seriously than those traffic cops i already have sir your help is deeply appreciated kwok pocketed the card milo said next time you speak to your son tell him dads a hero too kwok winced i dont know about that im just being logical yeah ill call you who the hell wants her coming back and burning the whole neighborhood down no sign of helga gemein by the next day the tips had ebbed to a handful of useless leads milo traced ownership of the rented storefront to an elderly couple named hawes living in rancho mirage the lease had been negotiated through a commercial brokerage and the listing broker had since moved to new jersey nothing iffy about the move he said broker had just gotten married and hubbie was transferred to trenton maybe thats why she got careless helga used her own name but all the backup information she gave was bogus and no one checked also a full years rent in cash up front tends to ease the process i got permission to search from ma and pa hawes nice folks about as radical as norman rockwell and plenty scared their place was used as a kaboom factory thats confirmed bomb squad found jello ingredients cookbooks like the one ricki flatt saw in desis room swiss and german newspaper articles on ecosabotage computer searches on sranil copper wire switches timers with remote triggers tools and workbenches to put it all together also a collection of womens wigs triplewrapped in plastic fortunately no booby traps so we left everything in place in case helga comes back have a twentyfourhour watch going on the house and the alley divided into threehour shifts sean moses me del hardy because hes exspecial services really has a thing for terrorists and eight plainclothes officers milo s army courtesy his munificence he loves being divinely right theres no reasonable place to park a vehicle in the alley itself but the haweses own a whole bunch of other storefronts up and down the block and some are vacant so were stationed on both sides of helgas little lair she shows up shes chopped misanthrope the hitch of course is she may already be roadtripping in that buick which has been bolod the tag numbers kwok memorized trace back to a stolen truck some guy with a carwashing business got ripped off eleven months ago when he was inguess whereholmby hills she scouted the neighborhood for a long time i said she and hoodie her intention right from the beginning was to be actively involved not just a financier backer and fredd were expendable the moment they signed on yeah shes a sweetheart ill be in that alley at seven right now im headed over to ricki flatts motel because shes finished all the paperwork on desis body and im driving her to the airport beyond the call i said meanwhile you probe for what she hasnt told you you he said are immovably skeptical thats why were pals want to come it could conceivably get psychological chapter ricki flatt was waiting outside her room jacket zipped luggage on the ground milo jumped out beat her to the rear car door you really didnt need to do this lieutenant well take streets freeways a bad idea at this hour moments later howd it go with the coroner ricki it took a while but were finally settled ill be able to ship to have desi sent back in two days spoke to the cemetery in seattle where my parents are buried and theyve got a plot available they referred me to a mortician here whos handling the logistics as well as the cosmetics he said there wouldnt be that much to do desi still looked handsome any progress lieutenant were chipping away ricki oh by the way those suitcases are out of your storage bin great she said i spoke to scott this morning and he didnt mention anything so were fine yes you are ricki a beat unfortunately were not what do you mean port angeles police didnt remove the suitcases this guy beat them to it hooking his arm he dangled the copy of the surveillance photo sent by chris kammen as kammen had predicted too blurry to be useful who is this we were hoping you might know me why would i could be someone local well i dont know she said i have absolutely no idea squinting he took everything sure did howd he get in with a key said milo who besides you and desi had one no onedoes scott know about this no reason for him to know how about scott does he have a key no we rented it to store my parents stuff scott was always bothering me to get rid of everything someone stole all that money the same person who murdered desi we dont know yet ricki flatt returned the photo thats why you offered to drive me you think ive held back on you and want to ask more questions im just informing you of the situation as it stands ricki only you and desi had keys and the guy in the photo obtained one do you happen to have yours right now im aof course i do opening her purse she fumbled produced a ring shuffled this one this is mine meaning that person used desis meaning he did murder desi for the money its always about the damn money burying her face in her hands she rocked milo drove another half a mile ricki what did desi tell you about his boss helga gemein her this is related to desis job at this point its all questions not answers ricki did desi talk about helga about work in general he liked the job said it was fun kind of easy said he met her at a convention and she offered him a job what kind of convention he didnt say why was she involvedoh my god the time desi brought the money he was traveling with a woman i didnt tell you because it slipped my mindits not like he brought her with him what happened was after desi and i took the suitcases to storage i asked him to stay for dinner he said hed love to but he needed to get back to his hotel someone was waiting the obvious assumption was a woman because with desi there was always a woman i made a crack youre in town for a day already have a hot date normally hed give that cute smile of his this time he frowned said a hot date would be the ideal but dont lay odds on it which was unusual for desi he was always so upbeat she choked back tears i remember i actually kind of gloated to myself finally don juan has failed how petty of me all those stupid childhood feelings i said what else did he say about this woman the only other thing was that the car he was driving was hers he needed to get it back to her almost as if he was intimidated by her the way you would be by a boss thats what made me think of it right now why else would desi be intimidated by anyone let alone a woman unless she had some kind of power over him that hadnt stopped him from propping marjorie holman up against a sheet of plywood milo said what kind of car was it american dark i dont remember i really wasnt paying attention milo nudged the file over to me i thumbed through found the internet photos hed printed of buick lesabres ricki flatt said cars arent my thing but sure that could be it this is helgas car milo said its similar to hershey look at this free sailing its good we avoided the freeway moments after hed carried her bag into the terminal he was back on the phone with chris kammen i can narrow the time frame for backers trip friend all i need is verification that either backer or helga gemein registered at one of your hotels kammen said friend huh every time i talk to you my life gets complicated thanks chris i appreciate it kammen laughed like i said before we aint gotham but we also aint mayberry itll take a while whos this helga milo filled him in kammen said international terrorism now i can brag to my kids about something not that its going to help with teenagers his return call came in before wed returned to the station bass tones vibrated with triumph i used logic figured people from la might want some creature comforts but since they were involved in something illegal they might want to stay off the main drag weve got a place that fits the bill twenty miles out set on the water real woodsy they got a spa honeymoon couples like it the myrtlewood inn im fixing to take my wife there for our anniversary if she behaves herself anyway sure enough ms helga gemein used her platinum amex during that exact time onenight stay or stand depending on your perspective excellent said milo give me the card number kammen read it off if your boy backer was there with her it was a stay not a stand cause she rented two rooms paid for both theres no record of who stayed in the other but whoever it was racked up hours of rentaporn unlike ms helga who didnt watch a second of payperview probably drank tap water because there were no room service charges not even peanuts from the minibar living like a nun said milo kammen said your boy backer though he watched four dirty movies ordered steak and shrimp cocktail and raided the bar for all kinds of goodies not exactly two peas in a pod they had enough rapport to do bad stuff chris sounds like your typical marriage i said how many rental car companies do you have in port angeles all the majors and a couple of minors why be good to know if either backer or helga used a hired vehicle the sister said backer was driving her car she wasnt with him when he gave his sister the suitcases they couldve gone their separate ways ah said kammen okay ill check that outstay on the line maybe i can do it fast four minutes later call me speedy gonzales myrtlewood inns got avis on the premises ms helga rented a chevy cobalt during her oneday stay its going to take a while to find out how much mileage she put on but i can do it if you want milo said much appreciated chris ill keep you informed this is starting to be fun i said separate cars means helga couldve followed backer to the storage bin once she got hold of the key getting the money was a breeze she didnt even need to bully him to get it they worked in the same office backer ever sociable goes off to lunch with his female friends helga ever the loner stays behind and goes through his desk or a coat pocket makes a mold then why the gun rape everyones got their own notion of fun milo said lord i want a date with this girl in a small bright room a warrant for helgas financial transactions revealed little shed canceled the amex account within days of the port angeles trip no others had shown up under her name i said daddy keeps vaults full of crisp bills maybe the department will fly you to zurich he phoned gayle lindstrom asked for a probe of ggialter privatbank she said ill try but good luck those places are tighter than missile silos still nothing at the airport im not into secrets milo if there was id tell you he hadnt told her about the storefront on western when i asked why he said at this point all she can do is complicate matters any suggestions on tracing ms hellish im wondering if shed chance a road trip she wouldnt exactly blend into middle america helga in the heartlandsounds like a movie the exception i said being vegas yeah a threeheaded albino monkey would blend in there its fugitive central okay i know a us marshal maybe helga will materialize at the craps table at caesars if not youre probably right shes still in town hopefully sooner or later shell return to her bomb shop my votes for sooner because youre my pal because its her house of worship gayle lindstrom phoned to say shed talked to her bosses about probing the bank given past dealings with the swiss government over nazi gold and looted wartime accounts the best guess was years of wrangling milo said nothing like neutrality what we were able to do she said is institute passport scans of the entire gemein family to build a conspiracy case should you ever find helga this whole thing is making the bureau nervous the fact that doreen was your paid stooge and she used you used my predecessors said lindstrom my goal on this one is being seen as outside the loop at five fortythree pm milo ate junk food at his desk preparing for the beginning of his alley shift he had a mouth full of packaged burrito when sean binchy called got her loot cuffed and in the back of my car she went down real easy chapter helga gemein in allblack and her bettie page wig parked her buick carelessly barely clearing hiram kwoks area she had her key in the lock of the bomb factory when sean binchy took her from behind shouting police and drawing her arms back binchy used longfingered bassplayers hands to secure her wrists had the cuffs on within seconds helga said all for twigs binchy patted her down lightly and spun her around twigs helgas look said he was beyond help by the time moe reed arrived from the opposite end of the alley sean had her in the rear seat of his unmarked belted in she glared through the window reed said excellent bro opened the door to get a better look helga said you look like a storm trooper reed said and youre an expert on that you didnt think to change your appearance why would i you look just like on the news what news the tv broadcast tv said helga is garbage i dont waste my time two hours later she sat in a west la interrogation room as bored as shed been when milo spieled off miranda a group watched from next door binchy reed don boxmeister the guest of honor captain maria thomas a tweedsuited blondcoiffed wellspoken aide to the chief the last few minutes had been spent discussing the western avenue rental which helga dismissed as my studio for what conceptual art those fuses for a collage what kind of collage you couldnt hope to understand milo hadnt bothered to ask her where she was living a rentalagency key was traced to a house in marina del rey del hardy had gone there with a crew of cops five flatscreens but no cable or satellite hookup in place no computer either but drawers full of paper included a trove of emails everything in german which hardy sent for translation to hollenbeck division detective two manfred obermann hardy said guess who shes renting the place from alonzo jacquard milo said doctor dunkshot he have any idea who his tenant is hes coaching in italy everything went through an agency ms friendly paid up front in cash just like with the storefront funny choice for her the place is tricked out way past vulgar pure alonzotrophy room six fully stocked wet bars disco room strippers pole home theater racks of the kind of dvds i wouldnt keep out in the open great view of the water though but she had the drapes drawn is sleeping in a small guest room near the service porch might as well be in a convent except for the toys what kind of toys im a churchgoing man milo dont make me go into detail chuckle lets just say the latex lobby likes her milo said youre sure theyre not alonzos toys no these were definitely hers all girlie stuff hardy sighed alonzo man he was talented too bad he wasnt around to sign an autograph for my kid milo asked a few more questions about art helga answered each with dont waste my time you are ignorant captain maria thomas said shes breathtakingly arrogant boxmeister said that could work for us no she thinks shes in charge doesnt lawyer up thomas checked her blackberry so far so good but he hasnt gotten into serious stuff milo made a show of putting on reading glasses dropping papers retrieving them um okay so how about we talk about the house on borodi helga cut him off blah blah blah the house on borodi lane where blah blah blah blah blah milo grinned something is funny policeman blah blah blah is one of my favorite phrases helga rotated a finger in the air is that supposed to give us commonality i dont imagine commonality would be possible between us oh you despise people said milo most of the time i consider myself part of the human race i despise people said helga so you said the first time we met you policeman need to stop decoding literally milo snapped his fingers i knew i shouldve paid attention in metaphor class helga ran a manicured finger under chopped black bangs a policeman who has studied the dictionary started with a and working all the way to b unfortunately i kinda got hung up on boom helga didnt answer milo said the house on borodi i burned some twigs so what twigs a heap of rotting wood a monstrosity i did the world a favor by burning down the house not a house helga corrected ruins twigs garbage monstrosity shit i cleansed in the name of aesthetic righteousness structural integrity epistemological consistency and metaecology metaecology didnt get even close to that in the dictionary it wont be in there i constructed it ah helga gemein held up the rotating finger it means stepping back from trivial components of the gestalt that endow the system with no functional autonomy milo said looking at the big cosmic machine not the cogs helga studied him you cant hope to understand because you are american and americans are all religious weve got a few atheists in name only policeman even your atheists are religious because american faith is infinite the suckling pig that never stops offering its flesh im not sure im you people have convinced yourself possibilities are endless endings are happy puzzles are to solved the future is an advertising jingle your way of life is sacred might makes right if americans would tear themselves away from their twigs and their shit and use their eyes and ears and noses to dissect reality they would alter their cognitive structure maria thomas muttered and become clinically depressed like europe helga said americans are the domesticated pets of the world submissive and eating their own shit until they turn vicious and then we have war boxmeister said talk about a cuckoo clock thomas said ive been to interpol conferences shes just another spoiled eurotrash brat but maybe a little whack too boxmeister nudged me what do you think doc thomas said bite your tongue detective and dont answer dr delaware its going to be pain enough dealing with a foreign national last thing we need is diminished capacity milo was saying so burning the twigs was an act of cleansing refuse removal taking out the garbage helgas blue eyes narrowed milo said wouldnt altruism be a better word two sleek blacknailed hands clenched it would be a stupid word whys that altruism is nothing more than a mutation of selfishness milo crossed his legs sorry im not decoding i do what society says is nice so i can feel nice what is more narcissistic than that milo pretended to contemplate okay so if it wasnt altruism it was what i told you an act of metaecological cleansing hmm dont play stupid policeman you have enough natural defects there is no need to supplement boxmeister said ouch heil helga milo uncrossed scanned his notes again edged his chair back a few inches removing a handkerchief from a trouser pocket he wiped his brow getting hot in here no helga gemein tugged at her wig i am comfortable to me it feels hot id think that thing would make it worse for you what thing the hairpiece dynel doesnt breathe this she said is genuine hair from india he smiled so youre not a hothead helga snorted and turned away milo said no i mean that seriously its clear to me that you rely on reason not impulse maria thomas leaned forward yes yes go for it helga gemein said should i not rely on reason of course you should said milo we all should but sometimes being spontaneous spontaneity is an excuse for poor planning youre into planning no answer maria thomas was at the edge of her chair easy now milo said being an architect i imagine youd favor blueprints helga turned to face him without blueprints policeman even chaos doesnt work even chaos up came the pedantic finger there is chaos that emanates from stupidity think of flatfooted policemen in brassbuttoned tunics and tall hats tripping over themselves then there is corrective chaos and that must be planned burning those twigs didnt result from stupidity said milo you considered every detail i always do said helga always always maria thomas punched her fist yes helga gemein sniffed this room smells like a toilet it does get a little stale said milo how often do you bring prostitutes here pardon for your policeman afterhour parties mustve missed those oh please said helga it is common knowledge what policemen do with women theyve dominated down on the knees the man feels so big boxmeister said i must work in the wrong division maria thomas shot him a sharp look he shrugged milo said the cops do that in switzerland helga said if you are interested in switzerland buy a plane ticket goodbye policeman you have bored me enough i am going but she made no attempt to stand milo said going twigs brush clearing what is that a penalty i will pay you out of that cash in your purse since when is it a crime to have money america worships money no crime at all but six thousands a lot of cash to be carrying around helga smirked thomas said that was pure rich kid this ones never been told no helga said what is the amount of my fine milo said im not sure of the penal code on twigs yet were still checking well do it quickly soon as the district attorney lets me know ill get the paperwork going meanwhile lets go over this act of cleansing not again no i will not i just want to make sure i understand if you do not understand by this time you are hopelessly defective anythings possible said milo he shuffled papers knitted his brows stuck out a tongue hummed a low tune youre sure you dont want more water i still have eyeing the cup hed brought her five minutes in boxmeister said garsh gomer when you gonna call for a hayseed and a spittoon milo said okay you can drink that helga gemein picked up the cup sipped it empty power of suggestion turning point in the interview she put the cup down eyes still on his notes he said so you planned and burned the twigs all by yourself tell me how you did it the fine is insufficient penance said helga smirking again in america money fixes everything even so maam we like to have all the facts the facts are as an architect with a strong background in structural engineering i have a thorough understanding of structural vulnerability i located the inherent structural defects of that garbage heap set devices precisely operated a remote timer and watched as everything turned to dust so you were right there close enough to bathe in heat and light a few houses down i didnt count but you parked the motorcycle three blocks away blue eyes sparked how do you know i drive a motorcycle it was spotted and reported so you know the answer to your question so do not waste my time like i said we need to verify said milo for our report so we can let you go and be done with all this proper procedure said helga enabling you to pretend competence you know about procedure helga arched an eyebrow milo said that old joke hell is the place where the italians establish procedure and the swiss are in charge of design hell policeman is the place americans gorge themselves to unconsciousness and delude themselves to mindless optimism never heard that version said milo but you have to admit the swiss are darn good at designwho makes the best watches speaking of which lets talk about those timers whered you get them from des the quick reply caught him offguard he covered with a prolonged nod des backer no des hitleryes des backer i want to go and pay my fine and be gone soon said milo what else did des supply you with everything meaning you have invaded my studio you know what is there the fuses the wiring the vegan jello des knew about all that because he was he claimed to be an anarchist claimed you think he was faking des indulged himself des and women he was not a serious person milo said whered you two meet an anarchist conventionguess thats kind of an oxymoron huh helga said in a chat room which one shardsnet as in broken glass as in broken universe she said it has closed down anarchists are not good at selfperpetuation poor organizational skills said milo silence so you met online des being an architect mustve made it seem perfect though the combination is kind of odd building up and destroying there is no contradiction whys that as i told you everything depends on context but anyway i am not an anarchist i do not join movements so youre a i am said helga gemein with the first smile id seen her offer myself milo fiddled with his papers some more feigned confusion kind of a onewoman truth squad so you met des online and the two of you decided to burn some twigs i decided he was your supplier said milo knew where to get equipment that was the real reason you hired him the real reason you established your firm silence nice shell he went on for explaining your presence in la giving you a reason to be hanging with des covering expensesfifty thousand in cash whos the real source of all that money your father no response the road trip to port angeles helga nice crisp bills in two suitcases the kind you get fresh from a bank the kind that gets released when one bank talks to another helga gemein poked a finger under her wig i would like some water milo collected his papers and left alone helga fooled with the hairpiece some more massaging the top of the glossy black strands working a finger joint under the hem and poking around don boxmeister said what shes got cooties maybe we shouldve stripsearched her maria thomas said what i said still stands don no sense alienating her right off he needs something to work with and its paying off she admitted premeditation several pokes at the blackberry im needed back in an hour hope he can nail the bitch soon helga straightened the wig turned leaned on the table sat and planted her boots on the floor her eyes closed her head swayed what the hells she doing said boxmeister some kind of meditation i said probably dissociation putting herself somewhere else is her default strategy milo returned with a small cup of water helga didnt acknowledge him but her eyes opened when he said here you go and placed it in front of her he put on reading glasses reviewed his notes she eyed him finally sipped okay tell me about the trip to port angeles she touched a fringe of wig i engaged in tourism the great lifeblood of american pseudoculture a pleasure trip i have been to disneyland as well guess i dont need to ask if you liked it actually she said it was quite pleasing in its own repugnant way consistent with vulgar american culture with a world devoid of reason he harrumphed slid a couple of sheets toward her this is your registration form from the myrtlewood inn in port angeles and this is your car rental receipt i stayed at a nice hotel she said so you and des backer both stayed there you took separate rooms the staff remembers you paying for both they also recall seeing you and des at breakfast together guesses good ones helga gemein frowned so what i already told you i got my equipment from him it was a purchasing trip sightseeing then some purchasing whyd you give des your car and rent another vehicle for yourself because we were not together as as being together did you drive up together i drove he flew so no one at the office would suspect anything i wanted to drive said helga he wanted to fly he wanted to visit his family what did you do when he was visiting i shopped for timers and fuses among other things said helga what things clothing find some bargains jeans she said stroking one shapely thigh black jeans on sale you drove because you couldnt risk an airport security check with fifty thousand dollars in two suitcases helga took several seconds to respond if you know so much why are you wasting my time that darn old procedure thing i need to hear it from you all because of twigs afraid so they were big twigs owned by an important person no one is important obviously someone was to you helga he moved in closer like id seen him do so many times spreading his shoulders and hardening his voice she flinched reflexively forced a smile he asserted his big face inches from hers helga someone was important enough for you to pay fifty thousand dollars to burn down twigs important enough for you to set up a shell company important enough for you to plan precisely helga gemeins chest heaved she looked away beginning of the end helga youd like me to think you believe in nothing but the way i see it everything you did was an act of pure faith because thats what vengeance is right pure faith in the power of correction that wrong can be made right pretty lips quivered she stilled them with another smirk ridiculous faith motivated by love helga silence milo said you loved dahlia nothing to be ashamed of on the contrary but it is downright fundamentalist taking faith that far you may not be religious helga but you have no trouble drawing upon religion when it works for you helga gemein rolled her eyes let loose with a ragged tooloud laugh the sudden rise of her shoulders the rippling along her jawline gave her away milo said sutma no answer youve heard of sutma helga primitive nonsense maybe so helga but the point was prince teddy and his family dont agree waiting for a reaction to the name a single blink then nothing milo said or maybe its not just them maybe you really do believe in heaven and hell and all that good stuff but that doesnt really matter helga the point is the sultan and the rest of the family believes and after what was done to dahlia you needed to grab hold of any shred of revenge you could find because teddys out of your reach geographically financially you cant touch him but cosmically you burned those twigs in order to leave teddy dangling in cosmic limbo downright terrifying for someone who believes in sutma silence he said it is a funny concept though if i was a religious person id want to believe just the oppositedestroying material remains speeds up entry to the next world he laughed clapped his hands hard sprang up paced the room twice helga watched alarmed forced herself to stop following his circuit sat still as he came to a halt behind her she stared straight ahead pretending not to care about the massive figure shadowing her her jawline was an information highway reason i just laughed helga is i had a sudden insightan epiphany i guess youd call it youre totally into ritual like shaving your head since the first time i met you ive been trying to figure it out why would you do something like that but now i get it its a ritual of selfabasement you took on until you achieved your goal like fasting on lentwouldnt surprise me if youve done your share of that too other kinds of fasting maybe even a vow of celibacy her jaw clenched how long ago helga did you start eating meat during lent if you ever did do you eat your lent veggies and explain it as metaecology helga gemein shut her eyes even so its religion helga are you a strict vegetarian or do you sneak meat when no ones looking silence once a catholic always a catholic helga believe me i know she folded her arms let them drop began deepbreathing oh come on said milo lets be just a little bit honest and fess up like they taught you in convent school at the core youre devout believe sin must be punished and theres no greater sin than murder especially the murder of an innocent like dahlia helga gemeins eyelids scrunched tighter tears trickled out you loved dahlia thats not a bad thing thats a good thing she loved you too believing is a good thing helga it helps me understand what you did everything youve done since you arrived in this country has been aimed at getting justice for dahlia youre powerless to go to sranil and do what you dream aboutthough im sure you havent given up on that and maybe daddy hasnt either but meanwhile she let out a cry clamped a hand over her mouth milo bent close spoke softly inches from her ear youre a survivor aiming for justice thats human helga and no matter what you say youre a member of the species the entire lower half of helgas face began to tremble she pressed one palm to her cheek failed to still waves of twitches milo pulled his chair so their knees were just short of contact let the bastard dangle he said tenderly he deserves it moving in closer what i dont understand is why you had to kill des and doreen helga opened her eyes what are you talking about i think weve moved past selfdelusion helga you are ridiculous he handed her a tissue she swatted it away milo watched it flutter to the floor whyd you have to kill them helga did they get greedy and ask for more money helga gemein shook her head fool milo said or were they just a nuisance and expendable time to cover your tracks she tried to scoot her chair back the legs stuck he pressed closer she cleared her throat drew back her head boxmeister said uhoh milo jerked away just in time to avoid the missile of spit a wet gob landed on the floor her hands were balled flushfaced she panted milo shook his head ever the patient schoolmaster looks like i touched a nerve helga you have touched stupidity she said i have never killed anyone never whats the big deal you claim to hate humanity humanity is shit i dont put shit on my hands except when it suits your purposes she shook her head idiot reaching for his papers he pulled out another sheet the picture of the man in the hoodie adroitly no more fumbling you killed desi and doreen with this guys help helga gemeins jaw turned smooth a smile spread slowly that serene smile tightened my gut i have never seen this person maria thomas said uhoh what said boxmeister thomas said that look like a tell to you that picture mellowed her damn she turned to me either she is nuts or she really doesnt know what hes talking about right doc either way its mucho problemo milo continued to display the photo helga said you can wave that around forever your little policeman flag this guys your partner helga the person who helped you murder des and doreen did you drive up to port angeles with him helga shook her head you are an utter fool this photo was taken in port angeles a couple of days ago this man was there to retrieve the money talk about good planning you never had any intention of letting des keep a penny because you never had any intention of letting him live the real reason you rented him a car was so you could follow him and find out where he stashed the money after you returned to la you got hold of his storage keyplucked it out of a pocket or found it in his desk drawer made a mold maybe you did it when he was off having fun with the ladies and you were in the office all by your baldheaded selfabasing notsolapsed catholic fundamentalist self helga gemein giggled you truly believe this scheiss the evidence makes me believe helga then the evidence is scheiss clucking her tongue i have burned twigs that is all now i wish to leave and pay my fine and not hear any more of this crazy nonsense twigs said milo we call it arson and its a felony helga shrugged i will hire a lawyer he will make it into a prank that got too big and i will be free and you will remain stupid damn said boxmeister thomas said she hasnt actually asked shes only threatened shifting close to the mirror change the subject dude milo said more water yes said thomas helga said no thank you sweet smile unsettling wrong desi and doreen were murdered in that turret you went back to the house anyway i had business to do the murder didnt bother you not my concern policeman milo slid another piece of paper toward her what is this policeman this is whats left of a gentleman named charles ellston rutger he grew up in a house that once sat on the borodi property had one of those stupid sentimental attachments to the land which is why he liked to sneak up there sit in that same turret reminisce about the good old days see that shiny thing pointing thats what was left of his wineglass and that over there that used to be a tin of foie gras mr rutger was enjoying a snack washing it down with a nice bordeaux the night you reduced him to dust helga gemein grabbed the paper thats a crime scene photo helga check the date he doesnt look like much does he you killed him helga gaped whispered no on the contrary helga yes a big fat yes mr rutger had the misfortune to be enjoying a quiet moment in the turret of that monstrosity when you came in and set your fuses and your timers and your plugs of jello he didnt hear you because you were careful and quiet and he was an old man and being all the way up there on the third floor muted the sound he was sipping wine as you stood on the sidewalk and enjoyed your act of cleansing but maybe you already know that no he didnt hear you helga but youre young your ears work just fine so my bet is you heard him but you didnt care whats another piece of human scheiss helga let go of the photo as if it were toxic it slid to the floor she stared at it eyes wide with horror first time shed shown anything close to appropriate emotion i liked her better for it but not much oh god she said no atheists on the hot seat your twigs became a pyre for a human being helga that we call felony homicide loss of a life during the commission of any major crime even without prior intention thats not a fine helga i never knew she said in a small thin voice you must believe me i must it is true i did not know you havent been listening helga whether or not you knew its still felony homicide but that makes no sense i dont write the rules helga she studied him you are lying that is special effects anyone can stamp a date you try to confuse me so i will confess to des and doreen but i will not because i did not you did a whole lot helga trust me mr rutgers real was want me to show you his autopsy report you fried him to a crisp i do not kill milo shook his head unfortunately you do youve already admitted the arson admitted planning it a man died in the process youre facing a long prison sentence the only way i can see you extricating yourself from this mess is by explaining yourself tell me why you decided to eliminate des and doreen i can see a motive right off the bat they were trying to blackmail you if they were thats a good explanation people can understand that its kind of selfdefense she shook her head he said and if this guy in the hood did the actual killing and you didnt really know what was going to happen and you tell me who he is that will also help you that said helga gemein wringing her hands would be all idiocy i killed nobody truth is helga im leaning toward your partner as the major bad guy for des and doreen because there was a certain masculine stupidity to the murders and i dont see stupid as part of your makeup so lets start with who he is the dalai lama pardon today he is the dalai lama tomorrow emperor franz josef nikola tesla walter gropius take your pick youre not helping yourself helga you think i care to help you she said i understand maybe you didnt actually pull the trigger so you think you understand nothing she shrieked i did not kill anyone charles rutger would debate that if he could an accident she said had i known i would have waited even though you dont care about people i avoid complications well said milo youve ended up with a whole bunch of complications you are stubborn beyond rationality like someone else you know who milo smiled i had a dad like that helga shuddered her turn to cover the stab of emotion with an even bigger smile pity for you policeman lets get back to basics helga youre not leaving here but you do have a chance to help yourself by telling me policeman she said at this time i need to oh shit said maria thomas have time to think alone please soft voice almost gentle you have surprised me she said i need to think please some time milo said take all the time you need chapter the door to the observation room swung open milo stepped in wiping sweat from his face hed remained cool in helgas presence zen and the art of detection maria thomas said i have to say she didnt look the least bit hinky on those two murders don boxmeister said even with that we get her on rutger shes away for a long time dont get overconfident about rutger said thomas she has family money want to take bets the first thing any decent lawyer does is move to throw out the last two hours because she was under emotional duress milo didnt persecute her maria whos talking reality don its a game and rich people have a better winloss record she turned to milo youre lucky shes arrogant only reason she hasnt lawyered up is she thinks shes smarter than you but now that shes faced with rutger dont count on that lasting whats your next step milo sat down heavily watched helga through the glass shed remained in her chair blackwigged statue thomas said milo you with us i dont know thomass blackberry sent her a message she checked the screen poked with a stylus scrolled detective obermann has your german translations all done hell email them to you but is happy to talk to you over the phone and looks like he identified some of those numbers you found on gemeins papers gps coordinates matching a private hangar at van nuys airport registered to dsd inc that ring any bells milo sat up loud ones the sultans holding company so our swiss miss had more arson in mind ill talk to the sranilese consulate ask for consent to enter the hangar there is no consulate the embassy in dc then theyll say no and clean the place out of what their royal familys involved in murder theyre gonna be in total asscovering mode thomas thought guess we have a problem helga gemein closed her eyes boxmeister said how about this we apply for warrant under exigent danger likely presence of volatile chemicals imminent risk of ignition the hangars ready to blow said thomas what evidence do we have of that weve got prior bad acts by helga and her looking for gps coordinates to me thats clear intent she can look to her hearts content don hows she going to gain access to the hangar milo said shes got money to charter a private jet maybe once shes in there she could find it exactly said boxmeister like one of those private clubs getting past the ropes a bitch but once youre in anything goes thomas said no judge is going to buy it and were talking royalty to boot milo said but what if shes already gotten in there and set her jello all those aircraft nearby all that jet fuel boxmeister said shit i dont want to even imagine sure hate to be the one who failed to take precautions thomas said subtle guys you want me to ask the boss milo glanced toward the oneway mirror helga remained frozen up to you but i used all my charm up with her thomas drummed her blackberry began texting helga gemein stood up walked to the mirror turned her back on us one hand reached up fooled with the wig thats her anxiety tell messing with the rug said boxmeister shes gonna cave i can feel it if that comforted milo he didnt show it thomas kept texting helga gemein turned again faced us looking but not seeing blank eyes shed arrived at a solitary place snatching off her wig with one deft movement she exposed a beautifully shaped head shaved white and glossy holding the hairpiece in front of her bowl up like a chalice she smiled sad smile second time id seen it i liked her no better reaching into the wig she pulled something out small and white and capsuleshaped pincergrasped between thumb and forefinger still smiling she opened her mouth popped the white thing swallowed her smile spread her breathing quickened boxmeister said oh shit milo was already up rushing for the door maria thomas looked up from her blackberry whats going on milo ran past her let the door slam shut inches away blocked by glass helga gemein wobbled clutching her abdomen she let out a gasp retched something green and slimy trickled out of her mouth slack mouth the smile was gone thomas said omigod and ran out of the room boxmeister hustled after her i stayed in my chair no reason to crowd the space helga began convulsing her breath grew labored staggering closer to the oneway she panted raggedly filmed the glass flecked it with glassy spit then pinpoints of pink the massive convulsion began at her eyes raced downward as her entire body was seized rag doll shaken by an unseen god foam began pouring out of her mouth a niagara of bile chunks of slime coated the glass clouded my view but i managed to make out milo rushing in catching her as she fell laying her down gently he began chest compressions thomas and boxmeister stood by transfixed milo s technique was perfect rick insists he recertify every couple of years he gripes about the colossal waste of time homicide is brainwork when would he ever have the opportunity to get heroic today he did today it didnt matter chapter the police chiefs face is pocked more severely than milo s a lush white mustache does a pretty good job of camouflaging a harelip hes a lean man with no discernible body fat the lack of spare flesh stretches the skin that sheaths his skull highlighting pit and crater glossing lump and scar the skull is an oddly shaped triangle broad and unnaturally flat on top coated with silky blondwhite hair and tapering to a knifepoint chin his eyes are small and dark and they alternate between manic bounces and long stretches of unblinking immobility when he turns his head a certain way patches of taut tortured dermis give him the look of a burn victim he turns that way a lot and i wonder if its intentional take me on my terms everything in his history supports a screwyou approach to life the upfromnothing ascent the graduate degree at an ivy league university he disparages as an asylum for rich brats war heroism followed by clawing up the ranks of a notoriously corrupt east coast police force the combative years spent kicking bureaucratic ass and clearing out departmental deadweight defying the brass and the police union with equalopportunity contempt he armtwisted his way to dramatically lowered felony rates in a city considered ungovernable by pundits he dismissed as fatassed brats with mental constipation and verbal diarrhea stunning success was exploited to demand and receive the highest law enforcement salary in us history a month later he quit unceremoniously when la upped the ante everyone said la would be his fatal challenge within a year of arriving hed divorced his third wife ten years his junior married a fourth twenty years his junior attended a lot of hollywood parties and premieres and lowered felony rates by twentyeight percent when hed taken the job departmental wienies had badmouthed milo as a notorious troublemaker and a deviant and urged demotion or worse the chief checked the solvestats most of the wienies ended up taking early retirement milo got the freedom to do his job with relative flexibility as long as he produced id met the chief once before when hed invited me to his office showed off his collection of psych texts expounded on the finer points of cognitive behavior therapy then made me an offer fulltime job heading the departments department of behavioral sciences even with his promise to raise the pay scale by forty percent the salary didnt come close to what i earned working privately even if hed tripled the money it would never be an option i know how to play well with others but prefer my own rulebook during that meeting he was dressed exactly as he was today slimcut black silk suit aquablue spreadcollar shirt fivehundreddollar red stefano ricci tie embedded with tiny crystals on a lesser man it wouldve screamed trying too hard on him all that polish emphasized the roughness of his complexion my terms he faced milo and me across a booth at a steak house downtown on seventh street a pair of massive plainclothes cops watched the front door three more had staked out positions inside the restaurant a velvet rope blocked other diners in this remote dim section the waiter assigned to us was attentive vaguely frightened the chiefs lunch was a chicken breast sandwich sevengrain bread side salad no dressing hed ordered a thirtyounce tbone mediumrare all the fixings for milo a more moderate rib eye for me the food arrived just as we did milo said good guess sir the chiefs smile was crooked in the gulag we keep files on dissidents his sandwich was divided into two triangles he picked up a knife and bisected each half got five bites out of each quarter chewing daintily and slowly sharp white teeth somewhere between fox and wolf he wiped his lips with a starched linen napkin i bought you an insurance policy on gemein sturgis know what i mean captain thomas a gunfinger aimed across the table lucky for you maria was there when that crazy bitch cyanided because like all hot air blame floats to the top extralucky for you maria was the one who didnt want to stripsearch shes smart and industrious but she does tend to overthink milo said even without her directive i wouldnt have stripsearched sir whats that sturgis penance telling it like it is sir why no strip at that point my emphasis was on getting rapport with gemein plus said the chief even a supersleuth like you couldnt conceive the bitch would hide anything under her wig talk about an overblown sense of drama lucky for all of you i managed to block the pressscum when they started up the trashvacuum they live to tear us down sturgis because theyre useless pieces of crap theyve also got the attention spans of decorticate garden slugs i recently devised what i think is a tasteful and adroit method of handling press cretins out of a jacket pocket came a sterlingsilver card case conspicuously monogrammed with his initials a single deft buttonpush sprang the lid inside were pale blue business cards he removed one passed it across the table heavystock paper elegant engraving three lines of type your opinion has been duly received with great enthusiasm fuck you very much excellent sir lets have that back sturgis im still not sure if the wordings right the chief resumed eating the side salad was half a head of iceburg lettuce thin pallid lips curled as his knife reduced it to coarsecut coleslaw spearing a few green shreds he masticated with relish as if undressed greens were a sinful indulgence in any event ms gemeins ludicrous act of selfdestruction appears to be receding from the publics attention span ergo no need to throw anyone under the bus thank you sir so tell me dr delaware whyd the bitch snuff herself hard to say if it was easy i wouldnt be asking you theorize like youre getting paid for it i wont hold you to your answer i said she may have been living with a serious underlying depression for a long time poor little rich girl from what i hear she wasnt the sniffly breastbeating sort not a passive depression she reacted like some men do with hostility and isolation men with borderline personality disorder thats one possible diagnosis depressed he put down his fork what kind of family has a suicide doesnt give a fuck not a squawk from zurich which is good for us these are überrich people all we need is a lawsuit i had dc weinberg call them personally in switzerland do his colin powell bitaugust authority plus diplomacy the mother thanked him for letting her know like he was informing her about the weather then she handed the phone off to the old man who did the same damn thing polite unemotional no questions send the body when were finished with it what a bunch of coldhearted fucks guess that could depress you you think thats why she didnt have sex doctor shaved her damn hair offthat was a good phrase by the way sturgis selfabasement im going to work that into a speech one day youre saying this mess was all the result of not enough prozac doctor im saying depression couldve been her base state and she tried to give her life meaning by taking on a mission burning down that ridiculous heap of wood to avenge her sister that whole tribal thing whatchamacallit milo said sutma sounds like kama sutra said the chief something out of a national geographic special then again we live in multicultural times so far be it from me to disparage stupid primitive customs okay she went on a mission fucked up offed herself out of shame ill go with that you see her for the turret murders cant say for sure sir but my gut says no the chief ate more lettuce anyone have a feel for whether prince teddys dead or alive milo said no sir whats your plan on the turret murders no plan yet sir then develop one and do it quickly ive got a case i want you to deal with gang scum in southwest division sucking the federal titgang prevention grant which is like pedophiles getting paid to run a preschool ive got reason to believe the moneys being used to buy heavy artillery southwest division needs my help i determine who needs what youve got two weeks to close the turret murders before it goes in the fridge manicured fingers lifted a quarter of sandwich dont like your steak its great sir then wolf it down the way you usually do couple of refreshing burps and youre on your way to van nuys to check out that hangar the sranilese embassy granted permission fortyeight hours of ignoring our reasonable request plus exigent danger fuck them sturgis i grant permission chapter beautiful afternoon at van nuys airport no security lines no delays or other indignities this was the mont blanc of travel all private every happy sojourner owning or leasing one of the spotless white jets luxuriating on the tarmac quiet afternoon a single craft ran its engines citation x as sleek as an indy car porters hurried to fill the hold with a dollyful of vuitton luggage as a wellfed sunglassed family of four boarded thirtyish mother fiftyish father two kids under ten everyone in suede the luxury terminal backing the runways was nestled in greenery so were the three other luxury depots wed passed the hangars sat at the north end of the airport monumental toy chests the bomb squad was waiting at hangar a when milo and i arrived familiar faces from the search at helgas house and her workshop all the tech toys in place ready for a replay new dog today a beautifully groomed flatcoated retriever named sinead who stood patiently at her handlers side emitting the confidence that comes from good looks and serious talent milo said okay to pet her mitch the handler said sure a big hand stroked the dogs head sinead purred like a cat shes a solo act mitch said shes the only one we can trust because she wont get distracted by jet fuel and such good nose huh the best said mitch we already did the outside perimeter clean lets go inside sinead was in and out within seconds the bomb squad followed up with a detailed search declared the hangar safe motioned us in the interior was smaller than the house on borodi but not by much with twentyfoot ceilings a carpeted floor and cedar paneling at the center sat a navyblue gulfstream numbers on the tail conformed to sranils international designation one of three planes registered to the island all belonging to the royal family a goldpainted crest on the door showcased the sranilese flag palm fronds a crown three stars in a single horizontal row behind the jet were stacks of wooden crates piled ten feet high milo had officers lower a few to the ground began prying them open mikimoto pearls in the first thousands of them in velvetlined boxes the next three contained plasticwrapped fur coats with an emphasis on sable crate number four was devoted to a fourfootwide tiffany chandelier hollyhocks in a riot of color and luminosity five and six gold ingots onward to platinum jewelry tapestries paintings mostly of the sweetdomesticscene variety old master etchings more gold bags of loosecut diamonds one of the cops said we get a finders fee milo put down his crowbar walked to the opposite end of the hangar where blocked by the jets mammoth body a fleet of cars sat under navyblue covers same royal insignia on each removing the cloths revealed a red ferrari enzo a black bugatti veyron a limegreen lamborghini convertible a silver rollsroyce phantom limousine behind the limo a white prius oh man said the same cop i shoulda been born in saudi arabia sranil said another whatever dude this level of bling call me hussein and circumcise me with a dull knife and no anesthesia the first time didnt hurt enough said his buddy another officer said heard they didnt leave much to work with you heard wrong dude ask your wife laughter the first cop said whats with the hybrid looks like a zit on the rollers butt probably got a solidgold engine block dude or maybe some serious tuningcan i pop the hood loo milo held up a restraining palm circled the cars gloved up smoked windows on each vehicle but unlocked doors he opened the priuss drivers door and stopped we rushed over a cop said oh jesus thats rank two skeletons took up the rear of the hybrid huddled embracing a duet of interlocking bones to my eyes not a staged pose the natural instinct to draw together when faced with the worst news of all milo aimed his flashlight on the bones and i peered around his bulk cottony blond tufts fuzzed the smaller skull darker strands greased the other femurs and tibias pressed together fingers entwined eternal lovers milo said two bullet holes in each skull forehead and under the nose execution said the cop whod asked for a look under the hood and they made em watch milo continued to work his flashlight theres some skin mostly at the lower extremities looks leathery mummification said another cop this place is humidityand temperaturecontrolled probably slowed the decomp but didnt block it whoa dude someones been watching forensic files loo how long do you think theyve been there milo said well wait for the coroner on that but my guess is a couple of years makes sense loo security guy didnt remember seeing anyone here and hes been on the job eighteen months as opposed to the next one over thats larry stonefields little porsche garage larry likes to drive a different car every day his crews in and out all the time fifteen gimme one dude im happy gimme one of those boxes my girlfriend would kill for a millionth of whats inside good choice of words dude milo aimed his flashlight at the skeletons feet poked his head in deeper emerged all sorts of crust and stains on the carpet if they werent done in the car they were done nearby okay lets get this place roped off mitochondrial dna comparison of bone marrow from the blond skeleton and helga gemeins corpse confirmed that dahlia gemein had never made it to sranil identification of the second victim wasnt established might never be as if anyone wondered the government of sranil had lodged a formal complaint regarding unauthorized entry to the hangar demanded immediate return of the plane the crates the darkhaired skeleton invoking diplomatic privilege and bringing in a supporting army of faceless men and women from the state department must be my lucky week sturgis said the chief i get to see you twice im the lucky one sir the chief touched his rear feels nice to be licked so in come the illfitting suits with their smallprint weapons we get the female skeleton the rest goes back to sutmaland do i look upset sturgis no sir diplomats are amoral rimjobbing worms not worth my time if the president called id tell him the same thing im sure you would sir think about elections sturgis some sociopath spends hundreds of millions of dollars for a sixfigure job thats some serious psychopathology right doctor i smiled the chief said he thinks im kidding anyway to hell with the feds to hell with the sultan to hell with that filthy lucre teddy was stockpiling lot of good it did him though i guess i cant blame the sultan for not wanting to be bankrupted by all that spending milo said and dahlia wrong place wrong time or maybe they dont like blondes in sranil so were finished with international affairs we are and the clocks still ticking on the turret murders twelve more days then off you go to southwest thank you sir dont thank me just row like a galley slave chapter days passed a week milo resigned himself to southwest division used to be a rib joint there meanwhile im eating healthy today that translated to triple portions of lamb and unlimited vegetables from his personal buffet at moghul the woman in the sari refilled iced tea as if she were paid by the pitcher guess what he said one of the prime gunrunner suspects is the nephew of councilman ortiz and ortiz is the oily sludge in his munificences tap water politics i said whatever he claims hes one of them the door to the street opened a midsized bespectacled man in a dark green hoodie jeans and sneakers stepped in walked straight toward us without hesitation late twenties shaved head sharp cheekbones rapid purposeful stride telltale bulge under the sweatshirt milo s glock was out before the guy got ten feet away the woman in the sari screamed and dropped to the floor the mans eyes saucered behind thick lenses what theoh shitsorry hands on head dont move lieutenant im thorpe pacific division hands on head now sure sure the man complied lieutenant i had to pack doing a gta sting decoy cars not far from here i figured idi called your office first sir they said you were here i figured id just milo reached under the sweatshirt took the mans gun another glock did a patdown found the badge in a jeans pocket officer randolph e thorpe pacific division wallet photos advertised a pretty young wife and three toddlers thorpe perched proudly on a harleydavidson a house with a gravel roof in the background two credit cards and a certificate of membership in a baptist church out in simi valley milo said okay relax thorpe exhaled im lucky i didnt soil myself sir you sure are what can i do for you we talked a while back sir about a pay phone on venice boulevard you were looking for a tipster a suspect named monte i think i mightve found him for you not monte your tipster milo returned the gun sit down officer thorpe and have some lunch on me um no thanks lieutenant even if i hadnt already eaten my guts are kind of knotted up thorpe rubbed the offending area how about tea to settle them down im okay thorpe looked around is this place dangerous or something someone comes toward me no introduction obviously armed i get a little selfprotective you looked pretty intense friend the job does that to me said thorpe i concentrate hard on whatever im doing my wife says i turn into a robot even when im watching tv sorry if i lets chalk it up to a misunderstanding how about some tea for officer thorpe here the woman in the sari said yes sir back on her feet and looking none the worse downright happy actually her faith in milo s protective powers validated yet again whos the tipster officer thorpe randys fine sir i cant be sure but theres this old guy i thought of him a few days after we spoke hes a local i didnt call you right away because i had nothing to back it up then yesterday i spotted him approaching that same phone booth my last day in uniform before the gta thing i was on code seven having coffee across the street he walks right up to the booth makes like hes going to call changes his mind leaves returns a few minutes later gets as far as picking up the receiver changes his mind again leaves i stuck around but he didnt come back it could be nothing but i figured appreciate it randy got a name all i know is george but he lives in one of those oldage homes nearby heres the address excellent said milo keep those eyes sharp randy this works out ill put in a good word with the chief you can do that anytime two georges in residence at the mintgreen apartment complex recast as peace gardens retirement center george bannahyde was wheelchairbound and never left the building george kaplan one of our healthier ones resided in a secondstory room too many oldage homes are hovels designed to stuff owners pockets with taxpayer largesse this one was clean fresh smelling softly lit with snacks in abundance and wellfed nicely groomed residents playing board games exercising on mats watching movies on widescreen tvs a posted schedule listed activities every daylight hour mealtimes excepted milo assured the desk clerk that mr kaplan wasnt in trouble just the opposite he was important to lapd she said george is he in up in his room i can call him down if youd like no thats fine well just drop in lots of headturns as milo and i walked past the activity we climbed the stairs to a freshly vacuumed corridor bouncy brown carpeting mockadobe walls burntorange doors equipped with name slots g kaplans door was open a small roundbacked lightskinned black man sat on a neatly tucked bed wearing a white shirt buttoned to the neck knifepressed maroon slacks spitpolished blackandwhite wingtips skimpy silver hair was pomaded to iridescence grayblue eyes not that different in hue from mine studied us with amusement a box of tam tam crackers a bottle of dryroasted peanuts and a setup for instant coffee sat on a nightstand the wall above the headboard bore portraits of martin luther king and lyndon johnson the latter signed two chairs faced the bed george kaplan said sit gemma called from downstairs officers all ready for you singsong cadence velvety intonation maybe one of new orleans s many variants his eyes were serene but both hands trembled and his head rocked at irregular intervals parkinsons disease or something like it thanks for meeting with us mr kaplan nothing else to do kaplans lips parted toowhite dentures clacked what does law enforcement have in mind with relation to george s kaplan milo studied the photos before settling lbj usually its jfk george s kaplan isnt usual those kennedys were fine if you like pretty faces president johnson didnt look like a movie star lord those ears he got no respect but it was him pushed through legislation to smooth out the races the great society he was a dreamer same as dr king i did the mans shoes ambassador hotel the president not dr king unfortunately had a stand there for fortyeight and a half years was there the night rfk got shot tried to tell the cops id seen that jordanian lunatic skulking around the hotel for days muttering to himself no one cared what i have to say we care kaplan massaged a pearl shirt button fought to still his hands know how old i am you look good sir take a guess officerscuse me detective youre a detective right yes sir whats your guess dont worry i wont be insulted normally id say seventies mr kaplan but if you worked at the ambassador for fortyeight years and it closed around it closed in place gave sixtyeight years of service and they let it go stonecold architectural masterpiece designed by mr myron hunt know who he was no sir famous architect designed the rose bowl ambassador was a palace drew in all the finest people you shouldve seen the weddings the blacktie galas i did my share of lastminute patentleather touchup and thats a lost art city bought the property says its going to be a school just what we need teenagers making a mess so how old am i eighty ninetythree you look great mr kaplan then appearances are deceiving im missing a whole bunch of internal organs doctors keep taking things out of me apparently god gives us extra organs that can be removed without serious consequence as to why youd have to ask him which im figuring ill get a chance to do soon care for crackers no thanks sir peanuts were fine sir so what about george s kaplan is of interest to the los angeles police monte kaplan looked at his knees i got a jewish name in case you didnt notice kaplan comes from hebraic means chaplain i still havent figured it out someone said my family mightve worked for jewish slave owners but thats wrong weve been freemen since the beginning came over after emancipation from curaçao thats an island in the caribbean lots of jews used to live there so who knows what do you think detective can the mystery be solved the internet has lots of genealogy websites tried all that my greatgrandson michael hes a computer geekthats what he calls himself thats how i learned about the hebraic origin of my name but it led nowhere guess some mysteries dont like being solved some do sir monte howd you locate me we traced your tipcall to the pay phone lots of people use that pay phone not as many as youd think mr kaplan cell phones dont want one have no need for one an officer watching the booth saw you approaching it yesterday it appeared to him as if you were ready to make another call changed your mind kaplan laughed and here i was being careful you wanted to help but didnt want to get overly involved hes a frightening person monte i lived ninetythree years would like a few more theres no need for him to know mr kaplan you arrest him based on my word hows he not going to know youll be listed in my notes as an anonymous source until some lawyer pokes around and you feel the pressure i dont respond well to pressure said milo and i never break my word i promise your name will never appear in any case file kaplan kept his eyes down sure you dont want a cracker its not food i need right now sir you think monte killed that girl i think i need to hear what bothers you about him huh said the old man george s kaplan does his civic duty like his mother taught him and look where it gets him if montes dangerous sir all the more reason to get him off the street ive never seen him do anything dangerous but hes a scary guy ive lived long enough to know a frightening person when i see one no respect for his elders he was discourteous to you kaplans head shifted from side to side when it stopped moving he said that girl on the tv the pretty one who was killed in that big house near bel air she lived with him him and his other girlfriend the three of them going in and out of that house normally youd think they were up for hankypanky but all the times i saw them they didnt look like they were having recreation serious more than serious id called it purposeful sneaky eyes like they were up to something i walk around the neighborhood a lot good for the joints and the muscles i notice things other people dont theres a woman right down the block been cheating on her husband with the gardener for near on six years kisses her husband when he comes home like shes madly in love with the poor fool when hes gone shes with the gardener people do crazy things i could tell you all sorts of stories tell us about monte and the girl on tv the last time i saw her with him was maybe a week before she got killed montes other girlfriend wasnt there just that girl and monte and they were going into that house and i started thinking maybe montes cheating on one girlfriend with the other girlfriend shes certainly a better looker but they didnt look up for fooling aroundgrim thats the word real grim after monte let the girl in he turned around gave me the dirtiest look youve ever seen said got a problem old man i just kept on going could feel him watching me made the small hairs stand up never walked near there again a week or so later im watching the fiftyinch downstairs and the news comes on there she is a drawing but its her so i do my civic duty what i didnt figure on was having to do more any idea what montes last name is i just heard his girlfriends calling him monte wheres the house two blocks east one block north he drives a black pickup truck she drives a honda gray the other girlfriend never saw the pretty one with a motor vehicle always riding with one of the other two you wouldnt have the address by any chance would you you swear on a stack my name wont appear anywhere scouts honor sir you were a scout actually i was i wouldve liked to be a scout said george s kaplan no colored scouts in baton rouge back then i learned to be prepared anyway denture grin he reached for a bureau drawer let me find that address and copy it for you do it in block lettering so no one can trace my handwriting chapter the house was a flatface stucco bungalow the color of curdled oatmeal narrow and tarroofed and shuttered tight cement square instead of lawn no vehicles parked there no mail pileup milo and i did a quick driveby parked half a mile up he celled moe reed asked for an assessors check owned and managed by a covina real estate firm rented to a tenant named m carlo scoppio looked him up loo male white thirtytwo years old no wants or warrants no ncic owners cant evict him but theyd like to whats the problem he always pays his rent but does it chronically late said reed like hes trying to irritate them by squeezing out every bit of delay they say getting rid of a tenant is a hassle even when youre faced with a total deadbeat and scoppio makes sure not to give them grounds top of that hes a lawyer they dont want the aggravation what are his physical stats five nine one seventyeight brown and green the picture makes him a guy youd never notice you anywhere near a fax nope but the stats are consistent with hoodboy where does scoppio practice law havent checked yet but i will dont bother i can do it thanks moses you can climb back up olympus now i said monte carlo milo said smells right but ol george really is ol george more like ancient scoppio gives him attitude kaplan builds up resentment a few days later he sees a drawing on tv convinces himself he just got dissed by a murderer ol george seemed pretty lucid to me more important youve got nothing else and who knows if that rib joint is still in business desperation time always been a favorite season of mine a search for the working address of m carlo scoppio attorney at law pulled up nothing same for an inquiry at the bar association milo said he lied excellent start i said lawyers can work in other capacities hush your mouth whippersnapper lets go back to the office return close to five if the timings right ill have a little chat with this charmer googling m carlo scoppio pulled up the website of baird garroway and habib an east la law firm specializing in personal injury civil suits scoppios name appeared near the bottom of the staff roster paralegal he didnt just lie he puffed himself up said milo were a little closer to sociopath he scanned hablo español and five other languages could be one of those slipandfall deals poor stooges get the whiplash lawyers get the dough maybe paralegal means scoppio ropes them in probing for articles on the law firm produced several news pieces about an investigation by the city attorney all three partners were suspected of setting up phony traffic accidents working in concert with corrupt physicians physical therapists and chiropractors no indictments had been brought no mention of carlo scoppio milo tried a contact at the city attorneys office the woman had no personal knowledge of the case but looked up the current status appears to be pending lieutenant meaning my guess would be insufficient evidence to file looks like they used illegals as their stooges try finding witnesses willing to testify does the name m carlo scoppio appear anywhere scoppio no doesnt look likeoh here it is hes a para suspected of being a recruiter he killed someone we might be able to use that by four fortyeight we were back on scoppios block cruising past the bungalow still no sign of the black pickup george kaplan had described but a gray honda sat on the concrete pad milo said girlfriends here maybe boyfriend will show up soon too few cars on the street made getting close risky i parked four houses up switched off the engine milo positioned a pair of binoculars in his lap chewed a panatela paused from time to time to spit shreds of tobacco out the passenger window we could be here for a while you want to put on music its fine with me what are you in the mood for anything that doesnt make my ears bleedwell looky here a black ford halfton approached from the south and pulled up next to the honda milo snatched up the binocs was focused on the drivers door as a man exited the truck thats himguess what hes wearing gray hoodie carlo scoppio walked around to the trucks passenger side retrieved something plastic bags five of them scoppio laid them on the concrete milo said albertsons ol monte c does the shopping how touchingly domestic scoppio returned to the drivers side reached in honked the horn the bungalows front door opened and a woman stepped out tallish dressed in a white top and jeans scoppio pointed to the bags the woman walked toward them milos shoulders tightened you are not going to believe this here take a look at what her chapter dual lenses highlighted a pleasant face framed by long rustbrown hair late twenties to early thirties rosycheeked clear blue eyes milo said our rookie ci lara whatshername i said helpful ms rieffen carlo scoppio lifted three bags left lara rieffen to carry two no pleasantries exchanged between the two no talk at all they entered the house the door closed milo said this changes everything during the drive back to the station he reached dave mcclellan the head coroners investigator asked if lara rieffens assignment to the turret murders had been scheduled routine mcclellan said she screwed up no i just need to know dave dont have the schedule in front of me im at city hall trying to impress city council members why do you need to know who do i talk to about the schedule dave now youre scaring metell me the truth did rieffen screw up in some major way is she a screwup shes new tends to be a little lazy she gave the opposite impression at borodi dave made herself out to be eager annie maybe she likes you the burden of charm story of my life where can i get hold of the schedule youre not going to tell me why all of a sudden my guts churning it could be nothing dave now my bowels are loosening said mcclellan call irma my administrative aide she knows everything wish i did too irma melendez took thirty seconds to come up with the answer a ci named daniel paillard had been next up for the borodi call he didnt take it lieutenant sturgis my record says he did lara rieffen did her said melendez how come i thought you might know i have no idea lieutenant the two of them mustve worked something outmaybe dan had an emergency she doesnt volunteer for anything not a workaholic thats putting it mildly where can i find paillard hes off today give me his cell and his home landline please dan did something wrong not at all good said melendez him i like daniel paillard was at universal studios with his girlfriend this is a big deal probably not said milo but tell me about it nothing to tell said paillard she came to me the day before said she needed time off next week was i willing to swap i said sure why not what day did she need time off she never said she never collected on the trade silence dan i guess she didnt said paillard i guess i forgotlooking a gift horse you know am i in trouble i mean it was between the two of us youre not in trouble i mean id been working my ass off for weeks all those gang shootings said paillard when she came to me i didnt see any problem long as the job got donedid she screw up is she a screwup shes green said paillard do me a favor dan dont tell her about this conversation shes in some other kind of trouble not yet said milo be discreet dan and i will be too yeah yeah sure said paillard shes green maybe a little lazy thats really all i can say about her milo swung his desk chair around faced me lazy rookie but she makes herself out as gungho a faker like scoppio she processed the bodies made comments about doreens clothes being cheap that takes on a whole new flavor now i said rieffen trading shifts the day before the murder says she knew backer and doreen would be up in that turret doreen lived with her and scoppio so thats no mystery if scoppios our port angeles hoodie weve got fifty grand of motive but the scenes always reeked of personal to me so it couldve gone beyond the money kaplan said the three of them looked grim when they were together maybe the gloss was off the relationship threesome gone bad possibly because threesome had turned to twosome doreen threw her roommies over for backer he said old flame reignited so to speak backer and doreen were paid by helga to blow up teddys palace scoped the scene and found the turret a fun place ned holman saw them use it two months before the murders they could very well have turned it into their private party spot couldve even taken rieffen and monte up there either way theyd be easy to track the scenes always pointed to two killers now weve got a new pair rieffens involved in the murder makes sure shes assigned to the scene cute the obvious reason is monkeying with evidence as in concealing any record of her presence and scoppios she was up there before i arrived lord knows what she did during that time i said one thing she didnt conceal was the semen stain on doreens leg on the contrary she called it to your attention and that makes me wonder if she was playing head games backer always used condoms weve assumed he made an exception for doreen what if he didnt and the semen came from someone else monte chokes out doreen then abuses her corpse why would rieffen point out the stain and why not wipe it off right at the murder maybe monte didnt want her to proud of himself playing his own head game on her own rieffen mightve been more cautious or she thought it was fun too in either case she knew the stain would be gone by the time the body got to jernigan thats exactly the kind of highrisk adrenaline rush psychopaths crave rieffen takes control of the evidence making herself look sharpeyed in the process then she finds a quiet moment at the crypt and destroys the evidence making the rest of the coroners staff look incompetent its not enough that i succeed he said you have to fail antisocial selfaggrandizing puffery at its finest big guy one speck of dna couldve screwed the dealif anyone would bother to analyze the stain but shes a goddamn ci would know how to do it right no reason to analyze dna i said the way the bodies were posed the obvious donor was backer speaking of backer maybe were talking foursome down to twosome they all knew each other one shot to the head desis out of the picture they get the storage key leaving doreen to deal with two armed baddies piece of cake subduing her rieffen trains the little gun on her while monte jams the big one then he strangles her delivering an incredibly demeaning coup de grâce then they reposition the bodies they left backers id in place but took doreens because shed lived with them could be traced to them rieffen and monte living with a pyro and montes copping the fifty gs says they knew about the plot what if the foursome was a business arrangement alex they were all involved in the fire i said eliminate backer and doreen and the share doubles foursome i said two other kids were suspects in the bellevue fire kathy something i forget the boys name he snatched up his pad kathy vanderveldt dwayne parris lindstrom said they turned out fine she went to med school he went to law school lindstrom never actually met them shes relying on the previous agents notes what if kathy and dwayne planned careers in medicine and law but fell short a ci deals with the human body but works under a physicians supervision a paralegalwho tells people hes a lawyerhas to answer to an attorney wannabes they change their names the feds being their usual thorough selves miss it he faced his computer okay lets see what we locals can come up with he called up a series of high school reunion sites found one that offered yearbook photos for a fee zeroed in on seattle plugging in kathy vanderveldt struck gold at center high after confirming that dwayne parris had been a member of the same class he used his own credit card to pay for the shots and printed blackandwhite shots but clear enough younger versions of the two faces wed just seen carrying groceries kathy lara vanderveldt had smiled warmly for the camera member of the science club the nature club future physicians of america dwayne charles parris had maintained a narrowmouthed stoicism an averagelooking kid in every way with bushy dark hair worn low over his forehead varsity hockey model un accounting club i said shes using her middle name as her first hes carlo as in italian for charles wonder where he got scoppio maybe it means something in italian it did explosion milo said monte go boom he kept searching starting with kathy vanderveldt no criminal record on file same for dwayne parris but a fiveyearold account of the vanderveldtrieffen family reunion was featured in the seattle times serious human interest because a hundred fiftythree people had participated pagewide group photo kathy nowhere to be seen but a small child with the same name sat in the front row beaming milo said little cousin makes it to the party but big kathy doesnt because shes using an aka shes running from something bad but no record i said its possible that whatever shes running from never made the files as in her own lost years another teen ecoterrorist who kept it going and whose career somehow got derailed doreen conned the fbi but lindstrom did say shed tossed them a few bones minor stuff but everythings relative to the bureau minor could mean big buildings arent blowing up what if doreens info implicated kathy and dwayne seriously enough to screw up their educational goals and force them underground kathy and dwayne figured out whod betrayed them but doreen and backer didnt realize that years later the four of them reconnect in la agree to collaborate on a torch job shades of the bellevue fire that killed van burghout but now theyre getting paid serious money kathy and dwayne go along with it until they figure out how to get hold of the money after that backer and doreen are history reunion of the naturehiking ecopyros he said okay its time to have a go at gayles ego chapter special agent gayle lindstrom met us at a pizza joint in westwood village not far from the federal building college student clientele meant oceans of cheap beer on tap not much in the way of décor milo talked lindstrom listened growing steadily more tense with each revelation when he finished she said those two oh crap kathy and carlo are your buddies theyre names in a file you made it like they turned out sterling shes a doctor hes a lawyer all thats missing is an indian chief i said that because thats whats in the file theres absolutely nothing pointing to them being criminal let alone homicidal all you know is what you read cut it out she snapped you dont have to make me feel stupider than i already do if you had nothing to do with working vanderveldt and parris theres no reason for you to feel stupid you just dont get it do you the first time we met you figured out ive got my issues as in having trouble ignoring obviously braindead decisions being made with more concern for buttcovering than the publics welfare i like to tell myself if id been in charge never wouldve happened maybe thats selfdelusional crap maybe i need to stroke myself because the jobs turned out to be not what i had in mind however you want to see it im an outlier and what i needwhat i neededwas a reprieve when i learned you nailed the swiss witch i was ready to buy you dinner at spago then i find out the swiss witch had nothing to do with killing doreen and the state departments on our butts because you went into that hangar without authorization not only havent you helped me youve made my life more difficult gee said milo here i was thinking solving murders was my job when all along it was being your life coach lindstroms hands clenched milo plucked pepperoni milo were the good guys why are we going at each other help me out gayle and well be sandbox buddies again what makes you think i can help you im an unpopular girl with a cubicle full of old cold files and a directive to clear them or else which is like asking me to teach britney nuclear physics forget physics said milo lets talk medicine and law you want me to find out if kathy ever enrolled fine i can do that same for parris and law school but whats that going to tell you you need physical evidence whatever builds the case is worthwhile gayle now tell me exactly what doreen gave the bureau before she split dinky stuff i like dinky gayle this was real minorleague it stayed with the forest service there was a chunk of disputed federal land in northern washington state the usual loggingfarmingdunebuggyingtourism side fighting the totally leaveitforthemosquitoes side doreen had volunteered as a treehugger a few months before she got nabbed hooking in seattle doing field tests whatever what she gave up when we pressed her were two schemes the first was her fellow volunteers tilting the odds by planting canadian lynx hairs near tree trunkssmearing the dna then discovering it apparently the lynx is mucho endangered so that wouldve meant bigtime land restriction the second con involved poisoning wild horses and leaving carcasses in spots grizzly bears didnt frequent to draw grizzlies and enlarge estimates of their habitat see what i mean lowrent the forest service gave even less of a crap than the bureau took no action then a senator who got tons of logging money found out and he raised a stink and an investigation ensued no one went to jail but people lost their jobs names said milo i dont have any the guy from whom i inherited the files wasnt into extraneous detail maybe not so extraneous gayle if kathy vanderveldt and dwayne parris were among those volunteers some people lost their jobs others mightve lost their careers expelled from med school and law school due to moral turpitude she said yeah i guess that could happen she stood tried to put money on the table milo s big hand closed around hers my treat gayle why you deserve it yeah sure said lindstrom when i got a bad grade my dad lied to me the same way i said manipulating physical evidence he said kathy lara cant be a doctor but gets herself a gig where she can still have fun with biology same old story with twisted types its all about control with everyone its about control i said the key is how you go about it lindstroms call came as we drove back to the station that was quick gayle wish i could say i pulled strings all i had to do was pull our copy of the forest service file vanderveldt and parris are named as participants in both cons in fact theyre the only participants named and vanderveldt was indeed booted out of u of idaho med schoolwhere shed been at the bottom of her class parriss standing at u wash law school was actually pretty good but he also got tossed both of them appealed twice denied you really see that as motive that and fifty gs gayle yeah i guess that covers a lot of bases said lindstrom so what now so now i talk to them id like to be involved when the times right hope thats not a lie with my dad i could tell with you not so easy chapter deputy da john nguyen confirmed what milo already knew insufficient grounds to arrest rieffen and scoppio for anything all interviews would have to be voluntary you are cordially invited to chat unless you witness them committing some kind of naughty and bust them for that bad lane change do the trick nguyen laughed i was thinking something involving blood how about smearing lynx dna on something what the hells a lynx anyway said nguyen something you make a coat out of right bite your tongue john im talking theoretical milo my pay grade the wifes lucky to get wool a review of the little we knew about the suspects suggested rieffen would be less violenceprone more likely to turn maybe reed and binchy took separate cars and began subtle surveillance on the man calling himself m carlo scoppio hed left for work at nine am drove to the east la law firm was still there by eleven thirty loo one thing occurred to me said reed the office is awfully close to where that ci escobar got shot how close moses like three blocks its county land owned by the med center but undeveloped you scoped it out it was close i started wondering theres an intersection nearby not much traffic but a long red light if escobar was a lawabiding type it wouldve been easy enough to catch him when he was stopped commandeer the car go back and take photos said milo after sean takes over the watch ill buy a camera said reed a cheap ones good enough for making memories moses one day well scrapbook lara rieffen was on shift at the crypt processing a shooting in pacoima the plan was to find her in the parking lot when she returned to file paper milo coming on friendly pretending to be there on business then walking her in and finding a space in the building for a followup interview keeping it lowkey so she wouldnt be threatened and the coroners staff wouldnt be aware of any disruption but the boss had to know so milo phoned dave mcclellan gave him the bad news he said ive been grinding my teeth since we spoke shes really that evil huh that makes us look great no way you could know dave whatever it takes to nail the bitch milo ill make sure theres an open room on the bottom floor thanks ill keep it as quiet as possible way im feeling about her you can hogtie her in full sight said mcclellan and dont worry about quiet were already crawling with cops anyway why bobby escobar all of a sudden sheriffs homicide decided they need to inspect his office sent their own techies over but they wont say why theyve been all over us since six am whos the lead detective new replacement irvin wimmers i know irv good man i think theyre here just to cover their asses anyway want me to reel rieffen in at any particular time or whatever the hell her name really is whens she expected back four five depending on particulars and drivetime lets aim for five you got it said mcclellan good riddance to bad rubbish milo phoned sheriffs homicide detective irvin wimmers and asked for a meet when wimmers had time wimmers said ill make time milo how about now you dont even know what its about irv youre calling me is what i know how many of the same conferences we been to denver dc philadelphia that fun one in nashville all those slides on decomp when we see each other we generally sit down for coffee we get back to la how many times do we call each other i dont know ill tell you how many said wimmers once that compton hatchet case you clued me in on that old file one of your retired guys worked we ended up nailing the bitch for turning two husbands to hamburger not just one so im figuring youve got something else useful to tell me maybe about escobar say yes it would make my day it is about escobar irv but it could turn out to be nothing did he have a predictable schedule at the crypt he had no schedule at all said wimmers going to school not working there anymore but they let him keep his key gave him a little closet office for working on his masters thesis what was he researching the technology of negligent evidence transferpeople screwing up with fingerprint brushes careless fiber collection that kind of thing whats on your mind milo wimmers listened to the barebones recap said thats pretty freakyokay this is something i need to sit down and think about my partners due in soon and i been up since five need to eat or im gonna pass out where you calling from the office you got the time for meeting about halfway i know a place youll like it rubys theatre of turkey operated from a storefront on eighth street just west of wilton monumental birds dunked into deepfryers carved to order served up glistening irvin wimmers was a black man taller and wider than milo with a pencil mustache and a soul patch and a gleaming shaved head furrowed longitudinally he wore a doublebreasted cinnamonbrown suit a longcollared maroon shirt a narrow olive tie patterned with orange battleships the platter in front of him held a crisp brown turkey quarter chunky cranberry sauce okra collard greens a sweating heap of macaroni and cheese a side plate hosted biscuits the size of baseballs sodden with what looked like redeye gravy leave your louisville slugger at home the turkey leg would be a fine substitute milo said thanksgiving came early irv wimmers said my philosophy celebrate anytime you get the chance so hows it going city boy its going quick handclasps milo introduced me wimmers said i heard about you doc ever think of coming over to the county side were the ones really out for truth justice and the american way i smiled unspoken like a true shrinksit down guys want me to order you half a bird quarterll do fine irv each both on a diet milo god forbid wimmers rumbled amusement whatre you drinking the iced teas good they throw in some pomegranate juice supposed to be healthy slow us down from rusting theyre outta that said milo ill take wd wimmers lumbered to the counter returned with a pair of twentyfourounce glasses of redbrown tea so youre thinking this crooked ci had something to do with bobby escobar i cant prove it irv but im certain she wiped away a semen stain because it belonged to her boyfriend and bobbys specialty was monkeying with evidence meaning he coulda been sharpeyed seen something from what i hear milo he was definitely sharpeyed back when he worked as a ci he used to get on peoples nerves for being a little too gungho you know the kid in class who points out the teacher forgot about the test milo said how far was his office from that fridgecloset where they stack up the tagged bodies right across the hall said wimmers hmm aint that cute so lets frame this i told you bobby didnt have a set schedule but before i drove here i called his wife and she said between school and a parttime job at a medical lab it wasnt unusual for him to come in at midnight stay for a while which is exactly what he was doing the morning he got killed same for the two days preceding which was the period when rieffen wouldve done her tampering so maybe she sneaks in late to do her mischief figures no ones there but bobbys in his office behind a closed door typing on his laptop she goes into the fridge does her bad thing just happens to encounter bobby as he pops out milo said she was official had a badge someone else mightve ignored her but bobby got curious only problem milo from what ive learned about bobby he sees something hinky he reports it theres no record he ever did milo said maybe he left a note on someones desk rieffen saw it snatched it guess so said wimmers but try proving that i said even if bobby suspected something and checked in the fridge how would he have found her out were talking evidence removal how do you confirm the absence of something then why bother killing him maybe he gave her a look that unsettled her or made a comment not enough for him to report but more than enough to get rieffen worried she told monte he decided to fix the problem homicidal boyfriend said wimmers cant believe she actually finagled herself to process a murder shed done thats gotta be a first didnt take much finagling said milo she offered a trade to another ci the tipoff is she never bothered to claim her share too good to be true said wimmers man this girls a piece of work now all we have to do is prove it what brought you back to escobars office today wimmer pushed cranberry sauce around his plate what brought me back was my perception of the case it wasnt mine initially two rookies caught the call got pulled off to do gang stuff and wrote up the prelim as a robbery gone bad given the neighborhood and escobars wallet being gone that made superficial sense but when i looked closer it started to fall apart escobars cell phone was right there on the passenger seat so was a bunch of bling on his person all inherited from his dad who was a pawnbroker im talking a big gold ring with a diamond a gold id bracelet a goldanddiamond earring stuff that wouldve been easy to fence plus escobar was sitting behind the wheel of his car when we found him but most of the blood was outside and when i revisited the scene i found what looked to be drag marks he got shot outside and put back in how many armed robbers you know gonna take the time to do that to me it smelled staged rieffen and monte are veterans at that milo described the turret murders in greater detail wimmers said please tell me your guy was shot with a revolver or maybe an automatic and the shells were collected milo nodded your bullet clean enough for analysis coroner says frags but they can be put back together so maybe whos making the call to the gun lab you or me be my guest irv wimmers phoned ballistics arranged for the comparison asap they said fortyeight hours i got em down to twentyfour two giant hands rubbed together this is starting to taste even better than my bird chapter theres a sixth sense a highdefinition sensitivity to threat experienced by soldiers in combat veteran cops and a certain class of coldblooded psychopath milo s approach to lara rieffen was subtle faking good cheer as she exited her county car in the crypt lot she went along with the chitchat synched with his loose slow gait but i was reading her eyes bet she had a different rhythm in mind milo probably figured it out but he kept up the performance as the three of us entered the northern half of the coroners complex where the wetwork gets done once inside he used the barest touch of thumb on arm to direct rieffen toward the empty room dave mcclellan had provided the trajectory took her toward her cubicle no reason for her to resist or suspect but her mouth tightened and she pushed ahead of milo he caught up and when they reached the open door took hold of her elbow and stopped the parade i could use a few minutes of your time lara stiff smile for what lieutenant go over the borodi scene a bit i need to nail down a few details before i finish my report youve closed the case i wish just the opposite its actually looking real bad for a close but ive got a new assignment from the brass need to move on blue eyes blinked oh that must be frustrating part of the job so just a few secs okay propelling her inside before she could answer two chairs facing one a table to the side where milo s jacket was bunched up kathy vanderveldt aka lara rieffen sat where she was supposed to no oneway for observation no space or practical way to work gayle lindstrom in and milo had informed the sa appetizer goes down smooth you can share the entrée gayle i sat down next to milo lara rieffen watched me more concerned with my presence than milo s he said docs along for the ride snapping his attaché case open he spent some time behind the lid fumbling like an inept magician scrounging for a prop lara rieffen wanted to look bored but her body wouldnt go along she tried to will herself loose ended up with something contrived and edgy what a yoga novice might achieve the first few times on the mat milo kept shuffling papers rieffen checked her watch i said busy day always before i took the job i had no idea whered you work before here labs she said nothing forensic medical settings always been into science huh always milo said sorry its a mess in here bear with me he clicked his tongue lara rieffen started to relaxthe real deal put at ease by his incompetence take your time lieutenant i want to be part of the solution not the problem thanks lara i wish everyone felt that way okay here we go instead of drawing out papers he snapped the case shut placed it on the floor smiled at rieffen and kept observing her with that lazy hooded look he produces when the moods right her lips turned up more sickly confusion than anything related to glee what do you need to know lieutenant well for starts lets talk about monte lara rieffens head retracted pretty blue eyes shot to the door milo crossed his legs and put his hands behind his head try to bolt go ahead youre mine im not worried lara rieffen said monte as if trying out a foreign word as in carlo as in scoppio no answer as in dwayne parris rieffen shook her head as in boom lara rieffen crossed her own legs smiled weakly and exhaled thank god for what lara he terrifies me says if i ever think about leaving him hell cut me up dump the pieces where theyll never be found milo winced thats heavyduty superheavyduty lieutenant but if youre asking about him you probably know that angling for info when that didnt work she scrunched her eyes worked at pushing out tears produced a couple of sorrylooking droplets milo s big thick fingers rested atop hers finally she said someone who can help me protect and serve lara okay lets get the details so we can nail this bastard good lara rieffens technique was classic con a mix of understatement distraction and outright lies painting dwayne parrismonte scoppio as ultimate evil herself as submissive victim all the while trying to pry out what milo knew he flyfished her dangling error as bait then withdrawing puncturing minor falsehoods with good nature while ignoring the whoppers setting the hook so when exactly did you meet monte couple of years ago really hmm another mumbling foray into the attaché case um i could be wrong here but i think i had a notation here unfortunately i cant seem to find it never mind what kind of notation lieutenant weve been talking to people about monte doing background you know someone claimed you and he knew each other way backin high school not really its not true more rummaging ah here it is center high class of oh that technically its true but center was huge we hung in different crowds so you knew who he was barely we met up years later and even that was nothing intense couple of years ago yes where i was backpacking with some friends in oregon he was at the same campsite i didnt recognize him but he recognized me he can be charming id just broken up with a boyfriend guess i was vulnerable ah scrawl well that clears that up would you like something to drink lara so it was monte who ran into des backer and doreen in venice im guessing a sunday definitely a sunday lieutenant monte went to skate hes into that youre not i bike thats what i was doing when he was skating the path and saw them what were des and doreen doing monte never mentioned he just came back and told me hed met up with someone else from center by that time did you know he was violent not really i mean i knew he had a bad temper but he hadnt touched me not yet later that changed oh yeah want another tissue lara im fine okay so monte told you hed run into des and doreen how did he feel about that what do you mean was he happy surprised upset definitely upset he blamed them for something but wouldnt say what i still dont know something from his past when he talked about it hed get furious but he wouldnt say why montes an extremely closed person something from his past maybe something to do with messing up his law career he never got into it but does that make sense to youlaw school i suppose we know he went to law school but was asked to leave he ever explain that to you no and i knew better than to ask well heres what folks have told us des and doreen mighta done something that got monte kicked out of law school that would be something youd carry a grudge on dont you think he tells people hes a lawyer when hes not makes sense by the way when did he start calling himself monte back then back when high school thats what i heard he liked to gamble monte carlo he used fake ids to gamble at indian casinos at least thats what people said okay one more thing lara folks have also said des and doreen mighta messed you up too something about med school silence lara you must be mistaken you never attended med school university of idaho class of i started there but changed my mind because my primary interest isnt making money i prefer pure science being in the lab exactly so it had nothing to do with lynx hairs silence lara prolonged sigh sick smile okay i guess im going to have to get into that i didnt want to because frankly lieutenant its too painful and i just didnt see the point i understand lara but the point is i need you giving me anything i can use against monte so if des and doreen did do something underhanded to you that makes it more likely they did something to him and id like to know about it and from what the forest service told us they were blatant snitches lieutenant it was a big misunderstanding obviously i dont talk about it because jobs are hard to come by and i love mine also afterward i realized i was lucky lucky about what leaving medicine it worked out for the best medicines become nothing but a big business my orientations research working here you get to do research i hope to eventually meanwhile im constantly learning and that satisfies the curious part of me eventually i hope to go back to school get a phd makes sense so the lynx hair business big misunderstanding lieutenant another of montes brilliant ideas but i admit i was stupid to go along with it okay i appreciate your being straight with us lara even though we had a few false starts im sorry for those lieutenant you caught me offguard im not always the greatest at multitasking when i have to i can do more than one thing at a time but its hard not to get sidetracked its some sort of learning disability my parents had me tested when i was a kid the psychologist said i was gifted but had organizational and memory issues so if i forget something please dont hold it against me deal okay lets talk about montes weapons that i can tell you about hes got tons of them rifles shotguns were primarily interested in handguns those too which one did he use to shoot des backer i have no idea we recovered acaliber slug from dess head does monte have a that would be a smaller gun for the most part he has an entire box of small guns lieutenant keeps them all loaded keeps the box on the floor of our bedroom closet right next to my shoes ive had nightmares about his temper what if he goes crazy it would be so easy for him to justhe also keeps one loaded in his nightstand sometimes i have literal nightmarescrazy dreams but they seem so real tell me about them its the same dream over and over theres a fire in the house and it spreads to the closet the guns get ignited by the heat and start going crazy shooting off randomly theres no escape i wake up sweating my hearts pounding one time i woke him up wanting some comfort he told me to shut the fuck up go back to sleep prince charming ive gotten in so deep lieutenant its like finding yourself in a hole with no way to climb out well get you outso monte keeps a whole box of small loaded guns yes sir what about largercaliber guns im sure ive never taken a close look dont like firearms dont go to the range with monte no he goes by himself reason im asking about a largecaliber gun is one was inserted in doreens vagina before he strangled her omigod even for monte thats brutal want another tissue lara yes please so monte never talked about what he did to doreen the big gun no no never what did he say about what happened up in that turret nothing he just came back home and told me hed done it done what taken care of des and doreenhis words i took care of them i was too terrified to talk about it you mustve wondered why hed do something like that of course did you come up with any theories there are no logical theories lieutenant nothing justifies murder well thats true what im getting at is did you think about that old grudge lynx hairs could revenge have been montes motive doesnt that seem out of proportion like you said murder always is but did it occur to you not really not really okay so were making good progress here painting a picture so to speak there is a small problem though lara nothing serious but you deserve to know know what weve got monte in custody and he tells a different story what does he claim that you planned the whole thing that it was your grudgedoreen and des ratting you out on the lynx hairs and screwing up your medical career that doreen and des split after they sold you out but you put it together because they were the only ones other than you and monte who knew no no way its montes grudge id already changed my mind about medicine im just passing along what montes saying so you can give me something to work with for example he claims it wasnt some chance meeting that got you together with des and doreen they tracked you down learned you were in la from someone in seattle couldnt find you under your own name but figured out you might be using your moms maiden name cause youd done that before you do have a facebook page and monte doesnt i dont know how they did it but it was monte they contacted that sunday in venice yes but maybe it wasnt an accidental thingmonte running into them guess not well at least that matches with montes story except hes claiming you were there arranged for him to meet up with them because you had experience with explosives as much as he didall of you didand des and doreen were trying to get hold of some help on a job i dont know anything about any of that monte also says the deal was for the four of you to split a hundred thousand no way you know about the fifty thousand desi got paid the half he was supposed to share but didnt no i dont but you can figure out what im talking about some kind of payoff for expertise and equipmentvegan jello for example silence you do know what that is ive heard of it a long time ago never used it no way makes sense why would you i just need to sort out montes story from yours hes the one with the violent streak hed obviously say anything to save his own skin the guns are his ive never owned a gun im sure thats true i cant stand firearms thats why im ciing not working in the ballistics lab makes sense let me check something okay here it is speaking of ballistics heres a report we found montes box exactly where you said it was so i know youve been truthful about that and i appreciate it unlike monte whos spinning a yarn about having no clue like were not going to find it he can be that way what way mindless denying ill bet anyway we found the box and recovered the that was used to shoot des backer unfortunately its your fingerprints that are on it not montes silence lara that makes absolutely no sense thats what i told the lab so they ran the prints againyours are on file because when you got the job they printed you and we obtained montes when we arrested him his are all over the box and some of the other guns but not that one oh wowi just figured it out after monte came back he gave me the gun to put away i didnt want to be an accessory even after the fact but you dont defy him hed just murdered two people for gods sake so you stashed the gun right back in the box im sure you found it on top thats exactly where we found it i wanted it to be obvious so if someone ever searched theyd see it you figured wed search i was hoping unfortunately i wasnt thinking straight didnt glove up not that i couldve gotten away with it monte was right there monte stood there and ordered you to stash the gun he couldve done it himself but he was into domination ordering you around constantly mustve been hard lara it was souleroding same for carrying around the knowledge of what monte did and not being able to tell anyone everything ive done since the night he told me has been a form of selfdefense lieutenant when i met you at the scene i thought you might be someone who could help me but taking that step i shouldve done it sooner im sorry thank god i finally did lets talk about that first time lara howd you come to work the borodi scene i was up next ive never been a big believer in coincidences but im starting to change my mind because lately my lifes full of them like meeting up with monte at the campsite exactly like monte bringing des and doreen into our lives he mustve been plotting revenge for years so you got called to the scene not knowing it was just another call lieutenant when monte told you he murdered des and doreen did he say where it happened i didnt ask next morning i take a call and its them you can imagine i nearly fainted when i met you you seemed to be holding it together pretty well lara it took every ounce of energy to not start screaming lieutenant the moment i was out of there i just fell apart too scared to tell me what you knew im sorry its obvious i should have i was so freaked out and then later when i thought about it i figured id get in trouble for not coming forward right away i was i felt totally stuck i can understand that its obstruction isnt it frankly it could be lara whether or not john nguyenhes the deputy da in chargedecides to pursue that is up to him if you continue to help i have no trouble talking to john on your behalf id appreciate that sure coincidencesyeah ive seen that in my own life what some folks might call fate karma or just plain luck what do psychologists call it dr delaware yet another mystery of life heh hehokay lets move on you show up at the scene find out who the vics are try to maintain my insides were churning freaky coincidence there is one sticking point you made a special effort to take that call we found out because we werent thinking in terms of coincidence and wondered how you came to work a scene with vics you knew so we checked the work schedules here at the crypt confirmed it with dave mcclellan you asked to switch with another ci dan paillard dan verifies it silence lara i know what it looks like but that had nothing to do with what happened absolutely nothing i was eager for more experience this is an intense place being new i felt i needed to catch up you traded with dan but never collected on your half of the bargain what do you mean you never asked him to cover for you in return guess i didnt i forgot he owed me anything like i told you lieutenant ive got memory issues i guess that could also explain forgetting you traded with dan in the first place sometimes i forget where i put my shoes that i can tell you lara they were right where you said near the box of guns i i was speaking rhetorically but sure so you traded with dan to get experience exactly okay looks like youve explained away each of the question marks i had when i came in the problem is each one makes sense but when you put them all together john nguyen doesnt like what he sees i know because he told me johns basically a good guy but hes also a highly suspicious guy i had a case i didnt want to file because i felt the evidence didnt justify it but john bulldozed ahead anyway and got a conviction hes aggressive smart and really good at convincing juries silence lara so what do we do lieutenant what we do is maybe you can explain something away as more than coincidence or memory lapse anything that breaks up this big database of coincidence i already admitted i knew carlo back in high school i just didnt know you meant knew with a capital k understood but i can tell you for a fact that john is not going to buy the part about switching with dan paillard as selfeducation hes convinced you were part of the murder and were aiming to control the situation that means premeditation and thats like a big martini for a guy like john but hear me out larayou okay heres another tissue its important that you see it from a prosecutors perspective what youre asking john to believe is that you had no idea what monte was up to when he left the house that he came home and told you hed murdered someone that you stashed the murder weapon for him and didnt report anything because you were scared johns seen plenty of women in domestic situations that much he can probably buy but then you want him to believe that you just happened to work the scene for selfeducation john is not going to accept that and to be honest in my opinion neither is a jury they watch too much tv want everything to make sense by the third commercial combine that with your prints on the murder weapon and you can i did have an idea about what about the call i guess youd call it a premonition but i didnt know for sure i wasnt even certain hed actually killed them hes been talking about it for so long i kind of brushed the whole issue off then when i got to the crypt and a westside call came in i got a really sick feeling and asked to trade with dan because just what you said i was feeling out of control just wanted to get a handle on it i guess part of me was hoping it wouldnt turn out to be them that monte really had lied and the nightmare would end id decided to leave him anyway so you intentionally traded to work the scene i know it was wrongnot saying anything to you if they want to charge me with obstruction i cant stop them but given what montes done compared with what ive done i dont think theres any question who youll want to believe we sure do lara pardon want to believe you he opened the case closed it um i just glanced at my notes and theres another problem lets resolve that too im talking the date of what when you asked dan to trade it wasnt the morning of the murder it was the day before so if you traded specifically to get control you can see what im getting at who told you that date dan did then hed have to be wrong normally id say thats possible no ones memory is perfect especially for small stuff like that but dan changed the log right after dated signed his name to the change he may be wrong but to john nguyenand a jurythats evidence silence lara i dont know what to say lieutenant lets put it aside for the moment maybe youll figure out a solution wow my brain feels kind of scrambled the psychologist who tested me said it happens under stress im sure youve seen that dr delaware of course what are you scrambled about lara the sequence the reason i traded danthe first reason wanting more experiencewas the right one not the part about psychological control thats also true but it came lateran afterthought you know when the call came in i couldnt be sure it was going to be them but i was scared because they lived on the westsideboth of them in santa monica des on california where did doreen live we still havent found out somewhere on the westside she never said so it made sense the westside was where theydwhere monte would do it close to home dont geographical profilers say that crimes occur in comfort zones that refers to the killers comfort zone monte lives on the westside too it made total sense i just had to see for myself so theres really no contradiction i wanted more experience plus i wanted psychological control did you learn anything at the scene to help you up your control level i learned monte was even worse than i imagined he claimed he was just getting even but then i saw that shed been strangled up close and personal saw that semen stain and knew hed done something twisted you suspected the stain was montes des uses condoms and that kind of thing fits montedominant cruel thats why i pointed it out to you lieutenant i was too scared to come out and tell you but i hoped youd follow the trail aiding and abetting me huh right from the beginning so you figured out the semen was montes not dess okay um how do you know des used condoms lara silence lara must be something i heard back in high school des was a huge player everyone talked about it how hed jump anything with a pulse how he carried condoms in his wallet we didnt find any condoms at the scene i figured monte took them why would he do that hes evilmaybe for a trophy some kind of sick male dominance just like ejaculating on doreens leg youre sure it wasnt dess semen i cant be sure of anything i just figured monte was capable of something twisted like that killing doreen then demeaning her when i pointed it out i was hoping youd analyze it find out it was montes and that would tell you had something more than a simple murder one thing this case hasnt been lara is simple something john nguyen reminds me every day now it looks like its not gonna close anytime in the future especially with that semen stain gone what do you think caused that someone here screwed up it happens more often than you think a screwup as opposed to something deliberate who would do that deliberately thats what bobby escobar wanted to know who bobby escobar ci used to work herethe position you filledbefore he went back to school to get a masters well liked so they let him come in after hours work on his data he told you about the stain basically okay good so someone will look into it and hopefully theyll tighten up procedures for the chain of evidence i mean that would be useful but here we go again lara with another annoying problem bobby reported to dave mcclellan that a couple of days after des and doreens bodies came in he was here working late happened to step out of his office which is right across from the fridgecloset at the exact same time you walked out of the fridge that ring a bell short latin guy big mustache thats bobby he went into the fridge found one of the bodies looked like the plastic wrap had been messed with doreens dave didnt think much of it you were staff maybe you were clearing a serial number for your paperwork but now that we know about the stain you can see what it looks like thats all it was i was checking numbers but someone else got in there and removed the stain or it got washed away by accident lieutenant that kind of thing happens around here believe me i can hear john nguyen groaning what do you mean see it from johns perspective lara youre seen entering the fridge the plastics disturbed a piece of evidence is missing maybe he did it who that guy bobby maybe he wanted his job back so he tried to cast suspicion on me bobbys busy with school and a parttime job he mightve changed his mind anythings possible lara but i wouldnt even try to offer that to john nguyenhold on let me shoot another one at you a problem i mean bobby was murdered silence lara oh that that i heard a ci was shot off the premises i didnt know it was him it was lara he was shot in the head same as des backer with a same as des no shell casings left behind same as des which makes sense because the gunthe one with your prints on itis a revolver that little smith and wesson we found in the box in the closet so obviously we ran comparisons and unfortunately the striations from the bullet in bobbys head match those from the bullet in dess head i say unfortunately because now weve got your prints on a weapon of multiple destruction so to speak monte has an explanation for thatone that doesnt depend on coincidence want to guess what he says something that incriminates me but hes a sociopath and a liar be that as it may lara john nguyen likes what monte has to say which is that you were the one who ambushed bobby monte admits to following bobby when he left the crypt and to waiting until bobby caught a red light then jacking him pulling him out of his car and dragging him over to where he says you shot bobby he even admits to putting bobby back in the car all you did according to his version is pull the trigger john likes that story because it doesnt depend on coincidence silence this is ridiculous lieutenant so is sticking lynx hair on trees where it doesnt belong which when you think about it isnt that different from wiping away a stain a stain monte was too macho to get rid of at the scenelike you said hes a gambler likes to take risks probably told you no way would they even analyze the stain two people are found in a sexual pose theres semen why even suspect someone else contributed im willing to believe he intimidated you that night lara thats why you couldnt get rid of the stain right then and there you both had guns but montes was bigger size mattering and all that you were training your little gun on doreen while monte did his biggun thing werent you then he strangled her came on her leg silence lara silence lynx hairs stains its always about playing with evidence lara silence now youre getting kind of closed up lara the way you say monte tends to be that is not in your best interest john nguyen will not appreciate that silence lara ive been open to your explanations will continue to be open but youve got to meet me halfway like that trip to port angeles to get the money weve got monte on video taking those suitcases but both your names on the passenger list to seattle on a day you were offshift silence tell me what really happened lara start at the beginning its in your best interest were over pardon over finished i need to have an attorney youre saying you absolutely want an attorney finished suit yourself lara you always do chapter knock on the door milo said entrezvous a muttandjeff duo of female sheriffs stood over lara rieffen thank you ladies give this one the full stripuse that room across the hall the shorter cop said will do loo he turned to rieffen see you around lara or should we start

wimmers showed up with two more tan uniforms after a brief happy chat with milo wimmers and his team took rieffen away marching her through the crypt cuffed headdown past stunned coworkers and dave mcclellans look of utter contempt when she passed close to mcclellan he made a point of directing a thumbsup at milo rieffen looked up at him cobra disturbed from its nap i said master manipulator lotta good it did her said milo i was referring to you moi im crushed grinning so howd i do cecil b you deserve a percentage of the adjusted gross and a big chunk of the marketing revenue hooray for hollyweirdnot that i really fibbyfooed perish the thought think about it monte will soon be in custody i just got there a little early ill jumpstart your election committee soon as were back in the office once we get him is there any doubt hell turn on her and bobby did kind of talk to me from the grave thats a form of talking right and look he was right bobby i mean i guess fibbyfooing about

nasty old gun and it wont be used to make anyone else dead please tell me im a good person dr delaware i was still laughing when we reached the car he wasnt i said whats the matter nothings the matter life is grand im just focused on playing onecard monte chapter baird garroway and habib attorneys at law occupied a triplewide storefront on soto window glass painted black promises of quick

at the wheel of a chevy sedan financed by federal income tax wore a white tank top tight jeans wedge sandals hoop earrings sparkled more makeup than her usual quick morning dab including too much frosted pink lipstick milo said new side of you gayle i love being a girl he slouched in the front passenger seat i had the rear to myself the car was impeccable but it smelled of vanilla as if someone had partied with cookie dough the man his employers knew as m carlo scoppio had remained inside the law firm since arriving save for a tenminute smoke break out in the rear parking lot no chance to take him as he puffed away three other nicotine freaks indulged themselves close by several times scoppio had walked people on crutches to the firms front door a couple of the limpers actually seemed to be disabled at three pm when the roach coach honked la cucaracha scoppio wasnt part of the small crowd surging for snacks maybe hes brownbagging said lindstrom saving his hardearned blood money for a rainy day seven cops from the fugitive apprehension squad were positioned at various spots in the neighborhood the location wasnt ideal for stakeout heavy traffic on soto would make a quick dash across the street hazardous and light pedestrian traffic killed the chance of sidewalk surveillance the lot where scoppio had smoked was blocked to the north by deeper buildings one way in and out a cracked driveway to the east coiled a warren of residential side streets to the west was the thoroughfare freewayclose the onramp in sight raising the risk for a highspeed chase though at four thirty pm any lam artist would encounter bumpertobumper while scoppio worked the wonderful world of personal injury the house hed shared with lara rieffen and doreen fredd got tossed by moe reed

taken place in the bungalow the tech swabbed and pulled up prints and left binchy and reed found the gun box right where rieffen had said it would be resting on top was a black plastic case housing the s w serial numbers filed off but probably accessible chemically binchy drove the gun to the ballistics lab the final report would take time but the analyst saw enough to opine that the bullets from backer and escobar came from the same weapon reeds meticulous roombyroom produced an arsenal under the bed three rifles a shotgun boxes of ammunition maybe rieffen had been telling the truth about bad dreams both her prints and montes showed up on the murder weapon the longerbarreled gun inserted in doreen fredds vagina could be any of several in the collection but a charter arms bulldog did show up fitting dr jernigans guess the top drawer of a desk in a spare bedroom held newspaper accounts of the lynx hair episode along with rieffens med school acceptance letter well thumbed

nothing else substantial pops out on the cards just a hundred or so in piddly charges but i did find some matchbooks from three indian casinos in his nightstand so that could account for the rest youre slipping moses sir those dinners whatd they eat for dessert hopefully humble pie loo at four fiftysix pm two middleaged hispanic women in casual clothes rode away from the law firm in a battered

rieffen couldnt reach her somehow found out she was in lockup milo said she was brought straight to highpower wimmers handled it himself im just saying keep doing that gayle what being a little bundle of human prozacokay here we go scoppio hadnt appeared but a gaunt furtive sandyhaired man wearing a backpack walked around to the back checked out scoppios pickup truck jogged to the door binocs revealed a face ravaged by pustulant eruptions constant jerky movement was the dance of the hour your friendly neighborhood meth man said lindstrom speedy delivery the door cracked the dealer was inside for ninety seconds hurried off milo picked up the radio for those who cant see our subject just bought dope probably meth could be tweaking right now so factor that into the danger level multiple assents from the field four minutes later carlo scoppio walked out hed changed from business casual to jeans running shoes a baggy gray hooded sweatshirt that lent his mediumsized frame the illusion of bulk a small white rip on the left sleeve matched the hyperenlarged security photo from the storage bin in his hands a gym bag unremarkable man with sloping shoulders a soft square face dark curly hair rollercoaster eyes he shook himself off like a wet dog ran in place bobbed his head headed for his truck lindstrom said to me thats definite tweaking hopefully theres nothing nasty in that bag maybe hes gonna exercise said milo mr literal im getting too old for symbolism scoppios truck rolled out of the lot lindstrom said ready hold on gayle youre calling it her hands bounced on the wheel though i should point out that if he does get too far ahead yes dear whatever you say dear ill wash the dishes dear you and me in domestic bliss said lindstrom im sure my partner would find it as humorous as yours would milo laughed now we go carlo scoppio passed the freeway onramp continued south to washington headed west just past vermont he pulled into a shabby strip mall plenty of vacant spaces but a donut shop and a coin laundry were doing okay so was dynamite action gym the name cowritten in thai lettering the wideopen door showcasing bright light the truck parked in front scoppio got out entered lindstrom said guess literal takes it milo picked up his radio anyone look like a gym rat the head fugitive cop said gotta be lopez where is he another voice said im here loo a block south whatre you wearing the head cop said what he always does the sleeveless sweat showing off those guns of his snickers from the field lopez said you got it flaunt it milo said how about going inside and flaunting if its safe scope out the subject if its an open situation should be easy sir if its one of those membership things a frontdesk block it could be tough only one way to find out officer lopez at six eleven pm jarrel lopezs nineteeninch neck twentyinch biceps and beefslab thighs made their way inside the gym he was out moments later trotted to the fed car nice open setup mostly martial arts but some regular boxing subjects working the speed bag a pugilist he hits like a girl you want me to buy a oneday trial membership go in and keep an eye rather have you back with your buddies armed and dangerous thats what i told myself this morning loo nice blue sky i could use some armed and dangerous by six fortyeight pm gayle lindstrom was out of the car and milo had taken the wheel checking her makeup she fluffed her hair sashayed to the donut shop emerged with a steaming cup her own hoodie slimcut and peach velour did a good job of concealing the wire tucked into the rear of her jeans no loan from aaron fox the bureau had its own toy chest lindstrom said this one we call the electric thong ouch said milo not necessarily at seven fourteen carlo scoppio left the gym looking tired slightly flushed before he reached his truck a young woman in a peach hoodie walked up to him smiling but conspicuously nervous excuse me uhhuh i think im lost is this a bad neighborhood it can be where are you from tempe thats arizona i was supposed to meet someone at hollywood and vine is that close to here derisive laughter not exactly youre kidding youre pretty far from theredo you have a car i took the bus from union station they said get off at jefferson then transfer to the i forget so its nasty around here i wouldnt be out here alone after dark oh man can you point me toward hollywood laughter i can pointits that way north but you cant walk it is there a bus no ideawhat the carlo scoppio stiffened as milo and six other large men ran toward him shouting gayle lindstrom had her cuffs out told him he was under arrest scoppio swatted the cuffs made contact with lindstroms forearm threw her offbalance a bass chorus of commands filled the strip mall as scoppio dropped his gym bag assumed a pugilist stance fists up ridiculously quaint policepolicepolice putyour hands where they can be seen hands up yourhands hands up scoppio blinked raised one hand dropped the other to the waistband of his hoodie reached in brought out something longbarreled and shiny the choir switched hymns gungungungungun scoppio straightarmed his weapon milo aimed his glock same instincts as a few days ago at moghul whered hed taken years off officer randy thorpes life expectancy thorpe had been smart scoppio squinted his finger whitened milo fired so did everyone else chapter dr clarice jernigan said this autopsy was fun real hoot said milo the pathologists office at the crypt could have been anywhere no specimens swimming in formaldehyde no morbid humor potted peruvian lilies and cactus sat atop a low white bookshelf along with cheerful family photos jernigan and five healthylooking kids and a husband who looked like a banker she said i mean fun from an intellectual puzzle perspective your mr scoppio had twentyeight bullets in him from five different firearms with at least four wounds theoretically fatal i dont need to pinpoint which one did him in because frankly who gives a damn hes a sieve but if i was writing this up for journal of forensic science id tag the frontal head wound bigcaliber bullet went straight through the cortex and dipped down into the brain stem three fiveseven nod yours mines ninemillimeter like two other shooters no rifle fire how come fugitive guys always bring assault rifles the officer didnt have a clear shot shootout at the ok mall well if your ninemillimeter impacted anywhere above the rib cage you can award yourself honorable mention if you got him in the legs shrug milo didnt fill in the blank jernigan said in terms of why he faced off against such heavy firepower thats dr delaware s bailiwick to me im comfortable with suicide by cop how about you i said works for me im going to write that his inherent psychiatric issues were helped along by amphetamine intoxication cause we want to lay everything at this bastards feet make sure no aclu types start bitching and moaning milo said he was tweaking bigtime im surprised he didnt jump out of his skin lieutenant anyway i dont see a problem hopefully the pencilpushers wont either ill find out soon enough meeting with the chief in an hour that should be fun she walked us to the door milo said thanks doc thank you for what you did on bobby bobby was a great kid i know im supposed to be objective but when i found out the bastard ambushed him i allowed myself a little pleasure when i peeled his damn face off his damn skull and by the way i remember my pledge about autopsies long as you dont push it chapter milo drove to the chiefs office and i returned home detouring i drove past the lot on borodi all the embers gone bulldozed clean and level surrounded by a new substantial fence doyle bryczinski sat in his car by the curb he seemed to be snoozing but as i drove by he waved i backed up back on the job huh company finally got their act together he said realized they better have me every day all day sometimes they give me a double when mom doesnt need me im here keep up the good work he saluted only way i know how milo didnt phone after the meeting with the chief and i wondered if it had gone badly probably on his way to southwest division maybe that rib joint was still operative and hed dive into seven courses of transfat bliss he dropped in the following morning wearing a puce aloha shirt baggy brown pants desert boots id been working on custody reports blanche curled on my lap she bounced off smiled up at him he said i gotta bend next time get a great dane but patted her head far longer than mere courtesy called for i said vacation or wishful thinking two weeks of sun and fun rick managed to finagle some time were headed for the big island tomorrow morning think of me at the luau what i think of at a luau is more luau he walked to the kitchen took a half pint of orange juice out of the fridge put on glasses and read the expiration date a week past im doing you a favor he upended the carton guzzled blanche watched fascinated his eating habits have never stopped puzzling her i said two weeks no southwest gig crushing and tossing the empty carton he took out a plate of cold roast beef brought it to the table change of plans gunrunners off the radar still on the radar but i wont be watching the screen chiefs happy not a relevent concept for him what i did was bring up the fact that id closed backer and doreen well before his deadline in addition to preventing a potential arson disaster by nabbing helga but that i wasnt happy because of two skeletons in a prius yeah it was van nuys case but id checked and van nuys wasnt working it no one was and i thought that was a crying shame i also informed him that when i drove out to van nuys airport a few nights ago hangar a was totally cleared no jet no cars no gazillion dollars worth of gold and furs and diamonds and art no accounting of the skeletons ever being taken to the crypt and the faa had no record of the jet ever taking off not to mention the absence of a single letter of press ink his exaltednesss response was his brand of empathy i know what youre going through dont bitch sturgis were both victims of the politicians and the diplomats theyre all ivy league faggots compensating for short dicksand dont get touchy about faggot im talking generically then he ushers me out of his office informs me i need to concentrate on west la not stick my nose in any other sectors cases i say can i take that to mean southwest as well as van nuys sir he says dont make me explicate sturgis it saps my prostate chapter during his interview of lara rieffen milo had used john nguyens relentless approach to prosecution as a scare tactic a bit of performance art but part documentary as well rieffens defense lawyers filed motions to dismiss nguyen countered each with growing ferocity won every time their next step was to attack the admissibility of various pieces of evidence as part of that i was deposed to testify about rieffens mental state during detective sturgiss clearly intimidating and abusive interrogation nguyen said dont respond ill handle it and when the defense team tried pleabargaining down to a series of lesser charges nguyen threatened to go for the death penalty pointing out that rieffens prints on the murder weapon made it a nobrainer special circumstances due to multiple victims lying in wait extreme cruelty and depravity murder for profit rieffen pled guilty to one count of seconddegree murder in exchange for the theoretical possibility of parole nguyen said im happy with it anyone else isnt thats their problem i kept checking the internet for some mention of dahlia gemein or prince teddy her name never came up but four months after the turret murders an asian news service reported the tragic death of prince tariq bandar asman kuamah majur in a diving accident off the coast of sranil the sultan griefstricken and dismayed had declared a week of national mourning and announced that the pediatric cancer center crowning the worldclass medical center planned for sranil would be named after the prince my brother was a selfless man with a special place in his heart for children one week later insurgents attempted to storm the islands southern beaches the sultans troops turned them away but several commentators believed this was only the beginning logging off i
