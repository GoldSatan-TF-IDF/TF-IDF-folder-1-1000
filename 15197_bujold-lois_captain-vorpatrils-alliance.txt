lois mcmaster bujold captain vorpatrils alliance chapter one ivans door buzzer sounded at close to komarran midnight just when he was unwinding enough from lingering jump lag his screwedup diurnal rhythm and the days labors to consider sleep he growled under his breath and trod unwillingly to answer it his instincts proved correct when he saw who waited in the aperture oh god byerly vorrutyer go away hi ivan said byerly smoothly ignoring ivans antigreeting may i come in ivan took about a second to consider the at best complicated possibilities byerly usually trailed in his wake and said simply no but hed hesitated too long byerly slipped inside ivan sighed letting the door slide closed and seal so far from home it was good to see a familiar facejust not bys next time use the security screen and pretend not to be here eh byerly padded swiftly across the small but choice living quarters of ivans downtown solstice luxury flat rentals by the week ivan had picked it out for its potential proximity to solstice nightlife which alas he had so far not had a chance to sample pausing at the broad glass doors to the balcony byerly dimmed the polarization on the seductive view of the glittering lights of the capital city dome ivan corrected his thought to komarran nomenclature as the arcology existed under a hodgepodge of seals to keep the toxic planetary atmosphere out and the breathable one in byerly pulled the drapes as well and turned back to the room yielding to a curiosity he knew he would regret ivan asked what the hell are you doing on komarr by isnt this off your usual beat byerly grimaced working indeed an experienced observer which ivan unfortunately was could detect a distinct strain around bys eyes along with the redness from drink and perhaps recreational chemicals byerly cultivated the authentic look of a barrayaran high vor town clown given over to a life of dissolution and idle vice by actually living it ninety percent of the time the other ten percent and most of his hidden income came from his work as an informer for imperial security and ninety percent of that was just more dissolution and vice except for having to turn in reports at the end the residue ivan had to concede could get dicey ratting out your friends to impsec for money ivan had once heckled by to which by had shrugged and replied and the greater glory of the imperium dont forget that ivan wondered which it was tonight in reflexive response to the manners drilled into him in his youth ivan offered something to drink beer wine something stronger he contemplated bys boneless flop onto his living room couch coffee just water please i need to clear my head and then i need to sleep ivan went to his tidy kitchenette and filled a tumbler as he handed it to his unwelcome guest by said and what are you doing in solstice ivan working bys open hand invited him to expand ivan sat across from him and said trailing my boss who is here for an ops conference with his assorted counterparts and underlings efficiently combined with the annual komarr fleet inspections all the excitement of a tax inventory except in dress uniform belatedly ivan realized by had to already know all this hed found ivan hadnt he because bys random social calls werent still working for admiral desplains yep aidedecamp secretary personal assistant general dogsbody whatever he needs i aim to make myself indispensable and still ducking promotion are you captain vorpatril yes and succeeding no thanks to you by smirked they say that at imperial service headquarters the captains bring the coffee thats right and i like it that way ivan only wished it were true it seemed barely months ago though it was over a year that the latest flareup of tensions with barrayars most traditional enemy the cetagandan empire had pinned ivan to military headquarters hours a barrayaran day for weeks on end sweating out all the most horrific possibilities designing death in detail war had been averted through nontraditional diplomacy mostly on the part of barrayaran emperor gregors weaseliest imperial auditor and to give credit where it was due his wife that time there was always a next time ivan studied byerly who was only a few years older than himself they shared the same brown eyes dark hair and olive skin common to barrayars somewhat inbred military caste or aristocracy whatever one wanted to call it and indeed common to most barrayarans by was shorter and slighter than ivans sixfootone broadshouldered fitness but then he didnt have a desplains riding him to keep up the recruitingposter appearance expected of an officer serving at imperial headquarters granted when they werent squinting from the dissolution bys eyes had the startling beauty that distinguished his famous or infamous clan to which ivan was connected by a few twigs in his own family tree that was the problem with being vor you ended up related to all sorts of people youd rather not be and they all felt free to call on you for favors what do you want byerly so direct youll never become a diplomat that way ivan i once spent a year as assistant military attache to the barrayaran embassy on earth it was as much diplomacy as i cared for get to the point by i want to go to bed and by the looks of you so do you by let his eyes widen why ivan was that an invitation im so thrilled someday ivan growled i might say yes to that old line just to watch you have a coronary by spread his hand over his heart and intoned wistfully and so i might he drained his water and gave over the vamping the face so often arranged in a vague smarminess firming intently in a way ivan always found a touch disturbing actually i have a little task to ask of you figured its quite in your line i may even be said to be doing you a good turn who knows id like you to pick up a girl no said ivan only in part to see what by would say next come come you pick up girls all the time not on your recommendations whats the catch byerly made a face so suspicious ivan yeah by shrugged conceding the point unfortunately im not entirely sure and my duties with if i may say it the unusually unpleasant people i am presently accompanying spying on ivan translated this without difficulty and the company by kept was usually unpleasant in ivans opinion unusually unpleasant impliedwhat leave me little opportunity to check her out but they have an inexplicable interest in her which i suspect is not friendly it worries me ivan i must say he added after a moment shes quite welllooking i assure you you need have no fear on that score ivan frowned stung are you implying id refuse to supply assistance to a homely girl byerly sat back eyebrows flicking up to your credit i actually dont believe thats the case but it will add a certain convincing verisimilitude for the outside observer he pulled a small plastic flimsy from his jacket and handed it across the background was too fuzzed to make out but the picture showed a striking young woman striding down a sidewalk apparent age could be anything between twenty and thirty standardyears though that was no certain clue as to real age tumbling black hair bright eyes skin glowing an interesting cinnamon brown against a cream tank top decided nose determined chin either the natural face she was born with or the work of a real artist because it certainly didnt bear the stampedfromthesamemold blandness of the usual body sculpture a biological ideal that lost its appeal with repetition long legs in tan trousers that hugged in all the right places a nicely full figure nicely full if the face was natural might the other prominent features be too with weakening reluctance ivan said who is she supposedly a komarran citizen named nanja brindis lately moved to solstice from olbia dome supposedly i have reason to suspect that might be a recent cover identity she did move here about two months ago it does seem so who is she really it would be a fine thing if you could find that out if shes hiding her identity for a good reason shes hardly going to tell me ivan hesitated is it a good reason i suspect its a very good reason and i also suspect she is not a professional at the game this is all pretty vague byerly may i remind you my security clearance is higher than yours probably byerly blinked in doubt but then there is that pesky needtoknow rule im not sticking my head into one of your dodgy meat grinders again unless i know as much as you know at least byerly flung up his wellmanicured hands in fauxsurrender the people im with seem to have got themselves involved in a complex smuggling operation rather over their heads komarr local space is a major trade nexus the place is lousy with smugglers as long as the transients dont try to offload their goods within the imperium in which case imperial customs deals sharply with em they get ignored and the komarran trade fleets police their own thats two out of three ivans head came up the only thing left is the imperial fleet just so crap byerly if there was even a hint of that sort of thing going on service security would swoop in damned hard but even service security needs to know where and when to swoop i am doing as it were a preliminary preswoop survey not only because mistakes are embarrassing especially if they involve accusations of vor scions with arrogant and powerful relatives but because they tip off the real crims who then promptly escape ones tediously set net and youve no idea how tedious that can get mm said ivan and once military personnel get involved with they think simple civilian crime they become vulnerable to more treasonous blackmail by bared his teeth im so pleased you keep up one of your saving graces ive had practice ivan hissed alarm desplains should know about this desplains will know about it in due course in the meanwhile try to remember you dont know byerly paused that caution is cancelled of course should my dead body turn up in a lewd and compromising position in some ditch outside the dome in the next few days think it might the stakes are very high and not just the money so hows this girl connected again byerly sighed shes not with my crew shes definitely not with the nonbarrayarans theyre dealing with though its not outside the realm of reason that she could be a defector and shes not what she pretends to be whats left i am forced to leave to you to find out because i cant risk coming here again and im not going to have time in the next few days for sideissues ivan said slowly you think shes in danger of her life because why else would by bother to set even a sidefriend on this sideissue by didnt make his living through charity but he did make his living through a weird sort of loyalty and somewhere underneath the persiflage camouflage and just plain flage he was high vor of the highest lets just say you would gratify me by staying alert i should not care to explain any accidents that might befall you to your lady mother ivan allowed the concern with a rueful nod so where am i to find this socalled girl i am fairly certain shes a real girl ivan you think with you one never knows he eyed by dryly and by had the grace to squirm just a bit in acknowledgement of his cousin dono nee donna of lamented memory donna that is count dono vorrutyer was all too vivid a presence on the vorbarr sultana political scene by dodged the diversion and so to speak soldiered on though the idea of by in any branch of the service made ivan wince in imagination she works as a packing clerk at a place called swift shipping heres her home address toowhich was unlisted by the way so unless you can devise a convincing reason for turning up there probably better to run into her coming into or out of work i dont gather she does much partying make friends ivan before tomorrow night by preference he rubbed his face pressing his hands to his eyes actuallyby tomorrow night without fail ivan accepted the contact data with misgivings by stretched rose a bit creakily to his feet and made his way to the door adieu dear friend adieu sweet dreams and may angels guard your repose possibly angels with clouds of dark curls sunkissed skin and bosoms like heavenly pillows dry up by grinned over his shoulder waved without turning around and blew out ivan returned to his couch sat with a thump and picked up the flimsy studying it cautiously at least by was right about the heavenly pillows what else was he right about ivan had an unsettling premonition that he was going to find out tej was conscious of the customer from the moment he walked in the door ten minutes before closing when shed started this job a month ago in the hopes of stretching her and rishs dwindling resources shed been hyperaware of all customers who entered the shop a job that exposed her directly and continuously to the public was not a good choice shed realized almost at once but it had been the entrylevel position she could get with the limited fake references she commanded a promotion to the back office was mentioned so shed hung grimly on it was being slow in opening up though and shed wondered if her boss was stringing her along in the meanwhile her jagged nerves had slowly grown habituated till now he was tall for a local quite good looking too but in a way that fell short of sculpted or gengineered perfections his skin was komarranpale set off by a longsleeved dark blue knit shirt gray multipocketed sleeveless jacket worn open over it indeterminate blue trousers shoes very shiny yet not new in a conservative masculine style that seemed familiar but annoyingly eluded recognition he carried a large bag and despite the time noodled around looking at the displays her coclerk dotte took the next customer she finished with her own and the fellow glanced up and stepped to the counter smiling hi therewith difficulty he dragged his gaze from her chest to her facenanja it didnt take that long to scan her nametag slow reader are you why yes i get a lot of those tej returned the smile with the minimum professional courtesy due a customer who hadnt actually done anything really obnoxious yet he hoisted his bag to the counter and withdrew a large asymmetrical and astonishingly ugly ceramic vase she guessed the design was supposed to be abstract but it was more as if a party of eyesearing polka dots had all gotten fallingdown drunk i would like this packed and shipped to miles vorkosigan vorkosigan house vorbarr sultana she almost asked what dome but the unfamiliar accent clicked in before she could make that mistake the man was not komarran at all but a barrayaran they didnt get many barrayarans in this quiet lowrent neighborhood even a generation after the conquest the conquerors tended to cluster in their own enclaves or in the central areas devoted to the planetary government and offworld businesses or out near the civilian or military shuttleports is there a street address scanner code no just use the scanner code for the planet and city once it gets that far itll find him surely it would cost this man far more to ship thisobject to a planet five wormhole jumps away than it was worth she wondered if she was obliged to point this out regular or premium service theres a stiff price difference but i have to tell you express wont really get there much faster it all went on the same jumpship after all is it more likely to arrive intact with premium no sir it will be packed just the same there are regulations for anything that goes by jumpship rightoh regular it is extra insurance she said doubtfully theres a base coverage that comes with the service she named the amount and he allowed as it would do it was in truth considerably less than the shipping charges you pack it yourself can i watch she glanced at the digital hour display over the door the task would run her past closing time but customers were fussy about breakables she sighed and turned to the foamer he stood on tiptoe and watched over the counter as she carefully positioned the vasea glimpse of its underside revealed a sale tag with four markdownsclosed the door and turned on the machine a brief hiss a moment of watching the indicator lights wink hypnotically and the door popped back open releasing a pungent whiff that stunned her sense of smell and masked every other scent in the shop she bent and removed the neat block of flexifoam it was an aesthetic improvement ivan vorpatril read the name on his credit chit also with a vorbarr sultana home address not just a barrayaran then but one of those vorpeople the conquerors arrogant privileged class even her father had been wary ofshe cut the thought short do you wish to include a note naw i think itll be selfexplanatory his wifes a gardener see shes always looking for something to stuff her poisonous plants into he watched her slide the foam block into its outer container and affix the label adding after a moment im new in town yourself ive been here a while she said neutrally really i could do with a native guide dotte closed out the scanners and turned off the lights as a broad hint to the laggard customer and bless her lingered by the door to see tej safely free of the shop and him tej gestured him out ahead of her and the door locked behind them all the oldest human habitation on the surface of komarr solstice dome had a peculiar layout to tejs eye the aging initial installations resembled the space stations shed grown up in with their labyrinths of corridors the very latest sections were laid out with separate streetlinked buildings but under vast soaring transparent domes that mimicked the open sky the residents hoped to have someday when the atmospheric terraforming was complete middling areas like this one fell between with much less technologically ambitious domes that still gave glimpses of an outside where no one ventured without a breath mask the passage that swift shipping fronted was more street than corridor anyway too broad for the persistent customer to easily obstruct her off work now huh he inquired ingenuously with a boyish smile he was a bit old for boyish smiles yes im going home tej wished she could go home really home yet how much of what shed known as home still existed even if she could be magically transported there in a blink no dont think those thoughts the tension headache and heartache were too exhausting to bear i wish i could go home said the man vorpatril in unconscious echo of her thought but im stuck here for a while say can i buy you a drink no thank you dinner no he waggled his eyebrows cheerfully ice cream all women like ice cream in my experience no walk you home or in the park or somewhere i think they have rowboats to rent in that lake park i passed thatd make a nice place to talk certainly not ought she to invent a waiting spouse or lover she linked arms with dotte pinching her in silent warning lets go to the bubble car stop now dotte dotte gave her a surprised look knowing perfectly well that tejnanja as she knew heralways walked home to her nearby flat but she obediently turned away and led off vorpatril followed not giving up he slipped around in front grinned some more and tried what about a puppy dotte snorted a laugh which didnt help a kitten they were far enough from swift shipping now that customer politeness rules no longer applied tej decided she snarled at him go away or ill find a street patroller he opened his hands in apparent surrender watching with a doleful expression as they marched past a pony he called after them as if in one last spasm of hope dotte looked back over her shoulder as they approached the bubblecar station tej looked straight ahead i think youre crazy nanja said dotte trudging with her up the pedestrian ramp id have taken him up on that drink in a heartbeat or any of the rest of the menu though i supposed id have to draw the line at the pony it wouldnt fit in my flat i thought you were married yes but im not blind dotte customers try to pick me up at least twice a week but they arent usually that incredibly cute or taller than you whats that have to do with anything said tej irritated my mother was a head taller than my father and they did fine she clamped her jaw shut not so fine now she parted company with dotte at the platform but did board a bubble car she rode to a random destination about ten minutes away then disembarked and took another car back to a different stop on the other side of her neighborhood just in case the man was still lingering out there stalkerlike at the first one she strode off briskly almost home she started to relax until she look up and spotted vorpatril lounging on the steps to her building entrance she slowed her steps to a dawdle pretending not to have noticed him yet raised her wristcom to her lips and spoke a keyword rishs voice answered at once tej youre late i was getting worried im fine im right outside but im being followed the voice went sharp can you go roundabout and shake him off already tried that he got ahead of me somehow oh not good especially as i never gave him my address a brief silence very not good can you stall him a minute then get him to follow you into the foyer probably ill take care of him there dont panic sweetling im not she left the channel open on sendonly so that rish could follow the play she took her time closing the last few dozen meters and came to a wary halt at the bottom of her steps hi nanja vorpatril waved amiably without getting up looming or lunging for her how did you find this place she asked not amiably would you believe dumb luck no ah pity he scratched his chin in apparent thought we could go somewhere and talk about it you can pick where if you like she simulated a long hesitation while calculating the time needed for rish to get downstairs just aboutnow all right lets go inside his brows shot up but then his smile widened sounds great sure he rose and politely waited while she fished her remote out of her pocket and coded open the front entrance as the sealdoor hissed aside he followed her into the small lifttube foyer a female figure sat on the bench opposite the tubes hands hidden in her vest as if chilly voluminous patterned shawl hiding her bent head a slender gloved hand flashed out aiming a very businesslike stunner look out vorpatril cried and to tejs bewilderment lurched to try to shove her behind him uselessly as it only cleared the target for rish the stun beam kneecapped him neatly and he fell tej supposed the way a tree was said to not that shed ever witnessed a tree do such a thing most of the trees shed seen before shed fetched up on komarr had lived in tubs and did not engage in such vigorous behavior in any case he crashed to the tiles with a vague thrashing of upper branches and a loud plonk as his head hit owww he moaned piteously the quiet buzz of the stunner had not carried far no one popped out of their first floor flat door to investigate either that or the thump alarming as the latter had seemed to tej search him rish instructed tersely ill cover you she stood just out of reach of his long but no doubt tingling arms aiming the stunner at his head he eyed it woozily tej knelt and began going through his pockets his athletic appearance was not a facade his body felt quite fit beneath her probing fingers oh he mumbled after a moment you two are tgether thass all right then the first thing tejs patting hand found was a small flimsy tucked into his breast pocket featuring a still scan of her a chill washed through her she seized his wellshaved jaw stared into his eyes demanded tightly are you a hired killer still weirdly dilated from the stun nimbus his eyes were not tracking quite in unison he appeared to have to think this question over wellin a sense abandoning interrogation in favor of physical evidence tej extracted the wallet hed flashed earlier a door remote much like her own and a slender stunner hidden in an inner pocket no more lethal weaponry surfaced let me see that said rish and tej obediently handed up the stunner who is this meat really hey i cn answer that their victim mumbled but fell prudently silent again as she jerked her aim back at him the top item in the wallet was the credit chit beneath it was a disquietingly officiallooking security card with a heavy coding strip identifying the man further as one captain ivan x vorpatril barrayaran imperial service operations vorbarr sultana another mentioned such titles as aidedecamp to admiral desplains chief of operations with a complicated building address featuring lots of alphanumeric strings there was also a strange little stack of tiny rectangles of heavy paper reading only lord ivan xav vorpatril nothing else the fine black raised lettering bumped under her curious fingertips she passed them all up for rishs inspection on sudden impulse she drew off one of his polished shoes which made him twitch in a scrambled reflex and looked inside military issue shoes aha that explained their unusual style ds though she couldnt think of a reason for that to be important except that they fit the rest of his proportions barrayaran military stunner personally coded grip rish reported she frowned at the handful of ids these all look quite authentic assure you they are their prisoner put in earnestly from the floor damn by never mentioned any lethal bluefaced ladies t ratfink izzatmakeup tej murmured in uncertainty i suppose the best cappers would look authentic nice to know theyre taking me seriously enough not to send cutrate rental meat capper wheezed vorpatrilwas that his real name thass jacksonian slang innit for a contract killer you expectin one that splains a lot rish tej said a sinking feeling beginning in her stomach do you think he could really be a barrayaran officer oh no what do we do with him if he is rish glanced uneasily at the outside door we cant stay here someone else could come in or out at any moment better get him upstairs their prisoner did not cry out or try to struggle as they womanhandled his limp heavy body into the lift tube up three flights and down the corridor to the corner flat as they dragged him inside he remarked to the air hey made it inside her door on t first date are things lookin up for ma vorpatrils boy or what this is not a date you idiot tej snapped at him to her annoyance his smile inexplicably broadened unnerved by the warm glance she dumped him down hard in the middle of the living room floor but it could be he went on to a fellow of certain special tastes that is bit of a waste that im not one of em but hey i can be flexible was never quite sure about mcousin miles though amazons all the way for him compensating i always thought do you ever give up tej demanded not until you laugh he answered gravely first rule of picking up girls yknow she laughs you live he added after a moment sorry i triggered your um triggers back there im not attacking you dead right youre not said rish scowling she tossed shawl vest and gloves onto the couch and dug out her stunner again vorpatrils mouth gaped as he stared up at her a black tank top and loose trousers did not hide lapis lazuliblue skin shot with metallic gold veins platinum blond pelt of hair pointed blue ears framing the fine skull and jawto tej who had known her companion and oddsister for her whole life she was just rish but there were good reasons shed kept to the flat out of sight ever since theyd come to komarr thass no makeup izzatbody mod or genetic construct their prisoner asked still wideeyed tej stiffened barrayarans were reputed to be unpleasantly prejudiced against genetic variance whether accidental or designed perhaps dangerously so cause if you did it to yourself thass one thing but if somebody did it to you thassthass just wrong i am grateful for my existence and pleased with my appearance rish told him her sharp tone underscored by a jab of her stunner your ignorant opinion is entirely irrelevant very boorish too tej put in offended on rishs behalf was she not one of the baronnes own jewels he managed a little apologetic flip of his handsstun wearing off already no no s gorgeous maam really took me by surprise is all he seemed sincere he hadnt been expecting rish wouldnt a capper or even hired meat have been better briefed that and his bizarre attempt to protect her in the foyer and all the rest were adding to her queasy fear that shed just made a serious mistake one with consequences as lethal if more roundabout as if hed been a real capper tej knelt to strip off his wristcom which was clunky and unfashionable right but please dont fool with that he sighed he sounded more resigned than resistant tends to melt down if other people try to access it and they make issuing a replacement the most unbelievable pain in the ass on purpose i think rish examined it also military she set it gingerly aside on the nearby lamp table beside the rest of his possessions how many details had to point in the same direction before one decided they pointed true depends on how costly it is to be mistaken maybe do we have any fastpenta left tej asked rish the blue woman shook her head her gold earbangles flashing not since that stop on pol station i could go out and try to get some here the truth drug was illegal in private hands being reserved to the authorities tej was fairly sure that worked about as well as it did anywhere not by yourself at this hour said rish in her and no backtalk voice her gaze down at the man grew more thoughtful theres always good oldfashioned torture hey vorpatril objected still working his jaw against the stun numbness theres always good oldfashioned asking politely didja ever think of that it would be bound said tej to rish primly overriding his interjection to make too much noise especially at this time of night you know how we can hear ser and sera palmi carrying on next door houseless grubbers muttered rish which was rude but then shed also had her sleep impeded by the amorous neighbors anyway tej wasnt sure but that she and rish qualified as houseless too now and grubbers as well and that was another weird thing the man wasnt yelling for help either she tried to decide if a capper even one whod had the tables so turned upon him would have the nerve to bluff his way out past an influx of local police vorpatril did not seem to be lacking in nerve or else against all the evidence he didnt think he had reason to fear them mystifying wed better tie him up before the stun wears off said tej watching his tremors ease or else stun him again he did not even try to resist this process tej a little concerned for that pale skin vetoed the harsh plastic rope from the kitchen stores that rish unearthed and pulled out her soft scarves at least for his wrists she still let rish tug them plenty tight this is all very well for tonight said vorpatril observing closely especially if you break out t feathersdo you have any feathers because i dont like that ice cube thingbut i have to tell you theres going to be a problem come morning see back home if i didnt show up for work on time after a night on the town nobody would panic right off but this is komarr after forty years assimilation into the imperiums going pretty well they say but theres no denying it got off to a bad start still folks out there with grudges any barrayaran soldier disappears in the domes service security takes it up seriously and quick too which umim thinking might not be too welcome to you if they track me to your door his comment was uncomfortably shrewd does anyone know where you are rish answered for him whoever gave him your picture and address does oh yes tej winced who did give you my picture mm mutual acquaintance well maybe not too mutualhe didnt seem to know much about you but he did seem to think you were in some kind of danger vorpatril looked down rather ironically at the bindings now securing him to a kitchen chair dragged out to the living room for the purpose it seems you think so too tej stared at him in disbelief are you saying someone sent you to me as a bodyguard he appeared affronted by her rising tones why not aside from the fact that the two of us took you down without even getting winded said rish you did too get winded dragging me up here anyway i dont hit girls generally well there was that time with delia koudelka when i was twelve but she hit me first and it really hurt too her mama and mine were inclined to be merciful but uncle aral wasntgave me a permanent twitch on the subject let me tell you shut up said rish driven to twitch a bit herself nothing about him makes sense unless hes telling the truth said tej slowly even if hes telling the truth hes blithering said rish our dinner is getting cold come on eat then well figure out what to do with him with reluctance tej allowed herself to be drawn into the kitchen a glance over her shoulder elicited a look of hope from the man which faded disconsolately as she didnt turn back she heard his trailing mutter hell maybe i shouldve started with ponies chapter two ivan sat in the dark and contemplated his progress it was not heartening not that his reputation for success with women was undeserved but it was due to brains not luck and steady allegiance to a few simple rules the first rule was to go to places where lots of women already in the mood for company had congregatedparties dances bars although not weddings because those tended to put the wrong sorts of thoughts into their heads next try likely prospects till you hit one who smiled back next be amusing perhaps in a slightly risque but tasteful way until she laughed extra points if the laughter was genuine continue ad lib from there a ratio of trials to hits was not a problem as long as the original pool contained ten or more prospects to start with it was simple statistics as hed tried to explain to his cousin miles on more than one occasion hed entered that shop knowing the odds were not in his favor a pool with only one fish required a fellow to get it right the first time well he might have got lucky it wasnt unprecedented he wriggled his wrists against his scarf bonds which were unexpectedly unyielding for such soft feminine cloth some sort of metaphor there this is not my fault it was bys fault he decided ivan was a victim of poor intel from his own side like many a forlorn hope before him ivan had encountered overprotective duennas before but never one whod shot him from ambush the first time he walked through the door the unfriendly blue womanwas a puzzle he disliked puzzles hed never been good at them not even as a child his impatient playmates had generally plucked them out of his hands and finished them for him rish was incredibly beautifulsculpted bones flowing muscles stainedglass skin shimmering as she movedbut not in the least attractive at least in the sense of someone hed want to cuddle up to sort of a cross between a pixie and a python she was shorter and slimmer than nanja and very bendy but he had noticed when the two women were dragging him up here much the stronger he also suspected genetically augmented reflexes and the devil knew what else best appreciated from several meters distance like a work of art which he suspected she was whose work that degree of genetic manipulation on humans was wildly illegal on all three planets of the barrayaran imperium unless one had it done to oneself offworld in which case it might still be better to go live somewhere else after nanja was certainly neither komarran nor barrayaran or shed have had a more visible reaction to that famous name and address where hed shipped the ghastly vase not only not from around here but also not been here long her companions elegant gengineering was almost cetagandan in its subtletybut the cetagandans didnt make human novelties as such their aesthetic boundaries in that material were very strict not to mention restricted reserved for more serious and longrange goals now animalswhen cetagandans were working with animal or plant genomes or worse both at once all bets were off he shuddered in memory he would be glad to cross cetagandans off his list renegade or otherwise he would be ecstatic ivan peered around the dim living room he was not he assured himself tied up in a small dark place it was a spacious dark place and not pitchdark in any case given the ambient urban glow from the window and on the third floor well aboveground he sighed and remembered to keep wriggling his weary feet the nasty plastic ropes securing his ankles to the chair legs did seem to be slowly stretching perhaps he should have tried harder to escape earlier but the two women had been taking him right where hed wanted to go inside for just the purpose hed come to talk true hed been envisioning friendly chat not hostile interrogation but what was that quote miles was so fond of never interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake not that they were enemies necessarily he hoped by could have stood to be clearer on that point in retrospect the next most likely suspect on the body modification front was of course the planet and system of jacksons whole an almost equally unsavory hypothesis supported alas by any number of small hints the two women had let fall jacksons whole did not have a unified planetary governmentin fact it claimed to have no government at all instead it was ruled by a patchwork of great houses of em the last ivan had heard but the number shifted in their internecine competitionsand countless houses minor they tended not to hold large unified territories on the planets surface but rather interpenetrated more like competing companies granted the system or lack of it did make it less likely for the jacksonians to pull together for say a major military invasion of their neighbors but a person who had no house allegiance or employment there was a very unprotected person indeed ivan had no trouble imagining all sorts of colorful reasons for the two young women to be on the run from the whole any sensible persons not aligned with the power structurestructureswould be better off emigrating if they could manage it the real mystery was why anyone from there would be chasing them assassination wasnt that casual a business expense not with interstellar distances in play if the two had made it all the way to komarr but were still this afraid someone with resources must really care and not in a good way the room was not growing smaller nor darker nor damper nor changing in any way but dear god this chair was getting hard he hitched his shoulders and wriggled his butt recalling all those dire warnings about deepvein thrombosis and long rides in shuttle seats as if he didnt have enough paranoia running through his aching head right now though his legs had stopped with the poststun pinsandneedles and were down to just pins so how had the two women fallen in together and what was their relationship really was the blue woman friend business partner servant lover or bodyguard to the other some combination or something even more arcane when inevitably hed had to pee rish had taken the con in the argument over whether it was safe to let him up ivans plaintive how long do i have to spend not attacking you to prove im not attacking you had moved the warmer nanja but not the goldeyed other in the end nanja had left the room and rish had held a plastic jug decanting his bladder was too much of a relief by then for ivan to be embarrassed much rishs strange beauty did not diminish close up it just grew ever more detailed almost fractal but hed stayed shriveled in her hand nonetheless too alarmed to be aroused by her cool touch shed been as impersonal and efficient as a trained medtech which was undoubtedly just as well ivan couldnt vouch for how things would have gone had the task fallen to her partner so had undertaking the chore indicated anything except the price of winning the argument or that rish was protectively older or what maybe the two women were escaped slaves they could ask for asylumslavery was entirely illegal in the imperium even more disapproved than gaudy gengineering upon humans despite the inevitable legal brangling about where mere unfavorable indentures left off and the real thing began if rish was a created slave she might be valuable enough to pursue hell maybe nanja had stolen her now there was a thought thatd tick someone off for a planet with a mere nineteenandsomethinghour sidereal day this was turning into a damned long night ivan eyed his outofreach wristcom and tried to estimate the time left till dawn and his nonarrival at work his credit chit used at the shipping shop would surely give impsec a last known location nanjas coclerk would come under questioning about as soon as the investigating officer could scramble there and probably wouldnt even need fastpenta to identify ivan impsecnot service security for reasons ivan had not yet confided to his quarrywould probably be knocking on the door before the two women had finished arguing over whether to feed their famished prisoner any breakfast pleasant wellupholstered nanja ivan imagined would take his side his breath stopped at a faint scratching noise from the living room window the flat was three floors up there was no wind within a dome to move say tree branches against the polarizing glass even assuming there were any trees on that side of the building he hadnt had a chance to look he opened his mouth again exhaling as quietly as possible wellhe scraped for optimismmaybe impsec hadnt waited for morning and if you believe that i have a cousin who will sell you the star bridge in vorbarr sultana a hiss a faint glow as a narrow plasma beam cut a large hole in the window ivan thought he could see two dark shapes briefly limned in the dark beyond three floors up they had to be riding some kind of float pallet out there above the alley the panel of normally unbreakable glass was eased back soundlessly out of the way ivan had quite expected impsec to come collect him yet another reason not to exert himself unduly in pointless escape attempts but not at this hour and not by that route it seemed nanjas paranoia was more urgently justified than hed thought ivan became uncomfortably aware that he was still tied to the bloody chair even if he could by some heroic effort rip his feet out of their restraints shedding his shoes in the process his wrists would remain bound to the chair arms the most hed be able to manage would be a sort of barefoot crouching waddle toward his probablyarmed foes maybe he could swing around and hit them in the shins with the chair legs ivan had no desire to be stunned twice in one day even optimistically assuming they bore stunners and not some more lethal weapons ivan sank back and waited till both dark shapes had oozed through the gap and stood up before calling out in a carrying voice if youre after those two women i gotta tell you youre hours too late they packed their bags and flew ages ago a lowvoiced huff from the dark that might have been what the hell a faint double gleam from night goggles as two startled heads turned toward him you may as well turn on the lights ivan continued loudly you could stand to untie me too he bounced in place and thumped his chair legs as if for emphasis the shapes trod forward one reached to shove up his goggles and hit the light pad on the wall the other yelped ow clapped his hands over his eyes and hastily dragged down his own lightamplifying eyewear cheap civilian models ivan observed wincing against the sudden glare not that anything more exotic would be required for this sort of sortie the first intruder strode toward him waving a stunner ivan noted wearily who the hell are you the man demanded two males komarran accents and heights and general builds though komarran phenotypes were not nearly so uniformly blended as barrayaran it was all their centuries of trade and passing traders when barrayar had been cut off from the nexus at large dark clothing that might pass as street wear a few minutes ago id have said i was a completely innocent bystander but now im starting to think i might be someone who was mistaken for you said ivan amiably i dont suppose you could untie me and why are you strapped to that chair added the other staring tortured too ivan supplied inventively nanja rish wake up horribly for hours the second man peered in suspicion i dont see any marks it was psychological torture what kind well ivan said beginning with the first thought that rose to his mind they took off all their clothes and then the first man said dont talk to him you fool the jobs gone wrong toss the place and lets split hey it gets betterdont you want to know about the ice cubes should we grab him instead the stunner wavered in doubt steadied pointing alltoodirectly into ivans face decide on the way out stun him first and ask questions later in some nastier locale much harder for impsec to find dammit miles could have talked two such goons into untying him yeah and probably suborned them to his cause before the ropes hit the floor to boot the trigger finger tightened the staccato buzz of a stunner beam came not from the komarran but from the shadows of the darkened hallway two pulses two direct headhits the most effective if you could make the aim the range was short the invaders dropped like sacks of cement ivan controlled his involuntary flinch about time you two woke up he said cheerily swiveling his head rish padded into the light followed at a more cautious tiptoe by nanja neither woman wore filmy nightwear ivan saw to his disappointment and apparently neither slept bare mores the pity instead both wore bodyhugging knits suitable for the gym or for snapping awake in the middle of the night and dealing with unpleasant surprises you know if anything i said maybe led you to think i didnt quite believe you i mean about being a touch twitchy about uninvited visitors i take it back ivan began he nodded to the two lumps on the floor anybody you know rish knelt and turned them over nanja followed to stare down into their faces no said rish local rental meat said nanja in a more disgusted tone her face grew suddenly tenser theyve tracked us not only to komarr but all the way to here rish now what do we do follow the plan the blue woman rose and stared down at the unconscious pair kill them first i suppose wait wait said ivan a twinge of panic running through him she meant that even if she didnt sound very enthusiastic about it i mean i agree with your diagnosis local hirelings suggests they probably dont know much and i dont think they were assassinscappers they were kidnappers i bet he added after a moment and dont i get any reward for saving you from them just now i mean a kiss would be nice but untying me would be more practical nanja after long look at him nodded under her blue companions disapproving glare she knelt and undid ivans bonds he vented a whoosh of relief rubbing his wrists and ankles before carefully standing up the room only spun a little he really shouldnt push it but faint heart never won and all that he bent his head and presented his cheek to her just to see what would happen a hesitation a widening of her eyes which close up were a clear sherry color lighter than her skin very striking framed with her long black lashes to his unconcealed delight she stretched her neck and bestowed a neat peck on his cheekbone see he said in an encouraging tone that wasnt so hard the spot tingled pleasantly he poked an invader with his toe in passing as rish knelt to go through their pockets then stuck his head out the big rectangular hole in the window through which a faint draft now coursed a float pallet of much the sort used by techs to effect repairs on tall building faces hovered just below the frame it bore a large plastic bin typical of receptacles used to haul away soiled linens in hotels or hospitals empty you could just about fit two stunned women into it ivan judged if you folded them up snugly ah the classics but a cheap common object no one would look at it twice so long as it wasnt trundled through some very inappropriate location he drew back inside and turned to the two women yep kidnapping not murder unless they meant to kill you and then cart away the bodies tidily any guesses which nanja stood hugging herself looking cold it could be either i suppose depending any idea who would be sending you budget ninjas in the dark before dawn no silly question belay that would you care to share with me who would and so on she shook her head the clouds of curls bounced in a forlorn fashion no ids no money no nothing reported rish rising just stunners gloves and pocket lint the invaders ivan noticed for the first time did indeed wear thin transparent gloves cheap commercial millions used to protect hands from dirty jobs all over the planet nothing unique nothing traceable which pretty much went for all of their equipment low rent or cleverer than they seemed you know those goons could well have some sort of backup waiting outside ivan opined we have an escape route over the roofs said nanja have you ever practiced it yes said rish scowling at him which was no clue as she pretty much scowled at him all the time start packing tej tej well ivan had known that nanja was an alias the blue woman hadnt made that slip of the tongue in front of him before starting to trust him or just rattled do you know where youre going that is do you have a place to go ivan asked to which rish replied no business of yours and nanjatej said why do you ask ivan promptly addressed himself to the latter i was thinking you might like to hole up at my place for a few days take stock make your plans when not in a panic i can almost guarantee i have no prior connection with you for your enemies to trace its likely as good a safehouse as you could get on short notice and its free nanja hesitated nodded rish sighed what do we do with these then said rish nodding at the lumps safest to kill them ivan was still having trouble figuring out which woman was in charge but the lumps did indeed pose a puzzle the most obvious thing was to call impsec komarr and have them send a professional cleaning crew to take the whole mess in hand reminded ivan retrieved his wallet stunner and wristcom no one objected the thing was very belatedly it occurred to ivan to wonder what kind of fix byerly was in to send an hq desk pilot to cover these women instead of say a trained impsec bodyguard or even squad with all the hightech trimmings bys idea of a joke was not out of the running as a hypothesis butjust how delicate was bys investigation was he simply out of range of his usual handlers contacts and blind drops or was there some more sinister reason in play bys hints had suggested that his current bag of creepy playmates had high connections in the servicehow high and which branches could by be on the track of some corruption within impsec komarr itself dammit the purpose of a briefing was to tell you everything you needed to know to do your job right it shouldnt be a frigging iq test or worse word puzzle ivan hissed in growing frustration next time he saw by he was going to strangle the smarmy vorrutyer whelp the smarmy vorrutyer whelp who ivan had reason to know did sometimes if very rarely report directly to and receive orders directly from emperor gregor dont kill them said ivan abruptly pack up as quick as you can well take your escape route and then go to my digs but on the way out ill call solstice dome security report that i witnessed a breakin from down in the street leave the door open for them everything in place plenty enough funny business here that i guarantee theyll take these goons in charge maybe put them on ice for a good long time when the local patrollers arrive any backup out there will scatter if they havent already does that work for you slowly rish nodded nanjatej was already on her way to their bedroom ivan did yield to the temptationtemptation should have the rightofway at all times in his viewto peek after her into the room the flat only had the one sleeping chamber windowless curiously enough twin beds both rumpled hm what did that mean the two women were ready in less time than ivan would have believed possible having fit everything they wanted into a mere three bags they had to have drilled this ivan coiled up the ropes and scarves and stuffed them into various of his jacket pockets and returned his chair to its demure place under the kitchen table as a practical matter he abandoned any of his fingerprints loose hairs or shed skin cells to their fates maybe they would pose an interesting test of solstice securitys crime scene procedures tej drymouthed with worry jittered along the edge of her buildings roof as the barrayaran spoke into his wristcom he did an extremely convincing drunken drawl yeah you should see im down in the street watching this right now no horseshit these two guys with like a windowwashers float pallet goin right through this thirdstory window i dont see how theyre washing windows in the dark dyou know oh my god i just heard a woman scream with a faint smile vorpatril shut down his link to the solstice emergency number solstice dome never really slept enough general illumination from the city lights gave adequate vision for the next task even if the colors were washed out to a mix of sepia and gray checkered with darker shadows you first tej said rish careful now ill toss you the bags tej backed up a few steps for her running start and made the exhilarating broad jump to the next building three floors up she cleared the ledge with ease and turned to catch the bags one two three rish followed loose garments fluttering as she somersaulted in air landing on balance half a meter beyond tej motionless and upright like a gymnast dismounting vorpatril stared gloomily at the gap backed up quite a way and made a mighty running jump tej caught his shoulders as he stumbled past her on landing ah he wheezed not as bad as it looked a little gravitational advantage thank you planet komarr almost makes up for your miserly daylength you wouldnt want to try that on barrayar really tej wanted to ask more but didnt dare and there was no time rish led off as they made the second leap the flashing lights of a dome patrol airsled were visible in the distance closing rapidly vorpatril balked at the next alley half a dozen meters across were not jumping that are we no said tej theres an outside stair from the bottom its only a block to the nearest bubblecar station by the time theyd distributed the bags and walked the block carefully not hurrying everyone had caught their breaths again the few sleepylooking early or late fellow passengers crossing the platform scarcely spared them a glance rish twitched her shawl around to hide her head better while vorpatril selected a fourperson car paying a premium for its exclusive use and express routing he politely took the rearfacing seat punched in their destination and lowered the transparent canopy to its locking position the car entered its assigned tube and began to hiss along smoothly the night was fading into dawn tej saw as the car rose on a long arc between two major dome sections a shimmering red line edged the horizon beyond the limits of the sprawling arcology as she watched the tops of the tallest towers seemed to catch fire eastern windows burning sudden orange in the reflected glow while their feet remained in shadow from a few lower sections higher domes rose in a strange random spatterpattern catching gilded arcs her fingers spread on the inside of the canopy as she stared shed never seen practically the whole of solstice laid out like this before since theyd arrived downside she had only left their refuge to scurry out for work or food and rish hadnt ventured out at all perhaps they should have their immobility had given only an illusion of safety in the end what are those domes vorpatril swallowed a jawcracking yawn and followed her glance huh interplanetary war as urban renewal i suppose those are sections destroyed during the fighting in the barrayaran annexation or later in the komarr revolt making way for fresh new building after he eyed her with tolerant amusement a real komarran would have known that of course even if they werent from solstice she clamped her teeth and sat back flushing is it so obvious not at first he assured her until one meets rish of course rishs gloved hand pulled her shawl down lower over her face several minutes and kilometers brought them to the business and governmental heart of the dome an area where tej had never ventured the platform on which they disembarked was growing busier and rish kept her face down they crossed the street and marched a mere half block till they came to a tall new building vorpatrils door remote coded them within the lobby was larger than tejs whole flat lined with marble and real live potted greenery the lift tube seemed to rise forever they debouched into a hushed deeply carpeted corridor walked to the end and entered through another coded door another foyer or hallway and then a living room with a broad view of the cityscape opening beyond a wide balcony the decor was serene and technologically austere except for a few personal possessions dropped at random here and there ah no look at the time vorpatril yelped as they entered first dibs on the bathroom sorry he broke into a jog leaving a trail of clothing in his wake jacket shirt shoes kicked aside he was unbuckling his trousers as he called over his shoulder make yourselves comfy ill be out in a tick god id better be the bedroom door slid closed behind him she and rish were left staring at each other this sudden stop seemed even more disorienting than their prior panicked rush tej circled the living area inspecting a swank kitchenette that seemed all black marble and stainless steel despite its culinary promise the refrigerator contained only four bottles of beer three bottles of wine one opened and a halfdozen packets which the undecorative wrappings betrayed as military ration bars an open box of something labeled instant groats graced the cupboards in lonely isolation she was still reading the instructions on the back when the bedroom door slid open and vorpatril thumped out again fully dressed moist from his shower freshly depilated hair neatly combed he paused to hop around and shove his feet into his discarded shoes both she and hee i saw that rish blinked the forestgreen barrayaran officers uniform was quite flattering wasnt it somehow his shoulders seemed broader his legs longer his faceharder to read gotta run or ill be late for work under pain of sarcasm vorpatril informed her reaching past her to grab a ration bar and hold the package between his teeth as he finished fastening his tunic he shoved the bar temporarily into a trouser pocket and seized her hands help yourselves to whatever you can find ill bring back more tonight i promise dont go out dont make any outgoing calls or answer any incoming ones lock the doors dont let anyone in if a slithering rat named byerly vorrutyer shows up tell him to come back later i want to talk to him he stared at her in urgent entreaty you arent a prisoner but be here when i come backplease tej gulped his grip tightened laughter flashed in his eyes he pressed his lips formally to the backs of her hands one after the other in some barrayaran ethnic gesture of unguessable significance grinned and ran the outer door sighed closed on sudden silence as if all the air had blown out of the room with him after a frozen moment she gathered her nerve went to the balcony door and eased it aside judging from the angle of the light she would get an excellent view of komarrs huge and famous soletta array key to the ongoing terraforming as it followed the sun across the sky later shed never been able to see it from her own flat shed been cowering in the shadows for a long sick time it seemed in retrospect every plan shed ever been given had come apart in chaos her old life left in a bloodsoaked shambles far behind her unrecoverable lost no going back maybe it was time to take a deep breath and make some new plans all her own she ventured to the railing and peeked down a dizzying twenty flights far below her a hurrying figure in a green uniform exited the building wheeled and strode off chapter three tej and rish spent their first few minutes alone scouting the exits the luxurious flat had only the one door but the corridor had lift tubes at either end and emergency stairs as well there was also the balcony tej supposed but to be survivable escape by that route would require either antigrav or rappelling gear which they did not currently possess they next explored the interior space for any hidden surveillance equipment or other surprises there either was none or it was very subtle the lock on the outer door was much better than average and rish set it with satisfaction but of course no ordinary door would stop a truly determined and wellequipped invader rish did find a compact launderizer concealed in the kitchenette and applied herself to laundering all the dirty clothes theyd hastily packed perhaps in the hope that their next escape whatever it turned out to be could be more orderly tej discovered the captains sybaritic bathroom and decided to treat her chill weariness with a long soak the scent of him still lingered in the moist air strangely pleasant and complex as if his immune system was calling out to hers lets get together and make wonderful new antibodies she smiled at the silly image lay back in the spacious tub of hot water and frankly enjoyed his dash of inadvertently displaced flirtation in the old evolutionary dance all the better because he couldnt know how he was observed it was she realized after a bit the first spontaneously sensual moment shed had since the disastrous fall of her house all those harried months back the realization and the memories it trailed were enough to destroy the moment again but it had been nice while it lasted she stirred the water with her toes since theyd gone to ground on komarr fear and grief had slowly been replaced with the less stomachchurning memory of them till last night had kicked it all up again it was not in the least logical that she should feelrelativelysafe in this new refuge who was this ivan vorpatril and how had he discovered her and why she floated her hair waving around her head like a seanet and breathed his fading scent again as if it could supply some hint the water didnt coolthe tub had a heaterbut at length her hands and feet grew rather wrinkly and she surged up out of the cradling bath and dried off dressed again she found that rish had discovered that the flats comconsole was not codelocked and was searching for any solstice dome security reports on their intruders find anything rish shrugged her slim shoulders not much just a time stamp and our address in response to a witness report of a possible breakin officers arrived and apprehended two men in possession of burglary equipment suspects are being held pending investigation it doesnt sound like anyones stepped up to outbid the arrest order yet i dont think they do it that way here said tej doubtfully rish scanned down the file officers called to domestic altercationvandalism reported at bubblecar platformattempted credit chit fraud by a group of minors oh heres one beating interrupted of man spotted by bar patrons stealing public emergency breath masks suspect arrested patrons thanked i suppose i can see why no one would have to pay for that arrest orderthe solstice patrollers were busy enough last night but really the crime here seems very dull i think its restful anyway baths yours if you want it its really nice compared to that dreadful sonic shower weve been living with lately i can recommend it i believe i will rish allowed she stood and stretched looking around posh place you have to wonder how he can afford it on a barrayaran military officers salary i never had the impression those fellows were overpaid and their command doesnt let them hustle on the side she sniffed at this waste of human resources i dont think its his real home thats back on barrayar hes just here for some work thing recently arrived judging from the contents of his kitchenette or maybe he didnt cook tej nodded at the comconsole i wonder how much we could find out just by looking him up rishs golden eyebrows rose surely this benighted imperium doesnt allow its military secrets out on the commercial planetary net of its conquest throughout the jacksons whole system information was tightly controlled for the money power and security it could bestow and for that narrow edge that could mean the difference between a deal succeeding or failing at the other extreme tejs favorite tutors from her youth a trio of betans her parents had imported at great trouble and expense had described a planetary information network on their homeworld that seemed open to the point of madnesssuicide perhaps yet somehow beta colony remained famously one of the most scientifically advanced and innovative planets in the nexus which was why the tutors had been imported of all the instructors shed been plagued with the betans were the only ones whose departure shed mourned when homesick they had declined to renew their contracts for another year most other planetary or system polities fell somewhere between the two extremes of attempted information control i think we may be thinking too hard said tej we dont need to start with his secrets just with what everybody else knows everybody but us rish pursed her lips nodded and stepped aside have at it shout out if you find anything useful tej took her seat stuck hiding in their flat rish had been allowed far more time to learn the arcana of making this net disgorge data than tej but how common could that odd name be she leaned over and entered it a komarran database was the first to pop up above the vid plate bearing the promising title of the vor of barrayar all in alphabetical order starting with v and ending with v oh there were it seemed hundreds and hundreds of vorpatrils scattered across the three planets of the barrayaran empire she tried reordering the names by significance at the top of that list was one count falco vorpatril the counts of barrayar were the chiefs of their clans each commanding a major territorial district on the north continent of their planet in their way tej supposed they were the equivalents of a jacksonian great house barons except that they came by their positions by mere inheritance instead of having to work and scheme for them it seemed a poor system to her one that did nothing to assure that only the strongest and smartest rose to the top or the most treacherous she was uncomfortably reminded count falco a bluff hearty looking whitehaired man had no son named ivan pass on several highranking military officers followed and some imperial and provincial government men with assorted opaque and archaicsounding titles there was an admiral eugin vorpatril but he had no son named ivan either belatedly she remembered the little paper cards from vorpatrils pocket there were several ivan vorpatrils including a school administrator on sergyar and a wine merchant on the south continent but only one ivan xav his entry was short half a screen but it did have a confirming vid scan it seemed to be of him as much a younger officer though suggesting that he had improved with age tej wasnt sure how such a stiff formal portrait could still look feckless his birth date put him at standardyears old now the entry listed his father lord padma xav vorpatril as deceased and his mother lady alys vorpatril as still living her eye paused arrested his fathers death date was the same as his birth date thats odd so her ivan xav was half an orphan and had been so for a long time that seemedpainless you could not miss fiercely and daily a man youd never met she was reminded of his horrible vase who had he sent it to again she bit her lip bent and spelled the awkward name out very carefully all those vor names tended to come out as a blurred voralphabet in her mind unless she paid strict attention double oh a very uncommon name vorkosigan barely a dozen or so living adult males but she should have recognized it nonetheless the clan count of that surname appeared when she reordered the entire database by significance second on the whole list right after emperor gregor vorbarra count admiral regent prime minister viceroyaral vorkosigans entry scrolled on for what seemed several meters of closely written text unofficial titles included such nicknames as butcher of komarr or gregors wolf he did have a son named miles of just about her ivan xavs age vormiles also had an entry much longer than captain vorpatrils if much shorter than his sires tej was not as vague as most jacksonians about the history of this patch of the wormhole nexus but shed never expected even to visit here let alone be trapped for months so she hadnt exactly studied up her original evacuation route had called for a direct transit across the barrayaran imperium not even touching down on the surfaces of komarr or sergyar just making what orbital or jumpstation transfers were needed to reach her final destination of escobar or even when that goal had begun to seem unsafe as well to beta colony of imaginedhappy memory no one would blink at rish there well all right they probably would blink she was made to be riveting but no one would harass her anyway the point was this stop had never been on any sensible planners itinerary barrayar had one of the most bizarre colonization histories in the whole of the nexus which was full of the relicts and results of audacious human ventures the story extended far back to the rd century ce when wormhole travel had first been developed launching a human diaspora from old earth a prize because of its breathable atmosphere the planet drew an early settlement attempt of some fifty thousand wouldbe colonists who promptly disappeared from all contact when their sole wormhole link proved unstable collapsing with catastrophic results missing presumed dead and over the next six centuries all but forgotten till little more than a hundred years ago a new jump route was prospected fromto its ultimate regretkomarr the explorers discovered a thriving but backward world subsequently twenty years of komarransupported cetagandan occupation had failed to civilize the savage planet but did succeed in militarizing it a generation after the expensive withdrawal of the occupation the barrayarans had come boiling out of their culdesac to seize komarr in turn presumably to block any further galactic attempts to civilize them the momentum of their komarran success had led in turn to an illadvised overreaching as the barrayarans of the day then went on to try to conquer more distant escobar the same way that expedition had failed disastrously in the face of strong escobaran resistance aided by every neighbor the victim possessed including clever beta colony highranking casualties had included the barrayaran crown prince himself it was still a matter of profound respect and awe to jacksonian students of the great deals of history how evil emperor ezar had managed to hang on to the newlydiscovered planet of sergyar during the treaty settlements adding it firmly to his empire before dying and leaving his throne to a fiveyearold grandson after that the imperium had settled down a lot more concerned with consolidating the boundaries theyd gained than expanding them beyond their power to defend but in all the barrayarans remained uncomfortable neighbors jacksonians generally were just as glad they werent right next door but rather buffered by a complex multijump route through the open system of the hegen hub and the free planetary polity of pol all of which plus two out of three systems of the imperium a person had to cross to reach the safety of escobar or beta colony beyond sigh tej returned to ivan xavs entry really there was little more here than what had been revealed by the contents of his pockets though she supposed this confirmed their validity he was what he seemed a middling vor officer of middling responsibilities and middling rank just middling along so why was he looking for me but before she could explore further rish emerged refreshed from her bath to offer a shared brunch which perforce consisted of half a military ration bar nasty but nutritious and half a bottle of wine each it was surprisingly good wine though tej suspected the beer would have complemented the entree more stoutly and after that she fell into an exhausted doze on the sofa even after her months downside komarrs short day length remained physiologically awkward she hadnt slept soundly since theyd arrived nor since before ivan was only a few minutes late which he was honestly able to blame on the morning bubblecar clumpup on the tube from dome center out to the military shuttleporthappily the slowdown had been in a high section with a nice view not in the disturbing underground stretch barrayars komarr command hq was somewhat awkwardly split between the downside installation next to the port and the orbital and jumppoint stations but no popups to orbit were scheduled today for the visiting admiral and his loyal assistant desplains a spare and quietly competent officer in his late fifties took in ivans neat but squinty appearance with an ironic eye heavy drinking last night vorpatril no sir not a drop i was kidnapped by two beautiful women and held prisoner in their flat all night they didnt let me get a wink of sleep desplains snorted amusement and shook his head save your sex fantasies for your friends ivan time to saddle up ivan gathered the notes and agendas and followed him out the threehourlong morning meeting with the downside local staff was more torture than last nights ordeal had been in all and ivan only kept awake by surreptitiously pinching his earlobe with his fingernail the afternoons schedule promised to be more entertaining a private planning session with desplainss own inspection team a cadre of keen and occasionally evil officers known to the inspected as the vor horsemen of the apocalypse though only two of the group had surnames burdened with that prefix this left ivan his lunch hour to pursue his own affairs he grabbed a rat bar again poured a cup of tarry coffee popped two painkillers in an attempt to clear the sleepdeprivation cotton batting from his head unwillingly contemplated his secured comconsole and instead of starting a tedious and possibly frustrating search called the building next door admiral desplainss name cleared his route at once impsec galactic affairs shared its downside offices with impsec komarr although how much the two sets of spookhandlers talked to each other was anyones guess once past the lobby security the hushed windowless corridors reminded ivan all too much of impsecs parent headquarters back in vorbarr sultana utilitarian secretive and faintly depressing they mustve imported the same interior designer just before he hanged himself the top galactic affairs analyst for jacksons whole here was one captain morozov ivan had been interviewed by him twice before over his cousin marks affairs the personal touch always sped things up in ivans experience morozov also met adequately ivans current whodoyoutrust calibrations ivan found him presiding over a similar cubicle and comconsole as a few years back even more packed with books cartons of flimsies and odder memorabilia morozov was a pale scholarsoldier with a square bony face and an unusually cheerful outlook on life and his workimpsec regulars could be morbid morozov greeted ivan with either a wave or an impsecstyle salute it was hard to tell which and drew up the spare swivel chair with an extended foot captain vorpatril we meet again what can galactic affairs do for admiral desplains today ivan settled himself finding a place for his feet amongst the cartons ihe conscientiously did not say we have a query on an unusual person with a suspected jacksonian connection carefully if vividly ivan described rish withholding her name for nowit could be just another alias after all there seemed no point in describing tej there might be whole planets full of cinnamonskinned beauties out there somewhere for all ivan knew rish he suspected was unique keep it simple morozov listened intently his eyebrows climbing fingertips pressed together in a gesture copied ivan was fairly sure from his infamous former boss as ivan wound up he vented a huh before ivan could inquire just what kind of huh it was morozov spun to his comconsole and zipped through its file listings too fast for ivan to follow he sat back with a triumphant little tahdah gesture as a still vid formed over the plate ivan leaned forward staring good grief theres a whole set with a conscious effort he closed his mouth the vid showed a group portrait posed and formal rish it was clearly rish knelt on one knee second from the left she was wearing very little a gold thong and a winding pattern of gold foil that appeared to be glued on barely covering other strategic points and twining up to her neck as if to present her face as an exotic blossom surrounding her were four other women and a man they had slightly varying heights and builds but all looked equally lithe and shimmering one woman was white and silver one yellow and metallic gold one green and gold one red and garnet and the man was jet black and silver six faces differently but equally exquisite smiling faintly serene who are they morozov smiled like a particularly satisfied stage magician ivan had to admit that was one hell of a rabbit their names are pearl ruby emerald topaz onyx and the blue one is lapis lazuli baronne cordonahs famous living jewels that scan was taken several years ago jacksonian genetic constructs of course what um do they do besides stand around and look stunning well the baronne was known to use them as decor from time to timefrom all reports she was a woman who knew how to make an entrance also as a dance troupe for very favored visitors servants and i suspect much more they are certainly jeeveses uhwhat a jeeves is a jacksonian slang term for an obligateloyal servant or slave made variously either by psychological conditioning or genetic bias or both and unswervingly devoted to their object of attachment theyre said to pine if they are separated from their master or mistress and sometimes even die if he or she dies they actually sounded a bit like his cousin miless loyal armsmen but that select cadre of stern men wasnt nearly so photogenic ivan kept this reflection to himself baronne cordonah any relation to cordonah station one of five vital jump point stations guarding the wormholes into and out of jacksonian local space fell station which served the jump point out to the hegen hub was usually of the most interest to barrayar but the others were important too until recently shiv and udine ghem estif arqua baron and baronne cordonah were the joint masters of house cordonah and all its works until howwait what ghem estif a pure cetagandan name how the hell did that happen oh now thats a tale and a half a glint of enthusiasm lit morozovs eye how far back should i start how far back does it go quite a wayyoud be amazed all right begin there but keep in mind that i get mixed up easily ivan cast an eye on the time but quelled an urge to tell morozov to fastforward it an impsec analyst in a forthcoming mood was a wonder not to be wasted the name of general ghem estif may be dimly familiar to you from your history lessons morozov paused in hope more dim than familiar but ivan nodded to encourage him one of the lesser cetagandan generals who oversaw the last days of the occupation and its assorted debacles morozov generously glossed at about that time in his career he actually was awarded a haut wife the highest honor and burden a cetagandan ghem lord could acquire such a spouse was a genetic gift bestowed by the upper tier of cetagandan aristocracy the haut a superraceinprogress or so they imagined themselves having met a few daunting haut ladies ivan could imagine that the reward had been a very mixed blessing for the old general when most of his brother ghem officers returned to eta ceta to lay their somewhat terminal apologies before their emperor ghem estif and his wife understandably lingered on komarr it must have been a strange life and wrenching life for them expatriate cetagandans in the domes but ghem estif had his connections and eventually his daughter udine who was actually born here in solstice married an extremely wealthy komarran shipping magnate uh how many generations of udines are we talking about morozov held up a hand wait for itghem estifs schemes were unfortunately knocked asunder by us once more when barrayar annexed komarr the family fled in various directions the daughter and her husband got out at the last possible moment under fire with the protection and aid of a mercenary captain from the selby fleet which komarr had hired to augment their defense a somewhat eccentric jacksonian sometimesmuggler and hijacker by the name of shiv arqua was the komarran husband killed then nope but by the end of the voyage young udine had definitely switched allegiances it is unclear just who hijacked whom but shiv arquas rise to prominence in house cordonah began at about that time i see i think ivan wondered just what accumulated frustrations on the part of the defeated ghem generals expat daughter had triggered such an elopement or had it been a more positive choice er was shiv an especially glamorousspace pirate then mororsov rubbed his chin im afraid even impsec has no explanation for womens tastes in men he bent forward again and called up another scan the official portrait when arqua took the barons seat twenty years back hed be grayer and stouter now if that helps a man and a woman appeared standing side by side staring into the pickup with grave closed expressions both were dressed in red her gown deep carmine his jacket and trousers almost black the woman drew ivans eye first oh yeah she had the height the luminous eyes and skin the superb sculpted bone structure the marrowdeep confidence that marked a liberal serving of haut genes a thick black hank of shining hair bound with jeweled ribbons was drawn over her shoulder to hang visibly past her knees very much harking to the haut style the top of her husbands head was barely level with her chin though arqua was by no means unusually short middle height stocky build the remains of a muscular youth softening in middle age black hair of unknown length but drawn back probably into some knot at his nape maybe some faint streaks of silver in there rich deep mahogany skin a heavy rather squashed face that looked as if it would be more at home running a gang of enforcers but featuring liquid black eyes that would ivan suspected be dangerously penetrating if turned on you in person ivan wasnt sure but by the angle of their arms he thought the two might be holding hands behind that velvety fold of skirt impressive said ivan sincerely yes morozov agreed i was actually rather sorry to lose them arqua and his wife were pretty evenhanded in their dealings arqua got out of the hijacking trade and into the middleman ah recovery business quite a while back house cordonah had the best record for getting hostages back alive of any of the houses that dabble in that commerce reliable in their own special way they were just as happy to sell barrayaran information to cetaganda as cetagandan information to impsec but if the data the cetas received was as solid as what we did they should have been satisfied customers and the cordonahs were willing to return favors both above and below the table you keep using the past tense so whats barrayars current relationship with house cordonah then its in disarray im afraid about seven months ago house cordonah suffered an especially hostile takeover by one of their rival jumppoint control cartels house prestene with this much time gone by without an attempt at a countercoup its almost certain that both the baron and the baronne are dead a real loss they had such style he sighed are uh the houses new masters less helpful to us then say rather untested and uncommunicative several data lines were lost during the shifts which have not yet been replaced ivan squinted trying to imagine what that last sentence would translate to if it werent in impsec passive voice trail of bodies was a phrase that rose to mind it was not known if the late baronnes jewels were captured killed or scattered in the takeover morozov went on so i have a keen interest in any sightings if perhaps academic at this late date just where did you see lapis lazuli we need to talk about that ivan evaded but im out of time he glanced at his wristcom it wasnt a lie oops he scrambled up thank you captain morozov youve been very helpful when can we continue said morozov not this afternoon im afraid im bespoke ivan picked his way over cartons to the cubicle door ill see what i can fit in stop by any time morozov invited oh and please convey my personal best wishes to your er stepfather which i trust will find him much recovered virtual stepfather at most ivan corrected hastily mmother and illyan havent bothered to get married yet yknow he managed a somewhat wooden smile as he fled in disorder down the dingy corridor it occurred to him that there could be another reason he was getting such an unusual degree of cooperation from the impsec old guard these days and it had nothing to do with his association with admiral desplains he shuddered and ran on ivan headed for the door at days end with his brain jammed with everything from personnel promotion debates to surprise inspection schemes to the lurid history of house cordonah but mostly with urgent mulling of just where to stop for a takeaway dinner that would most please tej if shes still there he was anxious to get home and find out it was therefore no joy to see out of the corner of his eye a lieutenant from the front security desk waving frantically and hurrying to catch him sirs wait too late to speed up and pretend not to have seen the fellow ivan and admiral desplains both paused to allow him to come up slightly out of breath what is it lieutenant inquired desplains he did a better job than ivan of concealing his dismay at their impeded escape only a faint ironic edge leaking into his resigned tone sir two solstice security people just turned up at the front desk saying they want to interview captain vorpatril interview not arrest ivans suddenlyfocused mind noted although he imagined any attempt by civilian dome authorities to arrest a barrayaran officer from the midst barrayaran hq could be a tricky proposition jurisdictionwise desplainss brows rose whats this all about vorpatril it cant be the imperial services largest collection of parking violations againyou dont have a vehicle here and weve only been downside four days i dont know sir said ivan truthfully suspect was not the same thing as know right i suppose the fastest way to find out is to just talk to them well go along try to make them happy unfeelingly his boss waved ivan away tell me all about it in the morning desplains made a swift strategic retreat leaving ivan as the sacrificial rear guard it could have been worse desplains could have wanted to sit inivan sighed and trudged unwillingly after the tooefficient lieutenant who told him i put them in conference room three sir there were a handful of such reception rooms off the hq building lobby holding pens for people hq didnt care to admit to its inner sanctums ivan expected that every one of them was monitored conference room three the smallest had approximately the ambiance and intimacy of a tax office waiting area ivan discovered as the lieutenant ushered him inside he wondered if it was made that dismal on purpose to encourage visitors not to linger captain vorpatril this is detective fano and detectivepatroller sulmona solstice dome security ill just leave you to it then shall i detectives please return to the front desk and sign out again when youre finished the lieutenant too beat a retreat fano was a stocky man sulmona a slim but fitlooking woman he was in civvies she in uniform complete with such street gear as would be expected on a patrollers belt including a stunner holster and shockstick both were youngish but not young not grizzled veterans but not rookies born postconquest then though perhaps with older relatives possessing unhappy memories sulmonas left hand bore a wedding ring ivan noted automatically thank you for agreeing to see us captain said fano formally standing up he gestured to a chair across the table from the pair please sit down taking psychological possession of the space fano was in proper interrogationroom style ivan let it pass and sat granting them each a neutral nod he had suffered through a course in counterinterrogation techniques once long ago i suppose it will come back to me sir maam what can i do for dome security they exchanged a look fano began were following up on a peculiar b ampe arrestthats breaking and enteringearly this morning in the crater lake neighborhood dammit how had this pair nailed him so fast dont panic you didnt do anything wrong well all right hed done several things wrong starting with listening to byerly vorrutyer but he didnt think hed done anything illegal yeah im the victim here what he said out loud was ah oh put in sulmona pulling a vid pickup from her pocket and setting it in front of them do you mind if we record its standard procedure in these investigations why not im pretty sure my people are yes and the transcript would be copied to admiral desplains first thing tomorrow morning no doubt ouch sure go ahead said ivan trying for a tone of easy innocence he offered a friendly smile to the detectivepatroller she seemed to be immune to his charm fano went on the flat that was broken into is listed as rented by a young woman named nanja brindis lately moved to solstice from olbia dome unfortunately sera brindis is not to be found either last night or todayshe didnt report to her work this morning we understand you had contact with the young woman earlier last evening would you care to describe it in your own words the better to hang myself how much of the story did this pair already possess they had obviously seen some scan of the credit chit hed used at the shipping shop and maybe talked to the coworker and who knew what else so hed likely better stick as closely to the truth as possible without betraying byerly or nanjatej or the imperium or himself but it was pretty easy to see where he sat in that hierarchy should a goat be required he sighed because he didnt think the komarrans would understand it if he bleated yes well id stopped in at the shop where she worked to ship a package home it was closing time so i offered to take her out for a drink or dinner sulmona frowned at him why erhavent you seen a picture of her yet there was a scan for her work id said fano then it didnt do her justice she was a very eyecatching young woman believe me and said sulmona and im a soldier a long way from home all right she was pretty i was lonely it seemed worth a try i know you komarrans dont always think us barrayarans are human but we are he matched her frown she didnt drop her eyes but she did rock back a bit point taken and then what happened she said no and i went my way just like that said sulmona i can take no for an answer if i have to someone else will say yes eventually the pair exchanged another unreadable look fano prompted and then what did you follow sera brindis to her flat no i thought id stroll back to look at that lake where they rent the boats you know since it seemed i was to have time on my hands wait was that in the right direction well he could feign to have been turned around and i ran into sera brindis again coming the other way a happy chance i thought i thought you took no for an answer murmured sulmona sure but sometimes women change their minds it never hurts to ask again and if they change their minds in the other direction her prerogative im not into that rough stuff if thats what youre thinking and ivan could see it waswell they were cops they had to have seen some ugly scenarios i prefer my bedfriends friendly thanks and said fano weariness was beginning to color the patience in his voice so she invited me inside i thought id got lucky was all ivan cleared his throat this is where it gets a trifle embarrassing im afraid did they know about the blue roommate well they might but ivan decided that he wouldnt i thought we were going to sit down for a drink some gettoknowyou conversation maybe dinner after all all the civilized stuff when suddenly she pulled out a stunner and shot me were you trying to attack her said fano abruptly cold no dammit look i know ive been a desk pilot for a while but i did have basic training once and the impsec refresher course on personal defense once a year but that was a nonroutine and dubious benefit of his other rank no need to mention it here if id been trying to attack her id have succeeded she was only able to zap me because it came as a complete surprise id thought things were going well and then what did you think said sulmona dryly nothing i was frigging unconscious for a long time i guess because when i woke up i was tied to a chair and the flat was dark seemed empty i wasnt sure if it was safe to yell out or not so i just started working on trying to get loose safe said sulmona in a disbelieving tone he didnt have to play a total fool ivan decided he fixed her with a frown if you two have worked at your jobs for any length of time you have to have cleaned up a couple of cases of barrayarans especially in uniform out in the domes who ran into komarrans with old grudges i didnt know if id fallen into the hands of crazy people or terrorists or spies or what or if i was about to be tortured or drugged or kidnapped or worse so getting myself loose seemed a better bet than drawing attention the pairs return stares were tinged with enough embarrassment that ivan was pretty sure hed scored a hit develop this theme then i was just starting to make progress when these two guys showed up at the windowthirdstory window mind youand started cutting through it with a plasma arc i didnt figure this was exactly how komarrans went visiting their friends yknow especially at that hour for all i knew theyd come to collect me the perpetrators said fano in their first testimony stated that they were in process of returning the float pallet to the person theyd borrowed it from and saw you by chance in passing that you cried out frantically for help and thats why they broke in ha said ivan darkly good story but not true they cut their way in before they ever saw me he hesitated first testimony i hope you fastpentad those suckers hed actually neither hoped nor expected anything of the kind surely any kind of serious agent had to have undergone resistance treatment to the truth drug later said fano a soon as wed collated enough evidence and inconsistencies to legally permit us to conduct a nonvoluntary pentaassisted interrogation what they werent allergic i mean they seemed like pros to me what little i saw of em professional petty criminals in the domes dont normally adopt such extreme military techniques said fano instead they rely on a cell system they never know who hired them or why they were set to their task low tech but effective enough and very annoying to us that is ill bet ivan commiserated so were they after me and thank god hed stuck as tightly to the truth as he could so far fano frowned and admitted no it seems they were hired to pick up sera brindis and her maidservant and deliver them to a location where they would be handed off to yet another cell for transport we havent been able to find out anything about this maidservant sera brindis was the only resident listed in the flat did you see a second woman ivan shook his head not before i got stunned he gave it a beat nor after for obvious reasons did you stun the two men asked fano i was still tied to the damned chair unfortunately and blinded by the lights i tried to con them into untying me the shots seemed to come out of nowhere i did hear footsteps behind me running out the front door but by the time i finally got free and was able to look around nobody was there how many pairs of footsteps one i thought but i couldnt swear to it the whole night was like a damned farce except i was the only one without a script by then i was mainly interested in getting out of there before someone else came back and started in on any fun letstorturethebarrayaran games sulmona leaned forward and fiddled with her recorder we received an anonymous tip about the breakin which led back to a data wall that none of our programs could penetrate happily it seems we now have a positive voice match ivans own slurred voice began to sound yeah you should see im down on the street watchin this right now remorselessly she let the call play all the way to its abrupt end she added we also found a charge to your credit chit for a bubblecar ride from crater lake platform to downtown solstice just a few minutes after the timestamp on this call because it never hurt a case to add a little redundancy ivan glumly supposed did you hear a woman scream asked fano uh well no not really i just figured it would hurry up the response i wasnt sure how fast those two goons were going to wake up and i didnt think they should be let to go wandering off on their ownsome better the whole mess should be turned over to the proper authorities that would be you which i did you know captain vorpatril both leaving the scene of a crime and making falsified emergency calls are against the law said fano maybe i shouldve hung around but i was going to be late for work and i was still pretty shaken up fano gestured to the recorder were you drunk i wont deny i might have had a drink or two earlier he could but he wasnt going tobetter if they thought hed been a trifle alcoholimpaired which they might well buy he could see it played to their prejudices but have you ever had a heavystun hangover fano shook his head sulmonas brows drew down possibly in unwilling sympathy about the first hed got from her let me tell you theyre downright ugly your head buzzes for hours and your vision is messed up balance too its no wonder i sounded drunk and that for admiral desplains and whoever else on ivans own side that was going to be listening to this because there were limits to selfsacrifice and this was all bad enough damn byerly fanos lips twisted and what at your work was more important than leaving a crime scene in which to hear you tell it you were a victim ivan drew himself up letting the admirals high vor aidedecamp out for the first time he too could deliver unpleasantness in a chilly tone a great deal of my work is highly classified ser fano i wont be discussing it with you both komarrans blinked sulmona riposted would you be willing to repeat your testimony under fastpenta captain ivan leaned back folding his hands sure of his ground on this one its not up to me he replied easily you would have to apply to my commanding officer admiral desplains chief of operations and then after that the request would have to be approved by impsec hq in vorbarr sultana by general allegre personally i believe damned well knew actually an impsec operative would have to sit in administer the drug and the antagonist and record everything you would both have to be personally investigated and cleared by impsec first ivan added kindly youre welcome to apply of course i expect you could get an answer in about two weeks and he would be on his way back to barrayar before then the detectives shot him twin looks of dislike that was all right ivan didnt exactly like them either yes but didnt you even report this incident to your own security captain asked fano really disliked them i reported it in brief to my commanding officer true in a sense but oh god wasnt desplains ever going to fry him in the morning over that as i didnt end up in the hospital or the morgue and i wasnt questioned tortured bugged or even robbed i have to classify it as a misadventure encountered on my own time bit of a mystery true but mysteries get turned over to impsec or originate from impsec which is thank god not my department im ops and happy to be so every impsec officer i ever had to do with was twisty as hell yknow especially my relatives but when impsec decides what im supposed to think im sure theyll tell me fano said unhopefully and would impsec be willing to share any findings with solstice dome security you can apply said ivan he bit his lower lip to stop himself from baring his teeth sulmona drummed her fingers on the tabletop we still have a missing woman on our hands or not on our hands i dont like it if whoever was trying to kidnap her missed her where is she at a guess she probably pulled up stakes and went to hide somewhere else said ivan it would seem the sensible thing if someone was after you the sensible thing would be to go to dome security for help said sulmona mouth pinching in frustration why didnt she ivan scratched his head dunno she didnt exactly confide in me yknow but if shes only lately moved here it would make sense that her mysteries probably have their roots back where she came from where was that again olbia dome said fano automatically then shouldnt you folks be directing your attention to olbia dome instead of to say my flat argh that will be our next task sighed fano he pressed his palms to the table and levered himself upright and ivan wondered how much of his nights sleep hed missed over this not as much as me reluctantly he opened his hand in dismissal of ivan captain vorpatril thank you for your cooperation he didnt add such as it was out loud but ivan thought it was implied my personal embarrassment doesnt seem the most important issue here doesnt mean i enjoy it but youre welcome i really do hope no harm has come to sera brindis ivan rather pointedly escorted his visitors to the security desk to sign out the harrowing interview over he fled the building chapter four captain vorpatril returned nervewrackingly late after dark when both sun and soletta had set tej forgave him almost immediately for the sake of the several large heavy handled bags he bore from which delectable odors issued we have to talk he wheezed but the two famished women overbore him without much resistance on his part we have to eat do you realize you left us nothing but those awful ration bars tej demanded that was all we had for lunch well and the wine she added fairly that was pretty good i had rat bars for breakfast and lunch and no wine at all he oneupped this rish whose metabolism was permanently set on high sped to lay out plates and eating tools on the round glass table across from the kitchenette the bags disgorged three kinds of pasta grilled vegetables a saute of spinach garlic and pine nuts sliced vat beef roasted vat chicken with rosemary salads both leafy and fruit cheeses cheesecake three flavors of ice cream and two of sorbets and more wine tej could only think i do like a man who keeps his promises i wasnt sure if you had any special dietary things customs needs vorpatril explained so i tried to get a range all komarranstyle theres a good place just up the street ill eat anything that wasnt ever a live animal rish avowed settingto in demonstration i was beginning to think about compromising on that live animal part tej added vorpatril she was pleased to see was a man who appreciated his food given the rat bars shed begun to picture him concealing a level of barrayaran barbarism that even the holovids hadnt hinted at but the selection demonstrated an unexpected level of discernment and balance the attunement of his senses couldnt match her or rishs innate aptitude and formal training of course but it was far from hopeless and he seemed unwilling to damage the dining ambiance with upsetting discourse which suited tej just fine he was still working up to whatever hed wanted to disclose when he went off to the lav and to shed his jacket and shoes returned via the couch sat and more or less fell over just need to close my eyes fr a minute the eyes stayed closed after a while the mouth opened he didnt snore exactly it was more of a soothing purring sound muffled by the cushion he clutched rish crossed her arms and regarded him ill concede these barrayarans are cute when theyre asleep they stop talking her head tilted he even drools fetchingly he does not drool tej smiled despite herself dont get attached sweetling rish advised this one is dangerous tej stared down at the sleeping officer he didnt look all that dangerous not with that curl of dark hair straying over his forehead just begging for a soft hand to put it to rightsreally you know what i mean should we wake him up asked tej doubtfully i dont think he slept at all last night i thought he would doze in the chair eh let sleeping creatures lie rish glanced at her wristcom besides my favorite vid comes on right now rish immured in their flat for weeks on end had developed an addiction to an array of komarran holovid serial dramas a fondness tej did not especially share after a day of grubbing the short komarran evening left her little time for relaxation rish went off now to the bedroom which had the best holovid remote link and closed the door first turning off the lights to make sure she was not visible from a distance tej slipped onto the balcony and stared out for a time at the strange sealed city was her long journey doomed to end hereone way or another it could be worse but it was not her choice just an accumulation of chances she returned at length carefully locking the balcony door and drawing the drapes then set herself to quietly cleaning up after their meal there was plenty left over to sustain them through tomorrow at least the captain appeared to be planning on keeping her and rish not that the decision was his she returned to the couch and tentatively tried to poke him awake pulling away the cushion he clutched it back with surprising strength and determination for an unconscious man mumbling and turning over to protect it so tej gave up and just sat down across from him to contemplate the view she had to admit it was a good view genetically speaking for a wildcaught after another few minutes rish came out to join her smiling in a pleased way i was right about hendro fon she informed tej he was faking the amnesia and the dna sample had been substituted sera jenna was a real clone ill bet the trade fleet merger is off now she sat beside tej and nodded at vorpatril still out is he yes he must have been exhausted i wonder what it is they make an aidedecamp do all day anyway i have no idea said rish quiet held sway for a time tej finally murmured rish what do we do next were good here for tonight probably tomorrow but then what i cant go back to my job small loss i know you worked hard sweetling but your grubber job was far too slow in filling the bag i said so at the time you did i thought nanja would get something better soon and the commonplace shop had seemed to be ideal for lying very low indeed tej had learned how to do every task required of her in less than two days which was good because she doubted shed have been up to mastering anything more challenging just then im so sick of this struggle nanja brindis used up my last identity package and she was barely deep enough to pass even a cursory inspection maybe that was a good thing her next identity would surely be less predictable to their pursuers if even she couldnt predict it nor afford it if they could get to escobar better identities might be made available to them there but if they couldnt get off komarr without better ids i really realize now what it is to be houseless rish gripped her hand in brief consolation i suppose we could try going to ground in a different dome maybe equinox or serifosa if we cant afford a jumpship we could at least afford the monorail get out of solstice where we know weve been smoked her voice was unpressing a smaller dome would make it even harder to hide though rish stood stretched and wandered over to prod their host when he did not stir she leaned over and neatly forked his wallet from his pocket she brought it back to tej and they went through it together again not much cash said rish and we cant use his credit chit though i suppose his ids would fetch a good price if we could find the right buyer thistej fingered the thin stack of local currency then tucked it into the wallet againwould only sustain us for a few days weve a couple of days for free right here this much wouldnt get us ahead just put it back rish shrugged and did so as deftly as she had extracted it tej leaned her head back her own eyes closed for a time i saw this vid show rish offered after a while all about sergyar and the colonization effort it looked like a nice world breathable atmosphere and all did they show anything about that horrid worm plague tej shuddered not a word i think they were trying to persuade people to move there gruesome pictures of colonists all bloated up like lumpy sausages wouldnt much aid that but i gathered you could go as some sort of indentured laborer and pay for your passage after it sounded like the first step on the slippery slope into contract slavery to tej what she said aloud was but sergyar has an even smaller population than komarr and its all stocked with barrayarans how would you hide there its a very mixed population i heard the current vicereine is making an effort to draw immigrants from all over even beta colony it wont be like barrayar or even komarr if that keeps on they were both silent for a while contemplating this option it depended on their being able to make it to orbital embarkation alive and uncollected which didnt seem a good bet right now theres captain mystery here rish nodded to the sleeping figure across from them captain vormystery i suppose he would correct that ivan xav the one and only i think he likes me oh i can smell that rish smirked he also has a slight breast fetish dont they all tej sighed the corners of her mouth drew up though not in his case for slight breasts if he were a random komarran stranger off the street id advisethough only as a secondtolast resortthat you attach yourself to him and ride as far as you could but hes not komarran hes definitely not random and thats far too strange mm another long silence rish finally said in a very low voice i would die before i allowed myself to be taken back and used against the baron and baronne in an equally quiet tone tej returned theres no baron and baronne left to be used against wed just be used she blinked eyes gone abruptly blurry no i wont cry any more if weeping were going to help it would have done so by now both stared straight ahead rishs voice went darker bleaker once they grab us the chances for the last escape will grow very constrained too soon could become too late too fast to target no need to say out loud what the last escape was theyd discussed it twice before though theyd twice evaded it once by bare minutes how here too dangerous for either of us to go out looking for a painless termination drug though i did notice a sign for veterinary hospital on the way could be raided buti read about this method once that they used on old earth lie back in a hot bath and just open your veins it only hurts for a moment a little sting less than a hypospray jab they say theres that great big tub in the bathroom we could just ease back andgo to sleep sweetling just go to sleep it would be a bit tough on ivan xav when he came home though wouldnt it not to mention tricky for him to explain to the dome cops not our problem by then barely turning her head tej glanced aside at her companion youre tired too arent you very rish sighed you should have taken a nap this afternoon as well tej scrunched her eyes in thought i dont know i think id rather seize some last chance forsomething go to the highest tower in solstice maybe and step off the roof the fall would be great while it lasted we could dance all the way down your last dance bitch of an arret at the end though said rish and no encore the baronne always loved your encores i vote for the tub the balcony out there might do if we were cornered no too public they might scrape us up and put us back together and then where would we be thatsreally hard to guess ah more silence the sleeping captain snorted and rolled over again youd have a better chance of hiding out minus me began rish tej sniffed this too was an old argument my loyalties may not be bred in my bones oddsister but ill back nurture against nature any day you care to name nature breathed rish starting to smile nurture said tej nature nurture tub tower tej paused you know we need a third vote here we always end up in a tie its a gridlock deadlock whatever tej tilted her head in consideration actually the best method would be something that made it look like our pursuers had murdered us the local authorities would think they were killers and their bosses would think they botched the snatch get them coming and going thats pretty rish conceded but it would only cook the meat the best revenge would fry the brains oh yes tej sighed oh yes but she didnt see how to reach all the way home to effect such a deed from the unbeing given that she couldnt even do so while still breathing vorpatril rolled back and made a strange wheezing noise like a distant balloon deflating then went quiescent again eyeable show that i grant you said rish nodding to him but theres not much of a plot think of it as experimental dance very abstract more quiet rish yawned i vote we take over the bed leave him out here you know i think you might get a unanimous tej froze as the door buzzer sounded loud in the stillness rish jerked as if electrocuted and leaped to her feet golden eyes wide tej lurched across to the other sofa and shook its occupant by the shoulder saying in an urgent undervoice captain vorpatril wake up theres someone at your door he mumbled and hunched in on himself like an animal trying hide in a hole too small for it the buzzer blatted again tej shook him again ivan xav rish stepped across grabbed his sock feet and ruthlessly yanked them to the floor the rest of him followed with a thud hey ah wazzit he mumbled indignantly rolling over and sitting up at last then clapping a hand over his eyes ah too bright the door buzzer sounded and did not stop now as if someone held it down with a thumb and leaned in who the helld be out there at this time of night vorpatril blinked in a blurry attempt to focus on his wristcom what is this time of night youve been asleep almost three hours said rish not nough he tried to lie back down on the floor god whats that noise in my head swear i didnt drink that much answer your door tej hissed hauling on his arm to the buzzing was now added a thumping as if someone was hitting the door with a bunched hand surely kidnappers wouldnt be this noisy he lumbered up at last visibly pulling himself into focus right right l go find out he waved them off as he started for the short hallway leading to the door on the corridor you two go hide tej stared wildly around the place had only the living room kitchenette bedroom and bath spacious as they were plus two closets and the balcony any search for cowering women would be short and foregone should she allow herself to be cut off from access to that balcony rish darted into the open bedroom doorway and frantically motioned her to follow instead tej nipped to the other corner and peeked around into the entry hall the door slid aside from a shadowy shape occluded by vorpatrils broad shoulders came a terse voice male barrayaran accent ivan you idiot what the hell happened with you last night you to tejs considerable surprise the captain reached out grabbed his visitor by the jacket and swung him inside and up against the hall wall the outer door hissed closed she caught a bare glimpse of the man before shrinking back out of sight neither old nor young shorter than ivan xav not in any recognizable uniform ivan ivan the voice protested shifting its register from irate to placating easy on the jacket the last time anyone greeted me with that much passion i at least won a big sloppy kiss out of it a slight pause granted that was my cousin donos dog things the size of a pony and no mannersit will jump all over byerly you youimpweasel what the hell did you set me up for just what i wanted to ask you ivan my love what went wrong i thought you would bring the woman back here not on a first date you twit you always end up at her place first time or some neutral third location but only if youre both insanely hot what i stand enlightened said the other voice dryly or would if you would let me down thank you thats better tej fancied she could almost hear him shooting his cuffs and adjusting his garb ivan xavs voice surly you may as well come on in that was what id had in mind yes id have thought the five minutes i spent leaning on your door buzzer would have been a clue but oh well tej retreated on hasty tiptoes across the living room and around the bedroom doorframe rish stood plastered against the wall on the far side listening intently she raised a warning finger to her lips tej nodded and breathed through her open mouth the light exasperated voice continued the latest updates from solstice dome security on the breakin remain very unenlightening buttied to a chair ivan however did you manage that i havent seen the latestoh god they didnt give my name did they do they know your name they do now ivan you should know better a hesitation the next begged question being of course how did you get untied the captain heaved a sigh before you say anything more byerlyladies youd better come out now whoever this man was he seemed to know ivan xav and far too much about tejs affairs should she trust in her hosts cavalier disclosure of them do we have a choice tej let out her breath nodded across to rish and stepped out of the bedroom doorway the new man swung around to take her in his eyebrows climbing the hell do you mean to tell me ive been running mad since midmorning trying to trace the woman and she was here all the rish stepped out from behind tej and regarded the newcomer coolly he was abruptly expressionlessnow there was a curious first responsehis face unreadable but not the rest of him his eyelids did not widen but his pupils flared rish could actually pick up heart rates a degree of discernment beyond tejs capacity though she fancied his heart did not speed but actually slowed seeming to take bigger gulps in its shock of the surprise fear and arousal all present in the first faint scent of him wafting to her she suspected he was only conscious of the first two he blinked once closed his lips with a visible effort my word he said faintly yeah thats what i said more or less said vorpatril or would have if she hadnt just grassed me with a stunner mademoiselle the man named byerly favored rish with a flowing halfbow only partly a parody of the gesture may i just say a stunner seems redundant so introduce us mon coz he was back in control of himself now rishs eyes were very narrow watching him intently taking him in far more literally than he could guess hes not my cousin said vorpatril with a jerk of his thumb at his visitor the relationships more removed although alas not removed nearly far enough tej rish meet byerly vorrutyer commonly known as by just plain by not lord vorrutyer or lord byerlythose titles are reserved for the sons of the count in coloration the two might have been siblings though the underlying bones denied that first impression yet clearly the two men shared a generous measure of vor genes caste might be the precise term the visitor wore a vaguely militarylooking jacket and trousers decorated with braid and piping that she suspected were more artistic than indicative of rank the jacket swung open revealing a fine shirt and colorful braces and a brief glimpse of a discreet stunner holster ivan xav was dangerously engaging this man was dangerouslytense tired wired yet despite his manhandling in the hallway there was no flinching in his posture no effort to distance himself from his host no fear of vorpatril nor of tej for that matter rishby the flicker of his eyes the angle that he held his body he was keenly conscious of rish trying to account for her vorpatril went on by meet tej also known as nanja brindisbut you knew about her didnt you and herfriend rish who was a surprise to us all but i believe the dome cops have her down on their playlist as the maidservant missing tej swallowed how do you do byerly vorrutyer she said formally that tells us who you are but not im afraid what you are she let her eyebrows rise in an inquiry divided equally between the two barrayarans vorpatril folded his arms and stared off into space that would be for by to say the other barrayaran drew a long breathbuying time to think and cast an inviting wave toward the angled pair of couches indeed may i suggest we all sit down more comfortably another moment or two purchased while she and rish alighted where theyd been before and the two men took vorpatrils late sleeping slot but after settling himself next to his removed relative who removed himself yet further to the couchs end byerly still looked rather blank um so howdid you all end up here tej said in chill tones captain vorpatril invited us they wanted a safe place to lie low vorpatril put in which must be working if you couldnt find em he added after another moment on purpose anyway tej frowned at byerly the mismatch between his foppish mannerisms and his bodys testimony was as grating to her senses as clashing colors or a musical discord who are you good question who are you i can tell you one thing said vorpatril got it from morozov the jacksons whole guru in galactic affairs out at hqrish here is also known as lapis lazuli she used to be part of a whole gengineered dance troupe belonging to the evidently late baronne cordonah of cordonah station seems that about seven months ago house cordonah was swallowed up by some pretty nasty competitors tej trembled rish looked up eyes hot with rage swiftly banked not competitors predators scavengers hyenas jackals and vultures a veritable zoo said byerly his brows lifting above widened eyes were you ah there at feeding time tej held up her hand we wont tell you anything she waited while his face tightened in frustration and then offered her only card or the illusion of it pure bluff exhilarating and sickening but we might deal you for it answer for answer value for value would he go for it the deal was utterly hollow the man could pull out his stunner drop rish where she sat and take tej before she was half launched at himthough perhaps less easily the other way around she could wake up tied to a chair like poor ivan xav except with the cool kiss of a hypospray of fastpenta held to her arm in minutes be spilling everything she knew along with fits of giggles why should he buy what he could so easily steal instead he sat back there ensued a long thoughtful silence all right said byerly at last ill deal rishs brows rose in surprise so did vorpatrils whats your real name sera brindis by began at once tejs mouth drew down concealing both elation and terror his supple adaptation was almost jacksonian and yet he was as purely barrayaran as vorpatril did he understand what he was doingwhat she was doing only one way to find out thats a question worth my life what have you to offer of equal weight his head tilted eh perhaps we wont start with that one then as for what happened last night i can get that free from ivan so i shant waste a trade on it what did happen last night ivan vorpatril started eh you want the short version no thanks to you these ladies mistook me for a hired goon sent to stalk them a misunderstanding we didnt get straightened around till the real goons showed up you owe me for a lost nights sleep a stunner hangover having to jump tall buildings with a stunner hangover and let me add a major personal disappointment we bailed left the goons out cold on the floor called in the breakin to the dome cops and came here with barely time left for me to get to work byerly ran his hands through his dark hair disarranging it dear god ivan why did you call dome security they were bound to turn up eventually i didnt want the goons to get away sure as hell didnt want to take em with me and i wasnt sure if i could trusthe hesitatedother authorities given some things youd said he went on sounding more aggrieved and to cap it the two most unsympathetic dome cops ever tracked me to work just at quitting time and cornered me for fortyfive minutes of grilling they were just itching to arrest me for stalking rape kidnapping murder who knows what elsebeing barrayaran i expect ah shidid you mention me kept your existence entirely out of it had to tapdance around their physical evidence like a loon to do it too so you can say thank you ivan that may be premature vorpatrils scowl deepened yeah and to make things worse this all took place in an ops conference room where you just know it was monitored itll all be in my bosss inbox by tomorrow morning and i might lie to the dome cops for you by but im damned well not going to lie to desplains byerly pounded his forehead with his fist ivan if you knew that why didnt you take them out somewhere else for that interviewcoffee shop park bench anywhere you havent the instinct for selfpreservation that god gave a canary how ever have you survived so far hey i do fine on my own its only when you imyou damned weasels show up in my lifeuninvited generallythat it gets this complicated all right i have a question said tej interrupting all thishow long would they keep it up who sent captain vorpatril to me who gave him my picture was it you she frowned at the other voralphabet he spread a hand over his chest and offered her a sitting bow none other i trust you found him satisfactory why thats two questions so keep score her eyes narrowed did you know rish and i were going to be attacked last night how vorpatril bit his knuckle byerlys face set in a faint empty smile for a momentprocessing then relaxed into its ironic default expression once more i hired them tejs heart plummeted were they deceivedagain what cried vorpatril indignantly you might have said i was not certain to what degree i could rely on your acting abilities vorpatril crossed his arms and sat back with a snort uh what thought tej rishs empty hand slipped quietly back out of her trouser pocket even her guarded face bewildered byerly continued to tej i am presently engaged in studying some people frequently the best way to gain a close view is to make myself useful which i doselectively while it is not always true that the enemy of my enemy is my friend in this case i thought it well to give the appearance of cooperation while diverting its result at least until i could find out more about you so hed betrayed her with one hand and his acquaintances with the other thatspretty ambidextrous he shrugged unoffended hence ivana third hand if you like whom i admit was a lastminute stopgap but this all came up rather suddenly my planas there was no indication whatsoever that your strangely elusive maidservant lived inwas that he should take you out frolicking leaving the cupboard bare for your midnight visitors pleasant for you both frustrating for them entirely unconnected with me i still dont know why they wanted you kidnapped mind you he looked up and batted his eyes invitingly youre an agent commercial governmental surely not military what kind now that is a piece of information worth your name ivan put in er tej if your enemies know who you really are already why should your friends be kept in the dark does this make sense to you because it doesnt to me youve not proved yourselves our friends what i have too said vorpatril he jerked his thumb at the other man and conceded him maybe not so much tej rubbed her mouth ivan xav had a point is he trustworthy she asked him straight out no hes a damned weasel vorpatril hesitated but he wont betray barrayar if what you are poses no threat to the imperium you have nothing to fear from him probably byerly cast vorpatril a look of exasperated disbelief whose side are you on youve been known to make mistakes i distinctly recall pulling your and your countly cousins feet out of the fire on one of em spectacularly but do i get respect do i get gratitude do i get byerly hunching said you got another job for some reason this settled him huh byerly massaged his neck looked up and met tejs gaze with a mild smile belied by his intent eyes very well i will now deal for your name he inhaled i am an imperial security surveillance operative my specialty is normally the high vor social milieu centering around vorbarr sultana i am out of my usual venue because the people i am following left there and came here in pursuit of their affairs which are certainly criminal and potentially treasonous tej shook her head the ones who are after us are not barrayarans i know yours are the people my people are dealing with locating you for them was to be a favor to sweeten a pot presently in process of going sour vorpatrils face scrunched hey was finding tej and rish one of the little ways you made yourself useful too byerly shrugged for gods sake by what if those goons had snatched em i thought the experiment might yield much useful information whatever way it fell out said byerly sounding pressed in no case would their captors have been allowed to carry them out of the imperium but if tej and rish can tell me even more about their ah foes then this affair has fallen out better than i might have expected although there are other consequenceswell very reluctantly he added thank you ivan its not just my life at risk said tej slowly rishs is too byerly said i am working with two associates if iwhat is that jacksonian phrase get smoked it is probable that they will be too so you see i am not without my further responsibilities either it occurred to tej that this exchange had just given the barrayaran agent a very good professional reason to keep her and rish as far away as possible from kidnappers and hostile interrogators regardless of his other agendas her bluff had won them a very real prize or else hed want them safely dead but she did not sense the excited tang of such a hidden lethal intent upon him tej glanced at rish who had been following this with all her attentionand superior senses is he telling the truth rish returned a cautious nod yes go ahead with maybe a so far implied yes this mans coin is information notcoin rish would appreciate the aesthetic clarity to be sure tej swallowed very well her throat felt very tight and thick as if it were closing off in some deathly allergic reaction my full name is akuti tejaswini jyoti ghem estif arqua my parents arewereshiv and udine ghem estif arqua baron and baronne cordonah she looked up to gauge the effect of this news byerly had gone expressionless again as if not merely processing but locked up vorpatrils face had fallen into a fixed smile she had once owned a favorite fur and fabric bear very huggable with eyes that glassy but she felt no urge to hug the barrayaran now chapter five ivans mind had gone so blank the first thought that arose in it sped out of his mouth wholly without impediment how did all that name get stuck on one girl and how the devil did she spell it tejivan could see why the nickname nowtossed her clouds of curls in impatience she made a truncated gesture as if to denywhat when we kids started to come along my father found this booki dont know from where ten thousand authentic ethnic baby names from old earth their meanings and geographical origins he had trouble choosing i have a sister named stella antonia dolce ginevra lucia but by the time i arrived hed reined back a little she added after a moment we called her star yourenot an only child then asked by not the heiress of your house oh there was a good question and an appalling thought tej gave by a cold stare waiting for a trade im an only child myself ivan offered i know that how i looked you up on the comconsole youre really you too she frowned at byerly i wonder what id find if i looked you up not much i am a scion of an undistinguished cadet branch of my family bys glance flickered to rish listening with those pointed turquoise elfears disinherited technically but since my branch possesses nothing to inherit that was something of an empty gesture on my fathers part he has a younger sister i think said ivan havent ever met her married and living on south continent isnt she by bys smile already thin flattened further thats right theres no point in withholding anything captain morozov could tell us ivan pointed out helpfully to tej this whole deal thing was alarming really all too jacksonian and adversarial thatll include anything thats public knowledge or thats hit the nexus news feeds and likely a good bit more than that and ivan was now sorry that he hadnt lingered to learn more but it would have been bound to lead in turn to questions he hadnt wanted to answer just then such as how many mysterious women are you hiding in your rental flat ivan tej rubbed her eyes with one slim brown hand im the secondyoungest my oldest brother was the heir but he was reported killed in the takeover too im pretty sure my two older sisters made it out of jacksonian local space through other jump points but i dont know what happened to them after that my other brothergot out a long time ago how did that work your escape asked by tej shrugged its been set up for ages for all us kids in case of a house emergency there was a drill when we were given the code word we werent supposed to ask questions or argue or delay we were just supposed to follow our assigned handlers id been through it once before a few years backwe made it to fell station before the turnaround order caught up with us i thought thats what would happen again so you werent an eyewitness to the cordonah stations er forcible change of management i think star got out just as the station was being boarded but the rest of us were hours gone by then the evacuation drill was never something my parents took chances with she swallowed her throat obviously tight with some upsetting memory everything we learned we learned later through the news feeds though of course you cant trust them twice said rish unexpectedly surely you werent too young to remember was that the trip we took when i was six oh no one ever told me what that was all about just that we were going on a ride and a visit we wanted to keep you calm what you couldnt have been older than fifteen tej turned to ivan though not to byerly and said rish used to babysit me a lot when i was younger in between dance practice and other chores the baronne assigned you call your mother the baronne well the tall woman in morozovs scan had looked formidable more beautiful than warm the manhad been harder to gauge is rish your assigned handler asked by tej shook her head we had a real bodyguard a courier im afraid he may be dead now that happened on fell station we almost didnt get away had the man bought their escape with his life seemed like it from the quiver in her voice and the chilled look in rishs eyes but if rish wasnt the official bodyguard what was she ivan looked at her and asked so are you really a jeeves those spungold eyebrows rose what would you trade for that information i ivan glanced aside i think its byerlys turn now by shot him a look of annoyance which left ivan unmoved actually ivan went on to him i think you owe me a bucket of information by before i put my foot in it by accident again and im not taking any more ivan you idiots off of you when you cant be troubled to give me a decent briefing this ringing declaration left him a little winded and by edging slightly away good if ivan had to shout to be heard maybe it was time to bellow a bit name names byerly byerly looked as if hed rather knock out several teeth and hand them across nevertheless after a narrow frown at the two women he rubbed his forehead and began all right then ivan dyou know theo vormercier barely not my crowd quite lately he was cut out of a longexpected inheritance when his aging uncle count vormercier remarried and began springing offspring really i mean id heard about the marriage from mmother yknow but i didnt think the new wife was that much younger than him technology of course they used genetic assembly and a uterine replicator i understand they now have a brandnew genecleaned bouncing baby boy and another on the way byerly smirked say any chance that your mother and old illyan would no said ivan firmly not that a certain formidable auntly person hadnt actually suggested it betan that she was he glanced at tej listening intently if with a somewhat baffled expression you were saying about vormercier bys eyes glinted with fleeting amusement he nodded and went on theo had been living on his expectations for quite a long time and not frugally to say that this development took him aback would be understating the case in the meanwhile he had a younger brother in the servicea quartermaster officer in the sergyar fleets orbital depot brother rogers expectations while considerably more modest were equally thwarted about a year ago theo went out to visit him and evidently they talked sergyar fleet is commodore joles patch said ivan not to mentionhuh not a good place to play games doubtless that had something to do with the extreme caution and cleverness with which they went about it rogers embezzlements began small with theft of a load of outdated military equipment and supplies that had been slated to be destroyed perfectly understandable temptation almost an admirable frugality when you think about it the receiver contacts theyd made with that scam led to bigger and better contacts and the next effort was much more ambitious howd you get all this from vormercier you fastpenta him when he wasnt looking alcohol and braggadocio ivan and stretched patience and a strong stomach on my part if i do say so by sighed the conspirators divided the task roger takes care of the heavy lifting theo launders the money there is no money trail back to the actual military thieves the loads go as opportunity permits from sergyar orbit to pol station where they are slipped to their nonbarrayaran receivers and into a void money comes out of a void into the hands of a contact on komarr who finds various apparentlylegal ways to hand it on to theo who takes it back to barrayar and invests it at a much later date the military minions stop by and collect under an inventive variety of pretexts but like many another gambler before them the brothers vormercier appear never to have heard of the dictum quit while youre ahead my dada used to say that said tej rish nodded byerly after a bemused pause cast them a small salute and continued the old phrase no honor among thieves also seems apropos i have reason to think theo has been embezzling from the funds entrusted to him in any case he was quite onedge when it became time to take his yacht his entourage and his trusted hangeronthat would be meto komarr for a solettaviewing party and gather in his next payout for goods delivered from his komarran contact unfortunately for theo the goods have not been delivered the ship was unexpectedly delayed in komarr orbit and has missed its pol station rendezvous i believe your people had something to do with that ivan ivan pursed his lips and whistled so its gotta be the kanzian only sergyar fleet vessel insystem right now the vor horsemen snagged it for the fleet inspection desplains likes springing little surprises like that though i bet it wasnt a surprise to jole hell likely reciprocate next chance byerly nodded as if satisfied to have another stray piece of his puzzle slot into place while theos contacts appear to be relatively unruffled by the development theo is in a lather the contacts have declined to advance him moneys on a cargo as yet in limbo but offered as a sop a surprisingly substantial bounty on your two guests byerly nodded across at the women beggars not being choosey theo promptly seized the sop and set me on the task and here we are by paused as if for a round of applause and appeared disappointed to only receive three long stares collecting the identity of theos komarr contact was a bit of a coup for me but hardly enough to justify my expense reports but as ivan could no doubt explain in his exemplary military manner the best way to capture a wormhole is from both ends at once he spread his arms wide then brought his hands slowly together caging air or something only he could see if one could get a handle on those people in the void beyond pol station one might well work backward to trap everything that lies between them and komarr he looked up with undisguised interest at tej and rish do you figure the people who bid for you are from the syndicate that seized your house tejs fists clenched opened prestene idont know maybe or they might be anybody looking to collect the arrest order fee said fee posted ultimately by the syndicate why do they want you the size of the prize suggests quite a special interest tejs lips tightened then she shrugged rish as one of the jewels would be an outward sign of prestenes triumph over house cordonah if they could capture and display her even more brag if they can collect the set i suppose they think im a loose end wild to come back and destroy them if i could and take back my parents house maybe they watch too many holovids i dont know and are you wild for revenge i never wanted to be a baronne the only thing i want is my parents back and my brother she bit her lip wont happen in this life byerly turned to rish so are you a jeeves she eyed him then gave a short nod as if to say fair trade i was one of the baronnes created children and will always remain so all further loyalty treatments were discontinued after that scare years back the baronne said she didnt want her jewels to be damaged or suffer if she died unexpectedly i didnt know that said tej sounding surprised rish made a graceful turn of one blue hand though what she meant by it ivan could not guess you were six so what kept you from running off asked by she raised her chin and looked down her nose at him a neat trick given that she was shorter didnt you claim you were disinherited what keeps you from betraying your imperium by opened his hands as if to surrender the point so what other tasks did you perform for baronne cordonah besides babysitting rish touched her lips and gave him a peculiar smile living sculptures ah at receptions the baronne would position us jewels around the chamber and we would maintain various poses as still as marble for minutes at a time then shift to new poses after a while the guests invariably began to behave as if we were real statues none of them seemed to realize how very keen our hearing was or how good our memories we would compete with each other to see who could get the best tidbits to report to her at the end of an evening her gaze at by grew speculative but i think you know exactly how that works how freely people will talk when they take you for a block not so he returned her a reluctantly appreciative nod so what does it all mean asked ivan plaintively by cocked an eyebrow at him that seems a rather philosophical question to be coming from you no the name thing ivan gestured somewhat inarticulately at tej ajtejaswhatever from your das book he added conscientiously ivan in old russian means john in english dunno what john means come to think tej got a strange look on her face but answeredwas the deal still on akuti princess tejaswini radiantor maybe intelligent im not sure which jyoti flame or light princess radiant flame ivan tested this on his tongue hed attempt the other pronunciation later or princess bright light whichever princess in either case sounds like your da thought the world of you huh tej swallowed and looked away as if the far end of the room had suddenly grown riveting she answered in a wouldbepedantic quaver the geographical origin was supposed to be south asian stars was south european or south american or south something anyway or maybe it was the other way around we never spent much time on old earth history so what kind of a name is vorrutyer rish asked byerly possibly to give tej a moment to regain her composure he sat back looking surprised at the question or maybe just at its coming from her but answered readily the origin of the prefix vor is much debated except that it arose during the time of isolation and came to refer exclusively to members of the thenwarrior caste we are fairly certain that the rutyer was a mishearing or misspelling of the old earth german rutger tej back in control of her voice asked so what about vorpatril ivan cleared his throat not sure some say its british some claim it came from the greek or french maybe as a corruption of patros or some word like it a lot of barrayaran names got twisted around during the centuries after the firsters were cut off or shortenedserg from sergei padma from padmakar and xavs a contraction of xavier mutated over time makes sense said tej then paused to take in matching glares from both by and ivan why do you look like you just swallowed a bug the usage is precise a mutation is a copying error everyone knows that do not said ivan firmly use that term to a barrayaran its a pretty deadly insult to imply that someones a mutant even if youre just spelling their names oh tej looked baffled but said amiably all right if you say so by glanced at the time on his wristcom and muttered a curse i have to be somewhere else several minutes ago he dragged his hands through his hair and stood up his gaze swept ivan tej and rish all three i guess this is as good a bolthole for you as any other for now for how much longer asked ivan i dont know a day two days three i meant to play this out as long as i could in hopes of getting in beyond theos contact im making progress but were close to pulling the plug at which point ill need to vanish if i want to maintain my cover and my livelihood and my skin so until we meet again dear friends adieu with a wave that did not quite mimic an impsec salute by made for the door ivan accompanied him out in the corridor by lowered his voice if things go sideways ivan you should probably take those women to morozov they wont want to go they dont trust impsec by shrugged morozov could cut them a deal ill bet impsec galactic affairs would be happy to lap up whatever they wanted to spill about this syndicate of theirs or maybe more than they wanted we can discuss that later by strode off a tired man hurrying ivan sealed the door made sure it was locked and returned to his living room to find tej and rish deciding who was to have the first turn in the bathroom before bed ivan glanced at his wristcom and cringed to count the scant hours till komarran dawn i hate this strangled day length that is a strange man commented rish looking toward the door after byerly youre not the first to note that said ivan ruefully how did he get into his line of work ivan squinted wondering why that question had never before occurred to him i have no idea its not the sort of thing you ask these impsec fellows i think he was around twentystandard when he moved to vorbarr sultanahis parents lived out on the west coast tother side of the continent see he hung around on the edges of things for years before i ever found out about his impsec moonlighting the fact that he was estranged from his family never seemed to need an explanationthat is if you knew many vorrutyers the whole clan is umeither on the vivid side or downright antisocial ah said rish elliptically and went off to claim the bath ivan sat back down watching tej watch her friend pad silently away this couch would do for his bed if only people would let him lie here in peace for enough hoursbabysitter tejs laugh was no more than a puff of air through her nose i dont know that she exactly volunteered for the job i used to follow her around like a kitten chasing a string i was just fascinated by all the jewels when i was younger i would watch them at their dance practice and make them try to teach me too what kind of dance oh every kind they collected skills and styles from all over and were always trying to put them together in new combinations i wanted to be one of them to be allowed to really danceyou know in their performances but puberty was cruel to me on the contrary ivan thought puberty had been very generous to her he just managed to stop himself from saying so out loud converting it to how so the best dancers are all thin and small and strong very whippy like rish by age fourteen it was plain i was going to be built more like my dadamy other sisters all took after my mother willowy i just grew too tall too big too heavy too topheavy she sniffed as if in some weirdin ivans view anywayfemale selfdisapproval by age fifteen it was obvious that no matter how hard i worked i could never be as good as the jewels so i stopped gave it up said ivan thats no good just because someone else is some sort of natural flaming genius doesnt mean that youre an idium um doesnt mean that you should he tried rushing the notion should hide your light under the covers her smile grew wan my sister star said the only reason i wanted to perform with the jewels was to make myself the center of attention i expect she was right she hoisted herself wearily to her feet and went off to change places with rish shed forgotten to demand a trade watching her vanish into the shadows of the next room all ivan could think was actually yknowi expect you wanted to dance because you wanted to dance tej dreamed she was running through writhing space station corridors pursued by a nameless menace ahead of her the jewels scattered right and left leaping in grand jetes down crosscorridors flashes of red and green blue and obsidian gold and pearlwhite somersaulting in fantastical triple turns in the air but by the time she caught up the corridors were silent and echoing empty she ran on a side door slid open a voice hissed quick hide in here it was captain vorpatril he was wearing his green military officers uniform over a bear suit his chest was crisscrossed with bandoliers of power charge packs and he held a very large weapon perhaps a plasma rifle or was that a water gun he grinned at her from the round furry frame of the bear hood the gun went away and then they were kissing and for a moment or two the dream went good his kisses were expert neither too shy tickling annoyingly nor too invasive like someone trying to shove a slug down her throat but just right firm and exploratory tej noted this thinking ill have to try very hard to remember this part when i wake up i want to touch your skin she told him when they broke for breath its very pale isnt it is it smooth or hairy are you that pale all over do you have silver veins like pearl where was pearl here let me show you he grinned again and zipped the bear suit down from neck to crotch both fur and skin peeled away revealing glistening red muscle white fascia and the thin blue lines of veins no no just the fur tej cried in horror backing up not the skin too oh what said vorpatril in a tone of some bewilderment he stared down the bewilderment changing to dismay as the blackening crackle of a plasma arc burn spread out in a widening circle on his chest smoke and the smell of burning meat filled the air and then it wasnt vorpatril anymore but their illfated courier seppe back on fell station tej gasped and awoke she was in bed in the dark of vorpatrils flat rish lay in silence beside her unmoving unaware yet elegant even in sleep tej wanted to ask her where the jewels had been flying to but of course people didnt share each others dreams reciprocally tej wouldnt wish hers on anyone else certainly im glad to be out of that dreammost of it the beginning and the end were just like most of her dreams lately altogether too much like her real life the kiss though had warmed her right down to her loins hi there loins havent heard from you for a while the strange rushing noise at the edge of her hearing resolved itself at last as the shower it turned off and then she could hear rustlings from the bathroom and its attendant dressing roomcloset in a while a faint hiss sounded as the door slid aside but the captain had evidently turned off the lights before hed opened it so as not to disturb his sleeping guests or she wondered as his unshod footsteps wandered nearer to the bed something more sinister she opened her eyes turned and stared up at his shadowed shape he seemed to be fully dressed in his uniform again no bear suit his skin was firmly in place good masked by fresh soap and depilatory cream his scent was mildly aroused as was her own she supposed but fortunately rish was not awake to razz her on it what she breathed oh he whispered back sorry to wake you im just on my way out to hq but its still dark yeah i know damn nineteenhour days anything special youd like me to bring back tonight whatever you pick will be fine she said with some confidence all right ill try not to be so late this time but i never know whatll come up so dont panic if im delayed ill lock up behind me he made to tiptoe away captain vorpatril she hardly knew what she wanted to say to him but the dreamscent of burning flesh still unnerved her she settled on a vague be careful he returned a nonplussed uhsure the bedroom door closed behind him she heard him rattling in the kitchenette and then the sigh of the outer door and thenthen the flat sounded very empty tej rolled back over hoping for a sleep without dreams despite everything ivan managed to arrive at komarr downside hq right on time that morning half an hour before his boss was duethough more often than not desplains managed to bollix that schedule by arriving early ivan started the coffee sat at his secured comconsole grimaced and fired it up to find out what all had arrived in the admirals inbox since last shift ivan had developed a personal metaphor for this first task after the coffee of the day it was like opening ones door to find that an overnight delivery service had left a large pile of boxes on ones porch all marked miscellaneous in reality they were all marked urgent but if everything was urgent in ivans view they might as well all be labeled miscellaneous each box contained one of the following live venomous agitated snakes on the verge of escape quiescent venomous snakes nonvenomous garden snakes dead snakes or things that looked like snakes but werent such as large sluggish worms it was ivans morning duty to open each box identify the species vigor mood and fangcount of the writhing things inside and sort them by genuine urgency the venomous agitated snakes went straight to desplains the garden snakes were arranged in an orderly manner for his later attention the dead snakes and the sluggish worms were returned to their senders with a variety of canned notes attached with the heading from the office of admiral desplains ranging from patiently explanatory to brief and bitter depending on how long it seemed to be taking the sender in question to learn to deal with his own damned wildlife ivan had a menu of desplainss notes and it was his responsibilityand occasionally pleasure because every job should have a few perksto match the note to the recipient as he had both expected and feared an urgent of course note from impsec komarr with his full police interview of yesterday attached was nestled among this mornings boxes and the supply of venomous agitated snakes in todays delivery was disappointingly low after a brief struggle with his conscience ivan set the note in the gardensnakes file although he did put it at the very bottom of the list desplains was possibly the sanest boss ivan had ever worked for and the least given to dramatics and ivan wished to preserve those qualities for as long as he could forever by preference so every once in a while ivan let something trivial but amusing filter through to the admiral just to keep up his morale and today seemed a good day to stick in a couple of those as well ivan was still looking for a few more things he could legitimately enter when desplains blew in collected his coffee and murmured ophidian census today ivan all garden variety sir wonderful desplains took a revivifying sip of freshbrewed ivan wished he could remember which famous officer had once said the imperial service could win a war without coffee but would prefer not to have to what ever came of your interview with the dome cops yesterday i put the impsec note in file three sir file three was the official designation of the gardensnakes crate because after all sometimes desplains did suffer a substitute aide if ivan was on leave or out ill or requisitioned for other less routine duties and some shorthands took too long to explain i expect you will want to look at it eventually ivan made his tone very unpressing rightoh meeting with commodore blanc and staff in thirty minutes ivan reminded him i have the agenda ready very well snakes aweigh ivan hit the send pad on your desk now desplains raised his coffee cup in salute and passed into his inner office he would never ivan reflected ever want to be promoted to admiral to be greeted the first thing every working day by a desk populated entirely by live hissing snakes perhaps he could resign his commission if such a threat ever became imminent assuming he made it to that stately age without being courtmartialed a consummation depending closely in turn on his doubtful ability to avoid relatives associated with impsec bearinggift pythons gift pythons with snazzy reticulated blueandgold skins this time it seemed he bent to his comconsole and returned a crisp note to impsec komarr from the office of admiral desplains urgent memo received and the date stamp hold pending review chapter six tej get away from that edge said rish irritably youre making me nervous im only watching for ivan xav tej gripped the balcony railing and craned her neck studying the scurrying evening throng in the street far below shed had several false alarms already of foreshortened darkhaired men in green uniforms exiting the bubblecar station and turning in her direction but none of them had been the captain too old too young too stout too slight none with that particular rolling rhythm to his stride none bearing bags besides hes bringing dinner i hope rish crossed her arms tighter if only the baron and baronne had known they could have had all your parade of suitors offer you provisions instead of those high house connections tejs shoulders hunched i didnt want high house connections that was stars and pidges passion and eriks and the baronnes i thought there were enough arquas trying to build economic empires family dinners got to be like board meetings once they were all into it tej had long since given up trying to get in a word at meals without a crowbar certainly not about her own piddling interests which since they did not include schemes for house aggrandizement interested no one else there pidge officially named mercedes sofia esperanza juana paloma was tejs other older evensister born in the era before the baronne had finally made her spouse ease back on his inspirations or maybe shed hidden the book by the time the last few arqua offspring were decanted from their uterine replicators who knew the baronne always called her mercedes dada from the time shed started precociously talkingand never again shut up as far as tej could tellhad dubbed her little wisdom as a play on sofia but as soon as her other siblings discovered that another meaning of paloma was pigeon her family nickname had stuck well except when erik transmuted it to pudge to get a rise out of her which it reliably did did you get out safely pidge have you made it to your assigned refuge yet or did your flight go as sour for you as mine did for me her elder sisters had supplied tej with what she suspected was no more than the normal amount of adolescent hell but she worried for them now with all that was left of her shredded heart erikknowing that erik had not got out but not knowing how had supplied the stuff of nightmares both asleep and awake had he died fighting been captured and coldly executed tortured first however it happened hes beyond all grief and pain and struggle and regret now after all these months tej was beginning to be reconciled to that cold consolation if only for want of any other amiriher middle brother amiri was still safe as far as tej knew and your hardbought new life will not be betrayed through me thats an ironclad contract even if she made the deal only with her own overwrought imagination she rose on her toes and leaned out causing rish who stood well back with her shoulders snug to the wall to make a strained noise in her throat oh there he is and hes got lots of big bags tej watched that long stride close ivan xavs distance to the buildings entry till he turned in out of sight then gave up her spyvantage when they went inside rish locked the glass door firmly behind them vorpatril bustled in with the dinner and what proved to be sacks of groceries and cheerfully emptied them out onto the counter while rish rescued the restaurant containers and set the table its barrayaran greekie tonight he told the women wasnt easy to find got a tip about this place from one of the fellows out at hq a barrayaran greekie sergeant whose familyd been in the restaurant business back in his home district married a komarran woman and retired here set up shop it comes highly recommendedwell see barrayaran greekie asked rish brows rising in puzzlement the smallest of our main languages he told her the firsters actually arrived in four disparate settlement groupsrussian british french and greek as their home regions on old earth were back then over the centuries of the time of isolation everyone pretty much blended together geneticallyfounder effect you knowbut they kept up those languages which still gave folks plenty to fight about i think there were some more minor tongues as well to start but those got rubbed out in what you galactics call the lost centuries except we werent lost we were all right there it was just the nexus that got misplaced tej considered this novel view as he continued unpacking sacks including she was glad to see fresh fruit and teas and coffees and vatdairy cream and milk how many days was he planning for he added fortunately we kept a lot of the food styles modified but not mutated murmured tej indeed not but his lips twitched so her tiny joke hadnt really offended him good he drew out another large carton and folded the bag more instant groats theyre a traditional barrayaran breakfast food among other things i saw that little box in your cupboard i wasnt sure what a person was supposed to do with them oh is that why you werent eating them here let me show you he drew boiling water from the heater tap and mixed up a small bowl of the stuff and passed it around the table to sample as they sat to the new largess tej thought the little brown grains tasted like toasted cardboard but perhaps they were some childhood comfort food of his and she oughtnt to criticize them rish made a face though a bit bland dont you think you usually add butter maple syrup cheese all sorts of things theres also a cold salad with mint and chopped tomatoes and whatnot and they use them at weddings the greekie food as he dished it out looked more promising her first bites delivered some quite wonderful aromas flavors and textures how do they prepare your groats for weddings they dont serve them the grains get dyed different colors and sprinkled on the ground for the wedding circle and whatnot some sort of old fertility or abundance symbol i suppose it also seemed the food least likely to be regretted in that sacrifice a suspicion tej kept to herself ivan xav seemed much more relaxed tonight and she couldnt figure out quite why except for the lack of his strange friend byerly to stir him up she would have thought that the revelation of her true identity would have alarmed him more but maybe he disliked mysteries more than bad news this is all right he said leaning back replete when theyd demolished the greekie dinner when i rented this place to sample the solstice nightlife id forgotten just how short the nights were theres time to either party or recover before work but not both so staying in actually suits though not on your ownsome that would be dull he rose to go rummage at the comconsole my cousin told me about this dance thing you and rish might like to see if i can find an example do you have a lot of cousins tej asked leaning over his shoulder or just a lot of one cousin he laughed at that last both actually on my fathers side theres only my cousin milesnot exactly a cousin our grandmothers were sisters that part of the family got pretty thinned out during mad yuris war which came down soon after the end of the occupation ive halfadozen first cousins on my mothers side but they dont live near the capital and i dont see much of em ah here we go his search had turned up a recorded performance of the minchenko memorial ballet company from a place called the union of free habitats or quaddiespace tej had never heard of it but as the vid started up rish drifted in and said oh the gengineered fourarmed people baron fell had a quaddie musician once i saw a vid of one of her gigs played a hammer dulcimer with all four hands at once but she jumped her contract and left and no ones heard of her since i didnt know they could dance her face screwed up how do they dance with no feet free fall said ivan xav they live in it work in it dance in itmy cousin and his wife saw a live performance when they were out that way on er business last yeartold me all about it later very impressive they said dance the quaddies did it seemed in zerogee hand to hand to hand to hand singly in pairs but most amazingly in groups glittering colored costumes flashing through air the jewels gave the illusion of flying at timesthese dancers really flew wheeling like flocks of bright birds both rish and tej watched in rapt fascination rish putting in mutters of excited critique now and then and bouncing on the edge of her chair at especially complex maneuvers her arms waving in unconscious mimicry tej shared the sofa with ivan xav his arm laid out along the back crept nearer easing down over her shoulders till she was quite snugged in by it after a few moments of silent consideration she declined to shrug it off it threw her back into a memory of watching shows with dada in her childhoodhow patient he must have been with her choices in retrospectsnuggled into his warm side a stouter one than ivan xavs but smelling equally if rather differently masculine she wasnt sure if the recollection helped or hurt but there it was for a little hour some simulacrum of peace it ended soon enough when ivan xav turned off the holovid at the close of the performance and rish said so how long were you planning to stay on komarr captain vorpatril mm oh he sat up and tej edged regretfully away this whole dutythe annual inspections and conferencesusually runs about ten days or so ive been here um let me see his lips moved as he counted on his fingers seven nights so far including this one so not much longer i trust that by will be done with his business sooner though seemed like his pace was picking up so this safe housea graceful blue hand spiraledwill go away when you do uh he said im afraid so though i could book it an extra week for you buti figured to wait and see what by comes up with rish glanced significantly at tej ivan xav cleared his throat would you two consider making a deal with impsec i mean more than just with byerly i bet you know lots of things theyd like to share for suitable considerations tej grimaced if there was one lesson both my parents took care to pound into me its that its impossible to deal safely if the power differential between the two sides is too great the high side just skins and the low side gets stripped your impsec has no need to be nice to us well theyve no need to be gratuitously nasty either said ivan xav uneasily that i can see what if they decide they need to establish a fresh working relationship with the new house cordonah and that rish and i would make dandy bargaining chips i have nothing to stop them with nothing she choked down her rising tone refusing to turn her head toward the balcony that nothing would stop them too literally true look i know theyre all weasels over there at impsec but theyre pretty honorable weasels i thought they were a security organization said rish their honor has to consist of putting barrayars interests first ivan shrugged somewhat helplessly but did not deny this well think about it said tej meanwhiledo you want first claim on the bath captain you have to get up before us he glanced at the time and made a face i guess id better he looked as if hed like to stay and argue more but swallowed whatever hed been going to say and went off when the bedroom door had closed after him rish said was that a maybe yes well think about it or was that a no but we wont confirm it till we make it safely to the exit well think about it have you spotted a safe exit i havent rish set her fine jaw tomorrow i think we should run tomorrow as soon as he goes off to that hq of his the cash in his wallet would get us to another dome at least it would have to be one of the domes with its own commercial shuttleport that cut it down to a couple of dozen choices planetwide all larger arcologies which was a good feature but none were close tejs heart sank at the thought of another scurrying fearful journey among strangers from nowhere to nowhere in the vague hope that their lost houses enemies would look for themnowhere and are you sure were not being watched out for said tej are you sure he isnt watched for that matter rish shook her head i think we ran out of good choices a while back were now down to the leastbad tej rubbed her aching forehead ill think about it rish flounced in her seat a maneuver only she could imbue with such stylish censure and you have to stop cuddling that barrayaran its not as if you can keep him or take him along with us or whatever oh so its just me said tej you liked his weasel friend well enough even i could smell it did not rish denied i just thought he wasinteresting a walking human puzzle whoworks on human puzzles i suppose ferreting them out tej snickered apparently rish frowned he sure found us twice a disturbing observation tej was still thinking about the implications when her turn came for the bath the door buzzer sounded in the half light of dawn just as ivan was finishing dressing for work all but his shoes and kept on sounding continuously byerly in a toot strange hour for it it was too late for him to have been up since yesterday and far too early for him to be up for today ivan padded to the door and this time prudently checked the security vid yes by leaning on the buzzer and shifting from foot to foot maybe he really really had to go to the lav you wish ivan released the lock the door slid aside and byerly tumbled within and hit the pad to close it with his bunched fist ivan thank god i caught you he said we have a problem what a new one or just more of the same one we have already said ivan refusing to be stirred by bys histrionics at this hour he gave way as by surged down his short hallway beginning to rethink that stance already by never surged he sauntered or strolled or sometimes swayed or even evaporated but right now he looked downright condensed altogether too much here the two women awakened by this entry appeared through the door of the bedroom as ivan followed by in from the hall tej looked deliciously bedrumpled warm and soft but for her frown this was a woman who ought to greet each day with a sleepy seductive smile which ivan wished he knew how to supply hell i do know i just havent had a chance to rish was her usual sleek self concerned and fully alert mere seconds after being jerked from a sound sleep both women wore the tank tops they slept in and loose komarran trousers pulled on hastily rish spotted by and tucked her stunner back in her pants pocket tej wore no support garment under her top and the effect as she moved forward was wonderfully distracting not now ivan told himself part of himself the part with a single mind of its own whats going on asked rish theo vormercier has blindsided me said by bitterly when my hired goons didnt produce you instead of turning to me for my next solution he implemented his very own brilliant idea or so he thinks he turned your identities and descriptions over to komarran immigration services as illegal entries he figured to let them do the legwork of locating you and then snatch you somehow from incarceration after your arrests tejs eyes grew big rish just went very very still so said ivan theyre hidden for now no way for immigration to know theyre hereis there unfortunately immigration shares databases with the dome cops and your name which you so thoughtfully supplied them came up the immigration people will be on their way to check you first thing today theyll have to catch me at work again nobody home here right what if they break in to search asked tej uneasily theres no place to hide her gaze shifted to the balcony door where the first faint color in the sky was beginning to mute the city lights and she swallowed they have to have some sort of warrant said ivan beginning to share her unease i would think ivan those people issue warrants said by impatiently they dont have the broad powers impsec does but theyve plenty enough for this probably more than they used to have back when komarr was an independent polity they dont even have to break anythingthey can make the building manager open the door we have to get out said tej we cant let ourselves be trapped in here ivan had some sympathy for that sentiment even though the flat wasnt dark or constricted or wet also they werent alonemaybe they were overreacting really thats what i came to tell you said by wait no said ivan once they got away and lost themselves how would he ever find tej again the women had to be pretty good at hiding or they wouldnt have evaded their determined pursuers across four systems for what seven months or maybe by had a planhe wouldnt have come boiling in here without one would he some way to keep a string on them youll have to get your things together by began but was interrupted by the door buzzer two stern blats tej jumped and rish tensed by wheeled what the hell they cant be here already ivan nipped out to the short hallway and checked the security viewer unfortunately he recognized his visitors detective fano and detectivepatroller sulmona up bright and early or dark and late whichever fano leaned on the buzzer again and sulmona after another moment pounded on the door vorpatril she shouted through it answer your door no polite please with that ivan noted as by and the women came up to peer anxiously around his shoulders thats not immigration said by no its the dome cops same pair i talked to tother day would immigration have sent them no they have their own uniformed squads for this sort of thing there are procedures this must be something else another buzz longer sulmona pounded again vorpatril we know youre in there open up ivan hit the com and called why by winced fano drew a long breath we have a felony warrant for your arrest that gives us the right to break down this door if you dont open it arrest what the hell for i havent done anything kidnapping what said ivan outraged fanos jaw jutted we know you lied the security vids from the crater lake bubblecar platform finally surfaced they clearly show you and an unknown person escorting the missing nanja brindis into a bubble car she hasnt been heard from since the abduction charge is enough to get us in your door but the one im really after is murder but you know that dont you captain ivan was struck nearly speechless except for the wheeze of his hyperventilation dont open it whispered tej truly ivan didnt want to by and rish dragged him back to the living room for a hissed conference but i have to let them in said ivan harried in the first place its another felony not to and in the second place tej you can make the kidnapping charge go away by telling them i didnt abduct you i just invited you not to mention murder good god tej said we cant let them in theyll take us tell them through the intercom ivan suggested would that work how would they know you werent holding a weapon to her back asked by unhelpfully and dont you believe for a minute that prestenes agents cant whip us out of their custody before you can get back with help and anyway your help is worse said tej impsec id almost rather take my chances with prestene hey byerly protested rish turned in a complete circle gold eyes dilated reaching as if for some rope that wasnt there we cant get out theres no way out tej grabbed her hands stopping her rotation itll have to be the balcony after all oh rish im so sorry i led you into this whats on the balcony ivan began but was interrupted by a chime from his wristcom that particular tone wasnt one he could ignore he held up a hand wait and opened his link sir he said brightly vorpatril ivan rocked back desplains never bellowed uh yes what the hell is all this are you at work already sir no im in my quarters just received an emergency headsup from impsec komarr that dome security has filed a felony charge on my aidedecamp so i finally opened their memo that was no garden snake i can explain sir the door buzzer sounded again and more pounding muffled shouts later i have a bit of a situation on my hands right now ivan gulped and cut the com hed never cut off any admiral ever let alone desplains the pounding stopped more muffled voices weve got to block the door buy time said ivan time for what said by time for me to think of something that could take all day ivan shot him an irate look teeth clenching hard the couches said tej theyll be through the door codes soon enoughwe have to make a physical barrier the two women leapt to begin dragging furniture into the hall and propping it up against the door by looked as if he didnt think this would work but carried along by the fog of cold panic that seemed to be permeating the place fell into helping them nonetheless damn but rish was strong for her size ivan peered into the security vid the two detectives had been joined by four more people three men and a woman one man was the building manager the other three were in unfamiliar uniforms they appeared to be debating with each other comparing officiallooking forms displayed by their wrist holos unless it was some really arcane style of video arm wrestling dueling jurisdictions ivan shoved by up to look in the vid that wouldnt be immigration would it uh yes the building manager fumbled with a code key by opened his jacket and jerked out his stunner can you take down all six of them before they get you asked tej uneasily picturing her and rish escaping over a wall of bodies possibly including bys and ivans still peering by swore set his stunner on high and jammed it up against the electronic lock it buzzed angrily and after a long moment sparks shot out of the mechanism at least thatll hold the building manager said by a glint of strained satisfaction in his eye youve locked us in ivan protested and now i cant open the door good said rish heaving another heavy armchair atop the pile and wedging it in tight they all retreated temporarily to ivans emptied living room tej swung around stared deeply into ivans eyes gasped im so sorry it has to end this way ivan xav i know you tried and flung her arms around him ivan found himself holding what would under other circumstances be an absolutely delightful bundle of warm soft woman he opened his mouth to her frantic kiss nonetheless and his arms wrapped her in turn snugly and securely he wasnt sure what was happening here but o god dont let it stop she stopped pushed him away he managed not to whimper thats it she said simply and turned to take her blue companions hand with a nod toward the balcony its time rish rish nodded back face very grim they started for the door by uneasy moved to block the glass where do you think youre going by asked over the balcony but you dont have grav belts or anything said ivan tej wheeled back and raised her chin at him thats right but were twenty stories up yes that ought to be enough youll be killed rish stared at him in disbelief are you slow captain but the dome cops will think i flung you off or worse tej was plainly moved by this but steeled herself and said sternly if you havent got a better plan right now were going because later will be too late no yes what ivans wristcom chimed insistently he opened the link yelled not now sir into it and closed it again after a moment it chimed once more louder no override for this code by dont let them get out said ivan ran to the kitchenette ripped off his wristcom opened the refrigerator door tossed it in and slammed the door shut again the wristcom still whimpered but very faint and plaintive he turned back to the women and by who stood with his back tight against the glass both he and rish had their stunners out pointed at each other rishs was shaking in her deathgrip the new pounding from the hall was growing louder more disturbingly mechanical not just fists anymore the flats doors were designed to keep air from getting out in a domepressurization emergency not determined policemen backed up by building maintenance personnel from getting in what else had he just seen sitting out on that kitchen counterdont shoot ivan cried and dont jump i have an idea this held the tableau if only in morbid curiosity long enough for him to run back into the kitchenette and grab the instant groats from the countertop the large economysize box that hed purchased yesterday evening he ran back into his living room and brandished it thisll do the job youre going to throw cereal at them asked rish perplexed or shall we all sit down and have a hearty barrayaran breakfast together while the police break in asked by in an alltoosimilar tone but both stunners drooped shrugging off the sarcasms and dear god hadnt he had enough practice at that in his life ivan drew a long breath tej will you marry me what she said it wasnt a thrilled sort of what either that ought to greet such a proposal more of a haveyoulostyourmind what ivan cringed no thisll work a woman who marries a barrayaran subject automatically becomes a barrayaran subject its one of those fundamental oaths that underlie all other oaths biology before politics so to speak from the moment we finish speaking immigration wont be able to arrest you and the dome cops wont be able to arrest me either what he was going to do about desplains ivan was less sure his wristcom was still thinly chiming in its exile cold and lonely and far off ivan ripped open the box and began dancing sockfoot through the living room dribbling out a circle of cereal on the carpet dont we have to go somewhere and register it even for a simple civil match asked tej wed never make it to wherever theyll seize us as soon as we go out the door but not said rish blackly the other door by braced his back harder against the latch though he still stared confounded at the growing circle his eyes were as wide as ivan had ever seen them no thats the beauty of it ivan explained in barrayaran law the couple marry themselves its a time of isolation thing you wouldnt understand your breath is your bond you each prop up your secondyour witnesson the edge you step into the circle you speak your oaths you step out its done the core oaths are really simple though people gussy them up with all kinds of additions to stretch the ceremony out god knows why its usually racking enough he appealed for support tell them im right byerly actuallyby coughed swallowed found his voicehe is about the legalities anyway i can use my military dependent travel chits to get you back to barrayar ivan went on five jumps further away from your pursuers and besides once youre married to me youll have impsec totally on your side because um because thisll buy time and as soon as youve figured out what you really want to do we can go get a divorce in the counts court not quite as easy as getting marriedmy betan aunt thinks it should be tother way aroundbut count falcos an old friend of mameres ten minutes in and out i swear and youll both be on your way on our way where asked rish sounding confused i dont know somewhere i cant think of everything all at once you know oh so not a permanent but i dont know your oaths said tej faintly staring at him in a kind of hypnotized fascination as he stood before her waving the emptied box in time with his urgent persuasion thats all right i have them memorized i must have been dragged to about a thousand high vor weddings in the past decade i could probably recite them in my sleep or my nightmares we wont tell the dome cops about the divorce of course none of their business tej glanced toward the balcony toward him toward the balcony toward him why is this a hard choice from the hallway a teethgritting mechanical whine began as of someone cutting through an airseal door you cant tell me youd rather jump off a twentystory building and smash in your skull than marry me ivan went on desperately i am not a fate worse than death dammit or at least not worse than that death good god but what about rish asked tej her chin came up you cant marry us bothcan you uh said ivan he cast a beseeching look at by who held up his hand as if to fend off an attacking minidrone no said rish coolly thank you said by his expression grew inward for a moment i think ill ill illhire you for something after said ivan ladys maid lots of vor women have them mmother does i know at that point youll be properly employed by a barrayaran subject a vor subject and we can fudge it with immigration later from a safe distance then who will protect us from impsec said rish i will ivan promised recklessly i can call in some favors and if not i know people who can starting with mmothers gentleman friend if i have to or maybe as a last resort definitely as a last resort cant i by this last proposal left by standing like a mesmerized waxwork effigy but he did manage to make his mouth moveit was by of course he managed to make his mouth move i dont know if i want to watch when you tell your mother about this or flee the empire given that youre making me complicit as your second maybe old earth would be far enoughno farther than that he shook himself out of his paralysis and turned to the women much as i hate to admit it this notion of ivans would work temporarily its the longterm consequences that terrify me and after what you just did ivan went on to tej disregarding bys last comment you cant convince me that youd rather kiss the pavement than kiss me my mouth is still tingling not that youll have to kiss me if you dont want to totally up to you what happens after i hope that goes without saying more alarming thumps and crashes from the hallway rish wet her lips and said do it tej and well find out if it works soon enough were out of time to debate or for the tub she reset the safety and slipped her stunner back into her pocket in wordless acquiescence ivan held out his hand to tej tej will you please try this she rubbed her forehead and said doubtfully i guess so as the first acceptance to a marriage proposal that ivan had ever received in his life this lacked a certain something but she took his hand and stepped over the line of groats into the circle ivan pointed by rish you stand on either side facing each other youre the witnesses so watch i doubt ill be able to look away murmured byerly holstering his stunner as well and stepping up to his assigned spot itll be just like watching a monorail wreck rish rolled her eyesin agreement and took her place opposite all right ill go first said ivan to his bridetobe and then ill coach you through your part wordings about the same i ivan xav vorpatril being of sound mind and body thats for wills ivan muttered by i thought you said you knew this stuff ivan ignored him and plowed on do take thee uhwhat did you say your name was again by buried his face in his hands tej repeated it all of it do take thee akuti tejaswini jyoti ghem estif arquaand hed got the pronunciation right the first time and didnt even choke on the ghem part hah to be my spouse and helpmeet forsaking all others the core of the oath was only three sentences he got them out somehow and coached tej through her half do take thee ivan xav vorpatril to be my spouse her hands were shaking held in his so were his and thats it said ivan we now pronounce each other spouse and spouse before these witnesses and i get to kiss you again for the first time because before you kissed me right he locked himself to her lips rolling his eyes as by stepped forward and swept a break through the groat barrier with his shoe they swung out of the circle together byerly stretched his neck and pecked her on the cheek in passing and six irate swearing komarrans stumbled over each other out of ivans hallway and advanced upon them stunners at the ready ivan drew a wad of cash from his wallet thrust it into the startled rishs hand and added youre hired officially and as a uniformed woman reached out to seize tej who shrank away continued in a forceful bellow modeled directly on count falco unhand lady vorpatril chapter seven tej had spent days steeling herself for death this wrenching turn in her affairs left her stomach floating as if she had just jumped over that beckoning balcony except that this fall didnt come to an end she felt weightless like a drowning woman the mad captain seemed to have clamped a rescuing arm around her neck and be towing her along but was it toward some unseen shore or farther out into deeper waters she should have spotted that ivan xav was insane before this surely there had been clues but he had despite it all seemed so easygoing so affable so comfortable or at least unwilling to be thrust out of his comfortsa welcome rarity among the people in her life and then with no warning this maddest of all was that his ploy seemed to be working the komarran dome cops neither arrested him nor seized him to be carried off for some psychiatric observation byerly vorrutyer introduced as an acquaintance from vorbarr sultana and presenting valid identification blandly testified to the ceremony he had just witnessed pointing out the circle of groats ground into the carpet as supporting physical evidence rish backed him up if in a slightly choked voice there followed much frantic consultation of wristcom hololinks on the parts of both the dome cops and the immigration officers which apparently returned some very unwelcome answers ivan xav retrieved his nowsilent wristcom from the refrigerator and anxious to get to his military hq cut the attendant explanations quite short the dome cops were plainly not happy that the discovery of tej transmuted from kidnap victim to runaway bride had spoiled their hopedfor case against the barrayaran they retired thwarted and surly with mutters about subpoenas for material witnesses to be promptly forthcoming as they were still left with the puzzle of the budget ninjas on their hands but they couldnt arrest tej for being a crime victim the immigration people too retreated like a force planning a rematch but the important thing was that it cleared the doorway now except for a brief argument with the building manager about the damages vorpatril affronted pointed out he hadnt created the mess but impatiently shortcircuited the sting by telling the manager to put the repair costs on his rental charges the two tense barrayarans then gave tej and rish barely time to throw on street clothes and grab their most important possessionsnot many left of those by nowbefore hustling them out the wrecked doorway down the lift tubes and through the lobby outside vorpatril swung byerly aside and backed him up into a wall niche behind a tall potted evergreen she could hear very little of their rapid lowvoiced exchange over the street noise but it seemed to involve a lot of jawclenching and teethbaring under a flowing headscarf rish all but pricked her ears tej leaned toward the pair but only caught ivans xavs forceful you owe me and im collecting and as he finally eased back and released his unwilling auditor go do what you have to do byerly was more successful at pitching his voice not to carry so all tej had to go on was his body language shed never before seen someone swear quite so emphatically in body language but when they started again toward the bubblecar platform byerly hastened off in the opposite direction they were about to cross the street when vorpatril herded her and rish abruptly into the doorway of a shop not yet open spinning tej around to face himand she realized to shield him from view what is it she whispered acquiescing to the tactic as soon as she recognized it service security he muttered into her hair a whole patrol just came charging out of the bubblecar stationyep heading for my building all right two enlisteds a sergeant and a colonel hoo boy desplains must have dispatched them for me i wonder if they mean to rescue me or arrest mei think we dont want to stick around to find out they can have a nice long chat with the building manager he deserves it and itll hold em for just long enough i think come on hurry vorpatrils wooden smile and thisisallnormal posture didnt slip till hed bundled them into a bubble car and it was bowling along the route out to the military shuttleport he slumped in his seat and addressed himself to his wristcom with the caution of a man defusing a bomb at some return code he muttered in relief oh good hes got it on voice delay and continued more brightly admiral desplains vorpatril here sir sorry about the holdup this morning but i have the misunderstanding with the komarrans all straightened out nobodys trying to arrest me anymorehis lips silently mouthed i hope but i have one more short stop to make at impsec galactic affairs to settle a few details ill meet you and the horsemen out at dock six ill explain everything else when i get there he made to cut the com but then raised it to his lips and added please dont leave without me its important he blew out his breath then entered another code and made an appointment with someone named captain morozov to meet them in a few minutes at some lobby security desk tej and rish looked uneasily at each other thats your impsec person you mentioned who studies jacksons whole asked rish morozov yes good scout bit of a boffin but hes really interested you know i mean above and beyond what he has to be for his duties as an analyst which i suppose is what makes him a top boffin i thought id leave you two with him for the day you cant go back to my flatafter all that uproar this morning its gotta be smoked true said rish reluctantly but however you feel about impsec i can pretty much guarantee that nobodys rentagoons can get at you inside their hq but surely this captain morozov will want to know things said tej what should we tell him ivan xav shrugged everything hes even cleared to know about by though i doubt he doesnot his department even about thethe wedding thing he sighed ill tell him about that when they exited into the busy bubblecar station out by the shuttleport rish said i have to pee grabbed tej and towed her into the ladies lavatory vorpatril made frustrated gestures of protest but stopped short of following them inside they left him standing in the corridor alongside a couple of other males with glazed waiting expressions it didnt matter there was only the one door and no windows tej automatically noted as they entered a woman dealing with a wailing infant and another attempting to shepherd two hyperactive and notwelltrained toddlers through their ablutions gave plenty of sound cover and guaranteed that no one was paying them the least attention rish retreated to a corner and turned tej around strong blue hands gripping her shoulders talk to me tej you look like someone hit you on the head with a mallet and youre just waiting to fall down youre scaring me sweetling am i tej blinked i sure didnt see that blow coming i wonder if he really thinks he married me rish shifted her head and eyed tej narrowly as if checking to see that her pupils were still the same size do you think you really married him i have no idea i guess the important thing is that everyone else seems to tej took a deep breath and till we find out what all else this lady vorpatril business is good for wed likely better go along with it rish pursed her lips nodded and stood back releasing her worried grip point taken her mouth tightened so what are we going to tell this morozov fellow think sweetling think tej rubbed her forehead id be perfectly happy to feed everything we know about those house prestene bastards to barrayar if only i could be sure they werent about to become new best friends afterward though if the prestene syndicate is really on the other end of this smuggling scheme i think the barrayarans arent going to be too welldisposed toward house cordonahs new management i know even dada and the baronne took care how they crossed these imperium crazies its rumored that all of house ryoval was taken down by a single impsec agent after the old baron pissed barrayar off somehow rish whistled really thats the tale star told me anyway she got it from someone in house fell so i think tej wished she could think her brain seemed to have turned to mush i think we should tell this morozov almost everything bury him in details sos he wont have either the time or the motivation to move on to the fastpenta ah our story will be that the syndicate is after you as a flashy prize and me as a baby enemy they want to strangle in the cradle yes that had seemed to work for the byerly person and besides it was true hold back only anything about where amiri is anything about amiri come to think and dont volunteer anything about star and pidge or grandmama rish nodded understanding they both made quick dashes for the stalls returning to the station corridor before vorpatril overcame his social conditioning and came in looking for them although by the glare he cast them it had been a near thing crowded he inquired lots of little kids tej said truthfully i think they must have eaten straight sugar for breakfast that was the best deal yes truth just not all of it to ivans relief morozov was already waiting at the impsec galactic affairs reception desk when he guided the two women inside the lobby morozovs eyes widened as rish turned to face him but then he managed a boffiny bow lapis lazuli a visit to impsecs humble quarters by an artist of your caliber is quite an honor his lips parted in equal surprise as he took in tej and if i am not mistaken one of the misses arqua as well this is excellent vorpatril youre mistaken said ivan or anyway behind the times captain morozov may i present the new lady vorpatril morozov blinked three times and rose to the challenge congratulations to you both era recent happy event was this aboutivan glanced at the time on his wristcom ouch an hour ago he drew breath but its all right and tight and legal we had the groats and the oaths and the witnesses and everything which means she is now officially an imperial service officers dependent and rish is her um personal assistant in my employ officially i see i think morozov laced his hands together ivan wasnt sure if that lipbiting expression concealed dismay or unholy glee an officers dependent who some very unpleasant people have been trying to kidnap and maybe murder ivan forged on that got the analysts full attention ah i see we cant have that can we right so im leaving them with you for the day till i can get back downside and deal with uh everything they probably ought to stay in the building i thought you all could talk it would be my very great pleasure said morozov brightening right up tej and rish did not look nearly as thrilled as he did and no damned fastpenta ivan continued i think youd have to ask my husbandly permission anyway but just in case theres a question you dont have it my permission that is morozovs brows twitched noted erif i may ask a personal questiondoes your mother know about this marriage yet nobody knows about this marriage yet but thatll change soon enough one thing at a time im due to accompany desplains upside in oh god twenty minutes ago i hope theyre holding the shuttle morozov waved an impsec salute at him then i shall consider myself detailed to guard the new lady vorpatril from all harm until your return shall i please ivan turned away turned back and feed them theyll like that nobodys had breakfast yet he started off and stopped again but not rat bars ill send my clerk to bring up something from the cafeteria ladies will you come with me i can offer you coffee or tea in my office morozov gestured the uneasy women away down the corridor and continued in the tone of a town vor dame or possibly byerly vorrutyer at the most gossipy and im dying to hear all about your wedding lady vorpatril im sure this will come as a delightful surprise to all of captain vorpatrils friends ivan pushed through the doors and ran he made sure to make it that special bland run that said im late and in a hurry and not the wild bolt that said this building i am fleeing is about to explode because he didnt want to spread panic he had enough panic tamped into his head right now to blow up a battalion thisll work thisll work this had better work he found thanks be the admirals shuttle still waiting in dock six desplains and all four of the horsemen were aboard fuming with impatience the shuttle was already moving as ivan flung himself into the seat where the scowling desplains pointed and snapped his belts closed were off to inspect the flagship new athens right ivan wheezed so glad you remembered said desplains drawing a long breath for what promised to be a classic bolt of scouring sarcasm but ivan shook his head change it to the kanzian desplains stopped dead in midrantlaunch what the kanzian tell the shuttle pilot to dock at the kanzian desplains sat back eyes narrowing why because hidden somewhere aboard itor possibly clamped outside of itare several cargo pods full of equipment weapons and supplies stolen from the sergyar fleet orbital depot which their conveyors are no doubt trying frantically to camouflage right now in anticipation of our scheduled inspection tomorrow ivan nodded to the inspection team chief leaning over the aisle to hear this forget the rest thats what the horsemen should look for how do you know this vorpatril asked desplains i had a tipoff from an impsec agent impsec didnt tell me this was one of their lefthand men the sort the right hands dont talk to frigging weasels but hes known to me the reasons ive been late for work the past few days werent just personal ones sir are you sure of this very ihopeihopeihope impsec desplains sat back his scowl transmuting to his thinkingfrown scarcely less alarming i suppose you would know i do in this case sir adding id stake my career on it seemed redundant since he just had but you cant even hint where you got the tip sir there are impsec agents still on the ground in the matter who are at high risk till they get clear hmm there ensued rumbling and grumbling but the horsemen were good they had the new inspection plan roughed out before the shuttle slid into its docking clamps at the komarr fleet orbital station next to the kanzian captain morozov proved a disappointment to tej considering impsecs reputation he wasnt in the least scary by the time hed ordered in a gratifyingly substantial lunch the tale of her and rishs escape and subsequent odyssey across three systems was almost told the first nottooalarmed flight to fell station and then all their false sense of security blown to shocked bits when their bodyguard was shot the escape to the hegen hub the weeks turned to months of slipping from station to station around the hub like some sort of lethal shell gamebrief stressed frightening periods of motion alternated with long boring frightening periods of hiding the bad news catching up with them in agonizingly slow hammer blows the gradual relaxation of their months downside on the free planet pol almost sure theyd shaken pursuit till it turned up again the final flight to komarr with their every resource of money identity and resolution nearly tapped out she tried to hold back how their identity shifts had worked but since the fellow promptly guessed nearly every detail tej ended up being frank about all that as well morozov might not be properly intimidating but he was something better he understood tej discovered when he volunteered a few inviting anecdotes of his own during the lulls and hesitations that some years back he had actually been a junior impsec field agent in the whole they were all outofdate tales of amusing misadventures but tej began to sense that in the gaps lay some adventures that hadnt been so amusing nor misses no one is allowed to become an analyst without field experience he explained they are not at all the same skillset but when one is given the task of interpreting field reports its a source of considerable illumination to have once been the fellow writing them he seemed quite content with his headquarters job now though and perhaps the holovid of the middleaged woman with children tucked almost out of sight on his cluttered desk suggested why as they portioned out sandwiches teas and assorted deepfried vegetables and cheeses around the cubicle tej with editorial interjections from rish brought the tale up to the moment with a description of her bewildering wedding at dawn i wish i could have been a witness too said morozov his eyes crinkling that was quite a quixotic impulse on your er bridegrooms part well faint heart neer won fair lady i suppose i think it was his admiral calling on his wristcom that finally pushed him she swallowed the words over the edge and substituted into his inspiration when it wouldnt stop chiming he finally took it off and threw it into the refrigerator morozov choked on a bite of sandwich but really was all he said when he got his breath back is this admiral desplains of ivan xavs a um very important admiral chief of operations for the entire imperial service you could say so but it would be a charming understatement oh said tej soivan xavs not just some sort of military clerk you could say so morozovs lips twitched but it would be a charming understatement morozov finished his last bite leaned back in his station chair and tented his fingertips together i should likely explain i served several years of my apprenticeship in analysis at impsec headquarters in vorbarr sultana back when the legendary chief illyan was still running the place illyans at least was a name tej dimly remembered hearing on her fathers lips more than once usually accompanied by swearing she nodded uncertainly domestic affairs was never my department but one cannot serve long in the capital without acquiring some familiarity with the high vor scene did you know ivan xav there no we never met in person till the affair of his cousins clone brought him into my orbit some time later and why did that have anything to do with jacksons whole and which cousin am iare welikely to meet his cousin or his clone she hesitated is this the cousin miles he keeps talking about is he anyone important morozov squeezed his eyes shut briefly opened them to give her a rather pained look just how much has your new husband told you about himself not much i looked him up where maybe id better show you a few minutes at his comconsole found tejs database why ever did you look in a komarran database for barrayaran affairs morozov inquired mildly it seemedas if it would be more reliable would he take that as an insult morozov looked over ivan xavs entry and sniffed correct but incomplete and sadly out of date you shouldnt have stopped there mdear i ran out of time well morozov swung around again high vor family relations tend to be complex interlaced and mined before you set foot in them i strongly advise you to study up is ivan xav high vor then i thought he was justmiddling he acts middling tej was beginning to be peeved about that just what kind of a tricky deal had she landed herself in anyway oh yes said morozov as if that explained anything tej glared at him he held up a warding palm and suppressed a smile to understand captain vorpatrils peculiar position in the capital one must travel a bit farther up his family tree his mother is of good vor stock and certainly not to be underrated but its on his fathers side that things become interesting he said he was an only child so was his fatheror anyway he didnt have any siblings listed up farther than that captain vorpatrils fathers mother was princess sonia vorbarra who along with her elder sister olivia were the daughters of prince xav vorbarra who was the younger son in turn of emperor dorca vorbarra later called dorca the just and the younger halfbrother of emperor yuri later called mad yuri but thats another tale perhaps more than names out of history texts for the baronne or grandmama but mere distant tales to tej yuri had led the brutal and bloody rebellion against the occupation on the ground while his brother xav had run all over the nexus gathering offworld support for his forces not so much for barrayar as against cetaganda andum yesthat was the whole sum of tejs knowledge of them soivan xavs greatgrandfather was this really important prince and his greatgreatgrandfather was this really important emperor she looked suspiciously at morozov who had his hand pressed to his mouth his eyes alight with annoying amusement or is that another charming understatement it will do for now to bring it back to the present ivan xav vorpatril from the hour of his birth has been high on the list of potential heirspresumptive to the throne of barrayar should anything untoward god forbid happen to emperor gregor or he was till gregor married laisa toscane and the boys came along to many peoples relief a list is it a long list not especially though it still contains several latent opportunities for civil conflict first on the list has always beenah you see sonias elder sister olivia married count piotr vorkosigan who thus became the sire in turn of count aral vorkosigan who is the father of miles vorkosigan ivans notable cousin lord auditor miles vorkosigan now if you linger in vorbarr sultana for longer than ten minutes i can almost guarantee you will meet him but its always been realized by anyone with even half a wit that none of the vorkosigans would have touched the throne seeing as how lord miles was born so damaged should it have fallen vacant before gregor had sired his own heirs instead they would doubtless have swung their considerable weight behind ivan vorpatril and pushed rish was listening to all this like a blue marble stature tej hoped she was tracking the complications better than tej was tej had a hot date with a comconsole soon there could be no doubt homework tej hated homework no choice now the upshot of it all is that vorpatril has been a potential plot magnet for disaffected political parties all his life partially shielded by his cousins clan partially protected by his owni suppose i could describe it as notoriously nonferrous lifestyle pressures have eased off for him lately to a degree wouldnt ivan xavs mother have been anxious to promote him asked rish clearly puzzled by this maternal lapse or see him promoted anyway i gather that lady alys has always been much more anxious to protect him from risk her only child you see though she is a formidable woman had anything untoward ever happened to gregor i am sure thatafter first seeing those responsible properly hanged with all due ceremonyshe would undoubtedly have been drawn into guiding her son in his new duties i thought she was a secretary said tej faintly the database called her some kind of secretary she looked at morozov looking back at her in wonder charming understatement social secretary to the imperial residence official hostess for emperor gregor for decades now first assistant to empress laisa one of the most powerful women in the capital in her own quiet way i know chief illyan never underestimated her would ivan xav take her to meet his mother when they arrived in vorbarr sultana and if so should they perhaps tell her about the divorce before they mentioned the wedding while tej digested the implications morozov gathered up the lunch debris and set the tray in the corridor when he returned his thoughts had plainly shifted back to his own more immediate duties for he opened with a chatty and how ever did the baronne come to create you jewels rish it must have been a fascinating project for her and then it was time to gather what was left of her wits and evade again and push ivan xav to the back of her mind where he loomed like a very indigestible lump indeed just as ivan had hoped his arresting lure drew desplainss attention entirely off of the erratic personal affairs of his high vor aidedecamp for the next several hours especially after the first cargo pod was found in the process of being stashed under a fake antenna there followed a fire drill of the most chaotic service security everywhere surprised perpetrators playing hide and seek all over the ship the kanzian s captain out for blood livid with outrage and chagrin to discover that hed missed the criminal scheme taking place under his nose ivan faded into the background documenting and taking notes on the whole circus like the excellent admirals assistant he was at the end of the long day admiral desplains and the horsemen were being regarded by the kanzian s entire crew and most of the orbital stations personnel as possessing supernatural powers granted by some dark god and they wouldnt have been human if they hadnt enjoyed the effect at least a little bit desplains was almost mellow as he settled into his shuttle seat for the trip back to downside hq his gesture this time for ivan to take the seat across from him was more of a wave of friendly invitation the admiral leaned his head back against the seat in a moment of wellearned weariness but opened his eyes again and regarded his subordinate in some bemusement good work today ivan you do have your uses thank you sir and here i thoughtnever mind i owe you one ivan was good ivan was ivan when the admiral was pleased with him vorpatril when the mood was neutral and captain when desplains was irritated this was probably the best opportunity ivan would get to broach the next subject also given the short duration of the flight the only opportunity so go he took a deep breath im glad you think so sir as it happens i am in need of a somewhat personal favor just at the moment not unrelated to this his wave around reminded his listener of the kanzian coup just bagged oh desplains knew better than to offer a free pass in advance but his benign tone and nod invited ivan to go on i need a permission to get married and approval for two passages from komarr to barrayar for service dependents desplainss eyes flew wide ivan this is sudden you never breathed a wordis it some komarran girl nothing wrong with that of course quite the fashion these days butdoes your mother know about this backdated to yesterday ivan forged on before the admiral could build up any more elaborate fantasies of secret interplanetary romances in his mind desplains went still sat back continued in a much cooler tone i see when did these nuptials actually take place vorpatril not captain yet ivan still had turning room at dawn this morning sir so i suppose a permission dated to today would also do but there will hardly be time before we land downside i think you had better begin at the beginning i intend to sir ivan marshaled his thoughts trying to figure out how to put as much of the culpability on byerly as possible traditionally ops had no objection to criticizing impsec for any screwup from minor to monumental yes blame the absent always a good plan the beginning would be three nights ago when the impsec deep cover agent came to my flat and asked for my help it was almost komarran midnight when ivan at last made it back to the impsec galactic affairs building where the night clerk assured him morozov was still in his office very late isnt it sir ivan declined to respond to this invitation to drop tidbits which disappointed the clerk but did not surprise him the door to morozovs cubicle was open spilling light into the corridor and ivan was heartened to hear rather cheerfulsounding voices he arrived to discover morozov and his two guests perched variously in the debris disemboweled food cartons spread all over and deflated soda bulbs piled up deeply engaged in some sort of gamea brightly colored if rather tattered box lay open on the floor and each player manned a vid board balanced on their laps as ivan walked or rather picked his way inside something beeped and twinkled tej hooted morozov groaned and rish grinned like an evil blue elf tej was the first to look up she cast him an oddly penetrating glance ivan xav youre back sorry it took me so long i have some guest quarters arranged for us tonight here in the hq compound so its only a step over to bed nothing fancy but safe looks like you got dinner uh have you been all right here seemed to be a question already answered whats the game great house said tej its an old jacksonian childrens game i used to play it when i was girl with my sibs and the jewels but they always beat the pants off me unless i cheated though youre allowed to cheat each player starts with a small stake morozov explained and the object is to deal with and against each other till the winner ends up owning the virtual world it can be played with only two people barely but its far more interesting with three or more its not often that i get a chance to play it with actual jacksonians he added after a moment ive lost five rounds straight i suspect collusion rish smirked thank you for staying so late ivan began but morozov waved this away its been a very enjoyable day quite a nice break in my routine the impsec analyst rose with a groan and stretched i concede you two can wrestle it out for second and first the two women eyed each other bared teeth and bent to a flurry of beeps and twinkles morozov jerked his head at the doorway and followed ivan out they moved a few steps down the corridor beyond earshot of the cubicle i like your new wife captain vorpatril said morozov uh thanks only temporary though you know so she explained morozov smiled at his shoes did you get anything useful out of the day from impsecs viewpoint that is from your interrogation interrogation oh nothing so crude among friends or cultural relativesinlaw we just had one delightful riveting conversation after another you must get her to tell you the full tale of her flight from the wholeit sounds to have been a ghastly adventure in all i quite hope it may have a happier ending than beginning er said ivan we really havent had much chance to talk yet so i gathered morozov rubbed his neck his voice took on a more serious tone everything the pair of them told me that i already knew about checked out well allowing for point of view and so on so i have a high degree of confidence in the new information they purveyed as far as it went ivan waited for it then grew impatienthe was exhaustedand prodded but tej began by withholding details about her family reasonably enough but just about everything i could want to know and more about the arqua clan has come out in the last three hours of great house very valuable game lively too who won ivan suddenly realized could be a question with more than one answer morozov slipped from serious to grim my considered professional analysis is that the syndicate that seized house cordonah is going to keep on coming its plain they still fear a countercoup they want these womenalive probably dead in a pinch each arqua they can obtain gives them a stronger handle on the outofreach remainder youd best be prepared ah ivan swallowed he tried to figure out what that meant then realized he had a top figurerouter standing right in front of him use your resources for what exactly smallscale kidnapping teams most likely deploying all sorts of tactics including deception import teams have greater logistical challenges but are known quantities to their handlers local hirelings blend better and know the ground any successful abduction must fall into two halves seizing the victimswhich actually may be the easier partand their removal beyond the imperiums boundaries somebody kidnaps my wife and theyll find the imperiums boundaries can stretch a hell of a long way ivan found himself thinking with unexpected fierceness wait no this thing with tej was only a temporary ploy not a real marriage well no it was a real marriage that is a legal marriage that was the whole reason why it had worked but not permanent nothing to be alarmed about there anyway it was surely allowable to shoot kidnappers regardless of who they were trying to carry off right ill be escorting them both on to barrayar in little more than a days time said ivan they should be safe out here at komarr hq till thendont you think commercial or military ship admiral desplainss jumppinnace actually he was kind enough to assign me some spare berths wedding present he said that should be exceptionally safe i imagine it will take their pursuers some time to regroup after the ah curve ball you threw this morning i dont think that could have been anticipated in anyones schemes including mine meanwhile said morozov id think you as the ladys new husband would be as closely placed as humanly possible to find out more eh puzzles i hate puzzles ivan liked flowchartsnice and clear and you could always tell just where you were and what you should do next everything laid out neatly no ambiguities no traps why couldnt life be more like flow charts morozov went on jovially after all a man who cant persuade his own wife to trust him is a man in trouble in many ways so many ways ivan could only nod chapter eight the military compounds guest quarters proved to resemble a small faintly shabby hotel designed to temporarily house officers dependents or civilian contract employees either in transit to elsewhere or downside on komarr for duties too brief to billet them in permanent housing its security tej judged was only fair but still vastly better than anything shed had to rely upon lately and it didnt feel like a prison ivan xav escorted tej and rish to a clean if narrow chamber with two beds and yawning himself went to ground in a room directly across the hall as tejs very first wedding night ever this would have left something to be desired if she hadnt been so exhausted by the disruptions of the past days as to fall asleep nearly as fast as she could pull up her covers when they awoke the next morning ivan xav had already gone off to aidedecamp his admiral some more though he left a note of reassurance scrawled on the back of a flimsy and shoved under their door captain morozov turned up to escort them to a long chatty brunch in a private room off the impsec building cafeteria where he asked yet more uncomfortably shrewd questions seeming as satisfied with the evasions as the answers which was a bit disquieting on reflection in the afternoon a uniformed enlisted man arrived with all of their and ivan xavs remaining possessions from his rental flat and dumped them on rishs bed to be sorted out minus the groceries evidently abandoned tej would rather have liked to have kept the emptied groats box for a souvenir tej sat herself down at the rooms little comconsole and began to try to study up on barrayaran history which the barrayarans appeared from a first glance to have made far too much of rish trammeled by the confined space as usualthese past months had been especially hard on herstarted her dance exercises or as least as many of the thousandmoveskata as she could fit into the constricted area she had wandered into their tiny bathroom to practice the neck face ear eye and eyebrow movements in front of the mirrorten reps eachwhen a hearty knock on the door shot tej from her chair and almost out of the window only one floor up now so unlikely to be lethalhad ivan xav arranged that in any case it was his voice that called hi tej you in there trying to calm her pounding heart she went to unlock the door he stuck his head in and said saddle up ladies our shuttle awaits so soon said tej as rish came out of the lav hey you two may have slept in but its been a long day for me no i mean i thoughti thought this thing with the smugglers might have thrown you off schedule its service securitys problem now thats what delegation is for theyre scrambling like mad to cover their lapsethis is the sort of rattlesnake theyre supposed to hand to desplains neatly pithed pinned on a card and labeled not the other way around very disorienting for em though all of their further reports will doubtless catch up with us en route travel time with the boss is not break time alas he gathered up his delivered gear and went off to pack his duffle the ride up to orbit on the military shuttle felt like escape from a deeper pit than just a gravity well tej stared out her tiny window scabrous patches of green terraforming clung like lichen around the barren poisonous planet and the lights of the dome arcologies strung like bright beads along the faint monorail lines made promises for the future but not for the now for someone whod spent as much time growing up on space installations as tej solstice dome ought to have felt spacious but it hadnt if a place wasnt going to be a proper station it ought to be a proper planet but komarr had seemed to be something caught between i dont know where im going but this wasnt it was she going to have to sort through the entire nexus by process of elimination to find her final destination i hope not the shuttle docked and ivan xav led them on a very short walk through the military orbital station to another portal a zerogee float through a personnel flex tube gave tej a bare glimpse of a ship about the size of a rich mans yacht but not nearly as cheerylookingan effect of the warty weapons housings studding the armored skin perhaps the tube spat them out into a small hatch bay neat but decidedly utilitarian three men awaited them an armed soldier in ship gear an unarmed enlisted man in a plain green uniform and a spare grayhaired man in a lessplain green uniform like ivan xavs he did not particularly exude arrogance but tej recognized how a person stood or moved when they owned the place and this man did it hardly needed ivan xavs salute and admiral desplains sir to identify him may i present to you my wife lady tej vorpatril and her personal assistant lapis lazuli also known as rish the admiral returned the salute in a more perfunctory manner his polite smile broadened into something more genuinely welcoming or maybe that was just genuinely amused as he looked over his guests somebody must have warned him about rish for he didnt gawk lady vorpatril miss ah lazuli welcome aboard the jp my ship has no more memorable name im afraid tej gathered her wits enough to return thank you for inviting us sir and didnt correct rishs address a chief of operations wasnt exactly a house baron more like a senior house security officer but it might be well to treat him just as circumspectly i understand you were of material aid in helping us trap our homegrown smugglers yesterday desplains went on not at all sure what ivan xav had told him tej tried smiling mysteriously and murmured they were no friends to me or mine so captain morozov gave me to believe said desplains oh of course morozov had to be reporting to someone their chats hadnt been just for his entertainment or his backfiles however much he managed to make one feel so has morozov much special training in interrogation tej asked belatedly curious actually he trains interrogators said desplains one of our top men you know he dragged his gaze back up to her faceso old but not dead though tej had trouble estimating barrayarans ages i begin to see why captain vorpatrils chivalrous inspiration took the form it did lady vorpatril i suddenly realize his duties with me have not left you much time together since your wedding yesterday ah morning was it not any she confirmed she tried a doleful look on him curious to see what would happen it won a quirky smile anyway we shall have to find some way to make it up to you in the meanwhile ivan show our guests around the ship and give them the safety drill he made a motion to the enlisted man who collected their bags tej and rish parted reluctantly with theirs till ivan xav whispered opaquely but reassuringly admirals batman its all right as they left the hatch bay desplains and the other bent their heads together in some conference the ship was small and the tour brief as the engineering and navandcom areas were evidently offlimits while they were about this tej more felt than heard the faint thumps and clanks that told her they had detached from the station and were on their way already the amenities were few a kind of dining roomgathering place that ivan xav dubbed the wardroom a small observation lounge a compact but wellequipped exercise room that rish eyed with interest tej guessed a crew of less than twenty split among shifts and a capacity of perhaps a dozen passengers maybe twice that in an emergency the jumppinnace was bigger and slower than a fast courier but not by much getting lost on board was not going to be a problem or even an option ivan xav focused on escape routes and emergency pods and equipment howtos and conscientiously made them both go through the entire pressurizationorotheremergency safety routine till he seemed satisfied that they understood it do you do this for passengers a lot asked rish freeing herself from a breath mask and handing it back we carry highranking nonservice supercargo from time to time depending on the mission or the admiral sometimes includes his family on these more routine jaunts but they had other things going on at home this week have you worked for desplains long asked tej about three years he brought me along with him when he was promoted from admiral of the home fleet to chief of operations two years back the batmanperson appeared if you will come this way captain lady vorpatril miss lazuli he led them down to the end of a short corridor an airseal door labeled admiral desplains slid open at his touch on the pad inside was a tiny suitea sitting room and two bedrooms with a connecting bath one bedroom had four neat bunks the other boasted a double bed their three bags and ivan xavs duffle waited placed ambiguously on the floor of the sitting room admirals compliments lady vorpatril maam but he begs you and the captain will accept the use of his quarters for the duration of the journey he says the space is underutilized without madame desplains or the children along which indeed it is the batman pointed out a few basic features and bowed himself out with a murmured there is a call button on the wall if you require anything more but i trust i have provided most of the necessities ivan xav stared around seeming vaguely stunned huh guess im forgiven then he pulled himself together peeked into both bedrooms in turn wheeled to the women and said ertake your pick tej and rish looked at each other rish said excuse us a moment grabbed tej by the arm and dragged her into the bunk room letting the airseal door slide closed behind them quit smirking said rish tej chirped oh but how nice ivan xavs boss has given us the honeymoon suite it would seem a shame to waste such a grateful gesture dont you think rish ran a hand over her platinum pelt in a harried swipe blue ears twitching all right i can see how it might be a good deal if he pairbonds to you maybe not so good if you pairbond to him dont lose your head sweetling tej tossed her curls its only a practice marriage so i ought to get in some practice dont you think and quit prancing too its not like hes an allowed suitor that call button wont bring in a brace of the barons bodyguards to eject him from your bedroom if he displeases you theres only me and while there are places where id back myself to take him on this isnt one of them this ship is barrayaran bow to bulkhead with no place to run hes allowed if i allow him tejs voice went bleak who else is left to make that call rish rish took a breath but let it out slowly unused i know this isnt a deal from strength but here we are said tej for the next six days and afterward too for some unknown amount of time theres no harm in setting up a basic biological rewardloop as a minor safety net you know i wont mistake it for anything more tej hesitated although how you can look at what dada and the baronne had and dismiss it as minor i dont know exception that proves the rule sweetling rish paced the floor two steps each way oh hell go on and have your treat maybe itll be the fastest cure for this madness tejs smile tucked up irresistibly not for himill wager my training on that anyway his admiral practically handed him to me giftwrapped and you know how i like opening presents this pulled a reluctant chuckle from rish she thumped a fist gently into tejs shoulder in that case break a leg preferably one of his not one of yours nothing so violent they went back out to the sitting room where ivan xav was standing with the glazed look of those men whod waited outside the womens lav except that the fingers of his right hand were drumming rapidly on his trouser seam he jerked to attention with a weird twisted smile so whats the verdict rish will take the bunk room said tej and you and i will take the other room his mouth opened closed opened again thatsounds great but you know you dont have to do this if you dont want to of course if you do want to thatsthats just great rish rolled her eyes picked up her bag and withdrew to the bunk room calling good night good night to all a good night i claim first dibs on the bath though barely seeming to hear this ivan xav blinked at tej and said and the other good thing is that on board here were back on fleet time which is vorbarr sultana time twentysixpointseven hour sidereal day you know with the night proportional makes for a much more leisurely evening unexpectedly he stepped forward wrapped an arm around tejs waist and swung her around like a dancer and down onto the rooms little sofa bolted to the floor in case of artificial gravity mishaps how do you do lady vorpatril im so pleased to meet you yes i can tell already tej did not say out loud hi there lord vorpatril what was he a lord of anyway she would have to find out later say my whole name bet you cant his chin jerked up at the challenge lady akuti tejaswini jyoti ghem estif arqua vorpatril tej impressed raised her brows youre a fast study ivan xav when i have to be one finger went out to tease a curl from her forehead then hesitated erhow old would you happen to be tej i mean you look maybe twentysomething standard but jacksonians all that body modificationcetagandans all that genetic manipulationcould be anything from ten to sixty i suppose as it happens i am just turned twentyfive oh whew what would you have done if id said ten she asked curiously cried and turned you back over to your babysitter or sixty now that i could have dealt with older womenits a fantasy yknow or can be have you ever fulfilled that fantasy idont think this is the time to go into my past yknow tonight should be all about you his voice was growing smoother more confident but then he hesitated again ahgreat house barons treasured daughter and all i expect you led a very sheltered life huh very protected lots of armed guards and all that yes till the house fell he tilted his head back and forth as if thinking or puzzling uhi need to ask this dont mean to embarrass you or anything and any answer is fine as long as its true because i kind of need to know are you still a virgin good heavens no not since age fifteen oh was it fifteen for you too i mean oh good thats not a problem for me i dont have any of that timeofisolation baggage about marrying a virgin that would be hypocritical after all especially for a temporarythoughlegal marriage easier the other way around anyway really he paused again contraceptive implant also since age fifteen she assured him ah he smiled beatifically and closed in for a kiss it was a good kiss quite as good as her dream or better she snaked her fingers up between them to deal with his first button the flattering uniform seemed to have rather a lot of them for the first time his hand strayed below her shoulders in a tentative reverent touch good he wasnt going to be grabby so what happened when you were fifteen she asked during their next break for air was it a positive experience this surprised a laugh from him and a look of fond reminiscence i was a desperately randy adolescentalmost any experience would have seemed positive but yes i guess it was she was one of the girl grooms at my greatuncles stables down at the long lake a summer fling at a summer place pretty damned idyllic really i thought i seduced her but in retrospect i realize she seduced me older woman yknowshe was nineteen dear god but i was a clumsy young lout but fortunately or maybe it was mercifully she didnt trample on my young ego though she would probably have had to gallop one of the dressage horses across it to make a dent i was so chuffed with myself tej laughed at his laughter pleased for his covertly tender former self a finger ran lightly over her cheekbone tracing its curves he started to speak shook his head but then as if he could not help himself asked and you i hope you werent afflicted with a clumsy and selfabsorbed young lout by no means the baronne wanted to make sure we knew what we were aboutme and my siblings and the jewels so she imported an eminent team of licensed practical sexuality therapists from the betan orb for us for erotic arts training a man a woman and a hermaphrodite they stayed two yearsi was so sorry when they went back home it was the only thing i was ever better at than my sisters the hand stopped he made a weird little noise down in his throat that she was completely unable to interpret ive never been to the orb he said at last in a faraway voice my cousin miles has been there though he wont talk about it mark and kareen have been there hell even commodore kou and madame drou have been there well ive never been there either she said except by proxy i suppose but i did like the arts they meshed well with my perception drills it was like dance in a way for a little while you live in your body in the now not all up in your head all torn between the past and the future and missing the moment that gentle hint brought him back to the now the hand began to move again i had two allowed suitors after that she went on but they didnt work out theres another fortunatelyinretrospect for you allowed suitors i dont know whatis that a jacksonian term you dont have allowed suitors on barrayar she asked he shook his head she couldnt say she was surprised merely surprised at his ignorance its for when one is considering some sort of house alliance by marriage try before you buy and im glad i did the first was plainly far more interested in house politics than in me when i told him that in that case maybe he should go to bed with my father instead he wasnt too pleased and nor was i the otheri dont know there was nothing wrong with him i just didnt like the way he smelled did henot bathe ivan xavs arm made an abortive jerk as if he thought but then thought better of trying to sniff his own armpit no he was perfectly hygienic just not i dont knowcompatible the baronne suggested later that maybe our immune systems were too similar but that didnt seem quite right to me i thought he was just boring oh said ivan xav she took the opportunity of his distraction to unwrap his shirt a few more buttons ah nice chest hair not too much not too little a fine masculine dusting the dark color made a pleasing aesthetic contrast with his pale skin and she made sure to savor it one should notice ones partners gifts and let them know one was pleased or so her erotic arts training had emphasized she curled a bit of hair over her finger in signal of appreciation and danced her fingertips down his torso the bunk room door slid open partway and he flinched at the slight noise rishs voice floated out showers yours im going to sleep now so close both doors between when youre done eh the door slid shut firmly rish has very sensitive hearing said tej but she sleeps like a brick ah said ivan xav faintly well its been a long day perhaps id better hit the lavuh unless youd like first crack or we could share the shower her fingers twirled some more he shook his head in regret not this one its only a sonic and two people wouldnt fit he brightened but when we get back to my place in vorbarr sultana i know that umanother time they should have taken advantage of the amenities back in his solstice flat but how were they to have known timing the best chances of life all ran afoul of timing he kissed her again then peeled himself away lips last when they rendezvoused again in the bed most of the unwrapping was already done to tejs mild regret but perhaps there would be other occasions she slid between the sheets he had warmed clean sheets she noticed in appreciation a thoughtful touch from the busy batman at a guess ivan xav rolled over and up on one elbow his hand hovering uncertainly over her as if he didnt know where to begin she smiled up at him are you shy ivan xav no he denied indignantly its justive never made love to a wife before i mean to my wife a wife of my own not having had one i dont know how a few words in a groat circle can make what should be familiar feel very strange all of a sudden power of suggestion or something she rolled up on her own elbow to free a hand to reach his face trace the bones beneath the skin good bones her body shifted with the motion and then he wasnt looking deep into her eyes anymore but he was looking pupils wide and black noticing gifts with due reverence neednt always take the form of speech she was reminded i always kept it light yknow he gasped i can do light she said leaning in my name means light he leaned to meet her soso illuminate me he breathed and then there was much less talking the admirals batman brought breakfast on a trolleynot intending it to be indolently consumed in bed ivan suspected but rather to make sure ivan was out of his in a timely fashion the military servant knocked politely on both bedroom doors and set up the meal in the sitting room effacing himself promptly as soon ivan also suspected as hed ascertained who had slept with whom last night the better to report that intelligence back to their mutual boss desplains had very obviously left it up to ivan and his guests to sort themselves out but he had to be curious as to the results ivan feltchipper he decided was a good word remarkably chipper he put himself together in immaculate military order waved to rish who was blearily sucking tea kissed his wife goodbyemake that his beautiful bedrumpled exquisitely edible wife who to cap his enchantment did not appear to be chatty in the morningsand chippered off to work approximately twelve steps down the corridor to desplainss onboard office adjoining the ships compact tactics room desplains was there before him not unexpectedlythe admiral found the constraints of jump travel minus combat boring and unless madame desplains was along worked longer shifts to fill the time since this often resulted in his generating yet more things for his subordinates to do it was one of ivans duties not mentioned in the manual to make sure he didnt extend those hours indefinitely but this shift ivan felt ready to wrestle a thousand snakes he greeted the admiral with a snappy salute and a good morning sir and fell to desplains merely raised a brow they slid at once into the practiced routine ivan triaging the messages coming in semicontinuously over secured tightbeam shooting notes back and forth the occasional spoken query or order returning memos messages and orders in a steady stream back to komarr operations or ahead to ops hq in vorbarr sultana still five flightdays away as ivan had anticipated the uncovering of the theft and smuggling ring had generated a load of new traffic though not yet the interesting explosions that would no doubt ensue when word had finally made it all the way to commodore joles sergyar command and back ivan said desplains about an hour into this sir stop whistling you sound like an air leak sorry sir didnt realize i was doing that so i eventually concluded when the first wormhole jump came up ivan took a break to warn the ladies which was when he discovered that both were susceptible to jumpsickness rish far more than tej he then pulled off the worlds easiest heroics by popping to the infirmary and collecting jump medicationthe admirals ship carried the good stuffand handdelivering it though tej had to forcibly excavate the whimpering rish from her bedding to administer her dose five jumps in five days why did i agree to this she moaned but within twenty minutes she was sitting up blinking in agreeable surprise reconciled once more with her inner ears her stomach her vision and apparently her hearingunpleasant auditory hallucinations from jump sickness were a new one to ivan all he ever experienced was a brief twinge of nausea and having everything appear to turn green requiring him to remember to use caution in interpreting indicator lights for about a minute he returned to work intensely aware that mere meters away a pocket paradise awaited at the end of the shift desplains cordially invited ivan and his female entourage to join him for dinner which was laid on privately just the four of them in the little observation lounge while ship food was not elaboratedesplains was an indifferent gourmetivan detected the hand of his loyal crew in fresh produce picked up before theyd left komarr and ivan himself had long ago made sure that the admirals allbarrayaran wines were something to be proud of and the batmans service was impeccable observation lounge proved an apt description as ivan quickly became aware that desplains was using the opportunity to study ivans new bride and her companion well evaluating personnel was one of the mans jobs after all tej did quite well ivan thought it occurred to him that a jacksonian great house might be notdissimilar to a district counts household with its demands for the regular entertainment of assorted business associates and odder guests and a lot of potentially hazardous politics going on under the table she certainly had the howtomakesmalltalk and whichforktouse down smoothly desplains drew her out on her recent flight avoiding the most distressing parts because this was after all dinner a few of her stories were unconsciously hairraising but mostly they were neutraltoopaque morozov might have done some groundwork there unconsciously supplying her with clues of what to say to barrayarans and she hadnt missed the turns rish more wary spoke less in any case desplains seemed to have enjoyed the diversion and the company for the invitation was repeated on succeeding evenings with various of the ships crew gradually added in as shifts permittedthe captain the offduty pilots the chief engineer and desplainss physician because the admiral traveled with his own as per service regs but by whatever mercy desplains did not let the meals stretch too far into the night for which ivan was intensely grateful during the dayshift hours when ivan was closeted with desplains tej seemed to be reasonably content reading and watching vids or primping or playing games with rish the crew of jp were among the more sophisticated fellows the service could supply and any comments they had to make on rishs boggling physical appearance they at least kept out of her keen hearing rish made heavy use of the exercise room first alarming and then impressing some of the crewmen who shared it she somehow discovered three more addicts of komarran holovid dramas and ganged up with them during their offduty time to obtain fresh episodes snuck in during slack periods in the tightbeaming at one of admiral desplainss suggestions tej also discovered the onboard language tutoring programs and dipped into the barrayaran dialects of russian french and greek none of which she claimed to have been taught before or plunged into ivan thought when he ducked his head in to check her progress so far from a trudge she seemed to find the task tolerably amusing oh languages arent work she explained cheerily theyre a game now economics thats boring she made a face at some pedagogical memory ivan couldnt guess at for almost the first time ivan saw a glimpse in her of her haut genetic heritage not only in the scary speed of her acquisition but the purity of her accent as she wandered around the ship to find bemused bilingual crewmen to practice upon her komarran accent had certainly fooled him and presumably the komarrans as well no question she had a keen ear and he wondered if she possessed perfect pitch too like a certain partghem barrayaran he knew the offshifts arranged themselves though ivan was beginning to think that even hours was too short for a day or rather for a night the first snake in ivans garden raised its head briefly on the fourth day out hed forwarded a memo to desplainss comconsole from general allegre chief of impsec marked personal eyes only a few minutes later desplains looked up and remarked mildly ivanyou have messaged home with an account of your adventures have you not no reason to sir i mean you know all about it and my mother stopped asking about my girlfriends after i turned thirty vorpatril i decline to get between you and your mother on any of your personal matters as well you shouldnt have to sir and that was ivan hoped the end of that but a number of hours laterthey were after all getting closer to barrayarhe fielded another eyes only message from an alltoofamiliar address though the temptation to make it vanish between his comconsole and desplainss was very strong ivan nobly resisted it a spasm of virtue that he suspected no one was going to appreciate about fifteen minutes later desplains remarked may i ask why if lady alys vorpatril wishes to know what is going on in her only sons life she applies to me and not to you ivan blinked experience the silence from across the room took on a curious frigid quality and ivan looked up oh that was one of those what dyou call it rhetorical questions was it sir yes ivan cleared his throat you dont suppose impsecs been feeding her their reports do you thats bound to be confusing i mean look at the stuff they send us that last line almost worked but alas not quite desplainss lips tightened as she works directly every day with general allegre and his key staff on matters of the emperors personal security and lives with the man who ran impsec out of his head for decades before that and you are her closest living relative i would think you were in a better position to guess the answer to that question than i am captain ill ahivan swallowedill just fire her off a little reassuring note right now shall i sir you do that ivan hated that deadlevel tone ugly unnerving thing it was reminded him of his uncle aral in a mood but a written note that was the ticket a vid recording was nothing but an invitation to blather with no living person in realtime opposite you to give a visual or verbal cue how you were getting on or when to stop ivan bent to his comconsole setting the header and the security codes medium security would likely do enough to shield the message from the eyes of people who didnt need to know not enough to make it sound like some sort of emergency dear mother he sat a moment while lights blinked at him i dont know what impsecs been telling you but actually everythings all right i seem to have accidentally gotten married but its only temporary dont change the headings on your cards i will explain it all to you when we get there love ivan he contemplated that for a moment then went back and cut the middle lines as redundant if he was going to explain it all when he got there surely he neednt explain anything now i dont know what impsecs been telling you but actually everythings all right i will explain it all to you when we get there that looked much better now a little short though a slow smile turned his lips he bent and added psbyerly vorrutyer has the whole story if you can catch up with him actually he didnt expect by to be back in vorbarr sultana till some days after he and tej and rish arrived at the earliest but what was that tale from old earth about throwing ones fellow traveler out of the troika to distract the pursuing wolves yeah like that only more virtual since mamere wouldnt be able to lay her hands on by either but it sounded good he sent the message on its way racing ahead of them at the speed of light chapter nine for a capital that had hosted so many wars both civil and interplanetary vorbarr sultana seemed in remarkably good shape to tejs eye from her readings of barrayaran history aboard the jp shed half expected to see gutted buildings with blackened timbers still smoking bomb craters in the streets and haunted emaciated people scurrying like rats among the barricades instead it was fully modernized if not always fully modern chockablock with galacticstandard transportation and architecture with citizensno subjects she corrected the termout everywhere looking busy and wellfed and alarmingly assertive terms like lively or even vibrant rose to tejs mind it was extremely disorienting all right the traffic congestion was appalling the autocab that theyd taken from the military shuttleport took twenty minutes to crawl across what ivan xav assured her was a very famous bridge but it did give her and rish time to stare up and down the river valley from the high bluffs crowned with strange archaic castles lit their guide promised with pretty colored floodlights at night to the hillsides crowded with fine houses hogging the views to the level areas sprouting highrises universities and medical complexes they pulled up in front of a tall residential building quite close to the center of things or at least to the military headquarters the government complexes were closer to the old town nearly lost in the center of the sprawl but ivan xav explained that the historical area was all cleaned up these days with some quite fine restaurants to be found if one knew how to avoid the backcountry tourists the building harboring ivan xavs flat reminded tej very much of his place in solstice but the security was rather better a human guard manned a reception desk and ivan xav paused to have them scanned and entered as bona fide residents in the electronic database the vidcams were unobtrusive but maintained a redundant overlap he then whisked them up a lift tube and down a hallway pulling out a remote to unlock a sliding but not airsealed door home at last he announced cheerfully and boy am i glad of it his flat too reminded her of the place on komarrit lacked the separate entry hall and the kitchen was bigger but it boasted a balcony overlooking the street and a bit of the city not as high up the rooms were larger but they were much more cluttered seeming closer and warmer somehow despite the stuffy smell of a place not occupied for the better part of a month ah good ivan xav went on striding to the bedroom and tossing his duffle down on a broad bed the cleaning service has been in were all set having worked for nearly three weeks straight ivan xav was due several days of leave admiral desplains had told tej upon parting for his own leave and madame desplains whod been waiting at the shuttleport to pick him up he trusted captain vorpatril would use the time well to organize his affairs right ivan ivan xav had nodded earnestly just what that meant tej had no idea they were here now what in her exhaustion and stress on komarr shed scarcely thought past escape from escape to hadnt even been on her mental horizon where do i sleep rish inquired wandering around and looking things over her expression dubious the sofa folds flat its not too bad ivan xav stretched mightily and came back into his living room there are three people id most like to avoid in vorbarr sultanammother miles and gregor in that order well and falco but hes not so hard to dodge he may well be up in the district though i suppose well have to chase him down in due course but other than that what would you two like to do here in the great metropolis tej looked down at her travelrumpled garments do that implied go out surely we only have these komarran clothes are they all right to wear on barrayar or should we find something to help us blend in better rish extended a slim blue hand and snorted she then raised her arms and did a slow backbend kicking over to a handstand and then up to her feet again you know what i mean said tej yeah sure said ivan xav mmother gets her clothes custom designed but my other girive been dragged around to enough other places ill bet i could find you something nice but komarran styles are trendy tooempress laisa you know maybe you want to look around and see what you like first and then go picking a pleasant chime sounded t hell said ivan xav nobody knows im back yet not expecting company he wandered to his door and carefully checked his security vid it was far too early tej reminded herself for her pursuers to have regrouped and caught up with her ah muttered ivan xav christos maybemaybe were not home just yet still caught in traffic yeah come on lord ivan open up came a mans voice balanced on some cusp between amused and irritated i know youre in there or at least check the messages on your wristcom mmothers driver and errand boy ivan xav told tej and rish over his shoulder and bodyguardthe mans a retired commando sergeant like my cousins armsmen in all but title and oath i swear he aspires to the role came in about four years agohe didnt actually dandle me on his knee as a small boy he just acts like it he added reluctantly after a moment good at his job though which one tej wondered ivan xav hit the pad to open the door the man looked big grayhaired and affable for a change his clothing did not resemble a uniform just a neat shirt with wide sleeves trousers with baggy cuffs tucked into short boots and a sleeveless jacket with strange but attractive embroidery but mostly he looked big he eased around ivan xav spotted tej and rish and said ah in a satisfied tone he came to a species of attention before her good afternoon lady vorpatril mademoiselle lapis lazuli im christos dowager lady vorpatrils driver mlady has charged me to convey you to a private dinner at her flat and also to convey her earnest invitation for said dinner should it unaccountablyhe cast a knifeflick of a glance at ivan xavhave become lost somewhere on lord ivans wristcom oh said tej glaring a plea at ivan xav what was she supposed to do we just got off the shuttle ivan xav began yeah i know christos held up a viewer i brought a book for while you clean up im to wait while you get ready because she didnt want me to miss you if you took yourselves out or whatever he smiled thinly trod into the living room and helped himself to a chair settling back for a comfortable read he added as he keyed it on and found his place dress is casual she said which only means not formal trapped ivan xav muttered like rats what now tej whispered to him he scratched his head and sighed as if in defeat well weve all got to eat sometime and at least the foodll be firstrate if we get this over with now murmured rish we wont have to sit around anticipating it you know it does seem an inevitable meeting ivan xav grimaced but tej nodded even if ivan xavs mother was a horrible harridan in hysterics as his actions seemed to imply the news of the impending divorce ought to calm her down it seemed unlikely that she would pull out a weapon and shoot her sons new bride over dinner and besides that would be redundant she had only to stake tej and rish out where the enemy syndicate could find them and the problem would be carried out of her ken without her having to lift or tighten a finger stillpoisons rish could detect an astonishing number of these if presented in food or drink butredundancy again tej decided she was letting travel weariness and her nerves turn her thoughts just too strange it would all be made plain soon enough a flurry of turns in the bath and dithering over their tiny selection of garb resulted in rish in black komarran trousers and top with a longsleeved jacket and her headshawl tej similarly attired in shades of cream a little shabby but easy on her acute color sensitivity and ivan xav in civilian clothes similar to what hed been wearing the first time theyd met but pulled clean from his capacious closet and not crumpled and smelly from his duffle the driver shepherded them out with bland courtesy a large groundcar with a separate drivers compartment awaited them in the basement garage as christos handed them into the spacious back passenger compartment and started to close the silvered canopy ivan xav held up a hand and said uh christoswill simon be there do you know of course lord ivan the canopy snapped closed sealing them in ivan xav sat back with a wince but for a few minutes tej and rish were too busy craning their necks and trying to see the city for tej to pursue this new mystery nearing sunset of what seemed to be a late fall or early winter day traffic was heavy but the car was bearing generally upriver and uphill ivan xav cleared his throat i should probably explain simon he began then stalled out muttering no theres no explaining simon all right who is simon said tej if they were being flung into this headfirstarent you the one who was complaining to byerly vorrutyer about inadequate briefings how do i put this ivan xav rubbed his forehead simon illyan was chief of imperial security for upwards of thirty years from the war of vordarians pretendership till about four or so years back when he suffered um a sort of stroke neurological damage to his memory functions retired out on a medical yknow wait that simon illyan the same impsec boss whom morozov without a trace of irony had dubbed the legendary and took up with mmother why then and not any time in the preceding three decades that they worked together i have no idea but there you are so hes like there all the time now with her unless shes at the residence working they stick to each other like glue its pretty damned unnerving i can tell you oh said rish finally unraveling this theyre lovers why didnt you say so ivan xav tilted his head back and forth and made little flailing motions with his hands havent got used to it yet i guess after four years tej blinked in new dismay in other words the simon illyan was almostsortof ivans stepfather and he hadnt mentioned it till now does he really have a cyborg brain what that was the rumor in the whole illyan the barrayaran imperial security chief with the cyborg brain the whispers had suggested a sinister superhumanity or superinhumanity i wouldnt call it that when he was a young impsec lieutenanttwentyseven i think he said good grief thats almost eight years younger than i am now ivan xav trailed off then took up his thread again anyway thenemperor ezar sent him all the way to illyrica a trip that took months to be fitted with an experimental eideticmemory chip which was kind of a bustnine out of ten of the subjects came down with some sort of chipinduced schizophrenia and the project was canned illyan was a tenth man so ever after that he had to cope with two memories the perfect one off his chip and his original organic one ezar of course died and illyan had to find his own wayhe became one of the regents key men around the time of the pretendership so so he had a stroke and tej puzzled through all this spate of belated information it did something to this chip ivan xav cleared his throat actually it was the other way around the chip broke down had to be surgically removed but illyans brain had sort of its hard to describeeven harder to live through i guessrerouted itself around the chip in the what almost thirtyfive years that he had it when it was so abruptly yanked out it was really hard for him to readjust so the thing about simon is ivan xav forged on the thing about simon is he used to have this terrifying total recall but now he sometimes doesnt track hes pretty quiet so youre not always sure whats going on in his head not that you ever were so ummake allowances huh he wastej tried to sort it outhe was anxious for his mothers lovers dignity then and not just for how it reflected on his mother it seemed he seemed anxious for simon illyan in his own right that wasunexpected and illyan was now herstepfatherinlaw or would he see her that way it was unclear whether he and ivan xav were close but it seemed that the legend was in some sort of medical eclipse well old people it was said barrayarans aged faster than galactics it was all very curious if the looming christos were to offer them escape from their date with fate right now she wasnt sure that she would take him up on it they arrived at length at another tallish residential tower this one high on the river ridge and so commanding an even better view is this where you grew up tej inquired as they entered yet another underground garage no mmother moved here recently she has the top two floors she used to live in an older building much closer to the imperial residence that was where i grew up as much as anywhere i guess nice digs murmured rish as they rose in a transparent lift tube through level after level of elegantly appointed foyers are higher floors more expensive dunno she owns the building so its not like she pays the rent he added after a moment she still owns told one too and after another and mine has a business manager to look after em all tej was beginning to wonder if lady alys vorpatril qualified as a house minor in her own right and then they were crossing out of the tube into another foyer and escorted by christos through a pair of sleek doors clad in fine wood marquetry to a hushed hallway graced with mirrors and fresh flowers and then into a broad living room backed by wide glass walls taking in a sweeping panorama of the capital with the sun going down and the dusk rising to turn the city lights to jewels on velvet for as far as the eye could see under a cloudbanded sky in two comfortablelooking armchairs angled close together at the rooms far corner sat a man and a woman both rose and advanced as christos announced milady sir lord ivan vorpatril lady tej vorpatril mademoiselle lapis lazuli and bowed himself out delivering his captives and escaping in the same smooth movement tej scrambled to recognize the couple from assorted vid scans shed recently seen although as always a person in person was subtly different from their graphic representationsin scent in sound in sheer palpability and these people were palpable lady alys was a woman past youth and into an indeterminate age one might dub dignified but certainly not old she moved with ease and the streak of silver in her boundback hair seemed to rest there as mere tasteful decoration dark brown eyes like ivan xavs large in her pale oval face fine skin wellcaredfor a longsleeved dark red dress with a hem at her midcalf was topped by a darker loose sleeveless vest of equal length the colors appropriate to her skin tones her surroundings and the season simon illyan was dressed not unlike the driver except in shades of sober cream and charcoal he was barely taller than lady alys who was surely of no more than average height for a barrayaran woman thinning brown hair was succumbing to a tide of gray rising around the sides scans shed seen of him from earlier in his career always in the background of some imperial eventand if shed known shed have paid him more attentionhad seemed to convey a sharp tension in his posture and grim expression he smiled at her now with an amiable vagueness that went well with the slight pudge around his middle but sat oddly with his reputation lady alys cast a look at her son that seemed to say ill deal with you later and turned to take the startled tejs hands in cool slim fingers lady tej she said looking her guest in the eye as ifsearching welcome to my home congratulations on your marriage and i am so very sorry for your late losses the last words floored tej no one had offered her condolences for the slaughter of her family not one person in all the long months of their erratic flight from the whole to here granted the only people whod known who she was were the ones trying to add her to the tally but still but still but still she gulped breathless and trembling managed a constricted thank you blinking back the blur in her eyes ivan xav looked at her in concern with a peculiar little nod lady alys squeezed her hands and released them ivan xav moved in to slip an arm around her shoulders and give her an uncertain hug and you too lapis lazuli lady alys continued turning to rish but offering more of a handshake or do you prefer rish i prefer rish said rish lapis lazuli has always been more of a stage name may i make you both known to my longtime friend simon illyan illyan too shook their hands in turn his clasp firm and dry he lingered to look tej up and down his smile broadened slightly but he made no remark please wont you come sit down lady alys made a graceful wave toward the seats in a close conversational grouping at the rooms far end ivan xav grabbed tejs hand and kept her by him aiming them onto the twoperson sofa lady alys and illyan took their former chairs and rish perched on a rather antiquelooking carved chair with new silk upholstery the whole room tej noted was put together with a quiet firm taste a mixture of the old and new that complemented rather than clashed and oh blessings with an impeccable eye for color well rish stood out a little lady alys touched a jeweled pin on her vest and in a moment a staidly dressed middleaged woman servant appeared trundling a sort of drinks trolley may we offer you an aperitif or there are teas tej mind still swimming rather blindly selected a barrayaran wine she recognized from admiral desplainss table and rish chose some native cordial apparently for the strange name the others were handed what were apparently their usual tipples without query by the servant the glasses were small and finelywrought inviting appreciation not inebriation the servant trundled away as discreetly as shed entered lady alys took a sip and turned to rishto give tej time to recover herself someone was kind enough to forward me a short vid of one of your performances with your fellow jewels very impressive i understand your emigration was forced upon you but do you have plans or hopes for continuing your art in a new venue rish grimaced no plans certainly performance arts do not mesh well with hiding for ones life success requiresand generatesfame not obscurity lady alys nodded understanding teaching or choreographyno i suppose the same difficulty would arise illyan rubbed his chin and offered could you change your appearance cosmetic alterations to blend with the target population a blue hand tightened on a blackclad knee that would be repugnant to me andwhen i started to dance people would know who i was anyway he gave a conceding nod falling back into his listening quiet tej decided shed calmed enough that her voice wouldnt crack she set down her glass gripped ivan xavs hand for courage and said lady alys you should know right away that you neednt worry about the marriage ivan xav and i will be getting a divorce ivan xav freed his arm only to put it around her shoulders hugging her in tight he endorsed this thats right mamere just as soon as i can catch up with count falco that is lady alys tilted her head and stared at them has my son proved such an unsatisfactory husband in a mere week surely you should give him a longer chance oh no no said tej hurrying to correct this strange misconception i think ivan xav would make a wonderful husband so i had always hoped murmured lady alys and yet somehow it seemed never to be ivan xav squirmed slightly inching closer to tej or trying to there werent any inches left tej said sturdily he has so very many good qualities hes brave hes kind hes smart he has excellent manners and he thinks quickly in emergencies when pressed hard enough anyway very goodlooking too of course she probably ought not to add good in bed here barrayarans seemed to have funny notions about sex which she didnt quite understand yet and um what was that unusual word desplains had used chivalrous too which is why he rescued us and brought us here but really he owes me nothing lady alys pressed a finger to her lips that is not what those words in the groat circle say however assuming ivan managed to remember the right ones i did asserted ivan xav indignantly and anyway i shouldnt think you would be in such a tearing hurry to become the dowager lady vorpatril my dear and only child how did you come by that misapprehension ive longed for it any time these past ten years and anyway if the title comes to seem too dreadfully aging i now have other resources to correct the problem she glanced at simon illyan who raised his brows and smiled back very private smiles that made tej feel an intruder though she wasnt sure on what so lady alys went on it is to be a marriage of convenience then illyan put in or inconvenience and pressed a concealing hand across his jaw his eyes were alight betraying his upward liptwitch nonetheless the inconvenience said lady alys would seem to reside not in the marriage but in this jacksonian syndicate which pursues the girls about which i confess i understand very little as yet but i feel constrained to point out to you ivanjust in case you have overlooked itthat there is no point in your catching up with falco for a divorce until you have figured out what happens to tej and her companion after the protection of your name and position is removed you dragged them here to barrayar after all i uhhadnt got that far yet ivan xav admitted lady alys turned to tej and asked seriously do you know what you would want it came to tej then belatedly that lady alys had just spent much of the prior conversation slowly gently and thoroughly roasting her son and that she wasnt at all the person tej had been led to expect she allowed herself a moment of crossnessshe would have words with ivan xav about that later but right now she needed to give lady alyss serious question the serious attention it deserved we had a place we were planning to gonot here on barrayar not in the imperium in fact but we can only go there if we are absolutely certain that weve broken our trail in a way that the prestene syndicate cant pick up again otherwise itsit would be worse than getting caught ourselves that would actually come to the same thing rish pointed out once they have us they have a blue hand made an ambiguous if fluid wave tej nodded grimly that was why the balcony in the end so you protect another said illyan leaning back and tenting his hands together one very dear to you he blinked vaguely must be the missing brother whatshisname tej gasped and turned in alarm to ivan xav he shrugged and muttered out of the corner of his mouth i said hed lost his memory not his wits the point was mentioned in morozovs report said illyan sounding apologetic i only read it this morning it hasnt had time to go fuzzy yet he took up and emptied his glass appearing to study the curious absence of his drink before setting it down again from the direction and duration of your travel i would posit that hes hiding on escobar with remoter possibilities being beta colony kiboudaini or tau ceti not farther rish had jerked upright in her chair but there was nowhere to bolt to nothing to attack or to defend against either in which case illyan continued one obvious solution presents itself the ladies might be conveyed to escobar as unlisted supercargo in a routine government fast courier and discreetly deposited downside by the same means by which we used to insert agents or perhaps still do i dont suppose the procedures have changed all that much the break in the trail from here at least would be clean as our couriers go in all possible directions and no record of your landing on escobar either rishs mouth had fallen open she leaned forward like a woman contemplating a bakery case tejs heart was beating faster she asked could it really be done ivan would no doubt have to call in some favors said illyan a bit blandly oh yes please said rish er said ivan xav glancing at tej is that what you really want tej sank back in new hesitation no gifts came without price tags what would you want in return for this deal she looked in worry at illyan at lady alys at ivan xav lady alys finished her drink i should have to think about that ivan xav scratched his nose frowned at illyan could you assist me sir illyan replied airily oh i think thats a problem you can solve on your own ivan you know the same goto men as i do ivan xavs brow wrinkled he turned to tej and said rather plaintively but you just got here dont you want to look around a little before running off againforever i hardly know said tej wishing she had a net to catch her spinning wits lady alys touched her brooch again indeed ivans aunt has often remarked on the inadvisability of making decisions on an empty stomach shall we dine as she rose and everyone else followed suit the smiling woman servant spread wide another pair of marquetry doors at the end of the room revealing a dining chamber with places for five ready and waiting lady alys ushered them all through ivan xav had not lied his mother set a firstrate table the conversation became general as the discreet server brought course after course with wines to complement rish made no signals regarding subtle poisons in the soup or salad fish or vatmeat instead she bore the blissful smile of a trained aesthete given for a change no penance to endure in the name of good manners it was all as wellchoreographed as a dance if ivans mother fed her lover like this all the time it was no wonder he never left have you lived here long sir tej asked illyan when a lull in the talk presented an opportunity say rather i visit here frequently i keep my old apartment as my official address and stay there often enough to make it plausible and for my mailletter bombs and suchalthough i am officially retired impsec still provides a courtesy squad to open it he smiled quite as if this were not a disconcerting remark he added a little regretfully just because i have forgotten so many old enemies does not mean they have forgotten me we set it about that i am more addled than i am to appease them please feel free to add to that public impression should the subject come up i dont find you addled at all sir said tej quite sincerely ah but you should have met me before theno perhaps you should not have its far better this way i assure you both ivan and his mother shared an unreadable look at this but it was gone from their faces before illyan glanced up again from his plate for all his silences the man was about as selfeffacing as a neutron star light itself seemed to bend around him after dinner lady alys kindly showed tej and rish around her morethanflat or at least the top floor ivan xav slouched after his hands in his pockets the floor below was given over to personal apartments allotted to her servants of whom she kept four a cook a scullionandhousemaid who was also the server theyd seen a dressercumpersonal secretary and the driver christos two rooms she passed over in the tour ivan explained in a behindthehand whisper that they were illyans bedroom and study they stepped out briefly to a chilly roof garden designed lady alys told them proudly by lady ekaterin vorkosigan who appeared to be famous for such things it was past the season for lingering there though a few lateblooming fall plants still gave up delicate scents but tej could see how one might want to on warmer days or nights the view was even better than the one from the living room below i do appreciate your welcome said tej to lady alys as they paused at the parapet to take in one last look at the lightdraped river valley i feel so much better about it all now i wasnt sure what to expect or what to do aboutwell anything id never planned to visit barrayar lady alys smiled into the dark i considered leaving the time and place of your presentation up to ivan as a sort of test then i considered all the many ways that scenario could go so wrong and changed my mind hey said ivan xav but not very loudly there were two principal possibilities on the table lady alys turned to face tej laying out her cards at last first was that you were an adventuress who had somehow succeeded in entrapping ivan and he should be rescued from you as expeditiously as possible maybe after id found out how you did it for future reference or possibly he should be allowed to extricate himself from the consequences of his own folly for a life lesson i was having trouble deciding which another inarticulate noise of protest from her son ignoring it she went on but in any case both morozovs and simons evaluations put that as a low probability the second main hypothesis was that you were exactly as you appeared to be the unwitting victim of one of ivans lesswellthoughtout inspirations and needed to be rescued from him my impsec consultants were both united in setting that as a high probability she added after a contemplative moment impsec men never fail to hedge their bets im afraid its most annoying when one must make decisions based on their reports if anyone needs any rescuing around here mamere im perfectly capable of doing it said ivan xav sounding annoyed so i hope love so i hope when at length they took their departure in the mirrored hallway where christos again waited to convey them to the groundcar ivan xav bent and gave his mamere a rather formal peck on the cheek which seemed to make her smile despite herself he really was much taller than her tej realized lady alys turned to tej with a thoughtful look as he may or may not have told you ivans birthday is coming up next week we always begin it with a little private ceremony very early in the morning i hope that he will decide to invite you the startled and bemused glances lady alys won from both the men for this were the most mystifying yet uhsure said ivan sounding oddly unsure gnight mamere simon sir he nodded to illyan and ushered tej and rish out to the foyer the natural wood inlay on the wide doors that closed behind them made not an abstract jumble but a mosaic picture tej realized in a last look back it portrayed a dense woodland with horses and riders halfhidden crossing through the trees her eye had not parsed it at all her first time through in the back of the groundcar ivan ran his fingers through his scalp in a harried swipe and moaned she makes me crazy still tej and rish seemed to have survived the daunting visit as had he that it was better to have behind themhe was not yet sure you mean lady vorpatril said tej she gave ivan a peeved poke in the arm she was not at all like what you led me to believe from the way you talked i thought there would be screaming and weeping and carrying on at the very least but shes very practical she added after a moment and kind i didnt expect kind oh yeah said ivan after thirty years of high vor diplomacy and a few wars of course she has the chops this is a woman who knows how to get her way tej cast him a funny look not always it seems like rish turned her head from a long thoughtful stare out the canopy to observe she reminds me of the baronne a little yes said tej with an introspective frown not as tightly focused shes mellowed a lot since simon arrived in her life ivan admitted and vice versa though his was rather imposed upon him by his um brain injury ivan was put uncomfortably in mind of tejs alarming response to his mothers first greeting tej seemed such a sunny personality much of the timethese flashes of dark were like a crack in the sky shocking and wrong reminding him that the daylight was the illusion the scattering of light by the atmosphere and the endless night was the permanent default behind it all and god that was a weird and morbid thought but his mother did make him crazy did you um love your mother the baronne tej hesitated her brows lowering when she spoke it was slowly as if she had to grope for truth in a thicket of thorny memories i admired her very much we didnt always get along actually we clashed a lot she said i wasnt working up to my full potential not like my sisters ah said ivan wisely that does sound all too familiar tej looked across at him in surprise but you were an only child notexactly i always had my cousin miles and gregor for an elder brother but of course it was understood he was in a class by himself he added after a reflective moment all by himself poor sod so your cousin miles was like a brother to you asked rish glints from her gold earrings flickered in the shadowy compartment as her head tilted milesis really hard to explain he wasissmart youre smart said tej in a tone of indignant protest ivans heart nearly melted but he sighed yeah but miles wasthe thing is he was afflicted with a severe birth injury he grew up pretty much crippled so he poured all his frustrated energy into his intellect since the vorkosigan family motto might as well be anything worth achieving is worth overachieving the effect was pretty frightening and it worked for him so he did it some more very like the baronne murmured rish tej said slowly yesmy mother loved being the baronne you see building the house was her passion and in her way i suppose she loved us and naturally wanted us to have this great thing shed found too excepti wasnt her it was likeif she could just fix me into being her then she could shower me with the gifts she so valued ivan winced ah it was kind of appalling how little trouble he had following that whole line of reasoning on both sides not sure what to say he slipped an arm around tej and hugged her in warm and soft why didnt anyone value warm and soft so will we get to meet your cousin asked rish or possibly prodded not sure hes an imperial auditor nowthats sort of a highlevel government troubleshooterso he goes out of town at erratic intervals to find trouble to shoot i should warn you if we do go to vorkosigan house its kneedeep in infants these days twins speaking of overachieving they offer to let you hold one as if it was some kind of treat ivan shuddered and they leak and make the most horrible noises i never had much to do with infants said tej comes of being the youngest i guess yeahonly child here said ivan whereas i said rish coolly was the babysitter she leaned back and stretched her legs propping her feet on the seat opposite beyond tej i expect well cope chapter ten tej was plainly distracted and unnerved by her new surroundings but by diligent efforts ivan won back her full attention in bed that night and a smile when he brought her coffee in the morning he had not guessed that any of his morning practice placating blearyeyed admirals would transfer but that one did his plans for a postcoffee rematch were thwarted however by a call from his mother informing him that she was sending cristos and her formidable dressercumsecretary to escort tej and rish on a huntingandgathering expedition for barrayaran garb granted the subject had come up last night but hed thought it was small talk is it safe to go out asked rish both dubiously and longingly the building had a wellequipped exercise room on the second floor but being immured inside was perhaps a little too much like being trapped aboard the jp all over again gotta be mamere and her people enjoy more attentive security than any jacksonian house lording could ever hope to buy on account of what shes done for illyan yknow impsec worships her at least the old guard and the newbies are all their daunted subordinates i didnt notice the coverage last night said tej you wouldnt and neither will anyone who attempts to stalk you till its too late you should go he told the women wondering why he wasnt more relieved to be let off the hook as sartorial escort you wont get a better native guide except maybe mamere herself who had duties at the residence this morning or else she had implied she would have undertaken the task personally the middleaged and gimleteyed dresser expanded upon this clothing is a cultural and social language she intoned when shepherding the women out and local dialects can be tricky for an outsider to interpret we must make sure your dress says what you mean it to say and not something unintended tej and rish at least looked very impressed if they were like every other woman ivan had known he was certain to be treated to a fashion show afterward anyway this was much easier than tagging along as all he had to do was approve each garment with suitable compliments instead of frantically trying to guess which choices they wanted him to endorse with the distinct hazard of guessing wrong much more restful he sent them off with a clear conscience and turned to his strangely silent and empty flat he had three weeks of personal correspondence and other chores to catch up on that had not been urgent enough to be tightbeamed after him to komarr which was most of it he was half an hour into these tasks when a call came in over his comconsole which after a glance at the sender id he sent to voice delay after another few moments the display above his vid plate flickered and gave way to a smiling or at least smirking face he didnt especially want to deal with damned imperial auditor override hi miles ivan sighed and waited no point in stirring any waters not already roiling sorry for the interruptionmiles did not look in the least sorrybut i must not be behindhand in conveying my thanks for the extremely thoughtful gift you forwarded from komarr ekaterin actually wondered if she should put flowers in it next time you came over but i suggested target practice or passing it along to the twins which might be an even faster way to dispose of it at which point the light dawned and she looked very relieved hey it took me half an hour to find that vase said ivan in mockindignation hidden in the back of the store was it lest it frighten away customers ivans lips twitched yep miles leaned back his smile stretching in an unsettling waythat is if you knew miles i also understand some very unexpected congratulations are in order news gets around fast ivan grumped i was in on it from the first day the reports started coming in your mother called me to ask me to explain it to her as if i would know anythingi told her to apply to allegre which she did apparently to more satisfactory effect yeah well thats not my fault muttered ivan miless brows rose most annoyingly you married a woman youd known barely a day and it wasnt your fault well it wasnt it was an accident and anyway its only a temporary expedient if youve read the impsec reports you know why she was in danger i heard various recaps from various people miles drummed his fingertips on his comconsole desk my mother talk to you this morning no not her in any case i have called to invite you to bring your blushing accident and her blueshe really is bright blue ivan nodded and her blue companion to vorkosigan house this afternoon for a gettoknowyou ma kosti tea ivan hesitated concealing the small spurt of saliva that spontaneously appeared in his mouth at any reference to miless famous cook damned conditioning thats bribery as an imperial auditor i am only above taking bribes not handing them out youve never shown an interest in any of my girlfriends before youve never married any of your girlfriends before ivan and in any case im off to sergyar soon for what may be an extended stay so i dont want to miss my chance to roast me youll doubtless have others get in line ah miles took in and let out a long breath make that requests and requires your attendance someone else wants to meet her in an informal setting we figured my library would do doubling up on my mission planning at the same time ivan paused his heart sinking oh sixteenhundred sharp uh right sharp see you then miles cut the com in his best grandiose mylordtheimperialauditordismissesyou style there was really no call to whimper but ivan wanted to tej sat in the passenger side of ivan xavs sporty twoseater groundcar with rish balanced awkwardly on her lap and fumed in terror gregor hed said as if it might be just any gregor off the street and not say the absolute ruler of three worlds as far above a great house baron as a baron was above a gutter grubber mister lord ivan xav ohimnotanyoneimportant had led her astray tej swore for the last time and now she was being semiforcibly carted off to meet gregor no the gregoroh yeah no he wants to meet you in about the most diametrical opposite of hideandbesoughtbynoone as she could have imagined no she couldnt have imagined this tej felt as if she had laser targeters dancing all over her skin and the imperial auditor coz was scarcely better shed barely had time to look up the definition of the title before having to get ready the man had the power to order summary executions for pitys sake at least she and rish were dressed well for it lady alyss expert had guided them to a semicustom shop the sort of place where one had a personal laser scan and then spent a happy hour poring over the vid catalog and experimenting with various virtual tryons upon ones threedimensional holovid replica before selecting garments to be made up ondemand to fit exactly by computerized fabricators the dresser had dubbed the results casual which tej eventually realized simply meant not suitable for an imperial function or ambassadorial ball they had returned burdened with bags to ivan xavs flat where the dresser had reported judiciously to the waiting husband the new lady vorpatril has an excellent eye for color having experienced the dresser in action tej took that as no small compliment and then ivan xav had dropped the news or bomb of where they were going nexthad lady alys known ivan with a glance aside at his stacked and glaring passengers took the next corner with improved caution and then slowed thank the hovering fates a tall stone wall topped with iron spikes sped by and then he slowed some more turning in to a short space in front of broad wroughtiron gates a man in a strange brown uniform with silver embroidery on the collar and cuffs flanked by a second in black with silver frosting ditto emerged from a kiosk and approached the groundcar ivan xav raised the canopy and they peered suspiciously in ah lord ivan ivan xav raised a hand in greeting and two guests as per the man in black unsmiling aimed some sort of scanner at tej and rish then nodded you are expected the man in brown and silver waved them on as the gates swung open a huge archaiclooking stone pile of a mansionfour stories highrose above the earthimport trees almost bare of leaves in this turning season ivan drove in under a portecochere parked raised the canopy and helped rish and tej extricate themselves the dressers tutorial on what styles a woman wore for what hours and occasions had been swift but thorough the barrayaranstyle calflength afternoon skirts were no more awkward to manage than komarran loose trousers tej was pleased to discover with some practice they might even prove more comfortable the faintest vibration from an invisible force screen shielding the house faded momentarily carved wooden double doors swung wide and yet another man in brown and silver motioned them through into a spacious twostoryhigh entry hall an elaborate wooden staircase with a polished banister swept down from a gallery above wide archways opened to the right and the left with a lesser archway under the gallery straight ahead rish stopped short tej nearly tripped over her the hall was stunningly paved in a marvelous colored mosaic like a stone garden underfoot wildly proliferating with plants and flowers insects and small creatures peeking from the leaves the stonework was so fine it looked at first glance like a masters painting in oils tej halfexpected the plants to crunch underfoot giving up strange perfumes the walls carried the theme skyward with meticulously handpainted vines and flowers madly twining as if the living forest on the floor surged up to reach for the light rish was riveted oh she said i could dance the most amazing dance across this a shrill squeal sounded from the right and a mans light amused voice ware escapee ivan xav jerked and swung around he muttered in alarm under his breath oh god theyre moving on their own now from the archway a stark naked boychild not much over two feet high toddled determinedly as fast as his little legs could carry him he was pursued by an even more startling figure the man swinging a cane who limped after the child was less than five feet tall shockingly short for an adult barrayaran male which he obviously was dark hair neatly cut a slightly oversized head set on a short neck faintly lined face hunched shoulders fine white shirt gray trousers and matching jacketand if tej had thought alys and her simon had borne a palpable presence this mans authority filled the hall drawing the eye away even from the astonishing floor and the happily shrieking child thumping across it the toddler stopped dead staring up at the strangers no staring at rish ooh he cooed mouth falling open in flattering wonder ivan grab sasha the short man ordered a trifle out of breath ivan xav stepped forward and gingerly scooped up the child holding him out well away from his body and handing him off as quickly as possible to the short man the toddler squirmed like a large pink starfish reaching out toward rish and repeating ooh ooh the short man informed ivan xav sasha has learned three new tricks this week how to divest his diaper how to get lost in vorkosigan house and how to outrun me if only he would take up talking like his sister id dub him a proper little genius he then with difficulty brought his wristcom to his lips around his unwieldy and resisting burden ekaterin found him stand down your patrol he broke cover in the dining room but was cut off at the pass in the front hall so where is his partner in crime asked ivan xav bending to look warily around at floor level sleeping they take it in shifts you know trying to wear us down i think theyre aiming for unconditional surrender and total world domination but i can hire shifts too hah he gave up attempting to hold the heavy wriggler and set him on the floor where the childs attention was caught by a bug in the mosaic he attempted several times to pick it up and put it in his mouth without success and made a moue of frustration a tall breathless darkhaired woman scuffed rapidly down the staircase she said to the short man how in the world did he manage to get down the stairs without breaking his neck crawled backward i believe hes actually surprisingly cautious i broke an arm and a leg on those same stairs once well sequentially different years i remember the arm muttered ivan xav competitive banistersliding the woman gathered up the boy one arm firmly supporting his little bottom they made a rather more proportional combination hi ivan she said and raised her brows invitingly ivan xav broke out of his infantinduced paralysis and said miles ekaterin may i make known to you my wife lady tej and her companion rish this is my cousin miles and his wife ekaterin lord and lady vorkosigan he peered uneasily at the child and his heir lord sasha ackle lord sasha remarked gnomically reaching up to dislodge a hank of his mothers sleekedback hair and chew on it lady ekaterin smiled in distraction welcome to vorkosigan house tej rish im so glad you could visit before we have to leave she added aside to ivan xav im taking the twins to sergyar to see their grandparents while miles is about his affairs nikki too asked ivan xav she nodded hes not too happy about having to do all the makeup work for school but hes tremendously excited about the travel she added over her shoulder to her husband miles why dont you take them on into the library and ill join you in a few minutes the burdened woman trudged back up the staircase and lord vorkosigan gestured them to follow him through the archway to the left on the far side of a large antechamber with walls covered in pale green silk double doors painted white were swung open by an unseen hand their host ushered them into a long room lined with antique bookcases tejs stationbred eye was briefly shocked by the orange flicker of a fire burning tamely in a white marble fireplaceno not an emergency here just decor a pair of short sofas and some other chairs were grouped invitingly around the hearth upon one of the sofas a lean darkhaired rather hatchetfaced man looked up from his viewer at their entry stood and waited with a grave smile he was dressed in one of those barrayaran fauxmilitary suits dark blue and very plain sire said ivan xav as they herded up hi ivan but im doing count vorbarra today said the man his smile turning briefly saturnine it cuts down the circus by at least half right said ivan xav he was apparently growing introductionfatigued at the most inopportune time for he went on far too casually gregor my wife tej her friend rish i suppose you read the reports i had allegres precis and i talked in person with your mother this morning which was rather more informative he turned to the women how do you do lady vorpatril mademoiselle rish welcome to barrayar he said this in the exact same way that lady vorkosigan had said welcome to vorkosigan house it came to tej that he was the one man here who was not a subject did that make him an object he sat apparently the signal for everyone else to do likewise ivan xav gathered tej to him and seized the other sofa lord vorkosigan swung his cane out of the way and dropped into a smallish armchair and rish perched gingerly on a similar one rish had to be madly trying to parse the many unfamiliar scents of which the wood smoke was the strongest and strangest there were two more men in the black uniforms standing statuelike in the room one by a pair of glass doors at the far end apparently leading outside the other at the wall by their entry they looked back over the two women like a pair of sleek guard dogs studying a couple of cats that had strayed onto their territory as if they might grab them in their teeth and break their necks with one sharp shake if their doggish reflexes were triggered by a wrong move tej tried to sit extracarefully and not let her fur stand on end the emperor of barrayar leaned back at his ease one arm stretched out along the top of the sofa and asked genially so lady tejhow did you come to meet our ivan tej glanced wildly at rish whose stark stuffed expression returned this ones all yours sweetling how far back was she supposed to begin she swallowed grabbed ivan xavs hand for luck and started at random wed run out of money trying to get to wait should shebut he said hed talked to lady alys how much of trying to get to your brother on escobar as i now understand it said the gregor tej gulped and nodded we were stuck downside on komarr dodging what we think were hirelings of the prestene syndicate i was working at this grubber shipping store trying to rebuild our stake and rish was in hiding at our flat ivan xav brought in this vase wanting it packed and shipped to here come to think she looked up at him in belated indignation hey you bought that horrible thing on purpose just to have an excuse to come into the shop didnt you he shrugged well sure we were just closing he tried to pick me up tej scowled in memory the lord auditor coz pressed a hand to his lips briefly what and failed tej nodded again then he turned up on my front steps i thought he might be a capper stalking me so i invited him in and rish shot him the cousin jerked slightly the emperors eyebrows went up stunned him sweetling rish corrected urgently just a little light stun really and then we dragged him up to our flat tej went on this wasnt in the impsec report said the gregor it wasnt relevant by then said ivan xav in a distant tone forgive forget so we tied him to a chair for the night said tej the lord auditor coz made a strange little wheeing sound he was biting his own hand tej noticed ivan xav pointedly ignored him which proved to be very lucky tej forged on because when the real kidnappers turned up we woke up and heard them talking to him and were able to get the drop on them that wasnt luck protested ivan xav i engaged them in delay as loudly as i could till the reinforcements came up rather slowly quick thinkingfor a man tied to a chair murmured the coz well it was said ivan xav anyway tej plowed on he invited us to hide out in his flat for the next few days which worked fine till the prestene contact thought of putting komarran immigration onto us to smoke us out of hiding so they could target us so byerly who came to warn us and the immigration officers and those dome cops who were trying to arrest ivan xav for kidnapping me which he didnt all arrived at once before anyone had drunk any coffee and then admiral desplains called ivan xav very irate about the dome cops i think and i was so tired and scared and wewe panicked she glanced at rish still no help there quit laughing said ivan xav irritably to the coz who actually wasnt out loud at least except for the madly crinkling eyes it wasnt funny at the time ivan xav glanced aside at tej and his hand squeezed hers she squeezed back no it hadnt been not that part not at the time in retrospect thoughso he threw his wristcom into the refrigerator grabbed this box of instant groats and asked me to marry him to keep the immigration people from arresting me and the dome cops from arresting him and i said yes i see said the gregor i think it worked said ivan xav sounding stung why did he throw his wristcom into the freezer asked the coz diverted by this detail his admiral kept calling back ah makes perfect sense it does said the gregor the coz nodded and he seemed to accept this and then ivan xav brought us here to barrayar where we are supposed to find this man named count falco who will give us a divorce and then tej ran aground till she bethought herself of the kind and shrewd lady alys and lady alyss simon suggested that rish and i might be smuggled to escobar on a barrayaran government courier vessel if ivan xav would ask the right people she gathered her courage and looked up from her lap at the gregor would that be you sir possibly he leaned over and propped his chin in his hand regarding her quizzically he had one of those wildly unfair male facetransforming smiles she noted even more so than ivan xavs but then the gregors smile was transiting from a much sternerlooking startpoint ivan xav had to work hard to look stern and even then it was more likely to come out just peeved the emperor continued where on escobar is your brother this was not the time to try to deal tej realized this whole meeting was a deal a big one at that amiri was never happy in the house never wanted to be involved in the business with my brother erik and my sisters he had this passion all his life for biology and medicine so eventually my parents made a deal for him to go to escobar to this clinic where they had a special contact and change his identity and finish his medical education hes a graduate researcher there now under a new name she moistened her lips and added it was always the plan that if something terrible happened i would go to him because we always got along best and my sisters would go to grandmama the gregor stretched out his arm and drummed his fingers on the sofa back given that shiv arquas jacksonian parents are both listed as longdeceased this would have to be your cetagandan haut grandmother general ghem estifs widow exiled to earth good god said ivan xav his hip being pressed to hers on the short sofa tej felt him start shes still alive the gregor looked across at him in some bemusement didnt you read the impsec reports didnt figure theyd disgorge em without arm wrestling besides i spend all day every day up to my eyebrows in ops reports for desplains but there were all those eveningnever mind said the gregor tej wasnt sure if he was looking at her or ivan xav or both but a ghost of that smile went past again but ghem estifs widowshe was on barrayar back during the occupation and nobody still alive remembers that said ivan xav she must be over a hundred and twenty years old at least mummified about a hundred and thirty said rish if i recall correctly did you ever meet her ivan xav asked rish but his glance went to tej tej replied after the old general died she came to live with the baronne and us for a while when we kids were all younger she left almost eight years ago i havent seen her sincebut she wasnt in the least mummified then she wasnt young of course and her hair had turned this fascinating silver color meters of it it seemed like but she was perfectly limber and tall and very dignified it was likeit wasnt that she couldnt move fast it was simply that she didnt choose to a smile of memory flickered across rishs lips that was her there was a bustle at the door to the antechamber and lady vorkosiganlady ekaterin entered followed by two maidservants with not so much a trolley as a train of carts loaded high with a bountiful formal tea everyone came to attention even the gregor the two blackclad guards were already at attention but every once in a while their eyes flicked longingly toward all the clinking and gurgling going on around the fireplace it was not until coffee two kinds of teas a dozen sorts of little sandwiches and cakes and tarts freshly candied fruits marzipan dainties and miniature and rather messy cream cakes were served that the conversation resumed limping around the chewing and swallowing rish was nearly mesmerized with sensory bliss ma kosti is always especially inspired by one of your visits gregor lady ekaterin told the emperor who smiled dont even think about it gregor said the coz i suppose an imperial military draft would be cheating replied the gregor with a sigh and homed in on his third cream cakelet everyone was amused except for tej and rish who were bewildered tej nudged ivan xav but he was chewing too and just shook his head splain later he mumbled miles defends his cook with his life the coz washed down his bite with a gulp of tea and told his wife just before you came in lady tej was starting to tell us about her cetagandan haut grandmother the late general ghem estifs relict she was apparently on barrayar toward the end of the occupation if you can imagine she must have been close to old general piotrs age lady ekaterin nibbled a frosted cherry licked her fingers and nodded oh ivan youll have to introduce tej to rene and tatya vorbretten when they get back to town giving up on ivan tej looked her question at the coz he waved a cucumberandcreamcheese sandwich expansively in the air and said count vorbretten bit of a scandal a few years back when a gene scan turned up that he was oneeighth cetagandan ghem on the male side unfortunately for barrayaran inheritance law dating back to his greatgrandmother and the occupation it seemed ivan put in they were dubbing him rene ghembretten for a while but the council of counts finally voted to let him keep his countship a near thing it was i was glad of it exceptionally nice fellow exceptionally diligent district count said the gregor now that gene scanning has become widely available said lady ekaterin to tej and rish quite a few such hidden links are being turned up despite huge pressures at the time from both sides against such crosses the occupation lasted for two decades after all humans will be humans said her husband and so make more humans they exchanged amused smiles which fell rather short of private renes case is hardly unique as far as internexus romances on barrayar go said the gregor miless mother countess cordelia is famously from beta colony as was ivansand milessgreatgrandmother who married the celebrated diplomat prince xav tej turned in surprise to ivan youre really oneeighth betan you never said rishs gold eyebrows too went up ivan xav shrugged cant say as i much think about it it was a long time ago before i was born he topped this unassailable observation with a marzipan violet and chewed defensively this medical clinic on escobar that took your brother the jacksonian refugee under its wing the one with the special contact with your late parents the coz said slowly returning to a subject tej had hoped was lost in the shuffle she stiffened it wouldnt by chance be the durona group would it he went on rish gasped a glazed orange segment dropping from her hand as she stared in horror did impsec know all the time apparently not said the gregor looking up with a scarily keen interest how did you know tej demanded it was a secret shed almost died to protect informed guess marks durona group ivan xav looked indignantly at tej you couldve stood to have said this earlier what do you know about them rish still tense with alarm asked the coz quite a lot for my sins they were once a division of house fell a group of thirtysix cloned siblings with extraordinary medical talents their progenitormother lily durona who is also on the high side of a century old i believe had some special relationship with old baron fell that i never did quite understand in any case my clonebrother mark helped buy them out some years back and arranged for their removal to escobar a planet and polity i understand they find considerably more congenial than their house fell technoslavery however much they were valued back in the whole were your parents allies of old fell then lady tej or of lily durona tej looked wildly at rish who opened her hands as if to throw the question back tej tried my parents were alwaysi believe they and fell often found each other useful yes there was never a formal alliance or any question of a merger though the coz tapped his fingers on his chair arm his lips pressing together for a moment hm my brother mark is a silent investor in the durona group but by no means a secret one i believe he and his partner kareen are on escobar right now in fact busy about their affairs mark is quite the entrepreneur of the vorkosigan family has several successfuland a couple of unsuccessfulstartups down in our district as well anything worth achieving muttered ivan xav under his breath god even the clone thecountourfather approvesthe vorkosigans district has lagged economically ever since the occupation unfortunately and several of the later civil wars were disproportionately hard on us as well he tapped some more but the thing is lady tej this connection of mine is also a connection of ivans if you meant to go to ground secretly with the durona group are you saying now we darent go asked tej anxiously no but i am suggesting that your identities and perhaps appearances might need to be rather better laundered than you originally thought he glanced at rish she glowered back you seem to know an awful lot about the whole for a barrayaran the coz shrugged i visited it several times in my career my earlier career that is before i became an imperial auditor in any case barrayar tracks the five great houses that control the wholes jump points rather more closely than we track the general mob of jacksonians house fell most of all because of proximity less of cordonah station as our interests dont extend much in that directionwe have more economically efficient routes to earth via sergyar and escobar the fact that the jump point from the whole into the cetagandan empires back door is controlled by house prestene is aha feature of some interest what earlier career asked tej he eyed another cucumber sandwich round popped it whole into his mouth and chewed and swallowed before replying i was an impsec courier for a few years before i was discharged for medical unfitness i did a great deal of traveling throughout the nexus he looked up and smiled at his wife rather got it out of my system to tell the truth lady ekaterins return smile grew lopsided did you indeed tej turned again to the gregor but the ride sir the emperor rubbed his jaw ill drop a word in allegres ear ivan and he can discuss the details he paused looking her and ivan xav over thoughtfully note it could be some weeks before a place opens up we cannot delay scheduled or emergency business for this courtesy tej nodded trying to seem cooperative beggars couldnt be choosers ivans perimeter has already been notified of the new threat level the gregor went on ifif the syndicates agents track us here can your people stop them asked rish the gregors dark eyebrows flicked up theyre expected to be able to stop much worse if theyre not blindsided the coz put in you need to give the poor security fellows as much of a fighting chance to protect you as you can that means no more withholding information eh tej nodded her throat tight ivan xav felt her hand tremble in his and frowned at her in worry she remembered all too clearly the death of their bodyguard on fell station shed barely known the man and yetamong the many many reasons shed never wanted power in the house to play the game as her parents had was that shed never wanted her life to be bought at the price of anothers maybe no one was free of that really or else what were police forces and armies all about on places like pol or komarr mass protection jointly purchased by an entire society instead of piecemeal by those who could afford itwithout even the upfront rewards that jacksonian enforcers and security people routinely demanded and were given for assuming such risks the guard beside the door to the antechamber spoke for the first time its seventeenthirty hours sire already the gregor glanced at his wristcom then looked apologetically at tej rish and ivan im afraid im going to have to let you go i still need to have a few words with my auditor here before we travel our separate ways lady ekaterin stood up smoothly perhaps tej and rish would care to see a little more of vorkosigan house before you take them home ivan and i could show them the barrayaran garden ivan xavs nod endorsed this and they made what tej hoped were correct formal farewells and followed their hostess out in the front hall rishs steps slowed as she stared downward her hands twitched as if she wanted to bend and touch the art underfoot or dance across it pinwheeling is this a recent installation she asked lady ekaterin its so beautiful and unexpected it looks new lady ekaterin smiled obviously pleased when miles and i were first married he encouraged me to put some stamp of my own on the housei mean besides the barrayaran garden it took me a long time to decide what then one day my motherinlaw was telling me about some unhappy events that she always associated with the old blackandwhite marble tiles that used to be here for oh decades and i thought of this she gestured in a sweeping arc from the lavish floor to the lush walls she went on i was born and grew up on south continent where such fine work in natural colored stones is very much a regional art formthe north favors wood as a medium there was a famous stone mosaic artist whose work id adored for years but could never afford miles flew down quite suddenly one day and practically kidnapped the poor woman out of her semiretirement i worked closely with her on all the botanical detailsit took over a year to design and install not to mention walking the vorkosigans district to collect as much suitable stone as could be incorporated it represents a mixed native barrayaran and old earth ecosystemjust like some places around vorkosigan surleau at the foot of the mountains ivan xav vented a short chuckle when they broke up the old floor people took the fragments away as historical souvenirs i saw some of them for sale for an ungodly amount of money later if youd thought to sell em yourselves ekaterin you could have funded the whole replacement with the proceeds she laughed too but said i suspect the fresh start suited everyone better she turned to tej countess cordelia vorkosigan is very close friends with ivans mother you know cordelia has frequently mentioned to me how much she treasured having a woman friend when she first came to barrayar as a bride and a stranger to show her how to go on hereall those things the men didnt know at least theres no war on this time perhaps when miles and i get back from sergyar we can visit again a heartbreakingly kind offer tej thought she smiled but shook her head we dont expect to be here that long ah said lady ekaterin with a curious glance at ivan xav thats a pity well lets just take a stroll through the dining room wing and then we can go out the back and around to my garden when tej had first set foot on barrayar shed felt she couldnt get away again soon enough now after less than two days even the nebulous plans for their departure in unknown weeks seemed to loom up before she was ready for them it was as if the whole blasted planet was bent on seducing herodd thought she shook it from her head gripped ivan xavs anxiously proffered arm and followed her hostess chapter eleven a bit of rest being overdue for everyone ivan and his guests spent the day following the alarming interview with gregor in the confines of ivans flat the women seemed content to limit their explorations of barrayar to the safety of the comconsole with meals delivered from some of the large array of providers of provender to bachelors on ivans autocall list it wasnt till conversation over a late brunch the next noon that ivan discovered that his ladies objections to venturing out lay not in mistrust of his security but in distaste for his groundcar he then had the happy thought of renting a larger vehicle for the week an inspiration greeted with applause they were just discussing his offered menu of places to go and things to see in and around vorbarr sultana when they were interrupted by his door chime tej and rish both jerked in fresh alarm no no its all right ivan told them swallowing his last bite of vatham and rising to answer it it has to be someone on my cleared list or the front desk wouldve called for permission to let em come up not that cleared necessarily equated to welcome ivan reflected when he checked the security vid to find byerly vorrutyer waiting in the corridor looking around and tapping his fingers tensely on his trouser seam maybe it was time to review that list and take certain names off itreluctantlywasnt this how hed fallen into all of this trouble in the first place ivan opened the door and let by in rather like a delivery boy bringing not delicious meals but bags of snakes no tip for you by by was perfectly neat tidy and well groomed but he had a harried look in his eye hello ivan he said padding past his host is everyone all still here ah yes good hello rish tej he waved to the women lingering around ivans little dining table who sat up with interest and waved back and helped himself to a seat settling in with a sigh if youre looking to hide out from my mother said ivan this likely isnt the best place too late for that said by for the love of mercy give me a drink isnt this like the equivalent of dawn for you drinking before breakfast is a sign of serious degeneration you know you have no idea what serious degeneration is ivan i just had a very long interview with your mother worse than my impsec debriefing by far and that took a full day ivan balanced mercy against a tempting heartlessness mercy won by a hair so he brought byerly a clean glass to share out their champagne and orange juice heavy on the champs byerly evidently wasnt in a fussy mood for he didnt even look at the label till after hed poured and taken his first sip not quite a gulp and raised a brow in belated appreciation id have thought you wouldve had the sense to duck her said ivan settling back into his own chair wasnt given a chance i was publicly arrested in the vorbarr sultana shuttleport by an impsec goon squad as soon as i stepped off the shuttle yesterday and hauled away in handcuffs ivan xavs mother did that said tej sounding impressed she just sent christos and a car for us byerly appeared to contemplate this much the same thing i suppose it was actually my handlers bright idea for getting me to my debriefing discreetly now that the vormercier scandal has hit the news the public tale for me will be that i had no idea that all this brotherly chicanery was going on i was just the caterer for the party yacht drinks drugs girls you know girls said ivan i dont think the term for that is caterer by by shrugged one shoulder they were actually my coagents impsec has found that its often better to recruit from those already in the trade giving them a step up in the world in return for their loyalty than to start with a trained agent and persuade them towell you see i called right after i left your wedding told them to get the hell off vormerciers yacht met them on the orbital transfer station to supposedly go shoppingthat was our code phrase for pulling the plug we were all three boarding a commercial flight to barrayar by the time desplains and your crew descended on the kanzian desplainss jumppinnace passed us by us en route i supposeours wasnt the fastest ship nor the best cabin we had to share a smile flickered over byerlys face we were commended for our economy though impsec being in the throes of one of its periodic budget spasms hot bunks inquired ivan what suffering you impsec weasels do endure to be sure just you and two beautiful call girls stuck together for eight days in a tiny room with nothing to do it must have been hell not quite nothing byerly murmured back taking another sip of champagne and orange juice we had all those reports to write whats a call girl asked tej her brows crimping in puzzlement uh ivan sought a translation like a betan licensed practical sexuality therapist only without the licensed and the therapy parts oh she frowned like a grubber sex worker that doesnt sound altogether safe it isnt said by its not a trade that attracts the riskaverse let us say like an informer inquired rish with a small blue smile he raised his glass to her and drained it there are parallels combine that with informer and you may perhaps guess why i was anxious to extract them before the hammer came down hm she said eyeing him in fresh evaluation so impsec released me back into the wild today supposedly after a grueling night of incarceration and involuntary fastpenta interrogation which cleared me of complicity in vormerciers crimes but left me looking rather a public fool all good so far he scowled and added i was also commended for my months of meticulous and if i may say it wearing work on the vormercier case and raised one pay grade congratulations said rish butyou dont look happy bys lips twisted and then i was promptly reprimanded and docked one pay grade for involving you ivan oh ivan almost added sorry till he reflected that actually it wasnt his fault had he asked by to handdeliver him a bride no not to mention the stunned tied up and threatened with arrest andor the admirals sarcasm parts they did it that way on purpose you know by brooded if theyd presented it the other way around it wouldnt have been nearly so stinging or just said nothing at all which would have come to the exact same end far more efficiently ivan assured rish who seemed taken aback dont worry about it byerlys pay grade goes up and down a lot think of it as white noise in a general upward trend this marked a new speed record though by grumbled tej was still looking thoughtful how does one become a spy she asked byerly his dark brows flicked in amusement thinking of applying a portion of candidates are filtered in from the service side of things good people in their way but let us say afflicted with a certain uniformity of worldview some are purposerecruited from the civilian side generally for some special expertise so which way did you get recruited asked rish he waved his glass in a whatwouldyou gesture i came in by the third route recruited piecemeal by a working domestic affairs agent i had arrived in the capital at the age of not quite twenty bent on going to hell as expeditiously as possible in my own callow fashionmeaning as like to the other callow ah what ivan and his ilk call town clowns as i could manage it was not a very original period of my life i wont say i fell in with bad companyi more hunted them downbut among all the bad apples in my chosen barrel was one who wasnot he used me for a few favors found me satisfactory assigned me more small tasks then larger ones tested me byerly grimaced at whoknewwhat memoryivan suspected he wasnt going to tell that one and then one day made me an offer which by that time did not astonish methough it illuminated many things in retrospect i was cycled through a few impsec short courses and the rest was apprenticeship and ahmore spontaneous learning experiences he poured himself more champagne and orange juice he doubtless needed the vitamins which brings me to the moment by went on we need to wait you skipped over my mother said ivan would that i could have she appeared to be remarkably well informed i tried to explain that my testimony was redundant but she insisted on the extra angle of view what i was about to say is that before any of you here go out into circulation in vorbarr sultanai mean beyond the extremely select company youve already keptwe need to get our stories straight about what really happened on komarr ah said ivan unsurprised not a social visit then hardly byerly glanced under his lashes at rish well mostly not but ill get to that later having miraculously not yet blown my cover and lost my livelihood i would like to keep it that way ivan conceded the validity of this concern with a nod the short version will be that ivan met you tej on komarr when he went to mail his package you indulged in a whirlwind affair and when you were suddenly threatened with deportation by komarran immigration he married you in a fit of gallantry tej wrinkled her nose why what you were beautiful you were in danger and i hadnt got laid yet said ivan seems simple enough byerly tilted his head you know you were doing well there ivan till that lastnever mind verisimilitude is everything speaking of which i was told tej and rish may as well go on being themselves for as long as they are on barrayar making a virtue of necessity as erasing them from earlier in the record would be nearly impossible with all the trail youve leftlike an emperors birthday parade compete with marching bands and an elephant highborn but destitute refugees fleeing from a disastrous palace coupbarrayarans will understand that part have no fear even if they remain suspicious of your jacksonian aspects his eye fell on ivan and he added meditatively you spotted me on komarr by chance and nabbed me for a known witness when you suddenly needed one i wonder if you should have been drunk at the time at dawn said ivan indignantly no he added in false cordiality youre welcome to have been if you like what and besmirch my impeccability as a witness surely not in other words said tej slowly pretty much the same tale as weve been telling everyone except for admiral desplains lady vorpatril simon illyan lord and lady vorkosigan emperor gregor she trailed off plainly finding it an uncomfortably long list for a closelyheld secret its all right ivan assured her that bunch holds more secrets among em than i can rightly imagine moving on to my concerns byerly continued in the interests of spreading the correct cover story as soon as possible to as many observers as possible rish i wonder if you would care to attend a select little soiree with me this evening dinner beforehand perhaps go out rishs eyes grew wide with both longing and alarm on a date with you on barrayar byerly tilted his free hand judiciously back and forth not exactly a date i need to get out and about to complain gossip backstab and of course curse theo vormercier and impsecjointly severally and loudly a tough job but somebodys got to and all that what about myrish waved a hand down the slim length of her bodynonstandard appearance some extra distraction for peoples eyes and minds while i set about my tedious task of disseminating disinformation seemsuseful famous foreign artist enjoying refugee status in the train of a mysterious romance or possibly scandal involving the scion of one of the stodgiest of high vor familiesi guarantee theyll muscle past their prejudices for a taste of that and in the company of the vorrutyer clans most debonair nonheir at that our audience will be positively agog he smiled ivan bared his teeth byerly ignored him and went on simultaneously it will begin the process of habituating them to you also it will give you a chance to see a bit of barrayar not in ivans stodgy company i am not stodgy and your company is notoriously notoriously unfit forwell unfit anyway rish raised her golden brows and murmured hm she regarded byerly for a long moment through narrowed considering eyes and flared nostrils it sounds a small enough task to start on i thinkyes i believe you will find the evening not without elements of interest by purred in triumph and i shall be fascinated by your observations what should i wear ah cerulean on the surface woman to the bone casualchic and striking would do the job nicely a touch of the exotic a plus ivan thought the exotic was more of a default but rish merely said i can do that ivan struggled with a formless frustration rish was not his spouse nor did he stand in any way in loco parentis to her but who would be blamed if something went wrong yeah on the other hand this would give him and tej the flat to themselves for the whole evening they could order in and andivan finally managed wellwell if youre taking my employee out into deep waters make damn sure you give her a better briefing than you gave me byerly set down his emptied glass and raised a brow ivan do i tell you how to run ops as ivan sputtered by grinned arranged the hour for his return to collect rish stood up and sauntered out all in fine by style again about a liter of ivans most expensive champagne had relaxed him presumably ivan returned from escorting byerly to the door and making sure it was locked after him to find tej and rish dividing the last of the fresh orange juice and frowning curiously sois by bi tej asked bisexual that is i have no idea what bys real preferences are ivan stated firmly nor do i wish to know what couldnt you smell him that first night he came in on komarr said rish addressing tej ivan hoped hed had a busy two days or so any lingering scents from prior to that were too attenuated to discern he was pretty confusing said tej in all ways including that one to be sure though id call it more compounded than confusing but whether his contacts were sequential or together for business or pleasure enjoyed or endured even i couldnt guess i dont want to know this ivan repeated although in a smaller voice he bethought him of a new caution you do realize byerly has almost certainly been ordered by his handlers to keep a close eye on you surveillance is what he does what could be a more efficient way of keeping you under his thumb than to ask you out himself rish smirked and rose theres nothing that says a man cant enjoy his work she added over her shoulder as she drifted out like some exotic blue blossom floating down a stream come on tej help me sort through this crazy barrayaran wardrobe tej paused to whisper in reassurance to ivan she adores being seen you know shes bound to have a good time she bounced after rish with a sort of happyteakettle chortle a more horrid notion occurred to ivan then what if byerly wanted rish not for a smokescreen but as bait what could be a more efficient method of drawing their syndicate pursuers out to where impsec could see and nail them than that well ivan reflected morosely one way or another at least impsec is on the job rish returned to the flat very late that night to tejs secret bemusement ivan xav stayed up to let her inbut not byerly who had escorted her to the door whom he sent to the rightabout with complaints about keeping people awake past their bedtimes bys ribald return remarks merely made him grumpier the next night rish had ivan xav issue her a door remote byerly took her out again although not to a party but to a dance performance put on by some touring folk group from the western part of the continent his former and apparently forsaken home on the third night rish called on byerlys wristcom to tell tej not to wait up shed probably be back around noon the next day ivan xav grumbled disjointedly the next morning however was his birthday an event tej had been anticipating with growing curiosity they arose in the dark before dawn and dressed rather formally he donning his green captains uniform for the first time on his weeks leave they ate no breakfast merely drank tea and then he bundled her into his sporty groundcar and they threaded the dark quiet streets although to no great distance away his driving was thankfully subdued though whether because of the bleary hour of the day or the solemn task they were to undertake she wasnt sure he hadnt been very forthcoming about the ceremony some traditional barrayaran memorial for his dead father that apparently involved burning a small sacrifice of hairafter it had been clipped from ones head tej was relieved to learn they pulled up in a street lined by older grubbier lower buildings where a municipal guard vehicle was parked its lights blinking two guardsmen were setting up a pair of lighted traffic deflectors on either side of a bronze plaque set in the pavement the guard sergeant hurried over and started to wave ivan out of the parking spot into which they eased but then reversed his gesture into a beckoning upon recognizing the car and its driver captain vorpatril sir the man saluted as ivan xav helped tej out were just about ready for you here ivan nodded thank you sergeant as always tej stood on the sidewalk in the damp autumn chill and stared around this is where your father died then ivan xav pointed to the plaque glinting among the amberandshadow patterns woven by the street lights right over there according to mamere shot down by the pretenders security forces while they were trying to make their escape wait she was there i mean here at the time oh yes he yawned and stared sleepily down the street then perked up slightly as a long sleek familiar groundcar turned onto the block the municipal guardsman waved it into its reserved parking space with studied officiousness and saluted its occupants as they disembarked lady vorpatril was accompanied or escorted by simon illyan with the driver christos bringing up the rear and holding a large cloth bag that clanked the guardsmen took up paraderest poses at a respectful distance away and christos knelt in the street to withdraw a bronze tripod and bowl from the bag setting them up next to the plaque he nodded to his mistress and went to join the guardsmen they greeted each other and conversed in low tones then one of the guardsmen went out into the street to direct the growing trickle of traffic safely around the site good morning ivan lady alys greeted her son happy birthday dear she hugged him and he returned her what seemed to be the regulation peck on the cheek he nodded thanks to illyans echoed happy birthday ivan thirtyfifth isnt it yes sir halfway through your old earth threescoreandten eh incredible that weve all survived so long he shook his head as if in wonder ivan grimaced the war of vordarians pretendership had been more in the nature of an abortive palace coup as tej understood it from her recent reading shortly after the ascension of the fiveyearold emperor gregor under the regency of aral vorkosigan the rival count vidal vordarian and his party had made a grab for power in the first strike theyd secured the capital city the military and impsec headquarters and the young emperors mother but the boy himself had slipped through their fingers to be hidden in the countryside by vorkosigans gathering forces it had proved an ultimately fatal fumble there had followed a monthslong standoff minor skirmishes while each side frantically maneuvered for allies among the other counts the military and the people captain lord padma vorpatril and his wife lady alys relatives and known allies of regent vorkosigan had been cut off in the capital during the coup and gone into hiding padmas death rated barely a footnote less even than the skirmishes had it been a chill and foggy night like this how much more not less surreal the tale all seemed now that tej had been in the same roomand shared cream cakeswith the grownup fortyyearold gregor not to mention the present lady alys composed and commanding turned to take tej by the hands good morning tej im pleased you came tej considered the significant difference between husband shot and husband shot in front of your eyes she ducked her head suddenly shy before this woman in a whole new way thank you she managed unsure what else to say this is the first such memorial service you will have seen i understand yes id never even heard of them before its nothing at all difficult especially not after thirtyfive repetitions sometimes people perform it on the anniversary of their loved ones death sometimes on their birthday sometimes other occasions as need arises keeping the memory alive or getting in the last word depending a dry smile turned her lips the amber light leached the color from her face and turned ivan xavs uniform drab olive lady alys and ivan xav knelt by the brazier with a brisk efficiency lady alys pulled a plastic sack of scented bark and wood shavings from the cloth bag and upended it into the metal bowl she pulled a smaller packet from her purse and shook out a mat of black and silver hair clippings atop ivan rummaged in his trouser pocket and unearthed a similar packet adding a fuzzy black blot to the pile parsimoniously saved from their most recent haircuts maybe they both stood up lady alys nodded to the plaque this is where my husband was shot down by vordarians security forces nerve disruptorspoor padma never had a chance ill never forget the smellburning hair among other things this ceremony always brings that back she grimaced ivan was born not an hour later where was his uterine replicator tej asked three faces turned toward hers lady alyss twisted in a wry humor she touched her stomach here dear tej gasped in new and unexpected horror you mean ivan xav was a body birth everyone was in those days replicator technology had barely reached barrayar and didnt become widespread for another generation lady alys stared at her uneasy son in reminded ire two weeks late he was nine pounds not my fault muttered ivan xav very much under his breath he added to tej not much louder she mentions that every year lady alys went on more serenely the friends who rescued usme almost in time hustled me away to an abandoned building in the old caravanserai districtvery rundown and dangerous back thennot too far from here sergeant bothari rest to his troubled soul played midwife for lack of any other with the least experience in the task including me i was so terrified but i couldnt scream you know because vordarians men were still out there looking for us bothari gave me a rag to bitei can still remember the horrid taste when i think of it nauseating and we got through it somehow dear heavens but i still dont know how we were all so young ivan is older now than padma was then she regarded tej in sudden wonder i was just twentyfive your age my dear now theres a strange chance half past strange and aiming for very unsettling tej thought but a new or newlyrevealed reason for this aging womans unexpected sympathy to another young refugee mourning her dead grew very clear like ice or crystal or broken glass or something else with sharp and dangerous edges oh she knows she knows it all and more probably maybe lady alyss glossy surface had to be so thick and smooth because it hid so much simon illyans brow furrowed where was i during all of this i do wish i could have been there for you alys she touched his supporting arm in reassurance you were smuggling admiral kanzian out to arals great tactical benefit his face cleared ah yes now i recall he frowned again fragments at least trust me love after thirtyfive years fragments are all anyone recalls she turned again to tej as ivans bride you are now a part of thishowever temporarily would you care to lay some hair on the fire as well since youre here tej was taken aback all over again that seemed to be happening a lot lately iis it permitted not offensive apparently it was perfectly allowable because all the barrayarans nodded lady alys drew a small pair of scissors from her pursesecreted for just this hope or did she always carry them and snipped a curl from tejs bent head she handed it to ivan xav who laid it atop the pile and set the wood shavings alight little flames crackled up hot and swift there did not seem to be any formal words to be recited because everyone just stood around watching the flames reflecting in their shadowed eyes as tiny molten glints the tops of the highest buildings visible in the distance sprang into color as the first sunlight reached them but down here all was yet a pool of damp gray with the fire a shimmering orange blur in the autumn murk not formal but wordsvery low from lady alys as though she told secrets padma and i were hiding in what was then a cheap boarding house down the street just there she pointed to a building a few doors down halfconcealed by renovation scaffolding the scent of burning hair was very pungent now when i went into labor padma panicked i begged him not to go out but he was frantic to find someone anyone to take over the terrifying task of delivering a baby that women all over the planet had been doing every damned day since the firsters landed though i had the biggest part of the job and wasnt going to be able to wriggle out of it by any means whatsoever so he went out leaving me alone and petrified for hours with my contractions getting worse waiting and of course he promptly got picked up once they brought him back and wed both been dragged out into the street he tried to stand up to armed men all pentadrunk as he was but i knew then and forever after that it wasnt his bravery that killed himit was his cowardice oh dear god i was so angry at him for that for years illyan touched her shoulder ivan xav stood warily away illyan said kou got you and baby ivan out didnt he giving her thoughts a more positive direction yes lieutenant koudelkalater commodore she glossed to tej kou managed to smuggle us out of the city in the back of a grocery van of all things his father had been a grocer you see lurching along in the vegetable detritusivan very hungry and noisy to be sure and not happy to be thrust out into the cold world in the middle of a war the little flames were almost gone gray ash starting to drift away in the stirrings of air from the passing vehicles the acrid smell was abating this is a barrayaran ceremony for remembrance said lady alys turning to tej it was always my intention when ivan married to turn this task of remembrance over to him to continue or not as he willed becausememory isnt all its cracked up to be her hand reached out and gripped illyans who gripped it back in a disturbed little shake though he smiled at her thirtyfive years seems long enough to me lady alys went on long enough to mourn quite long enough to be enraged its time for me to retire from remembering from the pain and sorrow and anger and attachment and the smell of burning hair in the fog for ivan its not the same of course his memories of this place are very different from mine i never knew said ivan xav shifting uncomfortably all that lady alys shrugged i never said first you were too young to understand and then you were too adolescent to understand and thenwe were both much busier with our lives and this had all become a rote exercise but latelyin recent yearsi began to think more and more about giving it up by every sign shed been thinking about this for quite a while tej thought no one built up that much headpressure overnight she looked her alarm at ivan xav who belatedly slid closer and put a bracing arm around her waist it was just something we did every year said ivan xav when i was really little of course i didnt understand it at all we just came here burned this stuff stood around for a few minutes and then you took me to the keroslav bakery because wed not had breakfast i was all about the bakery for the longest time they closed last year lady alys observed dispassionately not surprised theyd kind of gone downhill i thought mm that and your palate grew more educated than when you were six she added after a reflective moment fortunately the flames had burned out at lady alys gesture christos came back with the bag and a padded glove upended the bronze bowl and tapped out the ash wiped it with a cloth and put it all away again he stood up with a grunt lady alys brightened well thats all over with for another year at least given that the bakery is gone removing an occasion for tradition without any effort on our parts would you both care to come back to breakfast at my flat tej glanced at ivan xav who nodded so said sure thank you lady alys they followed the sedate groundcar in ivan xavs twoseater tej looked over her shoulder to see the municipal guardsmen taking down the lighted barriers and putting them away in their vehicle returning the street to its normal morning traffic which was growing notably busier it was full dawn now and the city was awake eager to get started on another brandnew day looking forward not back thirtyfive funerals seemed too many yet none was not enough tej wondered if ivan xav would help them to it if she and rish would feel any better for burning some hair in a little pan for dada and the baronne and erik maybe you had to be raised to this she turned to ivan xav what a morbid way to start your every birthday when you were a child i mean most children get presents and sweets parties maybe ponies here on barrayareven we and the jewels all did well not ponies not on a space station but you know what i mean oh i had all that too said ivan xav later in the day quite ornate parties for a few years when the mothers in mameres set were competing with each other all that was damped down by my midteens when we kids were all more intent on moving into adulthood as fast as we could god knows why he blinked reflectively not that their teens are something most people would want to linger in and after another moment it felt like childhood came to a pretty abrupt halt when i started the imperial service academy at age eighteen but looking at some of the frighteningly dewy newminted ensigns theyre sending us these days im not so sure maybe that was an illusion on our parts and after a much longer pause while he negotiated a few corners and dodged incoming traffic sure taught me the price of vorpatrils mixing in politics though i didnt understand much but i had that down by the time i was eight i meanother boys had fathers most of em even miles had uncle aral scary as he wasi had a bronze plaque in the street that groundcars ran over that made mamere either sad or twitchy or bitchy by turns but never happy iswasshe always this um tej wasnt sure how else to describe lady alys desperate for escape when you do this burning thing his brows drew in no shed never told me some of those crazy details before funny thing that i mean shes the one who had that damned plaque installed in the first place right makes me wonderif she didnt enjoy this and i didnt enjoy this and my father whatever he was or would have been is decades past caring why do we keep doing this she didnt have to wait for me to get married to stop she couldve stopped any time some passingofthegenerations thing tej hazarded i guess following christos ivan xav turned in at the garage under his mothers building and offered no more illumination chapter twelve the rest of ivan xavs thirtyfifth birthday passed quietly although he did take tej and rish out to dinner at an intimate restaurant featuring barrayaran regional cuisine where he appeared to be well known by the staff rish drew stares and whispers as they entered but no overt insults i thought they didnt like mutants here murmured tej byerly says my appearance goes so far beyond what barrayarans usually think of as mutants that their categories break down said rish although he did warn me to stay out of grubber venues if i dont have outriders except he didnt say grubber oh what was that barrayaran term prole said ivan plebe prole that was it yeah probably good advice till you know the territory better to tejs surprise they were guided to a fiveperson table with two seats already occupied a solid darkhaired man who looked to be in his forties not handsome but strikingblade of a nose penetrating nutmegbrown eyesstood up as they approached a younger athletic blond woman taller than her partner smiled across at them clearly interested in but not shocked by rish this must not be a grubber venue happy birthday ivan said the man shaking ivans hand congratulations on making it this far alive yeah really said ivan xav returning the handshake and smiling in evident sincerity tej rish id like you to meet my friend duv galeni and his wife delia the blond woman waved in a warm way galeni bowed vorlike over tejs hand and murmured lady vorpatril and shook rishs mademoiselle rish after they were all seated studied the menus had the vorgarin districtstyle stroganoff recommended and placed their orders tej asked how do you all know each other because galeni was no barrayaran vor certainly wrapped within that cultured voice tej heard a faint komarran accent delia ive known all my life ivan xav explained her father commodore koudelka worked for my uncle back when aidedecamp and secretary not unlike ivan xavs job this seemed to say wait was he the lieutenant who smuggled babyyou and your mother out of this city back when it was under siege yep thats the one three more daughters yknow where are they all at the moment delia because i figured tej could stand to meet some more barrayaran women the blonde replied martyas down in the vorkosigans district with enrique working on one of marks projects kareens on escobar with markim not sure when theyll next be back and olivias out in the vorrutyers district with dono would count dono count do you suppose no said ivan xav then hesitated and anyway thats a lame pun delia grinned unrepentantly galeni hid a smile behind his hand and you and ivan xav tej inquired of galeni i dont go as far back as delia he replied easily i first met ivan when i was senior military attache at the barrayaran embassy on earth and ivan as a wetbehindtheears lieutenant was assigned as one of my assistants abouthas it really been ten years eleven said ivan xav a bit glumly my word the crowsfeet at the corners of galenis eyes crinkled as the first course arrived galeni and delia took it in turns to draw tej and rish out about their own travels rish was describing their time on pol when tej overcome with a sense of morozovian deja vu turned to galeni and said suspiciously wait are you another impsec man well yes but i promise you i am offduty tonight he assured her his wife put in proudly duvs been head of impsecs komarran affairs department for the past four years he was one of the first komarrans to enter the imperial service as soon as it was opened to them commodore galeni it soon transpired and another of the legendaryillyans old trainees but he and ivan xav did appear to be friends in their own right not watcher and watchee or not just watcheras the conversation wended over a surprisingly wide range of topics tej had the distinct impression that both members of the couple were testing for the answer to the unspoken question is she good enough for our ivan that waskind of nice actually that ivan xav had such friends tej had enjoyed a string of carefullyvetted playmates growing up from among the children of her parents higherlevel employees but all were scattered now or worse suborned to the new regime when she tried to come up with a list of intimate friends the sort who might ask is he good enough for our tej they all came out family or at least some of the survivorsjet rish maybe amiri also all scattered she hoped jet was still safe with amiri galenis presence did account for the absence of byerly she realized a bit belatedly it would not do bys townclown cover good to be seen dining out with one of the senior officers of impsec when they arrived roundaboutly at the account of how tej had met and married ivan xav she was afraid it was going to be the coz and the gregor all over again or at least galeni wheezed redfaced into his napkin to the point where his wife stopped giggling long enough to look at him in concern galeni straightened up and caught his breath at last at least it sounds better than your last kidnapping i thought so ivan xav agreed ruefully what said tej galeni hesitated then said one of the more traumatic incidents of my tillthen remarkably traumafree sojourn on earth ivan spent a very unpleasant afternoon kidnapped by ah a group of conspirators who hid him in the pumping chamber of a tidal dam an afternoon muttered ivan xav try a subjective year pitchdark yknow i couldnt have read a clock if id had one also cold wet cramped and underground listening the whole time for the damned pump to start and drown me when the tide turned tej picturing this felt her throat tighten sounds nasty yeah said ivan xav among the several pressing reasons i was kissing my career goodbye about then that came high on the list sighed galeni to be handed lieutenant lord vorpatril to look after and then lose himnot good on my resume i assure you but he was rescued said rish obviously by you commodore captain back then lets say i helped fortunately for my resume is your claustrophobia better now delia asked ivan xav more in a tone of curiosity than concern ivan xav gritted his teeth i do not have claustrophobia thank you very much delia theres nothing irrational about itabout me but miles said i have an allergy to total strangers trying to kill me is all one that miles shares i might point out delias lips twisted i dont know ivan i think miles actually gets rather excited by that you may be right agreed galeni do you suppose its the attention said delia he does like to be at the center ivan xav choked into his own napkin at this one and was drawn away from his little moment of irate by uniting with this old friend in trading scurrilous observations about the coz none of which tej noticed galeni tried to gainsay at dessert the commodore pulled a small flat case from his jacket pocket and pushed it rather shyly toward her and ivan xav it contained a bookdisc she saw ivan xav eyed it warily whats this duv something of a combination birthday and wedding present well perhaps more for lady tej than you a new history of barrayar since the time of isolation just released from the imperial university press this week after some years in the preparation professora vorthys is going to teach her modern history class with it starting next fall how long is it ninety chapters roughly and how many did you write galeni cleared his throat about ten i didnt know impsec gave homework said tej faintly galeni smiled wryly more of a hobby in my case but i do like to keep my hand in when i can as much as i can i have several interesting papers written waiting for their references to age out of their classified status i should explain said ivan xav when duv said he quit school to go to the imperial military academy back when the service was opened to komarrans he was a professor not a student history hes mostly over it but sometimes he reverts is this thinghe touched the case with a cautious fingerwritten in high academic i can only speak for my own chapters but illyan beat the scholastic prolixity out of me back when i was first writing impsec analysis reports for him said galeni taught me the impsec abcsaccuracy brevity and clarity although he did say he was glad to get reports where he didnt have to correct the grammar and spelling ivan xav laughed ill just bet tej had just enough wits to accept the bookdisc with suitable appreciation this did not seem the time to explain that she wasnt going to need to study barrayaran anything because she was skiving off to escobar at the first opportunity ditto delias offer to hook her up with the array of sisters when the chances arose she managed noncommittal thanks the galenis excused themselves soon after desserta toddler and an infant evidently waited at home a vidcube of the absent offspring was shown about tej made suitable complimentary noises as the couple passed out of the restaurant ivan xav remarked no night life for him anymore poor sod but undercut this by adding i expect that suits him to the ground ivan xav didnt have brothers but at least it seemed he had brotherofficers tej reflected it was something it wasnt till bedtime when ivan xav was taking his turn in the bathroom and she and rish were making up the couch that tej was able to snatch a private moment to decant the byerly report so last night how was it rish flicked over a sheet and smiled a maddeningly secret smile interesting tej tossed her head thats what people say about some dodgy dish that doesnt quite work whitefish and raspberries oh this combination worked delectably so rish touched her lips though whether to check her words or draw them out tej could not guess byerlyive never encountered anyone whose mouth and whose hands seemed to be telling two such different stories do i have to shake you rish grinned and made a rather byerlylike wristflutter the mouth ripples on amusingly enough though most of what comes out is camouflage and the rest is liesnot so much to me though but the hands mm the hands are strangely shy until suddenly they turn eloquent and then their candor could make you weep a woman might fall in love with the hands though only if the woman were nearly as foolish as my little evensisterwhich luckily doesnt seem to be possible tej threw a pillow at her the next day the last of ivan xavs leave he spent ferrying them around to see a few locallyfamous tourist sites including a military history museum at vorhartung castle the most looming of the old fortresses above the river that were indeed lit up colorfully at night during this outing he discovered that tej and rish not only didnt drive ground vehicles they couldnt we had sport gravsleds at this downside country villa my parents kept but my older sibs usually hogged them tej explained and in congested places towns and cities like thisshe waved aroundeven dada used an armored groundcar with a dedicated driver and bodyguards outside the cities its all toll roads built and operated by assorted houses so you need a lot of money to get around huh said ivan xav i bet i can fix that his fix proved to be a private drivers education service specializing in offworld tourists whose personable instructor picked them up at the front of ivan xavs building the next morning after ivan xav went off to ops for his days work its an excellent choice to learn to drive in our beautiful vorbarr sultana the instructor informed them cheerfully after this no other city on the planet will daunt you tej jumped into the challenge rish claiming distressing sensory overload opted out after a short trial that left her green figuratively in far fewer hours than tej thought possible or even sane she was issued a permit that allowed her to practicedrive under ivan xavs supervision she only froze once on their first evenings outing when trying to back the groundcar out of its parking space beneath the building the pillar made such an ugly crunching noise dont worry ivan xav told her jovially these groundcars are so crammed with safety features you can hardly kill yourself even if you try why ive had halfadozen crackups with barely a scratch on me that is harder on the groundcars naturally except for that one time but i was much younger then so we dont need to go into it he added after a moment besides this is the rental encouraged tej set her jaw and soldiered on they arrived back an hour later without having cracked anything not even in her case a smile but that changed when she successfully piloted the beast back into its stall and powered down at last that wasnt as scary as i thought it would be oh hey you want scarythe best day i ever had with my uncle aral who usually doesnt have time for me in both senses of that phrase but anyway it was the first summer i had my lightflyer permit and had gone down with miles to their country place uncle aral took me out just me for a change over the unpopulated hills and taught me what all you could really do with a lightflyer he said it was in case i ever had to evade pursuit but i think he was testing his new security fellows who were along in the back seat if he could make them scream cry or throw up he won erdid they did he naw they trusted him too much i got a couple of the veterans to yelp though he went on with unabated enthusiasm after youre comfortable with groundcars well have to move you on into lightflyers you need them to get around out in the more remote parts of the districts where the roads can get pretty rough too bad uncle aral is too old now to give you his special advanced coursehe pursed his lipsprobably anyway hes stuck on sergyar viceroying which has disappointingly little to do with vice he claims the that uncle aral tej translated this it was almost harder to imagine than the gregor and your mother encouraged thiscoaching oh sure of course neither of us told her what we really did uncle aral is nobodys fool ivan xav next discovered that neither tej nor rish despite their sensory discrimination training was more than a rudimentary cook he claimed he was no master but could survive in a kitchen cooking a dinner at home for a change to prove it he then hit on the bright idea of sending them both off to ma kosti for formal lessons on the theory that she was underemployed and bored this week with most of the vorkosigan household gone to sergyar in appearance ma kosti proved very much their first sample prole short and dumpy and with a notably different accent and syntax than her employers and she was at first visibly leery of rish this changed when rish demonstrated her fine discriminatory abilities in taste and smell plus less of a tendency than tej to cut herself instead of the vegetables and rish was promptly adopted as a promising apprentice rish in turn recognized a fellow masterartist if in a different medium the days filled swiftly two evenings out of three rish went off with byerly often not returning till the next day bys place she remarked is surprisingly austere he doesnt bring his business back there much as far as i can tell something of a refuge for him tej handed her a pillow and she punched it to fluff it up not as austere as this couch though when am i going to get off this thing ivan xav passing by with a toothbrush in his mouth removed it to say you know i bet we could get you your own efficiency flat right here in the building if i try might have to wait for an opening or i could put myself on the waiting list for the next two or threebedroom unit that comes up call the moving service we could shift digs in a day no problem unless byerly takes you off my hands ivan xav fluttered his fingers to demonstrate their potential rishfree state rish sat up in her sheets and stared at him but were leaving oh yeah when are we leaving she asked thats kind of up to impsec they havent called but they could at any time wellyeah so what about this divorce ceremony you two have to go through before we can lift off tej perched on the couchs padded arm and said ivan xav said it would only take ten minutes yeah but how long do you have to stand in line to get the ten minutes is there a waiting list for that too and how does it really work said tej unwillingly prodded into wondering i mean in detail hed never said but then she hadnt thought to ask theyd been busy hm said ivan xav sticking his toothbrush into his tshirt pocket and sinking down into a chair the thing we have to do is fly up to the vorpatrils district on one of the days falco is holding counts court in person he does that at least once a week when hes in the district more if he has time thatll save a world of explanation we go in say please falco grant us a divorce he says right youre divorced done bangs his courtly spear butt and we skitter out dont you need lawyers and things said rish shouldnt think so youre not suing me for support are you ivan xav asked tej she shook her head no just for a ride to escobar which the gregor is giving us anyway if its something this count falco only does once a week for a whole districthow many people are in the vorpatrils district anyway said rish i dunno millions how does one man play judge to millions of people asked rish astonished he doesnt of course hes got a whole district justice department with all kinds of subterritorial divisions for cities and towns and right on down to the village speaker level but he keeps a hand in for the political symbolism of it and to sample what his people really have to say most counts do even uncle aral when hes home which isnt very often true hadnt you better check his schedule asked rish sounding a trifle exasperated in case impsec calls with our ride oh say tomorrow morning um yeah maybe said ivan xav and lumbered off reluctantly to his comconsole he was gone for a long time when he came back he looked sheepish in fact falcos counts court docket is packed for months out if that fast courier opening comes up sooner ill have to pull personal strings which i can do but would rather avoid if i can because the thing about me owing a big favor to falco is hell collect and grin while hes doing it but i put us on the courts waiting listthey say they sometimes get lastminute openings which they fill firstcome firstserved he took a breath your protection wont be withdrawn till youre safe on escobar anyway regardless of when we do this divorce deal rish nodded tej feltodd they were going to escobar in theory to take up a new life under new identities lady vorpatril was certainly a new identity enjoying a safety that didnt rely on obscurity no stick to the plan without the plan they had no anchor at all it was the last lifeline her parents had thrown to her as they went down with their house worried that tej might be a little homesick ivan stopped on the way back to his flat one afternoon and found a brandnew great house set with six player panels if hed had any doubt that rish was byerlys assignment as well as his hobby it was put to rest by bys apparent willingness to devote several evenings in a row to a childrens game if admittedly a fastmoving complex and strangely addictive one it didnt help that by took to it so well he was soon giving the born jacksonians real competition leaving ivan to bring up the rear time and time again but ivan found morozovs other way of winning at great house to carry over too as one friendly anecdote followed another in the relaxation and triggering reminders of the old game ivan learned a great deal about tejs upbringing as a real jacksonian great house barons daughter apparently much dotedupon by her powerful dada ivan traded with a few tales out of school himself only byerly did not contribute to the exchange although ivan was sure he was sucking it all in but they were in the middle of a round of great house when ivan finally learned the real relationship of the late baronne her children and her jewels evensister and oddsister said tej we call each other that because we are moreorless halfsiblings at least the baronne used a lot of her own genome as a base to create the jewels although not dadas except for the y chromosome for onyx in a way ruby was really the first the baronnes prototype so she claims to count as one in a class by herself erik was the next first and then topaz and star then pearl and then pidge and then emerald and then amiri and then rish and then finally me and right after me jetonyx that is odds and evens see it became a sort of family joke she sighed in memory only now were all scattered and eriki wish we could get some word about topaz i wont say its worse not knowing if shes alive or not but itsnot good ivan stared openmouthed at rish who stared back in somewhat affronted dignity so youre my sisterinlaw he sat a moment not so much in reflection as stunnedlike an ox that had just met a mallet that sure explains a lot byerly didnt help by laughing like a loon you could take some other course said ivan xav a week later when tejs groundvehicle operation training had concluded in triumph or at least not disaster and left her with a certification giving her the freedom of the cityif she could first borrow a vehicle and second wedge through the traffic bubbletube systems were being retrofitted in some areas but the installation was evidently slow plagued with problems it sometimes seemed to tej as if this entire planet was in process of being retrofitted there are three major universities and over a dozen colleges and who knows how many tech schools in this town ivan xav went on they have courses for everything well maybe not licensed practicing sexuality whatsits but given the way the conservative crowd complains that may be next youre smart you could pick anything you liked tej contemplated this offer both uneasy and enticed i always had tutors before i never chose my own like off a menu it might be a way for you to meet more people too ivan xav speculated i should really introduce you to more than the koudelka girls come to think all the women i know have women friendsto excess sometimes he paused for thought theres tatya vorbretten though shes up to her ears in infants right now as bad as ekaterin and delia tattie vorsmythe she was always fun despite her strange taste in men not sure who all mamere could suggest of the younger generation she used to know lots of vor maidens daughters of her cronies yknow but they mostly seem to have gotten married and moved along this mental search for names was interrupted when he went to answer his comconsole when he came back he looked stricken bad news asked tej sitting up on the couch and setting aside her reader no notnot really it was the clerks office at the vorpatril district court says they had a case fall off falcos docket for the first afternoon of next week and did i want the slot i uhsaid yes because god knows when therell be another yknow oh excellent said rish wandering in from the kitchen with a fresh mug of tea in her hand in time to hear this one more chore out of the way oh tej echoed hollowly yeah good it was like some weird sort of honeymoon in reverse ivan thought taking a personal days leave from ops left him facing a threeday weekend not something to waste so ivan seized the chance to show tej more of barrayar while he could outside of the hectic confines of the capital rish upon finding that her witness was not required elected to stay behind under the loose supervision of byerly and just how loose that might be ivan wasnt asking gift horses and all that it left him with a great chance for a real getaway with tej just the two of them at last it was not the season for tourists in the northeastern coastal district traditionally held by the vorpatril counts as his lightflyer beat its way up the shoreline against a cold sea wind ivan explained to tej people come up here from the south in the summer to escape the heat then go back down in the winter to find it again if theres time maybe i could take you down to see the south coast too time there wasnt enough time yes the marriage was supposed to have been temporary but not bleeding instantaneous he took a detour over the rural territory to give tej an idea of the extent of it a few areas of early snow just inland proved no novelty to her as jacksons whole was apparently temperate all the way to the equator with large and barren polar regions happily the snow covered up the last few biocide blights lingering from the occupation but a little way up the coast past the summer resort town of bonsanklar good saint claire in one of the old tongues lay a cozy little inn specializing in the vor trade fondly remembered from a few visits in ivans youth it was still there perhaps a little shabbier but just as cozy he and tej managed one walk on the pebbled beach before darkness drove them indoors the next day it rained but their end room boasted its own fireplace food service and no reason to go out none at all far too soon the next morning they were back in his lightflyer threading their way upriver to the vorpatril district capital city of new evias i dont understand what im supposed to call him said tej peering anxiously ahead out the front canopy count vorpatril or count falco and if only his heir is lord vorpatril why are you lord vorpatril too or are you all right ill try to explain it again said ivan there are the counts and their heirs political heirs count vorwho lord vorwho lord firstnamethe firstborn maleslike aral miles and sasha all right that i got any other siblings of lord firstname like sashas twin lady helen get to stick on a lord or lady in front of their names too as a courtesy title whether they drool or not but those titles arent inherited in the next generation so we have a case like by whose grandfather was a count whose father was a younger son and so lord firstname and then byerly who is just vorrutyer the vor part standing in for any other honorific so youd never introduce him as mister or monsieur vorrutyer just as vorrutyer although his wife if he had one would be madame vorrutyer and his sister before she married was mademoiselle vorrutyer all right said tej more doubtfully then just to confuse the tourists there are a bunch more lord vorlastnames running around like me who have the title as a permanent inheritance even though we arent in line for any districts my grandfather who was just a younger grandson of that generations count vorpatril and so didnt even rate a lord firstname was given his when he married princess sonia as some sort of prize i guess oh said tej fainter but still valiant but those are the correct formal titles then we come to casual conversation falco or aral would be falco or aral to their close friends and cronies wives and whatnot but id never call em that it would be count falco or count aral sort of like uncle aral informal but not so familiar or intimate ysee and also useful when there are a bunch of people with the same last name in the conversation to keep straight which is which so my mother gets called lady alys a lot because theres another lady vorpatril in town falcos daughterinlaw as well as his countess vorpatril er and you now butim not intimate with the same people youre intimate withso i cant just copy you can i keep it simple advised ivan just call him count vorpatril or sir unless he tells you otherwise and still call him count vorpatril when were actually in his court because thats very formal see he added after a moment i sure plan to the outskirts of new evias hove into view and ivan had to give over his lightflyers control to the municipal traffic computer new evias was maybe onetenth the size of vorbarr sultana but perhaps for that very reason more uniformly modernized in any case the control system brought them down neatly into one of the few empty circles painted atop the parking garage next to the assorted district offices of justice the targeting was accurate to within oh twenty centimeters or so or thirty ivan rubbed his jaw made sure tej hadnt bitten her tongue or anything in the hard landing and escorted her out count falco vorpatril sat in judgment as had several equally stodgy ancestors before him in one of the few remaining timeofisolation public buildings still left standing in downtown new evias the structures musty legal smell seemed to be ageless tej who had grown very silent perked up at the dark woodwork and elaborate stone carving gracing the architecture now this really looks like barrayar she said ivan was gratified in a secondfloor corridor they encountered prematurely the count himself who seemed to be on his way back from lunch ivan my boy falco hailed them he was still whitehaired stout joviallike a sly father frost with a hidden agenda falco was nothing if not a political survivor conservative by inclination centrist by calculation he wore the formal vorpatril house uniform of dark blue and gold which adapted itself to his contours much as he adapted himself to the political landscape a clerk bearing an electronic case filer stamped with the vorpatril crest dogged his steps obsequiously falco eyed tej in open appreciation as they stopped and he strolled up sir ivan came to attention may i introduce my wife lady tej indeed you may count falco shook tejs hand aborting a vague attempt on her part at a curtsey ive heard about you young lady how do you do count vorpatril sir said tej loading it all in just in case ivan guessed talk with mamere did you sir ivan hazarded quite an entertaining talk yes oh good thatll save a shipload of time ivan squeezed tejs hand see didnt i say itll be fine tej smiled gratefully and squeezed back huddling closer ivan slipped a supporting arm around her waist falco smiled benignly countess vorpatril was very curious about your nuptials ivan he went on tapping ivan familiarly on the chest with one broad finger shed like to hear about them from you by preference we will both be down to the capital later in the week note where you may find her at vorpatril house at the usual hours you are behindhand on your courtesy visit head of the clan and all that its only a temporary marriage sir as i hope mamere explained to rescue tej from some um legal complications on komarr which worked fine all right and tightgot her all fixed up free of them now we just have to get her free of me and shell be umfree the clerk touched his wristcom indicating time issues and count falco gave him an acknowledging wave yes yes i know well good luck to you both falco toddled off down the corridor to the back door of his chambers ivan led tej in the opposite direction where they found the waiting area another clerk took their names and left them to wait tej circled the room eyeing the woodwork and the items decorating the walls mostly historical artifacts and prints then stood studying the big wall viewer displaying successive scans of new evias and rural district scenes since the time of isolation ivan too rose after a while because sitting was becoming unbearable and studied the woodwork or pretended to im glad they didnt just knock this old place down like most of the rest of it makes it feel like our past isnt just something to be thrown on a scrap heap now were all turning galactic yknow this brought a smile to tejs lips one of the few in the past hours is that what you barrayarans think youre doing but before ivan could figure out a reply the clerk returned to say captain and lady vorpatril your case is up next the clerk led them down the hall to falcos hearings chamber they stood aside to let a group no two groups of people exit one set looking elated the other downcast and grumpy the woodpaneled room was surprisingly small and to ivans relief uncrowded just falco and his clerk sitting at a desk on a raised dais a couple of desks toward the front where a woman lawyer was gathering up what appeared to be stacks of yellowing physical documents dating back to the time of isolation along with her electronic case book some empty backless benches bolted to the floor and by the door an elderly sergeantatarms in a vorpatril district uniform the sergeant received ivan and tej from the clerk who departed again presumably to deal with whoever next needed to wait and directed them to the empty tables um should be one of you at each of these he said doubtfully and your respective counsels ill be out of here in just a moment said the lawyer stacking faster were skipping the counsel said ivan dont need it and wed rather sit together said tej ivan nodded and they both slipped behind the empty desk ivan let his hand dangle down between their uncomfortable wooden chairs and tej slid hers into it her fingers felt cold and bloodless not at all like her usual self count falco lifted his head from some lowvoiced consultation with his recording clerk then made a sign to the sergeantatarms who turned to the room and announced formally next case captain lord ivan xav vorpatril versus lady the sergeant paused and looked down at a slip in his hand his lips moving they rounded in doubt he finally settled on his wife lady vorpatril the lawyer about to make her exit instead turned around and slid onto one of the back benches her chin lifting in arrested curiosity ivan decided to ignore her the recording clerk leaned over grasped an ancient cavalry spear bearing a blueandgold pennant that leaned drunkenly against the table edge tapped its butt loudly in its wooden rest and intoned your count is listening complainants please step forward tej looked at ivan in panic count falco leaned forward and encouraged them to their feet with a little crooking of his hands a charitable pointing of one thick finger indicated where they should stand ivan and tej stood and shuffled to a spot beneath his countly eye holding hands very tightly the clerk observed into his recorder petition for the dissolution of a marriage number sixfivefiveseveneight oaths originally takenhe gave the date of that mad scramble in ivans rental flatsolstice dome komarr ivan wasnt sure whether to think wait was it only a month ago or is it a whole month already it had not been like any other month of his acquaintance anyway so falco laced his hands together and stared down at ivan and tej for a long thoughtful moment ivan rendered uneasy by the sheer geezerish falconess of his expression edged closer to tej falco leaned back in his chair so captain vorpatril lady vorpatril on what grounds do you petition this court for release from your spoken oaths ivan blinked grounds sir he hazarded what is or are the substances of your complaint or complaints against each other it was understood from the beginning to be a temporary deal yet you took permanent oath all the same er yes sir do you happen to be able to remember what you said yes repeat it for the court please ivan did so stumbling less than he had the first time and leaving out the of sound mind and body part because he was afraid the lady lawyer would laugh falco turned to tej is that as you also remember it lady vorpatril yes sir count vorpatril she glanced at ivan and ventured so what are the usual grounds for divorce on barrayar count vorpatril sir falco folded his arms on his desk smiling toothily well lets just run down the list shall we did either of you at the time of your marriage bear a concealed mutation tejs eyebrows rose for a moment almost haughty or hautlike i was genecleaned at conception certified free of over five thousand potential defects mm no doubt and the cetagandan element has undergone recent revision of precedent here so that wont count either besides i believe ivan knew of your ancestry yes sir count vorpatril sir ivan falco prodded huh ivan started oh you know im fine sir so we all have long hoped falco murmured well that disposes of that issue next adultery do either of you accuse the other of adultery theres hardly been time sir said ivan indignantly you would be amazed at the tales i have heard upon this dais lady tej no count vorpatril sir falco paused ahor admit to it they both shook their heads tej looked peeved really she whispered to ivan well lets see what next desertion obviously not nonsupport i beg your pardon sir said tej does your spouse supply you with adequate food clothing shelter medical care ohyes sir abundantly vorbarra sultana cuisine is just amazing ive gained a kilo since we got here lady vorpatrils dresser helped me find the right clothes ivans flat is very nice and medical issues um havent come up wed cover it ivan assured her whatever it was god forbid of course and i see you too are looking quite healthy captain vorpatrilhm hm what else do we have here falco made play ivan was sure of consulting some notes does he do this performance for every divorce petition or are we special abusephysical mental emotional sir said tej staring up in palpable confusion does your husband beat you no do you beat him no said ivan good grief sir does he insult you certainly not their voices overlapped on that one does ivan restrict your mobility your choices your access to your family or friends he got me a groundcar permit i have more choices than i know what to do with and my familytej bit her lipis out of reach for other reasons sir ah yes said falco pardon an old barrayarans clumsiness sir tej startled and clearly moved by this apology returned an uncertain nod theres rish shes the closest thing to family i have left she lives with us so we must cross off abuse as well what about denial of marital rights sir said tej what does that mean in barrayaran falco smiled when was the last time you had sex he clarified oh this morning sir tej thought for a moment then volunteered it was really good two snickers sounded from the back of the room ivan did not deign to turn his head and congratulations ivan falco murmured under his breath you wily old bastard why are you yanking us around like this ivan thought but did not dare say it aloud and so what are we down to here said falco hm hm denial of children tej looked taken aback weve never discussed it its only a temporary marriage sir ivan said children would be er rather permanent so we all hope and pray said falco tej twisted a strand of her hair in doubt though i suppose if ivan xav wanted an egg donation something could be arranged my mother sold eggs when she and my father were first married to raise venture capital ivan rather thought all of the barrayarans in the room blinked at this even the ones behind him he would not look around falco recovered his balance and continued so that one does not hold up either im afraid were reaching the bottom of my legal barrel here captain and lady vorpatril do either of you have anything else to offer but said tej in a confused voice it was the deal yeah there you go sir said ivan breachofpromise thats some kind of illegal isnt it falcos bushy white eyebrows climbed breachofpromise ivan is where an expectation of marriage is denied not where an expectation of divorce is denied also the complainant has to show palpable harm he looked them both over and just shook his head the clerk passed falco a swiftlyscribbled note he squinted read it and nodded do either of you make any financial claims upon the other no said tej and no said ivan now that is interesting and nearly unique if i may say so falco sat back sighing at length his tapping fingers stilled he drew a breath it is the ruling of this counts court that the respondents lord ivan xav vorpatril and lady akuti tejaswini jyoti ghem estif arqua vorpatril have no grounds for the dissolution of their respective freely spoken marital oaths your petition is denied case closed the clerk reached over and banged the spear butt in its rest with two loud echoing clacks tejs mouth had fallen open ivan was so stunned he could scarcely suck in air to sputter but but butyou cant do that sir of course i can said falco serenely thats what i come here every session to do in case you missed the turn ivan sit listen to people form and deliver judgments his smile stretched endlessly it seemed i do this quite a lot you know falco confided to tej sometimes i begin to imagine ive heard it all yet every once in a while theres still some new surprise human beings are so endlessly variable but didnt you say youd talked to my mother said ivan desperately oh yes at great length falco leaned forward for the last time his expression chilling down and for a moment ivan was conscious that he stood not before an elderly relative but a count of barrayar these are some words not from your mother do not ever again attempt to play fast and loose with solemn oaths in any jurisdiction of mine captain and lady vorpatril if you should in the future acquire grounds for your petition you may again bring it but my courtwhich is very busy i must point out and has no time for frivolous suitswill not hear you again on the same matter in less than onehalf year but moaned ivan still in shock even he wasnt sure but what falco made a fingerflicking gesture out ivan good day lady tej countess vorpatril hopes to see you both at vorpatril house in the near future count falco jerked his head at the sergeantatarms who came forward and grasped ivan by the sleeve towing him gently but inexorably toward the door tej followed bewilderment in every line of her body a mob of people waiting to enter shouldered impatiently past them as they cleared the doorframe and stood directionless in the corridor and the sergeantatarms turned his attention to herding the newcomers toward their respective benches the door closed on the babble although it opened again in a moment to emit the lawyer papers and files stacked in her arms she twisted around her stack and reached into her case to extract a card which she handed to ivan my number captain ivan took it in numb fingers is thisif we want legal advice no love its for if you ever want a date she trod away up the hall laughing by the time she reached the far end of the corridor the echoes had died but then she glanced back and her unlawyerly giggles burst forth once more as she turned down the stairwell holding onto each other like two people drowning ivan and tej staggered out of the archaic building and into watery earlywinter sunlight apparently still married at least i was right about one thing ivan thought it did only take ten minutes chapter thirteen tej paced up and down ivan xavs living room ivan xav sat with a drink in his hands occasionally putting it down in favor of holding his head instead rish perched on the couch with her feet drawn up listening to their tale at first with gratifying disbelief then with increasing and much less gratifying impatience which was now edging into exasperation i still cant believe that one old man who wasnt even there could cancel out my deal like that fumed tej i thought this was supposed to be all fixed up in advance it was it seemsbut not by me said ivan xav sounding morose that was my first mistake going to someone who knows mamere we should have taken this to some judge who didnt know me from a hole in the ground let alone since childhood total strangers wouldnt have known what the hell was going on and might have let us just slide on through so what do you have to do said rish to provide these grounds they want ivan xav shook his head divorce turns out to be a lot of work way more than i thought there has to be something lets go down your list again said rish in an annoyingly reasonable tone squaring her shoulders mutation couldnt one of you pretend to be a mutant well not tej i suppose but the captain here is just a natural conceptiona bodybirth if you can believe it run him through an exhaustive enough gene scan something would be bound to turn up that you could pretend to object to no said ivan xav incensed besides it would go down on the courts public record think what it would do to my reputation dear god id never get laid on this planet again rish tilted her head in concession all right so what about this adultery thing which i gather isnt about being a grownup something we could probably use around here but about sleeping with someone when youre married to someone else sounds easy enough pleasurable even who with for pitys sake said tej the only other male i even know very well on this benighted world is byerly ivan xav set down his drink with a thunk that sloshed it over the edge of the glass you are not sleeping with byerly who else have i even met here well theres the coz and the gregor i suppose but be reasonable anyway theyre both taken tej added after a moment and simon illyan was very nice too but no just no justno no said ivan xav so many kinds of no i cant even count the ways thats what i just said tej eyed him in speculation i dont suppose you could sleep with byerly only if i can watch murmured rish no said ivan xav nobody is sleeping with byerly all right frostily rish cleared her throat ivan xav waved his arms you know what i mean neither tej nor i are sleeping with byerly separately or together a foursome now theres a thought purred rish you know i bet we could persuade by to stop teasing poor ivan xav rish said tej he was getting an alarming flush if you cant say something to the point just give over rish looked at ivan xav dont you have any old girlfriends you could call on for a favor sure but theyre mostly married now even dono and olivia wouldnever mind jealous husbandsspousesi figured i was done dealing with that kind of excitement in my life its just no fun anymore yknow hasnt been for a while both women stared at him in bemused silence after a moment he stirred uncomfortably and took another swallow of his wine rish sat back what else was there oh yes abuse i am not beating tej ivan xav glowered at rish you im less and less sure about rish snickered you couldnt lay a hand on me if you tried naturalboy ivan xav sighed avoiding conceding the point besides itd get me in so much trouble with so many peopleafter mamere uncle aral and aunt cordeliaand simonthered be miles and ekaterin and all the koudelka girls lining up to deal with the remains and their mother and gregor and desplainsgod there wouldnt be enough left of me to carry to court in a bucket hell a teacup ivan xav sat back in what had he been of another gender tej would not have hesitated to describe as a flounce a little too large and surly for the term here rish turned her head toward tej that leaves it up to you but i dont want to hit ivan xav i want to kiss ivan xav try it urged rish just for the experiment her gold eyes glinted reluctantly at rishs gesture ivan xav put down his drink and stood up tej bunched her hand drew it back and poked him in the solar plexus her fist made a little fump sound bouncing off his heavy uniform jacket ivan xav just stared glumly at her what was that supposed to be its really hard tej protested when you dont want to besides it would hurt my hand bloody falco muttered ivan xav sitting back down and retrieving his drink which he drained rish ran her hands through her hair in a ragged swipe look think youre both making this too hard by trying to do the divorce thing first its not necessary desertion wasnt that one of the grounds tej and i go off to escobar change our identities disappear youre got your desertion right there tootle back to court on your own get it done you dont have to drag us into it at all there are time limits about that sort of thing said ivan xav three or four years or was it seven or was that for declaring someone dead he frowned in doubt what does that mean asked tej in barrayaran it means that even though you were gone id still be married to you for several more years i couldnt say remarry in that time or even become betrothed i suppose oh said tej thats right this place only lets people have one spouse at a time doesnt it that wouldnt be a good problem to dump on you would it you might meet someone you liked a strangely unheartening picture didnt she want him to be happy ivan xav on the other hand sat up brightening a trifle that actually could be more of a feature than a bug come to think my mother couldnt very well lean on me to seriously court other women if i was already married huh yeah that docking slot would be all filled up his brow wrinkled not sure what it would do to my hit rate though in that case said rish rolling to her feet i hereby declare this a nonemergency and would appreciate it if you two would clear my bedroom some of us want to sleep ivan xav appeared to give this serious consideration yeah miles goes all frantic and forwardmomentumy when he hits a snag in his plans but i usually prefer to give it a bit of time maybe therell be a better idea come along or the problem will change or if you wait long enough even go away on its own without having to do anything if people dont keep poking at it that is time would certainly do the trick sure said rish cordially i figure it would only take oh youre a naturalmaybe sixty more years unless you die sooner in a groundcar crash that is ivan xav said in a faraway voice yeah that would be the line of least resistance now wouldnt it rish shook her head go to bed screw whats left of your brains out deal with it again in the morning or some other time when i dont have to listen to you two she departed to collect her bedding from the linen closet in the dressing room ivan xav stood up and took tejs hand warm in his warmer one best advice shes offered all night lets justgive it a rest maybe something else will come up as the week wore on ivan contemplated the merits of inertia as a problemsolving technique with growing favor desplains kept him only normally occupied during his workdays there being no real crises at ops this week and ivan being quite unmoved by now by all the synthetic ones although he did garner some enjoyment selecting snarky return memos in the mornings tej continued her language studies or games as she seemed to insist on thinking of them alternated with afternoon visits along with rish to ma kosti even better they brought back culinary homework ivan surreptitiously let his uniform belt out one notch byerly continued to carry off rish most evenings a public service to which ivan could muster no objection the creatures of the night as he began to think of them returned at varied hours he didnt mind it if rish came in quietly although he was less fond of stumbling over byerly at breakfast as ivan was scarfing down his morning groats standing prior to toddling off to ops hq byerly en dishabille in shirtsleeves but slightly less bleary than usual sipped his tea and remarked interesting chitchat last night about you and tej from jon vorkeres of all people countess vorbrettens little brother yknow ivan frowned glad hed left tej sleeping she didnt need to hear anything poisonous what was he doing in one of your venues hey not all of my venues are a hazard to the morality of our vor youth else i should have gently steered him out jon says that gossip among certain of the more fossilized high vor dames in town is that your surprise marriage is a disaster for lady alys for all that she feigns otherwise that tejs haut genes and connections would render any progeny you two might pop utterly disqualified for the imperial camp stool should god forbid anything untoward happen to gregor et al and presumably you disqualified along with them unless you could be persuaded to some second marital attempt i suppose ivan choked on his groats seriously very seriously count rene vorbretten is keeping his jaw clamped shut on the discussion naturally byerly eyed him sidelong ivans brows climbed as the full import of this slowly sank in huh thats an advantage that hadnt crossed my mind but youre right the corners of his mouth tugged up me and my children ducking right out of the vorbarr sultana political crossfireoh superb have to point that out to mamere next time i see her it would cheer her up no end byerly took a delicate sip and inquired what children ivan reddened uh byerly patted his lipscurving in the most maddening waywith his napkin but did not pursue the point it was only as he was entering ops that it occurred to ivan that byerly had been watching his reaction for more reasons than just sly personal amusement no dammit i have never wanted gregors job he almost turned around right there and then to go find by and a body of water to hold his head under till he stopped thinking like that frigging impweasel i bought these bells for my ankles said tej to rish holding them up and shaking them they made a cheery chimetuned to chords not just randomly dissonant if we pushed the furniture back thered be room for a real dance practice i could take jets part keep the beat for you rish wheeled sizing up ivan xavs living room i suppose we could try i have an hour or so till by comes to get me they skinned into their knits and collaborated on shoving sofas and chairs around clearing a nice wide space on the carpet an afternoon without ma kosti was an afternoon when boredom and brooding loomed but tej had thought ahead this time as they began their bends and stretches tej asked asifcasually so by again what do you and he do every night anyway rishs lips twitched really tej you had the same erotic arts tutors that i did use your imagination i mean besides that tej tossed her head impatiently then had to blow stray hair out of her mouth what does he talk about i mean when hes not just camouflaging if his mouth is moving hes camouflaging said rish but added after a few torsotwists usually ah when this encouraging noise did not pry out further clarification tej tried do you still like him wellhe hasnt stopped being interesting yet tej dared do you love him rish snorted hes not the warm and fuzzy sort sweetling neither are you rishs ambiguous smile crept a tiny bit wider before she hid her expression in some toetouches i did meet his infamous cousin dono in passing at a party where by had gone to gossip i thought he wasnt on speaking terms with his family apparently count dono vorrutyer is an exception to the general trendhe laughed when by introduced me delighted apparently by a vorrutyer being even more shocking than himself herself whatever a few overhead reaches still by hasnt spoken to his father for eighteen years his mother has been estranged from everyone for a decade and barely communicates and by secretly helped impsec put his even more obnoxious cousin richars in prison with cause no love lost there on the whole not a closeknit clan how sad notreally oh tej raised her arms and her eyebrows waggling both a long pause while rish stretched hamstrings in vino veritas by calls it she said at last like some primitive native fastpenta except by is almost never as drunk as he appears if hes slurring and staggering hes certainly spinning out lines to catch something when hes actually smashed his diction gets very precise and distant likelike a scientist reporting the results of an unsatisfactory experiment its oddly disturbing tej sat on the floor with her legs out put her hands behind her head and bent to touch her elbows to her knees and waited not in vain her voice and movements slowing rish went on we were watching some old vids of the jewels performances that impsec came up with and testing out some really dreadful barrayaran inebriants which got us onto the subject of sisters somehow which got us onto the subject of his younger sisterit seems they were very close when they were teensby fancied himself quite the brotherly protector till their father as a result of some vile report he had from whoknowswhere accused by of molesting her and went on believing it despite the pair of them protesting to the rafters by says he was more enraged at his father for swallowing the smear than he ever was at the anonymous clown who made it which was when he left school and came east to the capital im not sure if you can disinherit your parents but it seems that break was mutual rish stood on one foot bent backward and touched the sole of the other to the back of her head then alternated tej merely essayed a few less ambitious backbends while she thought this through she finally collapsed to the carpet and asked what in the world did you trade to him for that confession im not at all sure said rish in a tone that frankly echoed this wonder but he was enunciating very clearly just before he passed out tej squinted puts rather a different spin on his choice of careers maybe i think yeah at first i thought he was in it for the money and then for the mischief and then i figured both of those were covers for this crazy barrayaran patriotism all these vor fellows go on and on about then i thought maybe it was for revenge for nailing the guilty now i wonder if this furtive obsession for sorting truth from lies is actually in aid of clearing the innocent that seems like two sides of one coin to me yeah but its like the man bets tails every time hm in which case hm he wont give it up no matter how much he despises the work or his subjects or himself do you thinkthis planet barrayar since this divorce thing snagged up what would you think of staying here for a while longer tej forced herself not to hold her breath rish shrugged its been a more interesting place to visit than i wouldve imagined but i wouldnt want to live here i wantshe hesitatedwhat i had you miss the jewels it wasnt a question rish stretched like a starfish on her back then closed her arms and legs in tight as i would miss my limbs amputated i keep reaching but theyre not there tej buckled the bell straps around her ankles rose and stamped the bells sang back in a ragged chorus ill take jets part she offered again keeping somehow the quaver out of her voice rish rolled to her bare blue feet kicked once in air and took up her position do your best she eyed tej more closely dont worry sweetling i wont abandon you on this benighted world well get out together thats not quite what i meant rish tej bit her lip nodded extended her arms and bent her legs taking up the complex rhythm at the hub of the wheel heelandtoe the music and motion flowed up through her body and out her spiraling fingertips as she turned to track her spinning partner around the circles rim ivan encountered by in the lobby of his building entering just ahead of him hey wait up he called and by paused ivan shifted his dinner bag from hand to hand and asked you going up to see rish were heading out for the evening yes goodoh they entered the uptube together ivan pictured himself demanding of by what are your intentions toward my sisterinlaw in the best paterfamilias style and winced trouble was by might answer but as they exited to the hallway outside ivans flat his steps slowed nonetheless by stopped with him looking his inquiry about rish youre not making her like fall in love with you or anything are you because you could be reassigned or something and have to drop her and i dont want to be stuck in a flat full of weeping angry women with no male to take it out on but me by tilted his head in appreciation of this concern no i seem to be on the case at least until they decamp for escobar has your ah nondivorce affected the timetable on that i have no idea have you asked uhno i see by was dressed in casual garb not evening wear planning a night in not a night out apparently ivan went on in covert hope so ahany chance that youll invite her to move in with you save steps and all that or that shell decide to move in with you bys hooded eyes grew amused the topic has not come up but you could make it come up couldnt you strue id rather hug a snake but theres no accounting for tastes sssshe is amazingly flexible by agreed i expect she could crush my skull with her thighs alone very talented thighs i could be in danger of my life every time we go to bed just think of the obituary ivan heroically resisted the straight line not to mention the spinning visions this comment engendered you could make her happy just by getting her off my couch or off on my couch i suppose except it was possible by already had dammit i want my furniture back by snorted happy god no i couldnt make her happy not in a thousand years ivans brows rose in surprise i dont get it she seems tolerably amused by you i mean youve made her laugh ive heard her by waved a dismissive hand she wont be happy till shes reunited with her odd sibs the other jewels theyre more than just a troupe or a team or even a family i suspect something gengineered ivans nose wrinkled are you suggesting theyre some sort of cetagandan posthuman group mind or or something no not that definitely not by her account of some of their arguments something much more visceral i suspect some sort of kinesthetic biofeedback in play its not at all obvious when you see her in isolation you have to see her with the others uh when did this happen i had impsec galactic affairs scrounge me some recordings of the jewelss performances itsno its not clear but it becomes subtly apparent if you watch them over enough that the jewels were sustaining each other somehow but rish alone isstarving isnt the word i dont know what is by had forgotten to be smarmy as his eyes narrowed in memory and thought so whats the difference bys hand reached out and closed as if trying to grasp something elusive rish with the jewels looks like a woman with a beating heart rish in exile looks likea woman with a muscle in her chest that pumps blood ivan tried to unravel this yknowi havent the least idea what youre on about by by rubbed his forehead and laughed shortly yeah neither do i you should watch the vids sometime though is tej in any of em no ah they walked on ivan coded open his door a sound of bells and rhythmic thumping wafted out they entered to find tej and rish engaged in some sort of vigorous dance practice tej spared ivan a flashing smile as she turned and stomped she seemed to dance with every part of her from her toes to her face the expressive movements of her arms reminded him for a moment of the quaddies the cadences moved through her generous flesh as though her body danced with itself joyously ivans lips parted rish spotting by glinted a grin like a sickle moon hung in an evening sky and switched from spinning along around a wide circle like some planetary epicycle to a kind of precise handtohandtofoottofoot rotation a blue spider turning cartwheels ivan blinked dizzily as the grin rolled upside down with each turn nownow thats just showing off he muttered to by for just a second by grinned back though not at him tej who seemed to be performing the same function as the drummer in a band backing the lead singer brought the bells and thumps to a graceful closure the two women stretched and made obeisance to each other for all the world like two martial arts players completing a satisfactory round ivan wasnt sure whod won rish waved at by and dashed toward the lav a quick shower and ill be right with you ivan put the dinner bags down on the table and watched as tej arrestingly warm and breathless sat on the carpet and began to unbuckle the ankle bells by folded his arms and leaned against the wall till tej and ivan drafted him to help pull furniture back into place ivan sighed meaningfully at his couch but he wasnt sure if by got the message the creatures absconded without dropping any further hints of their intentions anyway all right ivan supposed he was slow hed been told so often enough by his assorted relatives colleagues and socalled friends but it wasnt until tripping over the ankle bells on the way back from the lav in the night and wrapping himself around a warm squirmy sleeping tej that the thought crossed his mind like a bright evasiveunhelpfulshooting star sohow does a fellow ask his own wife to marry him it took him a long time to fall asleep again after that tej tej a hand shook her shoulder tej swam up out of slumber a dim yellow pool of light from the bedside lamp pushed back the shadows ivan xav was sitting on her side of the bed with his trousers on his face in that scrunched expression it wore when hed bitten into something he didnt quite like tej rubbed her eyes and sat up on one elbow what time zit she tried a sleepy smile on him but it won only a return liptwitch a little after ohthreehundred i just got a rather strange call from a customs amp security officer out at the vorbarr sultana shuttleport says theyve detained some fellow out there who claims to be a relative of yours or at any rate he was asking for madame tejaswini arqua vorpatril which is at least partright what tej sat bolt upright who supposedly some escobaran tourist named dr dolbraco dax held up because of irregularities customs said although the fellows documentation seemed to be all in order im not sure what that meant except that this dax fellow was insistent that if you would come identify him you could straighten it all out thats amiris identity tej cried scrambling from her covers oh whats he doing here we have to go out there ivan xav prudently ducked out of the way as she lunged for her clothes well either your brother or some really clever bounty hunter morozov was pretty sure some of those would be showing up in due course although a bounty hunter would have to be downright crazy to try a snatch in the middle of shuttleport security ivan xav scratched his stubbled chin or maybe just lazy not as far to drag you to the exit after all most of them actually are crazy but tejs thoughts whirled as she shoved her head through her turtleneck and clawed her hair free if its really amiri how did he find me here put your shirt on she crawled back across the rumpled bed in search of her socks did your impsec people contact him or something shouldnt think hed have been detained in that case ivan xav shook his head though i could seeif miles gossiped to mark or kareen about you and me and he probably couldnt resist doing so mark might have told this lily durona woman who runs his clinic who could have said something to your brother i cant guess how much information might have been dropped out or added with each link or how it was spun mark and i umdont always get along as tej got him dressed and pulled him toward the door ivan xav added im leaning toward bounty hunters myself i did alert my impsec outer perimeter though i dont much care to talk to those fellows if i dont have to but at least itll give the night shift something to do that doesnt involve voyeurism i expect theyll like that voyeurism despite her hurry tej froze i hope thats a joke well i hope so too confessed ivan xav grant you i gave up asking them questions i didnt want to hear the answers to some time back shaking her head tej abandoned this side issue and shoved him into the hallway for the first time ever as his twoseater arrowed out through the wintry margins of the city she thought that ivan xav was driving too slowly she leaned forward anxiously into her seat straps as the civilian shuttleport at last rose into view this was her first look at the place as theyd come downside before via the military shuttleport where arrangements had been very different vbs main looked very much like every other big galactic port shed ever seenunder construction ivan xav wove handily around worksite barricades fortunately he seemed to know where he was going and the place was thinly populated at this dark offhour his military id whisked them past the first layer of security like a magic wand at which point they were met by a man in a customs uniform a lieutenant in military undress greens with impsec horuseyes on his collar and hurrying up last byerly and rish out of breath the customs man stepped back at the sight of rish his lips parting in astonishment but he glanced at the unreactive impsec fellow swallowed and carried on ive arranged a preliminary look through a monitor for you madame vorpatril the customs man told her and it was a sign of something that ivan xav didnt correct the title as it seemed to be thought that there could be some safety and security issue tej wasnt sure if his irritated glance at the impsec officer suggested a conflict of jurisdictions or procedures or just the accumulated frustrations of trying to get impsec to give a straight answer to any question the customs man guided them through a codelocked door labeled authorized personnel only and threaded a maze of office corridors mostly with doors shut for the night down two floors through some utilitarian tunnels smelling of dry concrete and machine oil up again then to an unlabeled door in a broader corridor some kind of satellite security office judging by the consoles on duty was only a single clerk who gave way to the customs officer and gestured to the vid nothing of interest so far sir the plate showed four views of what appeared to be a midsized private waiting room brightly lit if a touch shabby neither luxury lounge nor prison chamber the ambiguous space was occupied by nine people and many jumbled piles of luggage the figures were variously sitting up looking very bored or lying across rearranged chairs and cases uncomfortably dozing three men and six women tejs heart seemed to stop beating altogether can you pick out this dr dax asked the impsec lieutenant she gulped for breath for rising joy for hope unlookedfor i can pick out everybody rish was staring over the vid display with wide devouring eyes the baronne she breathed and dada said tej and star and pidge and em and pearl andis that grandmama what happened to her hair said rish faintly ivan xavs brows climbed byerly looked suddenly very blank tej grabbed the customs man by the front of his uniform jacket she really hadnt meant to lift him off his feet it just happened take me to them take us to them right now chapter fourteen two armed shuttleport security guards stood alert outside the entrance to the waiting room ivan noted at once the arqua clan had been sequestered well apart from the usual transients but delicately not yet in criminal detention that area lay conveniently nearby though through those unmarked double doors at the corridors end if he was recalling the labyrinthine layout of this place correctly ivan decided not to mention this to the frantic tej or to the jittering rish judging from bys narrowed glances around he was making similar estimates the guards made way as the customs amp immigration officer a senior shift supervisor named mahon coded open the waitingroom door tej and rish nearly fell over him and each other blasting through my parents i thought they were dead tej squeaked as she elbowed the man out of her path a jerk of bys chin invited ivan to note the vid recorder the customs officer clutched in his hand mahon regained his balance and murmured to ivan all those names madame vorpatril was rattling offyou do realize none of them match the documentation these people were traveling under a thin smile turned his mouth as of an earnest official contemplating wellhoned instincts rewarded is that going to be a problem said ivan definitely i just dont know what kind yet or whose he and the wary impsec lieutenant zumboti exchanged calculating stares ivan twitched and corrected lady vorpatril for the first time just in case zumboti took the precaution of unholstering his stunner and easing off the safety though he held his hand discreetly down at his side before shouldering in ahead of ivan a beat and his glance back gave permission for ivan to enter the chamber was transmuting from sleepy grouchy boredom to shrieking chaos as various arquas looked up one after another and saw tej and rish ivan had just time to confirm that no one was drawing a weapon as tej flew directly to a stout grayhaired mahoganyfaced man who barely made it to his feet before catching her in an astonished bearhug ivan had moment to watch unobserved as his eyes squeezed shut lids glistening with moisture mouth opening in a huff of an exhalation under tejs impact it seemed wrong somehow to look uninvited upon a mans face so deeply disarmed so naked with emotion ivan tore his glance away to see rish somersault through the air and fetch up kneeling neatly at the feet of the very tall woman with short dark hair held in a jeweled headband and crouch to touch the sandaled toes the woman hastily bent and raised her up into an embrace as well her face was vastly more reserved than that of her spouse but her expression was unnervingly intense for all its restraint all hopes delivered the pairs parted to share another hug fourabout and then the mob closed in ivans eyes flicked madly trying to identify them allif they would only stand still for a minute or better yet line up he might have a fighting chance two young women were taller than tej although not as tall as their motherivan mentally dubbed them fit and fitter before memory of the scans hed been shown kicked in fit was pidge the middle sister sporting redbrown skin redbrown hair and cinnamon eyes dressed in something bluegreen and flowing her taller older and impossibly even fitter sister star shared the spicy skin with sleek ebony hair drawn back in a tight knot complemented by her utilitarian black pantsuit her startling icegreen eyes recalled those of her mother the baronne the assorted jewels were thank god colorcoded and much easier to sort out ivan barely blinked at emeralds green and glittering skin and sunlightonleaves colored hair or the slim woman with pointed ears and white skin laced with silver her snowwhite hair clipped in a similar short peltpearl obviously their pantsuits would probably be travelrumpled if they dared the two young male figures were less instantly recognizable although ivan managed to arrive at them by process of elimination they lacked the arqua height of their elder sisters being barely as tall as byerly the one had crisp black hair and dark olive skinhe likely could pass for an escobaran the second more thickset fellow had mahogany skin like the barons but weirdly patchy flecks of onyxblack and silver peeked through here and there his ears alone among the jewels were roundanother change from that old group portrait of morozovs both men were dressed in escobaranstyle street clothes shortsleeved hemmed shirts worn untucked over trousers onyx presumably and amiri cried tej flinging herself on him in turn you look so different jet the oliveskinned man embraced her his eyes closing briefly as if in prayer youre alive youre both alive but oh his eyes snapped open again in anger shot with joy crackling with both weve been waiting for months never heard a word untilwe didnt know if you were alive or dead im sorry im sorry tej laughcried back we ran out of money we ran out of luck we ran out of of nearly everything rish held out one of the other mans muscular arms and reached to touch the outer curve of an ear youre so big and your beautiful skinwhats wrong with it nothing permanent he assured her folding her in a fresh hug just a treatment to blend in on escobar wearing off the extra fifteen kilos is mostly muscle but i needed some fat to change the shape of my face the duronas supplied tej danced in a circle arms outspread as if to take in everyone oh how did you find me how did you get away why are you all here and you brought grandmama too standing a little aside from the whole show watching with cool approval was the tallest woman of all taller than ivan she wore loose silky trousers shirt and a light kneelength coat in an indeterminate planetary style she was very straightbacked yet thin and faintly frail agesoftened skin clad bones of timeless elegance her bright silver hair was cut in short wisps around her perfectlyshaped head tej bowed before her hands held palmtopalm in a respect only enhanced by the pleasure overflowing from her face a pale hand as delicate as an ice sculpture moved to rest palmdown among her wild curls in a gesture of benediction indeed the woman murmured the customs officer with another chary look around at all the wildly gesticulating and madly babbling arquas edged closer to ivan better the vor lord that you knew than the jacksonians that you didnt he said not quite out of the corner of his mouth are these really relatives of yours captain lord vorpatril about to hotly deny any such absurdity ivans mouth opened and hung at halfcock well erin a sense that is that would be my fatherinlaw my motherinlawhe nodded variouslyand my um siblingsinlaw all of them yeah pretty much i know they dont look alike its kind of hard to explain he took a breath yes he added after a vaguely shattered pause and myuhthat lady over there would be my grandmotherinlaw my wifes mothers mother widowed ivan was suddenly profoundly grateful for that a wizened ghemgeneral would surely tip this barrel right over wait no this wasnt the whole set after all it seemed the eldest brother eric was still missing and a couple of the jewelsruby and what was the other one topaz that was it maybe it wasnt just jumplag and umpteen hours in barrayaran detention that gave the arqua crew that edgy exhausted air the customs officer looked as if he was thinking hard and fast ivan eyed him uneasily tej grabbed ivan by the arm and towed him over to face the baron the baronne and lady ghem estif ivan was sorry now he wasnt shaved and in uniform instead of stubbled and in wrinkled civvies grabbed off his bedroom floor though he supposed it made him evenall with the travelworn arquas in a voice gone breathless and shy tej said dada baronne grandmotherthis is my barrayaran husband lord ivan xav vorpatril as if she had several other husbands of various planetary origins tucked away somewhere hes not a lord of anything though the three elders swung piercing gazes upon ivan their smiles chilled right down lily durona had said as much said the baron it all sounded very odd said the baronne not at all illuminating said lady ghem estif the wedding was a bit impromptu said tej but at the time it saved me and rish from a world of trouble ill explain later the barons heavy features lightened only marginally it was the mans height and broad build ivan decided that reminded him subliminally and uncomfortably of count falco and his edginess that recalled even more uncomfortably uncle aral in a mood yikes how do you do sir maam haut ivan managed belatedly grateful for every lesson in diplomacy his mother had ever tried to inflict on him the last being the proper form of address to a haut lady if a touch flattering to one culled and demoted to ghem lady ghem estifs silver brows rose in surprise in any case she did not offer to correct it god what next i am pleased to meet you was a diplomatic lie of the first order beyond his scope right now his mouth moved on automatically to how may i help you wait no the baron brightened a touch more with a surprised glance under those heavy lids at his daughter right answer by all means lets find out pidge come here the woman in the flowing bluegreen trouser outfit stepped up alertly baron the baron waved the customs officer forward officer mahon i think the time has come for you to talk with our lawyer the baronette sophia arqua pidges formal name and courtesy title ivan dimly recalled she will speak for our group are you oathbound to practice law on barrayar maam asked mahon stiffly pidge smiled warmly across at him eyetoeye i am primarily trained in galactic law and trade law with some experience in criminal law i have made a special intense study of barrayaran law in the past two weeks however ivan wonderedon jacksons whole how literally did she mean criminal law the conundrum would seem to be whether we are still house cordonahshe cast a nod at her father who nodded backand so due all appropriate diplomatic protocol or whether we are houseless persons seeking asylum under the aegis of a barrayaran vor relative and due all assistance as such thats not nearly the only two questions mahon swinging toward the impsec lieutenant held out a hand in either direction or plea ivan wasnt sure zumboti took a neutral pose not quite parade rest and observed to the air it is impsecs mandate to secure the imperium against threats of violence ive seen none on offer here so far strictly bureaucratic issues are not normally our department what was impsec giving its officers a short course in disingenuity now probably mahon rubbed his forehead and muttered two hours it took ivan a moment to realize he was likely referring to his endofshift when the day officers would be coming on and ivan was reminded with a glance at his wristcom when he was due at ops so would mahon play this out till then in order to dump it on his senior colleagues and escape in any case he looked marginally happier to be presented with a single arqua to argue with rather than all of them at once and a gorgeous female at that a little weakly he allowed pidge to glow at him take him by the arm and lead him aside bending her head to murmur at him in an intimate tone shiv arquas gaze shifted around to at last snag on byerly standing behind rish a brow cocked and who is this by with covert reluctance stepped forward rish cleared her throat baron baronne haut may i present my um friend byerly vorrutyer byerly managed a tolerably noncroggled bow my pleasure to be sure aye by was the trained professional liar star strolling up sniffed umfriend so it would appear really rish your taste in men he has to be a natural barrayaran vor certainly said lady ghem estif with the air of an entomologist observing a familiar species of beetle though not a lord by put in with a specious helpfulness but a friend said the baron to rish that edge was back truly rish put on the spot shrugged wellfriendly ill explain later all right bys stance eased the barons suspicious glower seemed to slot him into a class by himself provisionally very provisionally which wasnt wrong so were the news vids all lies said tej there were pictures of your bodies yes that made it rather awkward for prestene to report our escape when we followed star and the girls to earth said the baronne dryly ruby topazeric said rish is everything horrible made not so yes and no the baronne told her ruby made it to fell station we believe and is under the protection of baron fell for the moment seppe is apparently with her though fallen into contractdebt to house fell for his medical treatment ivan watched a tremble run through tejs body she exhaled and ran the back of her wrist over her eyes that was the yes said rish her voice was growing quieter the baronne nodded topazdid not get off the station when we did as far as we presently know she remains hostage eric said tej her voice too had fallen low shiv arqua grew grim its hard to say prestene claims to have his body cryopreserved how revivable he may be we do not know tej swallowed so did ivan almost worse than death that boundless uncertainty in his experience arqua grimaced fool boynothing he defended was worth his life once you girls were away he should have surrendered perhaps he did murmured the baronne and her husband pressed his teeth together did you get out right after stars group then asked rish oddly wary that question oddly hopeful the baronne ran a hand through her short hair almost dislodging the defiantly bright band across her forehead no not for some weeks they shaved my head when they took me among the other things they triedfor all the good it did them her eyes flashed in some dark triumph it will grow back we will grow everything back now weve rescued the pair of you uh we sort of rescued ourselves tej pointed out tentatively when no one responded to this she turned and added but grandmama what happened to your hair then a muscle jumped in lady ghem estifs fine jaw i sold it back on earth all three meters of it confirmed star at auction it went for a fabulous sum which we needed at that point far more money than i would have believed possiblethere are collectors it turns out and absolute provenance since we allowed the winner to cut it himself emerald at her shoulder muttered i still think he had a fetish pearl nodded ruefully the baronne her own dark hair regrown barely fingerlength beneath the red band said nothing at all the story under that silencewell ivan would doubtless get it later too no visible damage marred her skin but it was not nearly so luminous as in the younger scans pallid almost these people are really tired that was a pretty amazing sacrifice for a haut woman ivan offered this seeming a less fraught topic i once met some of the ladies of the star creche itself on eta ceta some years ago their nevercut hair was a major statusmarker lady ghem estifs expression went rather opaque it is long she stated since i left the star creche she hesitated looking at ivan more sharply do the consorts speak with outlanders now it was a special um event what was your clan that is your haut constellation of origin before you married the ghem general rond lady ghem estif delivered the flat monosyllable without emotion the rond were one of the midgrade cetagandan constellations though that was like saying one of the midgrade billionaires but she regarded ivan with the faintest new spark ofless disapproval as though he might be trainable with the right program of exercises and rewards byerly sucked on his lower lip his expression baffled officer mahon and pidge returned from the corner where theyd been talking in rapid undervoices mahons lips were screwed up in something less than joy but better than hostility pidge looked unsettlingly serene mahon blew out his breath this is what i can offer tonight to get you people out of here and into some more comfortable location if captain vorpatril here will speak for you as the barrayaran subject to whom you are related pledging his word and posting a bond i can release you into his temporary custody as applicants for asylum this allows you a twoweek limited visa while waiting for judicial review with an opportunity for extensions should the review take longer kicking the problem upstairsmuch the best choice ivan would sympathize except given the numerous irregularities not to mention outright falsifications in your travel documentation for which you can yes plead mitigating circumstancesa fending gesture at pidgeyou should not count on your application being finally approved but at least his voice dropped as if talking to himself possibly as the one sane person here i have forms to cover it all tej turned to ivan her bright eyes thrilled oh yes i knew you could do it ivan xav ivan tried to point out that he hadnt done anything yet but the words stuck in his throat especially when tej spared a hug for him this is not my fault right right he glanced at by who blinked back palpably unhelpfully bond ivan said to mahon is that like a pledge of credit or do you need cash down cash im afraid captain times nine although i may be able to arrange a group discount and a spoken oath given your rank ah how many forms multiplied by nine no he wasnt going to make it to ops on time today was he ivan drew a deep inhalation in that case officer mahon i need to make some calls mahon was efficient documentation hell only ran an hour and a half past the end of his shift either conscientious or curious he stayed to see things through ivan read aloud off mahons cheat sheet a number of promises to take responsibility for a number of things over which as far as he could see he had no control whatsoever making it official the arquas watched this barrayaran step with the inquisitiveness of metropolitans come down to take in a backcountry show at a district fair this dumped ivan tej the nine new arquas and their small mountain of luggage into a rented groundvan headed for downtown vorbarr sultana at the peak of morning traffic by and rish whod come out to the shuttleport by the new bubble tubein service this week for a change however temporarilydrove ivans twoseater on ahead ivan wondered what they were saying to each other conversation in the van had drifted off to a sleepdeprived muttering by the time they arrived at the hotel just down the block from ivan xavs flat it seemed a middling sort of place built in a functional mode during the reign of emperor ezar with patchy upgrades since but the location could scarcely be bettered ivan xav saw them all registered which seemed to involve displays of both his credit and military ids then drew tej aside now i really have to run to ops dont let them do anything awful till i get back right in fact dont let them do anything i think everyone wants to sleep first thatd be all right yeah do that he kissed her and fled surprisingly rish managed to scrape by off at the lobby lift tubes he bade her a fond farewell exiting at the seventhfloor lifttube foyer rish paused and picked what seemed to be a piece of metallic lint from under her collar murmured nice try by love and kisses and made smacking noises into it and deposited it in the waste chute at tejs sideways look she merely shrugged ivan xav had somehow managed to secure rooms all in a row for them a twobedroom suite for the seniors with a central lounge connected on either side to bedrooms that absorbed amiri and jet and star pidge pearl and emerald plus their luggage they all returned as swiftly as they could to the sitting room where tej and rish were recounting once more the tale of their long flight and took up perches to listen and inevitably to critique when tej came to the part about ivan xavs clever marital rescue on komarr she glanced at amiri and jet and left out the bit about the balcony saying only we werent thinking too straight by then i guess we were both so tired you werent thinking at all as far as i can see said pidge tartly good grief tej youre as scatterbrained as ever pearl turned to rish and you let her it worked out said rish defensively dada held up a thick hand to stem an incipient and wellworn digression into personalities if adding mildly though really tejlove we could have negotiated you a favorable deal for a house heir anytime these past five years all those wasted opportunities just to end up with a barrayaran this was tolerable only because he had accepted tejs every no well no thank you dada on said deals for five years straight with no more demur than an occasional wince and grunt at least dada wouldnt complain that ivan xav was a natural being one himself nor could the baronne without blatant hypocrisy not that she couldnt find other grounds this vorpatril fellow turns out to be quite interesting for a barrayaran i will allow that said the baronne if i thought it was guile and not blind luck i would be quite proud of you both ordid you know of his highlevel connections before negotiating this strange oral contract for free no less said star in an aggrieved undervoice tej no sighed tej we only found out after figures murmured pearl did you look him up tej asked the baronne back on escobar of course as soon as lily passed us thatat the time it seemed a very garbled rumor but actually it seems correct in more details than i would have believed not that we werent overjoyed to have finally located you two but how closely does that boy actually stand the to barrayaran imperial throne oh blast the baronne had already stumbled onto that angle well of course she had she was the baronne camp stool tej corrected in a small voice when the gregor has to sit in ceremony on account of vor being a military caste the baronne waved away this distinction tejremembered a plaque in a street that groundcars ran over rish put in there are quite a few more bodies between him and that position than when he was younger apparentlyplus hed have to win a couple of civil wars with rival claimants to hear him tell it he was never the only potential heir grandmama lifted a quelling finger i would advise against pursuing that direction udine dear there are many safer approaches you might work in aid of our aims here and i promise you you do not want to get bogged down in extended altercations with the locals she gave the impression of a delicate shudder without actually shuddering tej cast her a grateful glance dada grunted not disagreeing still hes in their military said star he cant be totally clueless in a crunch maybe we could use him in our security our new security when we set it up or in administration said pidge you say hes a kind of secretary or in hospitality said jet with an amused snicker how well does he strip tej glowered at him the baronne waved this aside pursing her lips but apparently hes been kept close confined here in the capital under the eyes of his handlers for nearly the whole of that career chained to a desk which is i suppose kinder than chained in a cage keeps him out of trouble just the same to be sure he really works said tej not very loudly admiral desplainsthats his ops bossvalues him what desplains had actually told her was despite ivans erratic personal life hes never once made an error in identifying hidden political stakes rare talent that or had that been political snakes confusing so i should think said the baronne this military chief must gain considerable cachet for harboring such a princeling on his staff almost a jewel i wonder what his deal was behind the scenes in return for taking on such a charge he likes ivans work said tej though completeness forced her to add mostly the baronne sat back and tapped her fingers on the sofa arm she said unhopefully i dont suppose youve had any ideas how best to exploit him have you tej having hador is that enjoyed the closest observation really baronne do you have to point that out tej twitched uncomfortably the gregthe barrayarans were going to give us a ride in secret to escobar on a government courier ship it would have given a clean break for rish and me to lose the bounty hunters i thought that was enough star sniffed there are much more direct ways to dispose of bounty hunters tej star had been the understudy of the house cordonah security chiefa department which had failed signally to stave off the present debacle tej was reminded with a pang of frustration tej restrained herself from escalating the critique the most important part of the takeover had been in behindthescenes deals on financial and diplomatic levels anywayyeah pidges department wasnt that star just liked lots of big guns so what did you do about prestenes hired meat they must have followed you four as well said tej to star star lifted her chin proudly they met with fatal accidents of course dada with a practiced fingerflicking gesture suppressed this sidetrail as well tejs turn to tell her tale em said still such a ridedepending on what they wanted you to trade for itwould have saved this expensive side jaunt to collect you two too bad you couldnt have brought it off two weeks back well there was the divorce thing we were waiting for the what said dada with a reluctant sigh tej plunged into an account of her and ivan xavs trip to new evias and count falcos strange archaic court with its unexpected nonresult dada rubbed his lips thoughtfully as she wound down his dark eyes crinkling i expect we may simply ignore this local wrinkle when we leave alternatively should you wish to become a widow you have only to ask it wouldnt be a first im sure something could be arranged no said tej indignantly hoping he was joking she was almost sure he was joking despite being a barrayaran ivan xav wasnt disposable dont be so hotheaded love said the baronne to her mate with a fond smile we shouldnt waste our opportunities before weve thoroughly explored them after all the double meaning of waste might have been intended because the corner of dadas mouth twitched up as it always did when his halfhaut queen indulged in jacksonian gutter slang the baronne never could make it come out quite right dada could authentically when he got on a roll about his old times but tej wasnt sure she liked this swing of the ivan xav pendulum any better star frowned in doubt if your barrayaran husband wanted to get rid of you why didnt he just let the bounty hunters carry you off problem solved from his point of view barrayars a more complicated place than i thought said tej in a possiblyfruitless effort at warning was anyone listening to her an unexpected murmur of support from of all people grandmama indeed we should not go rushing in i want some sleep first before rushing anywhere said dada a yawn cracking his face what a dismal shuttleport bed next for everyone i think nobodys thinking straight should i go out and try to scrounge an arsenal first said star were horribly disarmed here you have to admit said pidge dada was right about not trying to carry ours along it would never have survived that second search wouldve passed the first one though grumbled star before amiri insisted on bringing up that vorpatril fellows name no dont you dare said tej fairly sure that star out cruising back alleys trying to deal for illegal weaponry fell under the heading of something awful especially while this short of sleep and clues for that matter rish came to tejs aid as far as any unwanted visitors from prestene go i think that barrayaran imperial security has us covered for now i know theyre watching out for them and with more resources than we can command here right now dada nodded understanding and agreement my take as well bed chicks and chicklets he stood and stretched cracking joints grumbling the arquas trailed off to their respective roosts dada and the baronne hugged tej and rish a temporary goodbye as they left for ivan xavs flat their grips lingered as if reassuring themselves by the most fundamental sensory means of the girls wellbeing and well being yes call us at ivan xavs number when youre ready to go down to dinner said tej pidge followed them into the hotel corridor we could be halfway through the hegen hub by now if you two had stuck to your original plan she complained this detour is costing us critical resources you know time as much as money i dont know why they didnt just send amiri to collect you none of this is anything like the original plan tej scowled fortunately if you want to be honest if you do just for a change you know with a short gesture pidge batted this shot away were going back to retake the house everyone is pitching ineven amiri everyones expected to help even you tej ran an aggravated hand through her hair which snagged and pulled unhelpfully doing what dada and the baronne for overall strategy of course stars taking security im taking negotiations and the jewels are doing everything they can which is quite a lot you wellthe least you could do is cooperate in making yourself available for a genetic alliance a bargaining chipill bet the baronne can slot you in somewhere dada said i didnt have to and the baronne didnt argue with him that was then this is now we dont have the margin for personal indulgences anymore none of us do dada wouldnt ask me this dada shouldnt have to ask you this isnt it about time you stopped being such a maddening deadweight in the house you had your choice of choices you didnt take any of them youve lost your say id say i dont see you offering up your body as a personal pledge in some side deal who says pidges voice was grim oh so so umcall us when you wake up anyway right pidge flung herself back into the suite tej and rish continued toward the lift tubes rish watched her sideways but for once offered no comment tej loved her family she really did she didnt doubt for an instant that they loved her too in their way but she wondered how shed plunged from soaring elation to glum depression in so few hours chapter fifteen ivan only slightly out of breath but considerably out of sleep entered admiral desplains outer office to find one of the senior ops clerks manning his desk the mornings first pot of coffee had been made and drunk long ago he noted from the dark dregs in the bottom of the pot on the credenza and the faint tarry aroma in the air he checked a desire to scrape out the bottom of the pot with a spoon and eat the residue ah captain vorpatril said the clerk brightening the old man wanted to know as soon as you arrived he keyed his intercom sir captain vorpatril is here finally returned desplainss voice ivan tried to read the tone but from three syllables could only ascertain not joyful send him in ivan trod into his bosss inner sanctum to find the admiral had a visitoran impsec captain ivan saw by his collar pins and tabs as the man twisted in his chair to observe him in turn frowning lean but hqpale saltandpepper hair that tried but failed to make him look older than the midgrade middleaged man he apparently was raudsepp read his nametag they exchanged the briefest of military courtesies desplains was looking faintly harassed and given that the harassment was apparently being delivered by a mere impsec captainbringing the snakes in person decidedly irritated the admiral did not invite ivan to sit so ivan took up a prudent sortof parade rest and waited someone would tell him what was going on shortly they always did however little he wanted to know desplains went on dryvoiced captain raudsepp has just inquired if at the time i signed off on your marriage on komarr i had known what a curious set of relations young lady vorpatril was apparently trailing after her at the time of our marriage on komarr everyone thought tej was an orphan said ivan including tej and rish they seemed pretty happy to find out this was not the case last night and your interest in this is what captain raudsepp until last night i was the galactic affairs officer charged with riding herd on your new wifes alleged bountyhunter threat a relatively routine physical security issue that has so far failed to provide much in the way of action to everyones relief i came in this morning to find my mandate had been unexpectedly upped by a renegade refugee jacksonian baron and most of his extended family about which the critical complaint is the unexpectedly part ah yes impsec did not like surprises too bad surprises were their job in ivans view he wondered if he ought to argue with the renegade tag how could you tell a renegade jacksonian baron from any other sort refugee though yeah sure he did put in immediate family actually in a sense raudsepps brows tightened my heated memo to galactic affairskomarr crossed in the tightbeam stream with an urgent headsup from captain morozov warning us of the partys impending arrival so its good to know that they werent entirely asleep out there if the alert had arrived six hours ahead of the event instead of six hours behind it it might have helped somewhat and so my routine physical security issue has turned into a completely unassessed political security issue as i expect my assessment to be requested very soon it behooves me to make one ivan tilted his head in acknowledgement of the justice of this but resisted being drawn into premature sympathy with a brother officer after all impsec raudsepp narrowed his eyes at ivan why did you sign them out of customs amp security well they looked tired ivan offered hours and hours of bureaucrats on top of jumplag you know the komarr run is a bitch if youre jumpsensitive have you managed to find out yet why theyre here they came to pick up tej and rish wait what take them away for the first time this thought came clear in ivans sleepdeprived mind triggering an unpleasant flutter of panic in his stomach though he supposed he could part with rish without much of a pang but what if tej wanted to go with her check on them anyway he corrected hastily dear god we need to talk parents after all do you have any other observations to report anything of dangeror interestto the imperium all theyve done is land and go to bed ivan stifled a yawn well and fill out a lot of forms you have to have received copies of everything from customs and a report from your outerperimeter night fellowwhat the devil was his namezumboti that was it which means you know about as much as i do so far surely not you have by far the closest view of the affair going back the farthest im not the only one ivan wanted to snap back in fact he didnt even go back the farthest talk to your own damn people what had by gone off to bed without filing a report the rat in my what nine hours of observation all ive seen is some very jumplagged people glad to find their daughters alivethat without doubt had not been some show for his benefitand grateful to be taken to a hotel hang on by was domestic affairs raudsepp had named himself galactic affairs was this another fricking impsec right hand not talking to the left screwup again ivan was so used to byerly by now he perhaps forgot just how high and restricted a level by worked on however erratically should he direct raudsepp to byerly or not maybe it ought to be the other way around isnt trying to cover for by how i got into all this trouble in the first place but captain raudsepp was going on looking ahead then he rummaged in his uniform jacket and withdrew a card which he glanced at and handed to ivan this is my secured comconsole code by which you may contact me directly at any time should you find anything suspicious to report anything at all please call me at once ivan didnt reach for it uh youre asking me to spy on my wifes family for you out of the corner of his eye he saw a slight wince cross desplainss usually impassive features although in reaction to just what aspect of this he couldnt guess you did take formal responsibility for them captain vorpatril as a vor lord not as a military officer different chain of command oh crap that sounded just like one of miless arguments didnt it ivan knew he was on thin ice if hed started channeling his cousin gingerly he took the card glanced at itcode only no other identifying information right one of those and tucked it away in his wallet although raudsepp hesitated looking around the admirals tidy but resourcecrammed officeone whole wall was taken up with desplainss professional library including a few rare volumes going back to the time of isolation it does occur to me nearly everything to do with ops passes through your comconsole captain vorpatril one way or another until this entire situation is clarified it might be more prudent for you to take some personal leave unexceptionable enough for a family emergency certainly ivans jaw tightened so he noticed did desplainss if my loyalty is suddenly that suspect he ground out that should certainly not be my decision to make eh raudsepps brow wrinkled true enough he looked to desplains desplains looked back and said blandly my aide and i will discuss it thank you for your concern captain raudsepp and for your information and your time on this busy morning it was a clear dismissal raudsepp must have run out of questions for now or else hed decided ivan really had run out of answers because he allowed himself to be shifted the ops clerk saw him out this left ivan still standing studying him desplains rubbed his jaw and grimaced so have you become a security risk vorpatril i dont know sir said ivan as honestly as possible nobody tells me anything desplains snorted well then go back to work at least for the moment he waved ivan out but then added oh and call your mother ivan paused on the threshold i suppose i should at that actually hed totally forgotten that little task in the rush of events i should perhaps say call your mother back the voice could have dehumidified the room desplains was giving him that look ah yes sir right away sir ivan retreated to the outer office he evicted the clerk from his desk who was glad enough to get back to his own interrupted tasks settled himself and tapped in a familiar code lady alyss face formed over his vidplate all too promptly which suggested she must have been lying in wait for this ah ivan finally she said unconsciously echoing desplains dammit hed been busy ivan nodded warily mamere its been quite a night i guess youve heard something actually our first word was a copy of captain morozovs memo from komarr which he had strongly requested impsec vorbarr sultana forward to simon happily general allegre can recognize needtoknow when he sees it it came in while we were having breakfast we had a firsthand update a bit later not from you i must point out from who then ivan wanted to ask then realized it would be a redundant question and byerly had probably also acquired breakfast and bed by now of both of which ivan was deprived and looked to stay that way i kind of had my hands full ivan excused himself everyones settled now though temporarily good how is tej taking it and rish overjoyed well imagine how would you feel to get your family back from the dead all unexpected i dont actually have to imagine it ivan she said giving him a peculiar exasperatedfond look and nor do you come to think ivan shrugged embarrassed i suppose not anyway there seemed to be a lot of family feeling of several different kinds in retrospect an only child all his life and his closest cousin the same ivan had occasionally wondered what it would be like to have a big family mameres attention would have been more divided for one thing the panic simmering at the back of his brain seeped out in a suddenly smaller voice he said they uhseem to have come here with some idea of picking up tej and rish and taking them away mamere looked back at him and how do you feel about that ivan a rather long silence fell before he managed very strange lady alyss dark brows quirked well thats something i suppose she sat up more briskly in any case clearly we must have them to dinner at the earliest possible opportunity its the correct thing to do and there is so much to catch up on uh theyre all asleep now jumplagged then they should be both refreshed and hungry by early this evening tonight then very good ill send christos with the caryou will of course meet them at their hotel and help escort them uh better make that two cars or a bus and isnt this short notice for you ive put on receptions for hundreds at less notice my staff is perfectly capable of handling a private family party of fifteen surreptitiously ivan counted on his fingers i make it fourteen isnt it even including simon and me byerly will no doubt wish to squire rish thus saving steps for impsec too mamere was well aware of every angle ivan managed not to choke justdont invite miles or let him invite himself on any lesselegant face that lippursing could have been called a retrospective grimace i promise you i am capable of controlling my guest list anyway i believe hes still on sergyar although i shall miss ekaterin another time she waved a hand that was either airy or threatening ivan wasnt sure which ivan ran beleaguered fingers through his hair yeah and i came in to the office this morning late because of last nightto find some impsec captain with a stick up his butt giving my boss a hard time over all thisits not helpful i tell you he drew breath galactic affairs fellow who seemed not to be talking this morning to domestic affairs if you know what i mean it put me in a quandary are they all flying blind over there at cockroach central or does allegre want to keep his angles of view independent or what i hate getting sucked into these weaseltraps simon illyan leaned into the vid pickup and advised genially call guy allegre and ask ivan if its the first hell want to know and if its the second you need to know hell talk to you briefly mind the amused face withdrew out of focal range the reflective voice drifted back though good for the ga man for tackling an admiral stick or not its the backbone one wants to see in an agent ivan shuddered but i dont want to talk to allegre very sensible approved lady alys and ill call tej and rish carry on dear ill have christos contact you later with the details for transport she cut the com ivan sat a moment gathering his reserves and wondering when if ever he was going to get back to ops business this morning and whether any of this could be classified as making personal calls on office time and if he was somehow going to earn a reprimand for it he sighed and punched in the next code ah ivan said general allegre neutrally when hed been gated through by the secretary guy allegre passed as a stocky middleaged normallooking sort of senior officer with a normal wifewell she worked at the imperial science instituteand children in about the same agecohort as desplainss youngsters it took a while knowing him to realize how ferociously bright and brightly ferocious he really was we may have a place opening up on our fast courier next weekis that request obsolete now in view of this mornings news last nights news i construe from your point of view uh i think so sir its all very upintheair right now but this is related i seem to find myself dealing with two of your people who arent dealing with each other succinctly as instructed ivan described the conundrum with byerly and captain raudsepp hm yes said allegre ill have raudsepp apprised that and the generals lack of irritation with ivan taking up space on his comconsole was rather a clue that raudsepp must have been working in the dark re byerly good you asked right simon said i should just in case ivan needed a little more shielding allegre nodded vorrutyer does good work on his level it may actually have been a bit too much good work lately domestic had been thinking of standing him down for a while but then this came up how can someone do too much good work well irregulars allegre gave a vague wave and adroitly changed the subject how is simon these days what another family snitchreport no that was unfair guy allegre had been head of komarran affairs for some time directly under illyan until his promotion into his chiefs abruptly vacated shoes four years back and hed come up as a young officer entirely in illyans impsec his interest was personal as well as professional his health seems quite good glad to hear it any new interests i thought he could use some allegre added diplomatically no reflection on your lady mother of course do you two talk much with each other consult as needed exchief illyan has been very properly circumspect about jostling my elbow bless his wits no need to send him to sergyar like your uncle to get him out of the range of other peoples ingrained habits although i suppose simons medical situation served much the same function of distancing him from his old command allegres eyes narrowed in thought i wonder if hed like to visit aral i should suggest it dyou think your lady mother would be willing to travel as long as it doesnt create unhealthy excitement among the conspiracy theorists although that could be made useful too something else on the generals comconsole desk was signaling for his attention ivan guessed by the shifting of his gaze is that all for now yes sir for now thank you captain vorpatril with a move of allegres hand ivan was dismissed from his attention and vid plate tej watched rish trailing all the younger arquas lead them to the hotel lift tubes for what was billed as a short walking tour of the immediate environs planned to end up in the hotel bar to await their transportation to lady alyss shed really wanted to give the whole family an emergency briefing on barrayar before they went to dinnerif she would be permitted to get a word in edgewisebut a private talk with dada and the baronne and grandmama would have to do rish had promised to fill in the others as best she could she touched the door buzzer to the sitting room and was bidden to enter by her mothers voice she slipped inside to find the elder arquasplusone gathered around a low holovid table that was at present displaying what looked like a largescale city map grandmama touched a control a dizzy blur and the map settled again its just not here she complained a querulous note in her usually wellmodulated tones they can hardly have moved it said dada reasonably no they seem to have moved everything else instead grandmama looked up ah tej good were you able to arrange the early pickup for us asked the baronne did you explain that mother wanted to see a bit of the old city that she used to know yes said tej lady alys said that christos would be very pleased apparently as part of his training as a driver he had to memorize every street in vorbarr sultana and he doesnt get to try out the odd bits very often local knowledge might help said dada what are you looking for tej settled herself between dada and the baronne and received unusually a welcoming hug from each the baronne was not normally physically demonstrative and would probably get over it in a day or two she must really have feared for tej during their uncertain odyssey roundabout from their lost house to earth to escobar to here tej would have feared for them too if only shed known they were still alive it was hard to guess which feeling was worse an old vor mansion that went by the peculiar name of ladderbeck close said grandmama peering once more at the vid display at the time of the ninth satrapythe cetagandan name for what the barrayarans dubbed the cetagandan occupation it was where i worked worked said tej interest caught as a child she had taken her grandmother as she appeared and hardly wondered about her long past life i didnt think ghem generals haut wives worked the baronnes eyebrows flicked up not in some dire little shop tej the baronne had not approved of that ploy when shed heard of it grandmamas fine lips thinned you understand when i wasdetached from the haut i was already a fullytrained geneticist i simply missed the cut and not by very muchbut it was always harder for us girls from the outer planets to compete with the haut women from eta ceta itself they always had access to the very latest developments you know i was matched with general ghem estif precisely because he was being assigned to the ninth satrapy and the ongoing star creche program here wanted a reliable laboratory assistant the prior woman having been killed in some horrible bombing by those dreadful guerillas she wasnt even targeted she just chanced to be in the wrong place at the wrong time grandmama sniffed disapproval tej wasnt sure if it was of the guerillas their tactics or their failure to recognize the significance of their inadvertent victim the star creche had a presence on barrayar did the barrayarans know ivan xav had never mentioned such a thing nor had she run across it in her recent reading whatever were they doing here grandmama waved a dismissive hand just the obviousassembling a complete gene survey and library of the human occupants of the planet barrayars socalled time of isolation was a unique natural genetic experiment not to be wasted the hopedfor prize of course would be some novel mutation or set of mutations that might be extracted and incorporated into higher gene bases but alas in twenty years of surveysadly underfunded and undersupported for the scope of the task i must saywe only found some novel genetic diseases six hundred years was perhaps too short a time for new strengths to develop and be filtered into the population its really too bad the place was rediscovered so soon some komarrans thought so too tej was reminded if for rather different reasons and you had aa what a laboratory in the old mansion under it to be precise the building had been some counts residence in a prior generation had fallen to lesser family members and was appropriated by the satrap government the haut zaia our team leader was not best pleased with it but it made a suitably discreet entrance to our actual workplace the laboratory itself was good enough for its day proper biohazard barriers and all tej hesitated if it was just a gene library why did you need fancy biohazard controls one never knew said grandmama vaguely tej tried to process this it stuck rather huh that slackjawed expression does not become you tej the baronne pointed out do keep up this is important to our future actually it all seemed to be about the past so far the creakily ancient past at that tej suppressed a sigh and tried to look attentive she really had to get on to telling them more about lady alys before well we were dealing with the ghem dear the haut zaia kept her own supplies there as a matter of routine precaution grandmama pursed her lips and went on what we had here in vorbarr sultana was only a regional outpost mind you our main facility was that orbital laboratory the one that was sent to burn up in the atmosphere during the scramble of the withdrawal i only visited it once being too junior to be assigned there myself much better equipment than we had downside such a waste although at least we salvaged all the data out of that one which brings us dada rumbled back to your young man tej what tej managed to close her mouth this time youve had some time to study him what are his handles said dada handles tej said the baronne impatiently but dada waved her down for example said dada does he hanker for power prestige wealth i dont know how can you not know something so basic as that said the baronne tej shrugged i gather that his mother is wealthyshe owns the building his flat is in and hers and others besides and i dont know whatallelse outside of the capitaland hes an only child and he has some kind of trust fund from his paternal relatives and his officers pay which is what he mainly lives on thats not quite what i meant said dada many who are rich want more perhaps for some purpose or obsession and what would arquas know about that ha i think ivan xav cares about comfort more than display i mean he keeps up with the expectations of his vor class but i dont think its because hes interested in them so much asits just easier what about business training does he have any import export trade could he for example put together a large or complex project well i know he works on military budgets with admiral desplains those are large and complex projects hm dada drummed his fingers on the sofa arm you see despite the unavoidable need for local partners id like to keep this venture in the family if we can my old contacts here areless reliable than id prefer and in some cases perhaps a bit too old venture tej wasnt sure she liked the sound of that his eye nonetheless had brightened during this conversation edging out that scary look of weariness and defeat that hed had when talking about eric and the loss of the station so out of place on his broad beloved face what kind of venture do you have in mind on barrayar of all places a mining deal a flash of grin excavating history moira thinks weve found a rich vein of it every family should have a lost gold mine eh they were current events to me grandmama objected anyway the gold is the least of the real value potentially said the baronne in a voice of caution potentially this is all still such a long shot long shots better than no shot at all sighed dada which is what well have if the barrayaran imperial government finds out about this so no gossiping about this to anyone who hasnt already been brought inside eh tej tej wrinkled her nose do you mean that old underground lab whod want an old gene library i mean its all got to have spoiled by now and what would that smell like actually anything that was stored sporulated ought to be fully reconstitutable said grandmama and then there was all that tedious trash the ghem generals and their friends insisted on stuffing in at the last i suppose some of them really believed they would have a chance to get back to it all someday tedious trash dada sat back his grin deepening old records both cetagandan and captured barrayaran several art collections apparently mere native objects for the most part put in grandmama though i do believe there were a few good pieces brought from home ninth satrapy currency and cointhats where the chests of gold come in the primitives in the barrayaran backcountry always preferred those awkward gold coins for some reason grandmama confirmed and basically anything that a select mob of cetagandan ghem lords in a panic didnt have room or time to pack and couldnt bring themselves to abandon dada concluded i dont think even moira knows what all might be in there no one did grandmama said the haut zaia was quite upset with the incursion on her space but really no one could do anything at that point tej had started out determined not to be sucked into any more doomed arqua clan ventures but she couldnt help growing a little bugeyed at this litany how do you knowhow do you know someone hasnt found it long before this the baronne rubbed her hands thoughtfully together and touched her fingertips to her lips even if smuggled out in secret some of the known objects ought to have surfaced and left a trail some of the records as well they havent whathowhow would we get at it in secret dada flicked his fingers simplest is best if the building still exists buy it or possibly rent it if its been knocked down and built over buy whatever is atop it and proceed the same at our leisure i understand the place wasnt in the best part of the city if that isnt feasible buy or rent an adjacent property and penetrate laterally as always fencing the stash is where the profit is made or lostlost usually back when i was a young shipjacker the best value of any item can only be realized when it is matched to the best customer for it which will be best done from some future secure base out of this debatable empire fell station to start with said the baronne if we can present ourselves credibly enough to baron fell once we attain that leverage point our options open and ill have ruby back isnt um the historical value greatest when things are excavated and recorded on site said tej tentatively a sad loss the baronne agreed but in this case not avoidable how long have you three been planning this this lowjacking since earth said dada we had reached the nadir of marketing my motherinlaws hair when moira recalled this place i hadnt thought about it in years said grandmama decades really but shiv never did receive a proper wedding gift when he married udine ghem estif having wasted the first one on that idiot komarran he picked out who wasted it in turn on oh so many bad decisions i came to you in nothing but my skin murmured the baronne with a fond look at her mate andshe plucked a trifle mournfully at her short fringehair i remember that said her mate with a fond look back vividly i had very little more myself at the time your wits at least making this cache into test and wedding gift in one if shiv can extract it said grandmama does it occur to you two that you are running your courtship backward as long as we fit it all in somewhere said dada sounding amused your sudden barrayaran husband said the baronne to tej put several wrinkles in our planning we had originally intended to arrive here entirely incognito but your reappearance gave us a secondchoice level of plausibility even as this vorpatril fellows unexpectedly high security profile forced the necessity i hadnt wanted to activate our real identities quite so soon not till after the war chest was refilled and we could prepare some richer welcome for our enemies flexibility udine rumbled dada i admit said the baronne to tej i was quite frantic about rish and you when amiri reported youd failed to make any timely rendezvous or contact with him lilys roundabout news was the greatest fortuneit made this barrayar plan seem quite irresistible if we can extract this treasure said dada it will be the saving of our house the key to everything its been a long time since i wagered so much on a single throw though if im to revisit the desperation of my youth i want the body back too he slapped his stomach and grimaced his wife snorted though dada looked more stimulated than desperate to tejs eye now all we have to do said grandmama briskly is find ladderbeck close ivan settled his inlaws in the back of mameres big groundcar and took the rearwardfacing seat across from them the canopy sighed shut he gripped tejs hand briefly for reassurance of some sort when hed sped home to his flat to clean up and dress for this command performance hed found tej and rish had already gone on no chance to talk then no chance really to talk now nor for hours yet probably at least shaved and sharp in the dress greens that he seldom wore afterhours he ought to look a more impressive soninlaw than last night he hoped christos began the tour to please grandmama with a spin past vorhartung castle ivan mentioned the military museum within for future innocuous entertainment this place at least seems to have survived the century intact lady ghem estif observed staring out at the archaic battlements a few bright district flags flew there snapping in the winter wind indicating some rump meeting of the counts in session it looks so odd without the laserwire though a whispered conference with christos had concluded that the imperial residence was best viewed from a distance this first trip which they duly did christos managed to wedge the groundcar as close to the restored pedestrian alleys and shops of the old caravanserai area as it would fit well thats an improvement murmured lady ghem estif not sounding too grudging this part of town was considered a pestilential deathtrap in my day ivan decided not to mention being born there for now let someone else tell that story this round the last barrayaran i knew whod been alive during the occupation died what ivan had to stop and work it out in his head eighteen years ago when hed been barely more than seventeen was it really more than half his lifetime ago that his ancient and formidable greatuncle general piotr had passed to his fathers umyeah it was a drive past the fully modern ops building drew no special reaction a little to ivans disappointment but lady ghem estif sat up and peered more avidly as they drew away from the river the baronne seated next to her and the baron observed herpleasure it was hard to tell on that reserved facewith interest this was close to the edge of town in the days of the ninth satrapy she remarked vorbarr sultana is built out for a couple dozen kilometers more now ivan said in every direction you really ought to see some of the recent outer rings before you go the big groundcar nipped into a rare parking space just opening up and sighed to a halt christoss jovial voice which had been supplying sporadic commentary throughout the zigzag tour of the old town came over the intercom from the front compartment here we are lady ghem estif i had to research back quite a way to find mention of the old place the cetagandans had seized it from an old vor family that had taken up with the resistance and used it as a guest house during the time they held the capital due to its extensive grounds and gardens i gather it was occupied again by one of the opposition factions leveled during the rump fighting and seized again by emperor yuri the old vor family never did get the property back but i guess they were mostly dead by then but this is definitely the exact site of ladderbeck close all three senior arquaswell two arquas and one ghem estifwere staring wideeyed out the side of the canopy craning their necks what said the baronne in a choked voice is that great ugly building at least something in old vorbarr sultana architecture had finally riveted their attention even if it was one of the most notoriously awful buildings in town ivan explained cheerfully its one of the works of emperor yuri vorbarras megalomanic architect the infamous lord dono vorrutyer he got up five major structures before he was stopped they say not to be confused with the current count of the same name by the way donothearchitect was a relative of byerlys too though not a direct ancestor no doubt to bys relief by can tell you more tales of him over dinner later that gigantic eyesore is cockroach central itselfand its called that by people who work thereimpsec hq barrayaran imperial security headquarters a long silence fell in the back of the groundcar i dont suppose its for sale said tej in a strange small voice or rent ivan laughed back when simon illyan ran it he said hed sell it for a betan dollar if only he could find a betan with a dollar and no taste and if only the council of counts would build him a new building which they wouldnt mamere says he kept a holo of the investigatif federale building on escobartall thing all glasson the wall of his inner office for a while the way some men would keep pinups my my my said shiv arqua he kept staring back over his shoulder for a long time as the groundcar eased into the traffic and pulled away chapter sixteen it wasnt till the whole party was rising in the lift tube to lady vorpatrils penthouse that tej whispered to ivan um i didnt get a chance to explain about simon yet you havent ivan twitched what were you talking about all that time not that ivan stepped out into the lifttube foyer trailing senior arquas like ducklings well too late simon would just have to explain himself this round or not as he chose the marquetry doors slid open before themsomeone had been on the watch mamere and simon were both standing together waiting in her spacious hallway from the wide living room beyond a clink of glassware and murmur of voices assured ivan that rish and byerly had managed to shepherd the rest of the family safely here tej stepped bravely forward dada baronne grandmama i would like to introduce you to ivan xavs mother lady alys vorpatril and my stepfatherinlaw captain simon illyan imperial service retired lady alys simon lady moira ghem estif shiv and udine ghem estif arquabaron and baronne cordonah a slightly defiant tone to that last claim retired was not quite the word for their current status simon cast tej a strange surprised smile as he stepped forward alongside lady alys to murmur suitable greetings after her to the offworlder guests the baronne didnt turn a hair as he bowed over her fingers nor did lady ghem estif but the baron after a surprised glance aside at tej advanced to shake simons proffered hand heartily ah that simon illyan i do believethe impsec chief with the cyborg brain said arqua in his deep carrying voice your fame has reached even to the whole ivan and tej were just now showing us your impsec building very ah large isnt it one of the sights of vorbarr sultana they tell me not my building anymore nor my brain either im afraid my memory chip was removed four years ago said illyan upon the occasion of my retirement well that left out a few details ivan took note ah said arqua sounds a bit drastic as exit interviews go my condolences hardly that i was ecstatic personally were you the grip finally loosened and ivan wondered if theyd been doing that whocanbreakwhosebonesfirst thing seeing the two menthe two aging fathersinlaw facetoface for the first time was a trifle alarming arqua was stout dark intense despite his fatigue openly dangerous simon was slight graying selfeffacingquietly dangerous an effect not at all lessenedthe reverse reallyby knowing that he wasnt quite as mentally reliable as hed used to beivan was obscurely relieved when greetings completed and their wraps removed by his mothers efficient servants they spilled into the living room and the family reunion ivan dropped back to murmur to simon why did you grin like that at tej just now a ghost of that pleased smile flitted over simons face because that was the first time id been introduced as anybodys stepfather oddly flattering wasthat something youd wanted sir ivan asked taken aback for all the other people whod made assumptions about ivans fauxfilial relationship with his mothers partner ivan realized in sudden retrospect simon himself never had not once as your lady mother would say that would not be correct which is no ones fault or business flitted past impliedbut our own althougha brief sideways hesitation surely not diffident i could likely do without all the mumbled ums um ivan started to say then thought better of it he converted it to an oh did simon care about that evidently ivans mental review of all the awkward smartass ways hed introduced simon these past four years was interrupted thankfully by byerly sauntering over by gave simon an apologetic nod it was always a little fascinating to watch bys habitual smarmy irony so thoroughly purged not only from his expression but from his body language around the former impsec chief illyan plainly still unnerved by to the marrow of his bones even though by had once worked for himor was that because he had once worked for him ivans glance took inventory of arquas and jewels gathered around the drinks trolley or gazing out the windows into the softening winter dusk i see you managed to get them all here mamere find a bus a luxurious sort of groundbarge yes we didnt lose a single arqua overboard byerly said with mock pride not for lack of their trying you have a lot of new inlaws ivan yeah noticed that ivan nabbed a drink with a smile of intense gratitude to his mothers servitor a regular from that catering service lady alys called on for veryhighend governmental receptions when she wasnt using imperial residence staff the woman smiled back in a motherly manner simon and mamere were tagteaming ivan saw out of the corner of his eye mamere escorting the baronne and lady ghem estif to the wide windows to point out the highlights of vorbarr sultana simon doing the same for shiv both covertly watching the senior arquas interactions with their very assorted children very adult children but did any of the oldsters really see them that way tej was drawn into conversation with her brother amiri and his apparent jeevesshadow jet or onyx did each of the fullblooded arqua children rate his or her own jewel or what this was a family dynamic that ivans acquaintance with the barrayaran historical precedent of acknowledged bastards did not quite seem to cover he made the rounds of the rest of the clan inquiring politely after their hotel their naps and their trip to his mothers flat all of which were reported as tolerable then drifted over to join simon and shiv in time to hear simon say so how did prestene get the drop on you shiv heaved a sigh in part it turned out to be an inside job some trusted subordinatesshouldnt have been unfortunate but that can happen to the most supposedlysecure bastions simon touched his forehead in a frustrationgesture ivan hadnt seen for a while that was how the bastard took down my chip your eidetic memory chip that was removed upon your retirement was this not ordered by your imperial masters i dont follow the other way around im afraid first the chip was biosabotaged quite thoroughlyivan would doubtless remember that part better than i doa sharp glance under his lidded eyes ivans waythen the slagged remains surgically excised happily before and not after the ugly sideeffects killed me not the way i would have chosen to retire from the imperial service for all my daydreams of doing just that after forty years ah i quite see said shiv sounding entirely sincere the two men toasted each other ironically with their nearlyempty glasses and drained them the drinkstrolley elf appeared magically to refill them then vanished into the mob again the marquetry doors on the end of the living room parted like the curtains on a play revealing the stage or at least the table now pulled out to a spacious oblong and invitingly set mamere and her minions smoothly guided the guests to their places shiv seized the moment to murmur something in his daughter pidges ear before they were separated ivan was unhappily parted from tej seated opposite her father who was placed at the foot of the table on simons honored right alys at the head had moira ghem estif on her right and udine arqua on her leftthe usual protocols had plainly broken down in the face of the arqua challenge or things were being let to go a casual sort of familystyle or else mamere had devised placements by some plan of her own possibly with advice from impsec retired ivan found himself plunked between his motherinlaw and his senior sisterinlaw star with byerly beyond her separated from rish by emerald jet pearl amiri and pidge filled the opposite side of the table between lady ghem estif and tej the table was too long to maintain a single conversation except in spurts most likely the talk would fragment into two or three parts by in the middle was placed to either hear everything or be utterly distracted depending a hearty winterfairstyle soup appeared appropriate to the seasonivan recognized the recipe on the first heavenly sniff his mother had apparently kidnapped ma kosti for the evening and he trusted miles wouldnt find out rish down the table was assuring her fellowjewel emerald that everything was going to be just fine and the genetically senseenhanced portion of the table which was most of it raised their spoons in bliss lady alys diplomatically began the conversation with the most neutral topic available inquiring of lady ghem estif how she had enjoyed earth and drawing ivan in with a few leading remarks about his careerpolishing stint there as an assistant military attache a decadeno more ago a glance under her lashes warned ivan to leave out the interesting bits hardly necessary it would take more drinks than this before ivan would want to expand on his lingering feelings for those anyway lady ghem estif relieved him of the necessity by being willingly led describing her past eight years of residence on humanitys homeworld in unexceptionable terms to ivans surprise it seemed she had not spent her time there in a cloistered retirement either rich or straitened but in some sort of geneticsrelated consulting business to keep my hand in as she explained my original training is sadly outofdate by cetagandan standards not so much by earths though i have kept up she smiled complacently at her assorted grandchildren ranged along the table star who in ivans estimation had been drinking pretty heavily unless she had some sort of gengineered cetagandan liver looked up and said how did you and the old general come to have the baronne anyway did your old constellation order it must haveits said the haut keep their outcrosses tightly controlled that is incorrect dear although by then my constellation and i had long parted ways its the hauthaut crosses that are meticulously planned it is precisely the outcrosses which are loosened so as to permit the possibility of genetic serendipity udine smiled rather grimly across the table at her mother did you find me so serendipitous in the longer viewultimately i admit at the time my motivations were more shortterm and emotional stars brow furrowed were you in love with grandfather ghem estif back then moira ghem estif waved away this romantic notion rae ghem estif was not a lovable man as such i did feel strongly that hethat all of us who chose to stop on komarr rather than return to the empirehad suffered our efforts to be betrayed by our respective superiors it was raes one loss to the ninth satrapy that i could make up jet next to her looked confused what loss was that udine sipped her wine smiled affectionately across at her sonandorconstruct and said what you never heard that tale jet ivan was reminded was the last arqua even younger than tej conversation had died all along the table as those at the far end strained to hear tej leaned forward and peered around the line of her seatmates alert for some new tidbit their materfamilias must not often bore them with accounts of her youth ivan decided its a very barrayaran story all waste and aggravation and futility which i must suppose makes it appropriate to tell here said lady ghem estif with a glance down the table at her presumed host simon smiled distantly back but his eyes had gone quite attentive the generals son by one of his prior wives was lost in the ninth satrapy blown up by ivan xavs ancestors rish inquired brightly from her end we initially thought so but our best later guess was that he was killed by what is so oxymoronically called friendly fire captain ghem estif vanished while on a threeday leave normally this would have been put down to his being murdered by the guerillas or having deserteddesertions were a growing problem by thenbut rae insisted it could not be the second and there was no sign of the first it was only much laterwe had already reached komarr as i recallthat one of his sons friends spoke privately with us and we found out that the captain had taken a barrayaran lover she paused to sip soup fourteen people refrained from interrupting in unison she swallowed delicately and went on the captain had apparently penetrated enemy lines to the most dire and notorious nest of guerrillas on the planet in search of his young man it is entirely unclear if he had found out the city was secretly slated to be destroyed by the ruling ghemjuntaof which general ghem estif was not a part so he could not have had the news that wayand was trying to get him out or if it was just bad luck and bad timing for all the ironic horror of his sons immolation rae did seem to take some consolation in the assurance that it was not desertion the four barrayarans around the table were not actually quieter than the rest of the audience ivan thoughtbut maybe he was getting a worked demonstration of the difference between attentive and choked silence the infamous nuclear destruction of the vorkosigans district capital had been the act that had galvanized the wartorn and exhausted planet into its final push against the occupation my cousin miles actually owns the site of vorkosigan vashnoi ivan put in affably pseudoaffably even he wasnt sure its finally stopped glowing has it said lady ghem estif unruffled well salute the brave ghemcaptain and his beloved for me next time you fly over i assume you do not land there no said ivan not even now lady alys with thirty years of diplomatic experience under her belt looked as if she was discovering a whole new meaning for the term conversation pit but she made a valiant effort to recover is that why you and the ghemgeneral took up komarran citizenship i believe raes motivations for that were more practicalhe had been given access to a large block of planetary voting shares bribed did that translate as i did not actually apply for komarran citizenship myself merely claiming umbrella residency as a spouse lady ghem estif went on later when i lived with udine and shiv the question of governmental loyalties was mm locally moot i have actually managed to remain a stateless person for the better part of a century which i can tell you is not something the nexus generally makes easy to do indeed said illyan from the other end of the table staring at her in fascination not the next course arrived and the conversation broke apart the femaledominated end of the table going on to cetagandan genetic techniques as applied to jacksonian outcrosses with a sideorder of current barrayaran technoobstetrical fashions the other end to military history and its financing ivan was maddened by not quite being able to hear the details when simon and shiv began to compareandcontrast or possibly oneup anecdotes of brigandage and covert ops in the jacksons whole system presumably heavily edited on both sides ivan decided to let someone else explain the provenance of the mouthmelting maple ambrosia served for dessert but to his relief no one inquired lady alyss description of it as a traditional barrayaran confection seemed to cover it the menu item was likely inevitable given the cook ma kosti was collecting royalties on the recipe ivan understood dinner ended without disaster despite lady ghem estifs little wobble into ancient angst with the seniors setting the pace it was clear the evening was not going to run late or turn raucous ivan followed when simon drew shiv off to his study an unusual postprandial honor he normally only permitted the most select guests into this private space such as gregor or miles or uncle aral when he was onworld the honor was underscored when simon rummaged in his credenza and emerged with a bottle of the even more select brandy the one from the vorkosigans district so rare that it didnt even have a label being distributed solely as a gift from the counts own hand and two glasses simon studied ivan with his most annoying blandness and murmured i expect lady tej will be wanting your support out there eh ivan they eyed each other ivan tried not to let his gaze fix on the bottle gently dangling from simons hand im very concerned for tejs future sir i am aware ivan its one of the things in the forefront of my mind ivan couldnt say out loud in front of his putative fatherinlaw watching this play with keen interest dammit i need to be dealing with shiv wait your turn nor as simon chivvied him firmly to the door and evicted him dont forget just how many things could simon keep in the forefront of his mind these days without losing track the very soundproof not to mention projectile plasma and poison gasproof door slid closed in front of ivans nose exiling him to the hallway byerly wandered up looking faintly frazzled have you seen where arqua and illyan disappeared to ivan jerked his thumb at the study private conclave evidently discussing vorkosigan brandy and im not sure what else byerly stared at the blank door with curiosity second only to ivans own wellillyan presumably he has things in hand im not so sure you were closer to that end of the table than i was did you get the impression that shiv was hustling simon i mean subtly of course by shrugged well of course arqua has to be hustling every possibility he sees right about now trying to get support for his house in exile in the interest of making it not in exile it was less clearby hesitatedwhy simon seemed to be hustling him back even more subtly note unless it was just habit i suppose thats a disturbing thought the two of them hustling each other yeah it waskind of like watching two women trying to make each other pregnant ivan contemplated this arresting not to mention distracting metaphor for a moment thats done technologically even on barrayar these days byerly waved a dissociating hand you see what i mean though yeah ivan nibbled his lip are you outed by the way by rish im not yet sure do you know if tej has told her family anything about your line of work not a clue no one has given me any time to talk with my wife for the past day ivan hesitated she has talked with them about something well try to find out will you both by added in afterthought ivan growled spying is supposed to be your job im trying by bit out hey youre the one who outed yourself back on komarr surprised the hell out of me at the time were you trying to impress the pretty python with your daring dual identity or what at the time there were only the two of them and i never imagined theyd ever get closer than five jumps to vorbarr sultana it seemed a fair deal and they seemed to agree they werent going to blab to their enemies never pictured it lasting more than a couple of days before we went our separate ways or rish having to choose me over her family for gods sake or tej having to choose me over her family ivan had just time to think before a door slid open down the hall and bys teeth snapped shut tall and cinnamon pidge emerged from the guest lav began to stride back toward the living room spied the two of them lingering and hove to with a smile snazzy heels on her shoes positioned her to look ivan directly in the eye and down on byerly very baronette sophia arqua strange courtesy title that ivan kept hearing it as bayonet whichmight not be so wrong oh ivan xav a nod included byerly in the greeting what a very pleasant evening this has been after the tensions of our travels im glad said ivan do tell my mother entertaining is an art form to her i could see that said pidge with nearcetagandan approval your mothers partner is an interesting fellow too she went on yes she had been closer to simons end of the table through dinner in the place next to tej that should have been ivans eh illyan is a what do you call your grubbers a prole name though isnt it not one of you vor no twicetwentyyears imperial service man need yield to any vor for his place in our military caste said ivan firmly pidge looked to byerly for confirmation of this cultural detail he nodded cordially still a captain even after what forty yearswhy do you call it twicetwenty i wonder but isnt that the same rank as you no said ivan chief of imperial security which was his job title technically isnt a military rank at all but a direct imperial appointment he froze his military rank at captain because his predecessor emperor ezars security chief captain negrithe man they called ezars familiarnever took a higher rank either a political statement that it was after all a very political job pidge tilted her head and what did they call your illyan aral vorkosigans dog by put in lips quirking with amusement butvorkosigan wasnt an emperor was he imperial regent for sixteen years you know when emperor gregor was a minor byerly charitably glossed for her outworlder benefit all of the work none of the perqs ivan wondered if that was a direct quote from uncle aral or aunt cordelia more likely and what do they call the current chief of impsec allegre they call him the chief of impsec byerly cast her the hint of an apologetic bow i fear we live in less colorful times thank god ivan thought allegre was already a general at the time of his appointment they didnt make him give it back so i suppose thats the end of that tradition pidges generous mouth pursed as she puzzled through this it seems quite odd are barrayaran captains very well paid then no said ivan sadly he added lest she think less of his umstepfather illyan was given a viceadmirals salary though which makes more sense considering the workload or perhaps it didnt hours a day for thirty years allconsuming such a pyre wasnt something a man entered into for pay halfsalary now hes retired how much would that be ivan who dealt with military payrolls regularly and could have recited the wage ranges for every isnumberrank ever invented current or historical said i imagine you could look it up somewhere byerly smiled a little the sweep of his lashes invited ivan to carry on thenis he rich independently pidge persisted i have no idea pidge tossed her head in surprise the amber curls gathered in a clasp at her nape far more controlled than tejs cloud failed to bounce much how can you not know i expect he has his savings byerly put in stirring what imagined pot ivan barely wanted to contemplate but was probably going to have to he couldnt have started out with much as a young prole officer but that social class tends to be frugal and he had no visible vices nor secret ones either ivan put in he wouldnt have had time not that illyan hadnt been good at secretsmany years of unrequited and largely unsuspected prole pining for lady alys for example which had escaped ivans attention entirely till the shoes had droppedboth pairs well all right one secret vice they had both been very drunk at the emperors birthday celebration a couple of years ago ivan by habit and tradition the retired illyan because hed always been on impsec duty before and had never he said had a chance to through a progression of subjects that were soon a blur in ivans mind they had somehow got on to just what illyan did and did not recall or miss from his memory chip at which point ivan had learned just where the largest and most arcane pornography collection on barrayar had been secreted its not as if i acquired most of it on purpose illyan had protested but the damned chip didnt allow me to delete anything whether i picked it up inadvertently or in a moment of bad mood or bad judgment or bad company and then i was stuck with it forever or in the line of work oh god those were the worst do you have any idea how many truly appalling surveillance vids i had to review in forty years there were some things ivan reflected that no man should know about another not even or perhaps especially his umstepfather people had occasionallyin ivans hearing or even buttonholing him directlyspeculated about just how long this matter between illyan and lady alys had really been going on since illyans retirement when it had becomeovert public not flaunted lady alys didnt flaunt that would be tasteless more likethey wore each other with wellearned pride but it had occurred to ivan then that the physical danger illyan trailed from his work might not have been the only thing hed been loath to take to bed with his esteemed vor lady ivan had decided he was thankful when illyan appeared to have forgotten the conversation the next dayhangovers were definitely for the young the man had moanedand didnt remind him of it in any way and when ivan had got over his own hangover and the generational whiplash and the unwanted luridbutmaybenotevenluridenough imaginings hed finally decided that what it had mostly sounded like was lonely actually being married to a wife beat being married to a job it seemed increasingly clear to ivan captain illyan isor wasa clever man was he not said pidge i should have thought that a position as a security chief would have lent itself to considerable personal acquisition in three decades if not directly then through clever use of inside information it was a measure ofsomethingthat this thought had never crossed ivans mind till now if nothing else illyan had spent vast tracts of time and wells of energy dealing with corrupt people and the effects of their corruptions really there could hardly be anything he hadnt learned about the depravity of the human condition and yetjust because illyan took confessions didnt make him a priest no said ivan after a moment grabbing for his tilting certainty impsec was his passion he didnt need another if he had a drug it was adrenaline byerlys brows rose really god yes he only looked normal by contrast because he hung around with a pack of the biggest adrenalinejunkies on three worlds all the great men have to be to ride the imperial horse i mean think who illyan used to run in covert ops and at whose request that said byerly is a point but hes retired from all that now a modest frugal retirement for a loyal imperial bureaucrat said pidge and yet your mother so wealthy doesnt bother her ivan said stoutly but does it bother him about to deny this with equal vehemence ivan realized that among the many things he didnt know about simonthat was another i am sure he has more important things on his mind pidge smiled at him fascinating with a little shivlike wave of her fingers she trailed away toward the party byerly with one of his lesscomprehensible grimaces promptly trailed after ivan gave the blank study door one last look of frustration and followed ivan still hadnt had a chance to talk alone with tej when the party broke up an hour later simon and shiv had at last emerged from simons lair byerly was fidgety from having been excluded from a long allfemale confabulation amongst lady vorpatril lady ghem estif and baronne cordonah from which theyd emerged as alys moira and udine wraps were produced in the hallway even its generous proportions elbowjostling for this crowd christos reappeared to guide everyone back to their respective groundcars simon and shiv parted with another of those disquieting handshakes as the mob thinned simon gazed thoughtfully at the broad departing back but turned with a slight smile to take tejs hand intriguing fellow your dada tej the man could sell elephants to circus masters she gave him a puzzled gratified and alarmed smile back id think circus masters would want to buy elephants sir illyans smile stretched quite so tej had successfully avoided ivan xav all evening while the party swirled around her spinning head a bass beat of cetagandan gold cetagandan gold cetagandan gold had thumped in her brain with an occasional descant of buried treasure and discord wail of but impsec dada despite the lack of stepfatherinlaw intel for which he had shot her that pointed lookand it wasnt her fault that no one had let her explain earlierseemed to have made a swift recovery and hit it off just fine with simon that had to be good didnt it normally she looked forward to pillow talk with ivan xav and what followed for sheer aesthetic reasons if nothing else it had become a very comfortable time of the day something to anticipate with pleasure not this day as they dodged around each other and rish in and out of the bathroom the conversation was utilitarian tej made it under the covers first she didnt have to pretend to be exhaustedif she just rolled over and closed her eyes tej the other side of the bed creaked and dipped as ivan xav sat down but then he sighed got up again padded to the bedroom door opened it and called through hey rish what rishs tired irritated voice called back have you outed byerly yet about what he does for a living i mean of course not that was the deal tacitly i assumed ivan xavs tense shoulders relaxed ah just to my family of course the shoulders went from relaxed to slumped of course ivan xav mumbled he raised his voice again that would be like nine more people yeah great the naturalboy can count ivan xav growled and let the door slide shut he returned to the bed and sat up against the headboard looking down in the soft lamplight at tej who under the press of the stare between her shoulder blades rolled over onto her back tej he began again hesitantly could your dada possibly imagine that he could suborn simon how to deal with thissuborn what a word suborn youd only need to suborn someone for something like treasonous or evil something political or military bad for barrayar financial wasnt political or military right of course dada wouldnt do something like that couldnt id say you do realizeshiv must realizesimons had thirty forty years for his probity and loyalty to be tested by by more pressure than anything your dada could possibly bring to bearmaybe more than you or i can even imagine yeah so so look dadas not stupid neither is simon ivan xavs face managed peeved not his best expression theyre up to something arent they youthe arquas they came to barrayar to get rish and me yes and thats something else we need to talk abouti mean thats the conversation ive been rehearsing all bloody day before all this cametej what do you know she scowled up at him looming on her left ivan xav wasnt stupid either of course then are you in or out and was it even worth probing he was barrayaran to the bone seveneighths anyway hed be bound to want to grab everything for his empire his own gangthat was what the uniform he wore every day meant of what i cant say till i know what im in or out of though its got to be trouble or youd just be telling me theres some kind of jacksonian deal going on under the table yeah i cant tell you unless youre in or you decide youre out and then i really cant tell you married people said ivan xav austerely after a moment shouldnt keep secrets from each other tej rolled up on her elbow annoyed for once this move failed to distract him what you keep secrets from me all the time all that classified stuff at your work thats different thatsits assumed no its not just assumed they make it quite explicit that fellows dont babble about ops business at home or anywhere else its not like i keep those secrets from you preferentially it would probably be really boring anyway most of it admitted ivan xav almost diverted except maybe that stuff you mumble about in your sleep ivan xav stiffened and not in the good way he was in fact quite limp in that region at the moment i talk in my sleep about classified its kind of hard to tell tej composed her mouth into ivan xavs accent and cadences and recited dont eat that avocado admiral its gone blue the blue ones have shifty eyes dont remember that dream ivan xav muttered looking vaguely horrified fortunately i actually guessed it was a dream unless barrayars running some sort of military bioengineering experiments i suppose not as far as i know not like that anyway the avocado didnt meow did it tej stared i dont know you only said it looked shifty ivan xav appeared inexplicably relieved but then alas went on if its something benign theres no reason to keep it a secret sure there is like what like oh to keep other people from stealingwhatever its a thing then it was a bit hopeless to tell herself wake up when her head was so filled with fatiguefog tej tried anyway not necessarily people steal ideas so its a thing andand shiv and your family think its something that can somehow help their cause i suppose that would make sense well really by is right its the only thing that would make sense something that would help them something they need to take back their house so more power to thembut not here what can they be up to here i am not playing fastpenta interrogation with you at this time of night or at any other time thatsactually a party game fastpenta or dare people take turns asking questions and you have to either tell the truth or take the dare not with real fastpenta of course unless its a pretty dodgy party by would know barrayarans are strange yes ivan xav agreed with a pensive sigh then seemed to belatedly decide this might be considered a slur on his homeworld and revised it hastily no not as strange as jacksonians anyway or cetagandans he added something under his breath that might have been frigging mutant space aliens but swallowed it before tej could be sure she did not ask him to repeat it more loudly its not just the house tej tried after a minute of silence stretched unpleasantly prestene has eric and topaz held hostage oror worse so ivan xavs voice went uncomfortably uncertain eric may well not be revivable and topaz isjust a jewel right no genetic relation to shiv you said tej frowned dada never made any distinction amongst us kids or else when he was yelling at us he wouldnt have kept mixing up our names those cadences came easily to her mouth and memory her voice deepened automatically you rish pidge jet emnotej youre the oneyou stop that her lips turned up despite herself i suppose you could think of him as a stepfather to the jewels but since he didnt bother to sort us we never bothered to sort him of course he was a busy man it might have just been equal inattention but the point is shed lost track of the point and your mother with all the names the baronne sighed tej never mixed up anything she paused simon seems a funny sort of stepfather to you ivan flapped his hands if id been five or fifteen when he took up with mamere things might have been different id wanted a father then at thirty we could only be adult acquaintances and him mamereshusband sort of umhusband partner whatever he hesitated for a longer time leaving aside the thirty years hed watched out for me before that but then simon illyan watched out for everybody notnot making a distinction amongst us but simon ivan xav stuttered and went on do you realize thatno i cant say that or that i suppose oror that tej irate and exhausted and not just by the day snapped well then stop talking and go to sleep ivan xav humphed sounding likea lot like count falco really they rolled over with their backs to each other chapter seventeen ivans first thought on waking was the same as the last that had plagued him before hedfinallygot to sleep could simon be herding shiv into a sting such a move was likely as instinctive as breathing to the former impsec chief it was as plausiblea lot more plausible reallyas the idea that shiv could be suborning simon in that case would shiv lumber blindly into the trap or would he guess this and set a counterpitfall for simon before simon could do him neither vision was appealing it was maddening to suspect something was in the arqua works but have no idea what did simon know by now the comforting notion that in that case simon would surely be on top of it ran aground on the reflection that shiv could well be stringing simon along with heavily doctored information in which case the former impsec chief would likely let things run a bit to see what turned up giving the former pirate time to get the drop on him in turn this cannot end well ivan clutched his hair and stumbled to the shower tej and rish were still asleep when he let himself out of his flat the routine of the morning rush at ops was calming almost admiral desplains inquired after ivans evening in a perfunctory sort of way and was evidently much reassured by the news that lady alys and illyan had welcomed the refugee visitors diplomatically and without incident ah illyan of course murmured the admiral gathering up his coffee mug that should cover everything mm said ivan brightly and turned to his comconsole he was still sorting snakes when a call came in over his secured channel from impsec hq the stamp informed him ivan mustered a faint practiced smile of welcome when captain raudsepps face materialized over the vid plate good captain vorpatril raudsepp returned the nod general allegre thought you should know your case seems to be warming up about a day ago impsec komarr picked up a team of four individuals at the main orbital transfer station who proved to be freelance bounty hunters out of the hegen hub looking to collect your wife and her companion and deliver them to a contact back in the hub ivan lurched in his chair that wasfast slow expected unexpectedunfortunate just tej and rish not the rest of the clan apparently the reward for the two womens delivery to the hub station was substantial a reward for their delivery all the way to the whole is even more substantial the source of what the jacksonians are pleased to call an arrest order is confirmed to be this prestene syndicate that took over house cordonah eight months ago thats not a surprise by now were these rental goons arriving or departing when morozovs people caught up with them boarding ship for vorbarr sultana in point of fact thatsa bit late raudsepp shrugged they were quite professional and while we now have red flags on anything related to the new cordonah consortium their damned bounty system puts a natural break in any connection anyone at allwho is in the trade that ismay pick up an advertisement of the bounty and the first thing the jacksonians who posted it let alone us may know of them is when they pop up on their doorstep ready to deliver and collect personal motives not required crap said ivan then they could come out of the walls anywhere raudsepp nodded glumly the charge of conspiracy to kidnap a barrayaran subject will hold this crew for the moment he added in a more reflective tone one does wonder what we will do with them if they accumulate some special holding pen for galactic human traffickers might have to be devised not that we arent happy to have them identified and pulled out of circulation butwell perhaps its premature to look so far ahead ivan pictured it what the hell was the barrayaran government supposed to do with dozens and dozens of bounty hunters theyd make a slippery bunch to hold on to too as well as some of them being seriously crazy miles would know what to do with a sack of rabid weasels but that might be a cure worse than the disease and anyway miles wasnt here it was perhaps unworthy to think thank god i suppose said ivan slowly theyll keep coming as long as this prestene consortium is still out there offering the booty and for a while after as people fail to get the updates speaking of updates is there any sign that the arquas enemies have found out that the rest of them are now all here not yet said raudsepp but i shouldnt think that it will improve the situation once they do this could get expensive for my department ivan grimaced i suppose you fellows can think of it as a live training exercise raudsepp appeared unamused do you have any idea yet how long your ah relativesinlaw are planning to stay their initial emergency visa runs thirteen more days i dont know if theyll succeed in getting an extension hm raudsepp frowned were you able to discover if they have any further plans otherwise i dont see any impediment for them to take their family members and decamp promptly which would remove them from my work queue at least one of them is married to a barrayaran subject thats an impediment raudsepp waved this away i was told this marriage of yours was a temporary ploy not one that anyone takes seriously i do did he did tej raudsepp mused on one would think a notorious vor womanizer would have a less drastic seduction technique losing your touch hung implied in raudsepps eyebrow twitch ivan wondered irately what pruney prole impsec analyst had him down in reports as a notorious vor womanizer in any case did you learn any more about their intentions last night raudsepp sat up preparing to record ivans snitchreport general allegre had saidimpliedthat galactic affairsraudsepp had not formerly been in the needtoknow pool about domesticaffairs byerly in the interest of preserving bys valuable cover bys valuable cover in ivans view was beginning to resemble a lace fig leaf hed wanted to ask but what if they try to shoot each other well byerly wouldnt shoot the uniformed raudsepp probably accidentally so had that apprising taken place yet and this a mere triangulation bloody impsec ivan fell back on simon illyan was there the spooks spook cant you ask him raudsepp was taken aback oh of course a daunted look came over his face i should not like to bother him in his retirement his medical retirement but certainly no ones observations could be keener doubt colored his voice once so thats what dithering looks like on raudsepp under other circumstances ivan would have found it mildly entertaining if chief illyan had spotted anything critical he would certainly have reported it though maybe not on my level simon might have at that but to whom so why arent i in that needtoknow loop i bloody need to know ask around ivan suggested shrugging ah excuse me admiral desplains is paging me gotta go raudsepp reluctantly parted with him for now that line about desplains would have been a good lie for cutting himself loose ivan thought if only it had been a lie wasted for now but perhaps he could file it for future reference he turned to hastily muster the requested files another god spare ops interdepartmental meeting in forty minutes wormhole jump station logistics versus budget amp accounting with spreadsheets at twenty paces at dawn aiming to kill unless someoneand ivan knew just what someone would be expected to pitch incould persuade them to delope he rose to report to the inner office tej and rish arrived yawning at the arqua hotel suite to find everyone else up betimes even it appeared byerly just exiting in tow of jet who had drafted him for a local guide by spared rish a grimace of a smile she spared him a grimace of one back tej thought why dont you two just kiss each other and get it over with they so obviously wished to but they exchanged greetings and farewells in nearly the same breaths and parted at the lift tubes both looking back over their shoulders in dissatisfied ways inside the suiteshould she start thinking of it as house cordonah hq in exile everyone seemed to be pursuing a different project at a different comconsole terminal star and pearl at one pidge and em at another dada at yet a third grandmama sat in the center and regarded it all benignly the baronne greeted her directly with tej do i understand correctly that you can drive in vorbarr sultana yes excellent we will have work for you shortly dont run off rish star needs you rish with another grimace went off to join the little subcommittee at stars terminal in the next room but i dont have a vehicle ivan had taken his sporty groundcar to work and besides it would only hold one other arqua at a time although that might not be a disadvantage then you can also take charge of obtaining rentals as needed good i had been wondering what to do with you as if tej were a spare puzzle piece that didnt fit in anywhere perhaps accidentally included from another set and here came another amiri wandered in with a coffee cup in his hand looking vaguely at a loss but he brightened when he saw tej is there more of that asked tej nodding at the coffee yes right this way he guided her to the credenza whats jet up to i saw him going out with by she poured added cream and drank mere hotel coffee but the cream had that extraordinary mouthfilling taste that told of a real organic origin not from a biovat like station dairy products having now seen pictures of the organic origin tej wasnt sure she wanted to think too closely about it but she had to admit that the result was amazing decoy sort of whichever of us vorrutyer is with or who is with vorrutyer is supposed to switch to decoy mode with eleven of us dada figures we can keep him occupied what was rish thinking to pick him up tej remembering the exchange of scents at that first historic meeting in ivans komarr flat wasnt sure that thinking had had as much to do with it as either byerly or rish would likely claim he found us first really but it was a different situation then we were both looking for cover not the way i should have preferred my sisters to obtain it but dones done i guess gods tej he shook his head his crisp hair moving with it im so relieved the baronne and dada have found you two maybe if they can bring off this damned treasure hunt theyll let me go back to the clinic on escobar is that what you want of course it is i was just getting my teeth into my first big postdoc project it broke my heart to be dragged away id thought i was done with house cordonah and all its works i thought id made my escape all right i can understand that dada and the baronne have just had this big scare and why they want to keep us all collected under their eyes for a time but i do not want to be drafted as a replacement heir for eric not only would either star or pidge be better theyd want it tej wrinkled her nose and lowered her voice im not sure of the dynamics of that star and pidge both accepted eric as heir do you think either of them would accept the other amiri looked as if he took the point wellin either case it wouldnt be my problem he drank again how long have the rest of you known about the treasure hunt tej asked just since last night after we got back from lady vorpatrils dada and grandmama and the baronne called a family meeting and told us the new scheme theyd really kept it tight before theni suppose because they werent sure yet that the biobunkerthing would still be here i thought we were just coming here to get you two and id wondered why we all had to be dragged five wormhole jumps when we could have just sent one rep and much more discreetly tej wondered what she and rish would have done if just one arqua had turned up demanding they depart at once might have depended on which one why did they haul you along tej asked that was the big mystery to me too till last night they seem to have some idea of fencing any interesting old cetagandan biostuff out through lily durona i wonder if theyd told her about it all that would explain why she was so ready to let me go at least makes me feel a bit better amiri paused then countered how long have you known only since yesterday afternoon when rish was briefing the rest of you on local terrain but did they tell you what the barrayarans have planted on top of grandmamas old place yeah that sounded a bitchallenging but dada seemed to think he had it all under control an uncertain tone entered amiris voice dada and the baronne had presumably thought theyd had cordonah station under control once too amiri turned to tej with more urgency but you have to help make sure this comes off tej you have to my whole life is riding on it what about my whole life tej stemmed the rebellious thought of course amiris life was more important amiri did things tej as her family never seemed to tire of pointing out didnt she sighed ill try amiri dont just try do he urged its really important to me to everybody really but especially to me yes yes said tej distracted i was prepared to jump off a damned balcony for you shouldnt that be enough she was beginning to rethink that balcony business true it had been as much to escape the exhaustion and the beingafraidallthetime as it had been for imagined family heroism none of which had been a problem sincesince ivan xav really he was not the balcony type i like that in a man she was just beginning to realize how much the baronne was calling her away to consult on local transportation logistics with dada she sighed and trudged off to do her arqua duty ivan woke not as late as hed have liked on his first day off after the invasion of the arquas to an unexpectedly empty bed a gulping moment of panic was quelled as he sat up by the sound of voices from the next room and someone rattling around in the bathroom ivan had needed to work yesterday tej had spent all the long day and into the evening driving assorted arquas around town on mysterious errands which shed barely talked about from years of practice with his cousin ivan could recognize evasion both when he heard it and when he didnt hear it he wasnt reassured by either mode hed held her attention briefly with raudsepps account of the intercepted bounty hunters which shed assured him she would pass on to her folks but with unfeigned tiredness she had slipped away perhaps into sleep shortly thereafter yawning he dragged on trousers and went in search of caffeine tej was in the comconsole niche talking to someonea barrayaran a commercial clerk of some sort apparently she switched to barrayaran russian in midsentence the man brightened and became more voluble and cooperative in any case her business was concluded by the time ivan came back with a steaming mug in his hand ivan nodded at the comconsole how did you know that fellows mother tongue he had a pretty urban accent tej gestured to the nowblank vidplate i can hear it in their voices cant you accents sure but he sounded pure vorbarr sultana to me not really i havent got all the district dialect variations sorted out yet though sixtytimesfour plus south continent i have to pick up more local geography do you expect to sort them all out she shrugged if im here long enough theyll sort themselves tej he wanted to follow up that ambiguoussounding if im here long enough but stuck to his first thought how many languages do you speak i dunno her nose wrinkled since i came herenine thats a lot not really good translator earbugs will handle hundreds why bother making work out of it when the ones you need likely wont be the ones you learned anyway i never even heard of barrayaran russian before i came here or your local greek dialect which is pretty corruptwell alteredsee i didnt say mutated i mean learning them yourself isnt a practical hobby the earbugs do it better a crooked smile kind of fun though i like fun fun said ivan bemusedly reflecting on all the lack of fun hed had in his school language drills rish emerged from the bathroom fully dressed tej did you get the groundvan and the big speakers are we ready to go now yes and yes tej popped up and offered ivan a placatory kiss on the cheek gotta run where are you going the jewels wanted a place for some dance practice since this is the first theyve been together for ages and simon found us this nice park there wasnt any place big enough in the hotel im doing tech on the music outdoors in this weather ivan wandered to a window and peered blearily out all right the angled winter sun was shining brightly and it was windless and well above freezing but still its really pretty nice out today supposed to change tomorrow though so i really have to go now she and rish blew out ivan munched groats a little later with his uneasiness growing he shaved dressed and with extreme reluctance called his mother mamere he said when her impeccably groomed features appeared over the vid plate wearing an expression of surprised inquiry do you know anything about some dance practice place simon recommended to the jewels a park or commons outdoors vorbarra sultana had dozens of such nooks oh yes he mentioned that hes gone off to watch i thought it was good for him to get out id have loved to go with him but im running a diplomatic luncheon at the residence today for laisa as she had to go down to that vorbarra district economics conference in nizhnewhitekirk where the dance practice i mean he suggested the little park across the street from impsec headquarters hardly anyone ever uses it you know except those poor fellows with that seasonal affective problem who come out to eat their lunches sometimes simon did make fullspectrum lighting an allowable requisition years back um yeah thanks about to sign off he hesitated mamerehas simon told you anything about what shiv had to say to him or vice versa her smile never shifted so why did he get the impression of her putting on her most diplomatic pokerface he said they had a very enjoyable exchange i was pleased i quite liked udine and moira you know such adventurous lives earth ive never been further than komarr she sighed you should get simon to take you ivan suggested or take him lever him out of his comfy rut four pushing five years since his retirement all the really hot stuff in his headwhatevers left of ithas to have cooled off some by now doesnt he think its safe to travel out of the empire yet her brows rose in a thoughtful way hes never suggested travel farther than the south coast he was reallyextremely exhausted immediately after all that a flick of her hand summed the nightmare weeks of simons chip breakdown and nightmare decades of its full function before that ivan supposed more so than i think he let on he always was pretty closed said ivan in what had to be the understatement of the century its not like you could tell the difference from the outside no i suppose you couldnt ivan heard the faint emphasis on that you which presumably did not include her her thirty years of working with simon hadnt exactly been like one of those long marriages where people started finishing each others sentences but it did perhaps partake of some of the elements ivan tried to remember what had been the longest time hed ever stuck with one girlfriend or vice versa surely at least one of them had been more than a year almost a year more than a halfyear delightful for you to call but i must go his mother said firmly tomorrow we really must come up with something else to do with your visitors properly it would be their turn to invite us to dinner but they may not like to do so in that hotel um right said ivan and let her cut the com it being the last weekend before the start of winterfair proper parking around impsec hq was not as impossible as usual ivan only had to walk about a block before the bare little park and the great gloomy building across from it came into view the security headquarters had an imposing facade utterly windowless with the wide stairs leading up to the front doors deliberately designed to be higher than most people could comfortably step the great bronze doors were as far as ivan knew rarely openedeveryone with business here went around to the humanscale entrances on the sides or the back the stone face of the building was severely plain except for a stylized basrelief frieze of painedlooking creatures that miles had once dubbed pressed gargoyles which entirely circled the edifice at the time of the reign of mad yuri the gargoyles had possessed some politicalartisticpropagandistic metaphorical meaning which had once been explained to ivan but that he had promptly forgotten ivan thought the poor things just looked constipated the people of vorbarr sultana over time had named them all and endowed them with varied personalities there were running jokes about the conversations they had up there frozen in their frieze and some of them regularly appeared as editorial cartoon characters and a shortlived childrens animated show ivan dimly remembered from his youth the whole was surrounded in turn by a cobblestone courtyard and high stone walls topped with iron spikes not unlike the ones around vorkosigan house though already archaically outdated for actual defense even at the time theyd been built all the real defenses were electronic and invisible the wall was pierced fore and aft by two gates the gate guards armed with energy weapons muskets would have seemed more inperiod the park was indeed sunny if only because impsec had never permitted trees kiosks bathrooms or bushes installed to impede the line of sight or fire grass a little brown after the first frosts but neatly groomed held up well due to the small number of pedestrians who ventured to cut across it five brightlydressed people were milling about on the turfrish jet em pearl and starwhile tej knelt at the side messing with a portable comconsole and some wireless speakers under stars direction tej stood up and shifted one of the speakers a few meters tej saw ivan and waved but didnt come over to greet him star with jet consulting also shifted around a couple of brightlycolored sticks topped with sparkly pompoms counting off strides taking a line of sight and sticking them back in the ground simon wrapped in an aged military greatcoat was sitting on a bench at the grasss verge benignly overlooking the show hatlessmamere would have had wordswith his thinning graying hair making him look very much like some retired old man watching youngsters at play which ivan supposed he was sort of in some pigs eye somewhere a uniformed impsec officer without a coata major ivan saw as he approachedwas standing talking to simon looking back and forth from his former chief to the dance practice which was just getting rolling again bright music blared jewels were suddenly in motion swaying stomping gesturing rising and dipping jet in a bravura moment suddenly began a series of backflips that ran in a straight diagonal all across the park and ended with him balanced first on one hand and then on one foot thats impressive the major said to simon as ivan came up the fellows eyes shifted from jet to check out ivan in civvies because this was his day off dammit his face cleared captain vorpatril is it ops ivan granted him a nod in lieu of a salute yes sir so you would know what all this is in aid of a rather highenergy galactic dance troupe who have been cooped up on jumpships for too long celebrating their reunion is the tale i was told said ivan easily did simon smile there into his lack of a beard i had never seriously watched dance simon remarked to the major before my retirement lady vorpatril has her own box at the vorbarr sultana hall you know she has been kind enough to invite me to escort her there many times since its been a real artistic education of a style id never had time for earlier in my life old dogs new tricks who knows where it could all end hm well if theyre with you sir the major with a restraint that practically seemed to break somethingperhaps his heartvisibly kept himself from saluting his former chief managing a mere curt farewell nod before turning away to dodge traffic across the street and slip back through the front gate ivan slung himself down on the bench beside simon who had twisted a bit to watch the fellow retreat thats the fifth man who has come out so far to check this out simon observed turning back the ranks keep getting higher have they said ivan neutrally star all slickedback hair green eyes and long leggings bopped out and moved the sparkly pompoms again the music started up once more a slower beat this time jewels glittered in an eyegrabbing and athletic whirl jet repeated the astonishing backflip routine on the parks other diagonal i had always considered simon mused after a bit that for a building housing a cadre of men whose insigniahe touched his civilian shirt collar where no eyeofhorus pins now hungproclaimed to the imperium sees all knows all to have no damned windows allowing them to see out to be some sort of cosmic irony ivan leaned forward slightly to glance around simon at the looming facade i expect they were more worried at the time about windows being blown in the technoeyes were mostly nonobvious but for some antennae and reception dishes peeking over the crenellated roof edge they have electronic surveillance surely of a redundant redundancy it was like working in a granite spaceship hermetically sealed so um ivan considered how to phrase this how far up does the rank have to go before someone in your parade of concerned officers comes out and says what the hell simon i wait with some fascination to find out star shifted markers the four jewels began to dance another pattern granted said simon meditatively the halfdozen men that im sure would begin their inquiries in just those words either have the day off or are out of town which seems like cheating but then it was often much about cheating on all sides ivan considered this what the hell simon simon flashed a thin slice of grin make that seven dont you see no neither can they he glanced across the street no windows ysee im sure we still have some analysts in there somewhere who specialize in the arts but theyre probably kept in a box in the basement poor lads keep watching then the jewels set up once more for a longer pattern this time frowning ivan got up pulled one of the pompom sticks out of the ground and examined it it wasnt very heavy the surface featured swirling candycolored stripes it had a metal ferrule ivan tilted it up to peer in the end which was not solid but which was dark star frowning more fiercely came up and twisted it back out of his hand shook it vigorously and reset it dont screw up our stage marks she chided him someone might have an accident it was hard to tell but ivan suspected the stripes were not the same as before he trod back to rejoin simon the music this time seemed to mix a cheerful march with a winding wail like women lamenting the departure of their citys valiant militia jet produced another bravura set of flips again sowhat was so different about jet he certainly wasnt any more athletic than rish or the others why werent they doing flips he said aloud before he could stop himself jets the heaviest simon glanced aside at him that disturbing faint smile again turning his lips more music started up rish had portioned out the ankle bells ivan had seen on her and tej the other day among the three female jewels they began another dance or dance sectionthey seemed to be practicing movements rather than whole compositions this time the mood was merry the timingthe frequency different yet again jet began his runup and bounced over the ground in a quick succession of thumps ivan blinked and blurted sonic mapping simons smile deepened youre wasted in ops you know i have increasingly thought so if not i admitsome grimace of memory ivan certainly wasnt going to inquire afterearlier in your career i dont think so more to the point admiral desplains doesnt think so im happy in ops well theres that and your mother is happy to have you thereanother lippursing relatively safe nobodys tried to blow up ops for ages they always went for you fellows first one of impsecs many unsung public services human shields for ops but did ops ever say thank you ivan had no idea most ops commentary on impsec reports that hed heard was prefaced by swearing but maybe that was just habit has anyone tried to bomb ops lately or ever since our new building went up after the last one was leveled in the pretendership that is simon huddled down in his coat i wouldnt recall the details now nor the main points in some cases i cant remember was simons allpurpose response to any question he didnt want to answer ivan had suspected for some time it almost always daunted the hell out of the inquirer who sheared off except that ivan was getting used to illyan in some strange domestic way all those little tricks of expression inflection reminder that he used to defend his dignity it had been a horrifically beleaguered dignity during the chip breakdown in some ways ivan had witnessed and didnt wish to dwell on stillthe spooks spook had also been the weasels weasel for all that simon had forgotten ivan didnt think hed forgotten all of that ivan scrambled back up the conversational diversion to the last knot mapping underground mapping what the hell simon i would think you fellows would have had every cubic centimeter of underground vorbarr sultana mapped to the limit especially right around this place underground ugh indeed one would think that i certainly did simon scratched his neck although most people dont realize how incredibly complicated and illdocumented it can get under the old town old sewers abandoned utility tunnels freight access builtover foundations a couple of outdated bankrupted attempts at public transport before the bubbletube system was planned or even thought of streambeds drainage assorted vor mansions personal boltholes and escape hatchesand the same for some less savory prole venues and a rat warren of other covert passages dating back mostly to the occupation but some to other wars several centuries of forgotten secrets down there dying with their possessors ivan glanced again at the six skewed floors and several subbasements of paranoia piled across the street why arent they picking anything up of this over there what would you guess i dunno he considered the odd stagemark stick that hed held in his hand passive analog data collectors i suppose with nothing electronic about them i understand the colorgradient has a biological base that sensitively responds to vibrations yes dancing microbes of some sort ivan wiped his hand on his trousers nervously oh youre in on this then whatever this is i wouldnt say that exactly what would you say exactly at this juncture not much simon it took a bit of effort to make the name come out low and commanding and not a reproachful wail it was effort wasted simon just twitched the damned deadly eyebrows at him as if hed heard the wail in his possiblytelepathic mind anyway and dont even think about that boy there is nothing illegal or even immoral about looking ivan im sure ive even seen those old gentlemen with the metal detectors right here in this park searching for ancient coins and the like retirement hobby or destitution i was never quite sure your guards ran them off surely not always they might after all have found something interesting and have the arquas found something interesting we dont of course know yet till shiv and udine analyze their measurements and what will you do then flowcharts ivan im sure ive heard you go on at length over some meal or another with your lady mother about the warm fuzzy feelings you get from flowcharts this is only the first bifurcation in the decisiontree not the last whatever ivan was feeling right now warm and fuzzy wasnt in it the sun was climbing toward noon though not overhead as high as it got this time of year from the impsec gates there issued a gaggle of pallid men officers and enlisted both clutching lunch sacks and drinks of various sorts they split up and spread out to take over the benches in a practicedseeming way with some of the enlisted ending up sharing their lunch picnics on rolledout ground sheets they all gazed in suspicion at the jewels some gazed in suspicion at the two civilianclothed men on the last bench especially the group displaced from their usual perch till apprised by some of their older colleagues then they just stared tej grinned across at simon and at ivan almost the first his wife had acknowledged his existence since hed sat down and went into a brief huddle with the jewels star opted out looking mildly bored she had collected all the stage markers back into a bundle and seemed to be loading things up the group of jewels split up again and took positions in a circle or square or imaginary fourpointed star tej bent and started the music once more louder than heretofore a very traditional barrayaran mazurka if with a livelier updated beat and flourishes the jewels began to move grandly leaping and kicking in a version that recalled traditional barrayaran mens dances without in any way being one it was by far the most athletic performance yet even jet usually the thrower took his turn being thrown into the airif by two of his sisterjewels in cooperationand somersaulting to daring landings all the men around the perimeter of the park stopped eating to goggle tej watched as if hypnotized with pleasure when the dance finished in a whirl and a shout all the jewels were breathing heavily sweating despite the chill quite spontaneously the impsec men scattered around their impromptu stage broke into applause the jewels grinned and bowed back in one cardinal direction after another concluding with an especially low sweep toward simon and ivan simon rose with one of those mybackhurts sounds made by the aging whether sincerely or for audience effect there had been a deal of audience effect running in several directions here this morning ivan was pretty sure the jewels and tej finished packing up their scant props or gear hauling it to the groundvan parked on the far side of the grassy space you talk to guy allegre about all this yet ivan nodded toward the late outdoor stage or was he one of your six men not yet or him to you i set it as a high probability that well be talking to each other sometime ahgregor simons eyebrows mocked him and what is gregors favorite motto lets see what happens ivan recited glumly i always thought that was an appallingly irresponsible thing for an emperor to say there you go tej came over to inquire rather breathlessly of simon but not ivan did you like the show sir yes i did street theater of the highest order complete with audience participation ivan muttered wait rightsimon hadnt answered his last question or his first for that matter you should take your wife to lunch ivan simon suggested genially he asked tej to convey his thanks to the jewels for the show excused himself and walked off down the boulevard just as though he had been some ordinary passerby whod stopped to watch the rehearsing dancers but tej still elusive claimed chauffeuring duties and fled in the opposite direction ivan feeling at default if not fault sat back on the bench and stared at the blank landscape trying to imagine how far was down chapter eighteen ivan woke the next morning to an empty bed again a depopulated flat and a note on the coffeemaker gone driving t which was better than no reassurance at all but wouldnt love t have been a better closing salutation not that he had ever ended any note to tej with love i so far but then he hadnt ever gone out and left her with just some laconic uninformative scrawl shed come in very late last night too after some family thing and gone straight to sleep with no talk and scarcely a cuddle he buttered his instant breakfast groats which made him think back to the emergency impromptu wedding on komarr and wondered if the gelid grains would taste better with a shot of brandy poured over them instead no no drinking at dawn that was a bad sign not that this was dawnmerely midmorning he tried tejs wristcom without reply and was dumped to her message bin dumped that wasnt a good word either normemory intruded again albeit not one of teja good sign when his wouldbebreezy hey tej call me ivan your husband remember produced no response by the time he had shaved and dressed he steeled himself and walked down the street to the arquaoccupied hotel shiv himself admitted him when he buzzed the door of their suite ah ivan he called over his shoulder udine tejs barrayaran is here he gestured ivan in and to one of the sitting rooms upholstered chairs and fetched coffee from a credenza ivan accepted it gratefully the baronne shut down her comconsole joined her husband on the small sofa facing ivan and cast her provisional soninlaw a cool smile of welcome i just popped in to ask where tej had gone ivan explained she left me a note but it didnt say much udine answered she has kindly taken my mother and amiri out for some touring i dont believe they had a set destination well all right that sounded pretty safe and benign compared to yesterdaysodd performance lady ghem estif was not wholly alarming for a haut woman or exhaut woman and amiri was surely the least jacksonian of this crew a doctor after all aspiring unworldly researcher to boot but ivan was beginning to regret getting tej all those driving lessons couldnt you hire a driver wondering if that sounded rude he added i could help you find one or captain raudsepp could no doubt perhaps later on said shiv but this gave tej a chance to catch up with her favorite brother ah said ivan unable to argue with that dead end he cast around for another topic one came up readily so ahhow long are you folks planning to stay on barrayar anyway i expect that will rather depend on pidges success in obtaining our emergency visa extension said udine oh yeah said ivan hows that going for you moving along said udine she thinks it may prove advantageous to hire a local lawyer she said shed know by tomorrow or the next day my um mother might be able to put you in touch with a good one ivan suggested not that he necessarily wanted their stay extended with one exception lady alys has already made that offer said udine brightly so helpful your mother what will you all do if the extension is he started to say denied but switched on the fly to granted you wouldnt be planning to stay permanently would you apply for immigration status take oath as barrayaran subjects i should probably warn you they take oaths pretty seriously around here udine smiled slightly i am aware it wouldnt be my first choice said shiv gemblack eyes narrowing in his dark face in some unreadable emotion but if there is one thing my life has taught me its the need to stay flexible barrayar is not a place i would ever have gone voluntarily but i must say ive been agreeably surprised by what ive seen here they do say travel broadens the mind if none of our firstchoice plans work out we may simply have to develop some newenterprise his carved lips drew back in a smilelike expression ivan tried to imagine how a jacksonian who had already once fought his way to the top of a major house defined that last term plus wife dont forget they did seem to be a team the only comparison he had was miless jacksonianraised and relentlessly entrepreneurial clonebrother mark which wasnot especially reassuring ivan wondered if it was better to lay his cards right on the table just what are you people after under that park in front of impsec or let them assume him oblivious presumed obliviousness had served ivan well many times in the past after all perhaps he should split the difference just how close to tapped out were the arquas anyway could he ask raudsepp morozov hell why not ask shiv he leaned back and tented his hands remembered where that gesture came from almost put them down but then left them up sojust how close are you folks to being tapped out anyway its been a pretty long run for you to get this far he just barely stopped his mouth from going on and apologizing for such a rude question as udine at least was nodding in rare approval shivs eyeflick caught it too his thick shoulders gave a little shrug how much is enough depends on what you want to do with it venture capitali believe you planetary agriculturalists would call it seed corn ah yes thats the termif a man is reduced to consuming his startup stake he has nothing to hazard for the next round what do you people call your currency marks well barrayaran marks betan dollars cetagandan reyuls doesnt matter the principles the same theres a saying in the whole its easier to turn one million into two million than it is to turn one into two the effective breakpoint for us put in udine is enough to fund a credible attempt to retake house cordonah we are shall we say not without hidden resources and potential allies back in the whole but not if we arrive appearing to be disarmed destitute and desperate whether you can climb up to success or are forced down to grubberdom depends on making your breakpoint said shiv both success and failure are feedback loops that way me i started as a gutter grubber i dont plan on going back down to that gutter again alive jacksonian determination glinted in shivs eye reminding ivan for a weird moment of his cousin miles people for whom failure was psychologically tantamount to death yeah ivan had a few clues as to what forces had shaped miles that way putative child of privilege though he was the chief of whom had been named general count piotr vorkosigan though barrayars endemic hostility toward perceived mutations had certainly provided an ongoing chorus to that appalling old man whose every grudging grain of approval had been won by his mutie grandson by an equally appalling achievement or at least some bonecracking attempt at it on ivans personal youthful list of people to avoid greatuncle piotr had been at the top not a ploy available to miles poor sawedoff sod so what had shaped and wound that same tight spring in shiv and udine as well ivan wasnt sure he wanted the tour isnt enough to fund a small war also enough to say buy a nice tropical island and retire ivan couldnt help asking not while those prestene bastards hold two of my children hostage said shiv grimly not to mention my hair said udine plucking at her fringe shiv caught the nervous hand and kissed it looking sideways at his wife and for the first time ivan wondered what else besides the hair yet whatever had been done to her in the unsavory hands of her enemies ivan was pretty sure the hair was going to be the only part ever mentioned aloud ah yeah said ivan no it wasnt just about money there was blood on the line as well ivan understood blood well enough but it did give ivan a notion as to what the arquas thought was under that park enough to fund a small war or buy a tropical island depending on ones tastes in such things and these two didnt look to be going for the drinks with fruit on little sticks but ahtej wouldnt really need to go back with you for that would she surely it would be safer to leave her here on barrayar with me with you said udine raising an eyebrow and making ivan twitch i do umlike her a lot ivan managed he wondered if so does my mother and sortofstepfather would be good to add or if that would just up the bidding on the deal udine sat back so you like her enough to want her to forsake her family and stay with youbut do you like her enough to leave your family and go with her shiv too stared narrowly at him at this its true he does have that barrayaran military training it is unclear how much he also has barrayaran military experience however ivan gulped unnerved id be delighted to leave my family and go somewhere with tej just notnot jacksons whole not my kind of place yknow hm said shiv opaquely he eased back in his seat though ivan hadnt noticed him tense ivan said look i can support a wife here on barrayar and i know my home ground on jacksons whole id be whatdestitute and disarmed not to mention out of my depth as tej has been here udine inquired sweetly shiv gave him the eyebrow thing a man should know himself i suppose he said me ive been face flat sucking gutter slime three times in my life and had to start again each time from scratch im getting too old to enjoy shoveling that shit anymore but i cant say i dont know how this was not ivan sensed a remark in ivans favor oblique though it sounded i as well murmured udine though only once i do not mean to let this present contretemps stand as twice but you left your original family ivan tried to go with shiv your new husband didnt you anyway left your planet udines voice went dry more evicted than left in the event we were fleeing the barrayaran military conquest of komarr at the time although that worked out surprisingly well shiv murmured in the long run that passing hand grip again on the sofa between them her eyes grew amused and turned back on ivan yes i suppose i should thank you barrayarans for that ejecting me out of my rut i wasnt born yet ivan put in just in case dare he ask them straight out are you planning to take tej away what if the answer was yes certainly did tej think she had a vote did they think tej had a vote or ivan no jacksonians didnt have votes they had deals for the first time ivan wondered uneasily what he had to offer at the great house scale of play his personal wealth though doubtless impressive to some prole or grubber would barely tweak their scanners his blood was more hazard than hope the main question being how far it would splash in a crunch and he wasnt a candidate for conscription into their system as they had hinted not under any circumstances which leftwhat udines gaze strayed to her abandoned comconsole the suite was awfully quiet ivan realized where were all the rest of the clan this morning and what were they doing well dont let us keep you captain vorpatril from what but ivan took the hint and stood rightoh thanks for the coffee if you hear from tej before i do ask her to call me huh he tapped his wristcom meaningfully certainly said udine shiv saw him back to the door as it so happens he said eyeing ivan shrewdly we do have a little side deal in progress here on barrayar if it is successful it will certainly aid our departure and if you want to see the back of clan arqua maybe youd better do your bit to see it is successful huh seemed to hang in the air implied i sure hope everything works out ivan responded shiv merely looked amused at that manifest vagueness ivan retreated down the hotel corridor he rather thought he might also see the back of clan arqua by just waiting and letting nature or at least customs amp immigration take its course deportation that was the ticket and he personally wouldnt have to lift a finger and tej would not be included in the roundup because she had what had lady ghem estif called it umbrella residency as a spouse all right and tight and no argument there if she chose yeah it seemed to ivan that he needed to court his wife promptly in the next what was it ten days if he could catch her in passing in this spate of arqua chores but how can i court her when no one even gives me a chance to see her tej parked the rented groundcar and stared dubiously around the dim underground garage after yesterdays dance in the park and some sharp debate over city maps pearl had found this placeby the simple method of walking around and lookingunder one of the few commercial buildings near impsec hq which was otherwise mainly ringed by assorted stodgy government offices this building housed mostly offices as well attorneys a satellite communications company an architectural firm a terraforming consultant financial managers of various sorts the two layers of garage were packed during the day but relatively clear after hours and on the barrayaran weekend which this was this commercial building lay on a corner across the street from the backside as it were of the security headquarters the far side unfortunately from the little park that had indeed been found to top grandmamas old lab site or most of it some of the lab had been mapped to run under the street fronting the headquarters if impsecs subbasements had been dug two dozen meters farther southeast back in mad yuris day theyd have cut right into the labs top corner tej didnt see how they could have missed detecting it but the baronne claimed they must have dadawas perhaps persuading himself to believe as tej amiri and grandmama exited the groundcar pearl detached herself from the shadow of a pillar and waved them over amiri removed a hefty valise from the trunk and followed its looking good said pearl seems to be a storeroom for garage maintenance in use but no one has been in or out since ive been monitoring ive adjusted the lock for us she glanced around and led the way into a small utilitarian chamber lit only at the moment by a cold light set on a metal shelf the chamber and shelves seemed to contain stacks of various traffic barricades buckets of paint a ladder and encouragingly dusty miscellanea pearl cracked a second cold light doubling the eerie illumination we need to leave it looking like no one has been in or out too said amiri at least for now where should we start lets shift these two shelves said pearl we can shift them back after here tej take one end tej dutifully lifted her half of the grubby thing when they were done a large patch of concrete flooring lay exposed in the chambers corner from the valise amiri handed out breath masks all marked with logos from the jumpship line the arquas had traveled in on tej was under the impression that such safety devices were supposed to be handed back at the end of the voyage but oh well waste not he then donned biotainer gloves and removed a bottle from the valise everyone else stood well back as he squatted and trailed a line of liquid in a smooth circle about a meter in diameter over the concrete which began to bubble while the cutting fluid worked he laid out other objects including a long mysterious padded case then they all stood back and stared for a while all right he said at last and he tej and pearl combined to lever the concrete slab out of its matrix and shove it aside revealed was a layer of pressed stones pearl trundled up a waste bin and she and amiri and tel then knelt and began prying up rocksby hand you might have brought a shovel tej grumbled there should only be about a half a meter of this before we hit subsoil amiri said maybe less if the contractor stinted many hands make light the work grandmama intoned watching at tejs irritated glance over her shoulder she added its an old earth saying i picked up no wonder everybody left the planet muttered tej hired grubbers with power tools seemed a better deal for lightening a load to her i would feel more secure if we could have found a place to rent or buy said amiri really proof against interruptions but this leaves no data trail said pearl perhaps defending her find this squabble continued intermittently until tej found herself at the bottom of a halfmeterdeep hole levering rocks out of identifiable dirt grandmama leaned over shone the light down and said thats probably enough at least amiri gave tej a hand out she pulled down her mask and sucked on a bleeding fingertip where her nail had broken amiri brought the long box to the lip of the hole took a deep breath and knelt to open it you dont have to handle it like a live bomb grandmama chided its quite inert until its activated if the stuff eats dirt wont it eat us said amiri only if you are foolish enough to get it on yourself while its working said grandmama which i trust no grandchild of mine would be especially after how many years of expensive escobaran biomedical education amiri sighed and redonned his gloves tej ventured nearer to look more closely into the box it bore a label reading mycoborer experimental gsa patent applied for do not remove from galactech company premises without authorization under penalty of immediate termination and criminal prosecution inside the box were layers of trays holding an array of thin dark sticks each about fifty centimeters long how deep should we go for the first vertical shaft asked amiri since pearls location has given us the first two stories down for free i think eight meters should be enough to start said grandmama judiciously we may have to dogleg down more later depending on what we find between but that should put us approximately level with the top floor of my old laboratory bunker what diameter a meter may not be very roomy if we have to bring much stuff back up and out mm we may be able to drive a parallel or diagonal shaft later for the moment the chief urgency is to get someone inside to inventory whats still there as swiftly as possible if anything tej couldnt help thinking right said amiri and gingerly took up a pair of cutters measured eight centimeters along one of the sticks and snipped it through he then took a halfmeterlong drilling rod descended to the hole and began twisting it down through the hardpacked soil everything still all by gloved hand if were doing this said tej then why do i have to spend all day tomorrow driving star around to engineering and plumbing supply places to give your nice impsec people something to look at dear said grandmama they will be happier that way im sure by the time they think were ready to start we should be done said pearl how did you find out about thisshe bent to peer at the labelmycoborer product anyway i did some consulting a few years back for galactech bioengineering and struck up an acquaintance with one of the developers did you steal it out of their labs asked pearl with an air of incipient admiration by no means said grandmama with a bit of a sniff possibly at so crude a concept but when i and your mother and shiv thought of this possible resource i remembered carlo and went to see him he was happy to give me a large supply i thought it might be needed her tone was a touch smug amiri slipped the stick down his new hole eyed it for straightness climbed out and drew from his valise a liter bottle of perfectly ordinary household ammonia apparently purchased from some local grocery he descended again and gingerly poured about half of it in around the stick it disappeared into the dark with a bare gurgle only its pungent aroma rising along with amiri from their little excavation tej hastily readjusted her mask four people stood around the pit staring nothings happening said tej after a minute i thought you said this would work fast said pearl its not instantaneous chided grandmama macrobiological processes seldom are she added after a while as anything visible continued to not happen the mycoborer was developed as a method of laying pipe without having to dig trenches the genetic developer hopes it can be trained to build its own custom pipe as it goes but that seems to lie in the future for the moment theyre happy to have it proceed in a straight route with uniform diameter pipes said tej trying to picture this will they be big enough for people to get through some pipes are quite large said grandmama for civic water tunnels and underground monorails for example oh said tej umif its really alive what stops it from just growing forever the tubular walls which are composed of its own waste products eventually choke it off said grandmama failing that there is a suicide gene builtin after it loses enough telomeres and failing that there is ordinary senescence and failing that it can be sterilized by heat really i was entirely in sympathy with poor carlo over his frustration with the delays about the scaledup outdoor testing those earth regulatory agencies are so obstructive amiri blinked wait this stuff has never been tested outdoors no it has been tested most extensively in carlos laboratory she added pensively it is supposed to penetrate fairly swiftly through soil subsoil and clay soso through sand poor in limestone stopped by granite and other igneous rocks and by most synthetic materials it is possible we may be compelled to reroute a few times if the mycoborer comes up against unexpected subsoil inclusions amiri was staring downward looking disconcerted never been testedand were betting the house on it its being tested now said grandmama in a voice of utmost reason and in a very tidy legal isolation from its earthbased parent company too biological isolation as well although i have promised to send carlo a full report of the trial sub rosa of course that was as dear shiv would say our deal she took the cold light from pearl knelt and squinted ah she said sounding suddenly satisfied now you can start to see something all tej saw was what appeared to be a foam of black goo forming around the lip of the borer hole but amiri seemed vaguely impressed no noise no vibration no power surges of any kind said grandmama silent and stealthy as a fungal filament nothing for sensors to detect until we start to walk about down there i trust you all can contain your chatter when the time comes great said pearl now can we go to lunch excellent idea said grandmama certainly is it safe to leave this stuff alone asked amiri grandmama shrugged if its not safe to leave its not safe to stay with now is it thatsa point said amiri reluctantly he didnt say what kind tej helped shift the slab back move the shelves and tidy up when they finished there was no sign of their intrusion but a new crack in the concrete which since the floor had a few others ought to pass visual inspection they exited the garage into a cold afternoon rain and then she had no attention left for anything but getting them all through vorbarr sultana traffic alive as a first step toward reseducing tej ivan had a splendid dinner waiting her return that evening and waiting slowly drying out about two hours after shed said shed be home the door at last slid open and voices sounded ivan arose grumpily from the couch schooled his face into a smile and lost it again as not only tej but rish and byerly strode in in the middle of a raging argument and stop putting bugs in my hair rish snarled to by youd think you were twelve if you would just talk to me we wouldnt have any need for this roundabout method of communication said by his normally suave voice slipping a bit and where do you get the we need anyway if i need to talk to you i will believe me tej rubbed her temples as if they ached hi ivan xav she said in a dull voice she did not advance to kiss him or as had been her even more charming habit considering her fetching build hug him sorry im late things ran on what things just things well dinner said ivan brightly yeah it looked to be hypoglycemia city all around here i had a late lunch said tej im going back to the hotel said rish ivan didnt even get out an oh good before she went on are you coming with me tej or do you want to stay here and be interrogated tej cast ivan a grimace that had little in common with a smile and a tired wave yes all right wait ivan called as they reversed direction shedding by when will you be back i dont know well will you be back here to sleep should i wait up i dont know i wont said rish im going to bunk in with em and pearl i suppose the hotel can give me a gelmattress or something she glowered at byerly and padded past him without looking back tej trailed disconsolately the door slid shut once more silence fell ivan and by stared at one another ivan said werent you supposed to be the glib debonair impsec agent here byerly said a rude word or not as the case may be shes cut me off she says i suppose i shouldnt have tried to slip in a few subtle questions during sex she didnt like it ah said ivan and mentally edited his own planned ploy for later if there was a later but i am half maddened with curiosity arquas have been handing me off one to another for the past three days all the same runaround going nowhere they wouldnt be working so hard if they didnt have something to hide unless its a practical joke i suppose he let out his breath in a huff and sloped over to fling himself on ivans couch ivan stuffed his hands in his pockets and followed reluctantly cant you call for backup did by put his head back eyes closing impsec it seems is busy this week galactic domestic komarran all the affairs that highlevel diplomatic conference going on at the residence the big comconsolenet security convention downtown prep for dear laisas upcoming excursion with the crown prince to komarr to see the grandparentsyes they promise me help at the end of the week or next week maybe meantime im on my own just me and this ungodly herd of your inlaws his eyes opened and shot a look of unmerited blame ivanward to whom i am already outed ivan had seldom seen by emit so much emotion at one time granted it was all one emotion frustration but still byerlythesmooth was decidedly ruffled ive cozied up to every arqua said by closedeyed and addressing the ceiling once more staked out the hotel planted bugs which have either yielded nothing but rubbish or gone fuzzy altogether theyre spotting them all right god what havent i tried ivan hesitated simon by made to raise his head but it fell back he did open his eyes again are you nuts no listen ivan described his excursion yesterday to the park in front of impsec the dance practice simons security street theater and what seemed the pertinent bits of his strange conversation this morning with the baron and the baronne by sat up and clasped his hands between his knees listening hard simon and shiv have some deal going on id swear it said ivan or something going back to that first night in simons study and they think theres something buried where under impsec hq what for gods sake i dont know something big enough to fund a small war and old enoughi hesitate to guess how old but what say a hundred years occupation maybe or should i say ninth satrapy thats before impsec was built simon ought to know but did he remember if simon illyan is up to something we shouldnt bump his elbow by declared firmly imnot so sure bys eyes narrowed i thought he was just playing befuddled so by had spotted that good on by he does do that hes got half of vorbarr sultana believing hes as addled as an egg and my mother his caretaker and the people they report to right but sometimes heshorts out just a little you can tell when its real because its the only time he tries to hide it oh by frowned i suppose you would know seeing him close up and all mostly its seeing my mother she gets this kind of brittle look around her eyes when shes covering for him but thats just little memory lapses right its illyan you want to try to guess what goes on in his head ivan gave it a beat or do you want to go ask thats what simon had once told ivan to do after all in so many words if barrayars foremost former authority gave you advice no said by frankly he hesitated but ill go if youll go with me what are we a couple of women getting up a posse to go to the lav why do women travel in herds like that anyway ivan said glumly delia galeni back when she was delia koudelka once told me they go together to critique their dates really by blinked not sure she might have just been trying to wind me up at the time ah sounds like delia byerly waved a limp hand all right lead on ivan sighed and pulled him up then made him help eat the dehydrated dinner first because ivan had cooked it himself dammit but definitely without the seducing part he left the dishes in the sink chapter nineteen ivan drove by to his mothers building in his twoseater despite or perhaps because of the heavy rain the city traffic was relatively light to ivans secret relief they found simon alone for the evening mamere had gone off to the imperial residence to help coordinate some sort of feed hosted by gregor and laisa for those galactic diplomats by had complained ofa crowd guaranteed to clear a buffet table much the way time of isolation cavalry charges had cleared street riots ivan was only surprised neither of them had been roped in as native barrayaran decor as mamere frequently did unto them for these things huh said simon looking them both over when they were guided into his study by the maidservant playing porter tonight you two again he set aside his reader and took his slippered feet down from the hassock that had supported them in extended comfort he was dressed in shirtsleeves and a sleeveless sweater making him look in the lamplight like someones retired schoolteacheruncle close the door would you please marie yes sir should i bring drinks by looked briefly hopeful but ivan said firmly no thank you marie very good lord ivan she withdrew and the door shut rather more than firmly it was extraordinarily quiet in this chamber once that lock clicked byerly swallowed and ivan thought irritably welcome to chez vorpatril please take a seat i will be your spine for this evening not his favorite role under any circumstances well gentlemen simon waved genially to chairs and tented his hands above his lap what brings you to me this rainy night why arent you out squiring your young ladies by grimaced and barely shifted the comfy chairs ivan dragged them closer to their host on whom he felt an unwanted responsibility to keep an eye by sat on the edge of his sir by began atop ivans simon they both stopped and waved each other on ivan began again since by seemed determined to outwait him simon what do you know that we dont about what the arqua clan is up to in front of impsec or under impsec as it may be simons eyes crinkled just slightly i cant guess ivan what do you two know that they think theres something under there probably cetagandan and probably dating back to the occupation and shiv and udine arqua think its valuable enough to fund their attempt to retake their house which has got to be a highend hobby how the hell they think they can extract whatever it is right under impsecs collective nose not to mention get it out of the empire defeats me but i think not you want to give me a clue simon murmured something under his breath that might have been but youre so much more amusing without one ivan didnt ask him to repeat it simon went on well thats proving more interesting than i thought at first glance how do we know what we know its really a very philosophical question yeah but im a practical kind of guy said ivan recognizing simondiversion the man could keep interrogators going in circles for hours at parties all that practice ivan supposed on both sides of the table and im tired and my wifes stopped talking to me oh im sorry to hear that was it something you said simon byerly mustered his nerve and got out sir did you make some kind of deal with shiv arqua or does he just think you did mm said simon in a judicious tone i believe it was more in the nature of a bet ivan rubbed his face just how drunk were you two the other night simonsmirked perhaps a little but it was my favorite sort of bet very rare in my experienceone i cant lose it was bys turn to wail sir simon held up a hand abandoning thank god his sport upon his juniors to answer your first question first ivan what the arquas appear to be after is a cetagandan bunker built during the occupation under the mansion that formerly stood on impsec hqs site it was first mapped and marked cleared at the time the foundation for the headquarters was excavated under mad yuris and increasingly disturbed donos civil engineering aegis you know you mean ive been running in circles for a week chasing nothing said by indignantly not quite that said simon but impsec knew it was there all this time said ivan once again we return to the subtleties of the term know or perhaps remember impsecs records have been damaged many times in the intervening decades and even without that people who know things transfer or retire or die to be replaced withpeople who know different things lets say a kind of cumulative organizational amnesia its possible there might be some halfadozen men in impsec now alive who have personally examined those original historical documents but thats likely a generous estimate are you one of those men asked ivan simon shrugged i may have been i did a great deal of such homework when i was just taking over the place threeandahalf decades ago and cleaning up after the pretendership and negri dear god almost worse thananyway all i can tell you now is that the information didnt make enough of an impression upon me for much detail to be retained in my organic memory alongside my artificial one of course there was a great deal of competition for my attention back then thats the old records said ivan what about the bunker itself surely it has to still be on impsecs own current site maps oh certainly it is and its just been left sitting there ever since yuris day said by more or less my plan for that park was that it was to be the site of the new impsec building which as you know i never got whenever they excavated the foundations the bunker would have been revisited and after a quick check by us for safety issues turned over to the university historians to get what they could after which my contractors would continue i had the archeological dig boss all picked out in my mind simon sighed simon remembered quite a bit apparently along certain odd lines did shiv promise to cut you in demanded ivan for a percent of umnothing so who was doing who by muttered and thenwhat ivan continued growing perturbed in a whole new way just let them go on falsely hoping watch them while they try to break into an empty vault youre a cruel bastard simon i always had to be this time however the future of the imperium and millions of lives dont seem to be at stake making it all much more relaxing not to mention the quite standard procedure of letting a suspect run to lead the observer to other contacts which i should not have to explain to you byerly that probably worked a lot better when the observer hadnt been outed to the suspects ivan thought glumly simon added after a reflective moment also i was extremely interested to see how far they would get something of a private test for guy allegre what did he ever do to you in that case was it fair to cover for that damn mapping dance yesterday morning you know the jewels wouldve been run off if you hadnt been sitting there nodding benignly mm not so much cover as catalyze in my view speed things up simon frowned and added although my presence should not have caused an alteration in security procedures i mean to have words with guy about that later he added after another moment mind you my personal evaluation is that the civil engineering problems of tunneling in secret around impsec will defeat them as they have the many who have tried before and a smashandgrab approach say driving down through the park dirt with a plasma beam some what some twenty or thirty meters and boiling a hole through the roof of the bunker is simply not on nevertheless if they manage some way through those challenges and if they finally break inthen will be the right psychological moment to make my deal ivans eyes narrowed what are you playing for simon wider strategic concerns by made a kind of weak inquiring throatclearing noise simon cast a headtilt his way jacksons whole has always been a problem disguised as an opportunity for impsec and the imperium too far away for direct intervention but sitting astride a major wormhole route out of the cetagandan empire which gives the cetas roughly similar strategic interests to our own and the same problem with working through local contactsthey tend not to stay bought house fell has always been dangerous but determinedly independent morozov believes that house prestene has strong cetagandan contactsand it now controls two out of the five wormholes in a possible first move on a monopoly the loss of house cordonah was originally judged to make little difference in that count as they were thought to be technically neutral but with personal ties to the cetagandans through the baronne having now met moira ghem estif i amrethinking that i uhshiv arqua doesnt strike me as material to be anybodys puppet said ivan still less shiv and udine ours or the cetas puppet no allyperhaps even just having a reliable safe house for our agents in the whole would be a tactical improvement over the present confusion so youre thinking of offering himthemwhat asked by at present nothing till ive had a bit longer to evaluate the man word in your ear simon ivan put in uneasily the man and the woman evaluating shiv without udine would be like liketrying to assess uncle aral and leaving out aunt cordelia they seemed that tight to me simons brows climbed really his attention on ivan was suddenly sharper how do you come by that impression ivan stirred uncomfortably not any one thing just the way they add up hm simons lips pursed not that i in my capacity as a mere retired imperial subject am in a position to promise anything to anyone of course shiv keptnot noticing that ivan refrained from blurting a raspberry through his lips at this disingenuity it would have disturbed by so said by slowly what is all this thenan iq test for a future ally simons smile flashed nothing so simple alas or unidirectional the one other thing i would point outbut did either of you notice i handed it to you a few minutes ago by shot ivan an agonized look simon playing mentor sometimes reminded ivan of his worst moments from his school days or maybe one of those nightmares where you found yourself running to a test naked and hed been miless boss for years maybe that too explained something about his cousin simon sat back clearly willing to wait till the coin dropped for hours if need be and no endofperiod bell to save them simon had always been very precise in his speech a habit that had survived the chipremoval his current pauses for memorysearches were hardly distinguishable from the old ones forthe same thing only more reliable hed said hed just said marked cleared said ivan would that be the same thing as um was cleared simons smile at him grew briefly genuine it was not only before i took over impsec it was before i was born who now knows moira ghem estif ivan hazarded its plain she does think theres something there one of you has to be wrong simon nodded as for the marked cleared problem i have someone looking into that with suitable historical expertise privately on the side when he gets a spare moment ivan blinked you got duv galeni running inside searches for you wont he get in trouble and its not his department for all i know its all declassified and stored in the imperial university archives by now said simon but in either case duvs the man to most efficiently put his finger on it i should report this said by ershould i report this i dont know byerly should you simon said thatsnot fair sir not especially no simon took in bys harassed look and measured out a small drop of mercy you have some time to meditate upon it shiv can only have started to tackle the tunneling problem they need to line up local equipment perhaps local contactsif i were you id keep a close eye on shiv and star as the most likely to possess the technical expertise the problem was always what to do with the telltale dirt and the longer the shaft the bigger the pilewell ivan admitted reluctantly tej drives everyone everywhere and isnt talking to you you said thats actually rather convenient right now at least you know its not personal ivan wasnt so sure which means the arquas are under the gun to solve their visa extension problem or theyll never make it to the engineering ones i am so tempted to help with that afraid your game will be over too soon simon in any case simon had apparently decided that it was time for this chat to be over for he slid the conversation into amenities and then somehow a few minutes later ivan found himself and by being amiably escorted to the door ivan calculating how soon his mother was likely to be back allowed the eviction without protest that was reassuring said byerly as they settled themselves in ivans twoseater once more illyan is on top of it might have known ivans lips twisted eh by glanced aside at him i didnt notice anything addled about any of that did you no ivan admitted addled isnt exactly the problem here where would tej fall if things played out the way simon picturedor if they didnt for that matter but in any case if she was forced to take sides if she and ivan each were by buckled up in a pointed manner ivan aimed his car out of the garage and turned into the street and said where do you want me to drop you your flat or back to the hotel no i shant put any more arquas to the trouble of finding new circles to lead me in tonight by sighed my flat i suppose ivan took the turn that would lead on to the shabbytrendy parts of old town vorbarr sultana by put his head back and closed his eyes although given the lack of any whiteknuckled grips anywhere presumably not at ivans driving which was if not sedate was at least equally fatigued after a few minutes apropos some unguessable chain of thought by remarked i dont usually get attached to my surveillance subjects considering your usual crowd i can see why said ivan mm said by not disagreeing and after another minute ivan youve had a lot of girlfriends byerly vorrutyer is about to ask me for relationship advice ivan didnt know whether to be flattered or appalled or to distract his passenger with a few evasive lightflyer moves somewhat impeded by being in a ground vehicle seems like every time i saw you you had a different one hanging on your arm they werent all girlfriends mamere always made me do a lot of diplomatic and social escort duty actual real taketobed girlfriends had been less abundant though ivan wasnt about to explain this to by you made them all look like girlfriends well sure how did you keep them all happy the lightspangled night rain flickered by outside the canopy the wet streets wanted background music some soulful lament to urban lonelinessyou know and somehow probably because of the damned rain ivans mouth went off on its own ive always wondered why nobody ever notices that lots and lots of girlfriends entail lots and lots of breakups enough to learn all the road signs by heart yeah bys eyes opened his brows climbed huh you never seemed to point up that part no a lot of his troubles had seemed to start come to think with oblique or notsooblique pressure for a high vor wedding even from a couple of the women who were already married which ivan had naively thought would put a sock in the issue hed never had those troubles with tej hah if hed known how relaxing being marriedas opposed to getting marriedcould be he might have done this years ago except then it wouldnt have been with tej so it wouldnt have been like this now would it he contemplated this paradox glumly by leaned back in his seat with a tired sigh well at least parting with tej should be no challenge for you ivan could not he supposed stop his car in the middle of traffic and strangle an impsec agent no matter how personally annoying the man was fortunately bys block came up before temptation overcame prudence by bade him thanks and farewell with his usual boneless wave ivan wondered whether tej would be home yet or not and then couldnt decide whether to speed up or slow down an irresolution that kept him tepidly at the speed limit all the way back to his buildings garage ivan spent the next two days chasing tej around the clock she returned from the hotel very late rishless when ivan was already half comatose and shrinking from the thought of tomorrow mornings alarm the workweek resumed ivans shift ran over due to what seemed an unending stream of minor ops cockups and stupidities eliciting a return of memos running a short range from the tart to the sarcastic and had ivan mentally composing a whole new level of the latter searing in any case he missed dinner and tej who was out doing more driving ivans preemptive strike for the next eveningdinner reservations at a restaurant for tej and her family for which shed have to show up if only because shed have to ferry the rest of themresulted in less than a quorum of arquas but still more than enough to prevent any serious personal discussions vapid tourist talk dominated the table the public venue had been a bad idea ivan should invite them to his flat for the sort of intimate conclave he wantedpreferably with fastpenta served with the soup or maybe the predinner drinks alas that the truth drug could not be administered orally no private talk with tej that night either nor even sex as a substitute an evasion for which ivan was beginning to think he might be willing to settle since the evening ended with rish back on ivans couch presumably bys bedluck was equally dire but it seemed an insufficient consolation and in the morning tej let him oversleep too muchdeliberately so that he had to rush off for his day of armwrestling with opss finest idiots without talk kisses breakfast or coffee this cant go on the mycoborer was misbehaving tej adjusted her maska simple hospital filter mask without electronic components acquired by amiri from whoknewwhereyanked on her plastic gloves and prepared to follow amiri grandmama and jet on the nonetoosolid flexladder down the meterwide black shaft the chemical cold lights hooked to everyones belts bobbed as they descended making a bright but unsteady illumination she had to admit the results of the first three days of mycoborer penetration were impressive after that initial visit amiri and jet had found their way to the garage on their own by different routes each time for onceaday checks and repositionings of new mycosticks as the old ones successively pooped out but tej was afraid grandmama was going to have to report to her earth friend that his straight route and uniform diameter goals were still a hope for the future the black walls of the shaft waveredand not just from her wobbling lightwidened and constricted irregularly and bent away tej arrived at a kind of foyer amiri had made at the bottom of the shaft to store the bulk of their supplies straightened and caught her breath amiri held a finger to his mask as little talking as possible from here on he whispered jet and tej nodded dutifully theyd left their wristcoms in the locked utility room and traded shoes for soft muffling slippers tejs had bunny faces on the toes and grandmamas had kittens which was what they got for letting em do the shopping she supposed the floor felt odd through themrubbery not solid the tunnel leading away toward the park was just wide enough to stand upright in though grandmama had to bend her head except where it occasionally constricted and they all had to duck through worse it turned randomly twice they had to sit and slide around complete bends it seemed less like traveling a tunnel than like crawling through a giant intestine continuing the comparison the tube also seemed to be growing appendixes most were no larger in diameter than tejs arm she felt no impulse to stick her hand in glove or no but jet having taken a possessive attitude toward it all demonstrated that one could tej made a face at him jet stopped at another irregular wide spot his eyes bright over his mask amiri was leading grandmama on toward an inspection of the working face he cast a look of irritation over his shoulder but could not of course yell at them their lights bobbed away here jet whispered pointing with his light to his prize or surprise as hed resolutely refused to tell his sister what the wildly wonderful thing that hed found was a pale skeletal foot was sticking through the wall at about waist height tej jumped back and glared at her oddbrother evenbrothers oddbrothers all brothers were the same he apparently found it hilarious that she wasnt allowed to scream choking instead she drew a calming breath deciding that an unruffled front would be the best revenge well thats one barrayaran who wont be bothering us jet snickered and drew a long folding steel knife from his jacket pocket he opened it and held the point to the rubbery wall beside the foot leaning in after a moment of resistance it poked through what are you doing tej demanded in a tight whisper as he began to saw the walls harden up after a couple of days as they cure he whispered back wont be able to do this tomorrow without making noise its now or never tej could see the logic of that though she didnt see the problem with never or at least somebody else much later jet finding that he couldnt pull the foot out of the wall even after hed cut a small circle around it started on a much larger circle when he peeled that away entirely too much dirt came through and tej wondered if she should run and which way but the stream trailed off jet dug a bit more then stood up with his hand stuck through out of sight and a surprised expression on his face theres space past here another tunnel maybe asked tej that poor fellow has to have got all the way down here somehow jet knelt again digging with canine enthusiasm and style after too much more dirt he bent and wriggled through his opening his voice came back after a moment wow you should see this tej wasnt sure that was true butshe couldnt let her little brother go off exploring in a dangerous place on his own now could she she nearly had a responsibility to follow him she stuffed her hair down her jacket collar donned her knit hat and wriggled after jet he was crouching in a small smelly space seemingly held upright by some bowedlooking timber supports not very much farther along some other supports were crushed very flat had a cavein trapped their corpse a long time ago or the space would smell much worse about half of the body was uncovered facedown skeletal arms out as if clawing a tiny wisp of hair still clung to the skull but otherwise most of the organics seemed to have decomposed including some of his clothing the synthetics still held up shabbily some woven straps most of a backpack of some sort flung out before him as if by his bony hands some metal bits were blobs of corrosion or rust others still shiny including those eyepins shed seen on the impsec men and a strange necklace around the skeletons neck tej worked it loose to find a metal tag at the end with incised letters an unfamiliar prole name abelard v the rank of sergeantassuming that was what the abbreviation ssgt translated toand a long alphanumeric string it looks like he was a barrayaran soldier murmured tej so what was he doing down here she looked up to find jet opening the backpack dont touch that she said in a fierce whisper why not asked jet folding back the cover i think its a bomb even jet paused at this he brought his cold light closer to reveal a wad of corroded and uncorroded but in any case dead electronics and an even more mysterious gray mass er he said and backed up a little tej pocketed the necklace and crawled over to look more closely the gray mass several kilos worth was slumping and old wires led into it plastic explosive of some kind tej hazarded jets brow wrinkled some really old kind maybe its deteriorated by now maybe its not um a frightened whisper amiris voice came from their hole tej jet jet rolled over stuck his head down and whispered back amiri you have to come see this i told you to leave that damned foot alone yes but its attached to a whole guy youre the doctoryou might be able to tell how old he is some muffled swearing was followed a few minutes later by amiri wriggling through their makeshift passage anger at his more adventurous siblings warred with curiosity in his expression with a visible mental iou curiosity won temporarily amiris gloved fingers danced over the visible portions of the corpse probing pulling checking cant be sure without knowing more about barrayaran soil ecology he whispered but its not very dry down here not less than twenty years not more than forty a local forensics expert could likely date it more precisely his eye at last fell on the backpack stretched out beyond the skeletal fingers oh crap dont even touch that jet tried for an innocent grin defeated by his medical mask told you whispered tej it might be too old to go off though jet suggested maybe we should liketry to take a little sample to analyze this approach plainly appealed to the researcher in amiri but he did stick his head down their hole to whisper grandmama youre more of a chemist than i am do plastic explosives deteriorate over time some do her voice came back ah amiri unceremoniously plucked the knife from jets hand knelt and gently tried to carve out a few grams of gray blob it had apparently hardened with the decades some become unstable grandmamas voice continued amiri abruptly desisted i vote we leave it alone said tej or at least come back later when everything else is done if theres time yes said amiri reluctantly folding the knife up he didnt give it back to jet jet didnt protest from the same pocket amiri withdrew a childs toy compass a very simple analog tool indeed he held up his cold light and squinted at the quivering needle i wonder where he was heading depends on if he was coming or going said tej amiri sighed and pocketed the compass again i need to get down here and handdraw a meterbymeter map so we dont waste time sending the mycoborer in the wrong direction some more they wiggled after him back through their unauthorized hole to find grandmama waiting scowling at the pile of dirt jet you will have to clean this up she said pointing thoroughly or everyone will be tracking it all over and put something over this hole you made the idea but grandmama it was a dead body barrayaran graveyards are full of them if you want more she said unsympathetically and very unsanitary they are too cremation is much better that was the cetagandan custom certainly leaving the two boys to clean up grandmama gestured tej back along the tunnel amiri didnt deserve the chore but it was plain someone had to watch jet as they went along tej studied the ceiling more warily was it bending down at any point they arrived back in the vestibule and doffed their masks and gloves what was wrong at the tunnel face tej asked the mycoborer split around an inclusion went off in four perfectly useless directions we started another what kind of inclusion mm storm sewer i would hypothesize it was a cylindrical pipe anyway and we could hear water running on the other side this deep we are actually close to level with the river at this stratum though it wasnt barrayaran workfar too well made i think it probably dated back to the ninth satrapy grandmamacould our tunnel collapse like on the poor barrayaran bomber tej tested that wordstring in her mind trying to decide if it made sense yeah probably even if the fellow had been a suicide bomber that had to have been a horrid death she fingered the identity necklace in her pocket and wondered if ivan xav owned a similar one shed not seen it among his things certainly in due course grandmama frowned back down their tunnel you have to understand a perfectly circular pipe is in effect two arches supporting each otheran extremely strong shape i saw such arches back on earth built only of simple stones that have survived three millennia and that despite it being such a tectonically active planet but our tunnel isnt perfectly circular its more sort ofintestinal yes pity fortunately it doesnt have to last the ages only a week or two but what if it collapses on somebody tej wanted to ask but grandmama was already climbing the rickety flexladder she sighed and followed the carefullymoving kittyslippers that night by some miracle ivan found himself and tej both awake and in the same place at the same time and better yet it was his bedroom tej was restless though wandering about the place she opened the top drawer of ivans dresser into which he swept all his miscellaneous junk and peered curiously turning an item over now and then what are you looking for i was just wonderingdo you have any kind of military identification necklace ive never seen you wear one necklace oh dog tags what do dogs have to do with it nothing thats just what theyre called i dunno why theyve always been called that plural though they only issue you the one i suppose thats what they are but necklace probably sounded too girly for the grunts oh i think mine are hung with my black fatigues in my closet do barrayaran soldiers only wear them with the fatigues theyre not for every day at least not at hq just if youre out in the field going into some dicey situation say there was an argument going around ops for subcutaneous identity inserts with electronic trackers but the troops didnt like it and then somebody pointed out that if we could find our guys with a ping so might an enemy and the idea died in committee not to mention the possibility that the bad guys could be their guys in some civil fracas it had happened before so she hesitated looking over her shoulder at him where he waited in what he hoped was a good tactical position on what had become his side of the bed so if you were going into danger thats how id know i would hope you would know because id tell you no her gaze on him grew thoughtful im not sure you would he cleared his throat anyway why do you ask i uhsaw one today and i wondered about you where ifound it on the floor of a parking garage here wait she padded out and padded back in again a minute later a thin chain that clinked and winked dangling from her hand ivan rolled up and received it turning it over and reading the inscription this is a really old style mine look different somebody must have saved it for a souvenir maybe it dropped out of his pocket ivans imagination flashed another sadder picture or hers that would make sense i bet theyll want it back which garage um i dont remember there were so many maybe i can look this fellow up tomorrow in the ops archives oh can you tej looked briefly cheered then alarmed but maybeid like to keep it as a souvenir myself her hand reached uncertainly after the relic if you want that i can give you my old set from when i was a lieutenant ivans even older set from when hed been an ensign had gone with some girlfriend or another and not come back ivan suddenly remembered proving that as a girlleash they didnt work despite the name though it seemed as if they ought to tej at last sat on the edge of the bed still looking abstracted his stretch for her halted in midair when her next question was ivan xavdo you know anything much about old barrayaran military plastic explosives he sank back flummoxed i hope you didnt find any of that on the floor of a garage no no how old really old twenty years maybe more i had a munitions course back at the academy but that was all about current stuff how long ago erseventeen years but thats almost twenty years ivan blinked so it is um he remarshaled his forces anyway if you ever run across anything that looks the least suspicious what you do is call a bomb squad or call me and ill call a bomb squad is that what youd do of course well except for that old guerilla cache miles and elena and i found up in the dendarii mountains when we were kids but we were being very stupid kids as everyone from uncle aral on down explained very memorably after thenever mind that now anyway the point is people can still find old dangerous stuff lying around on this planet and civilians shouldnt fool with it untangling himself from this digression ivan finally got back to the important question which was why do you ask no reason tej said airily right avocados probably did shifty better than tej it was most unjacksonian of her it was just something i was reading about she added finding whoknewwhat in his expression consternation belike hows about said ivan after a minute i take some personal leave and to hell with whether any busyimpsecbody thought he was admitting to being a security risk if your familys only going to be here for a while i should seize the chance to get to know them better it only makes sense oh she looked briefly pleased then dismayed i wouldnt want to interfere with your work i know your career is very important were not at war this week anyway ops can suffer along without me for a few days without collapsing i expect they always have before her eyes were bright like those of an animal in the headlights good thats settled lets make love it was a patent diversion dammit shed be faking orgasms next but not it appeared yet this means she likes me right some awkward young ivan who still lived at the bottom of his brain urged just before the physiologically induced lightsout surly old ivan could only think ivan you idiot and not one ivan on the whole pathetic committee had yet been able to muster aloud the only question that mattered tej will you stay chapter twenty on the next mornings drive tej found herself threading through a new part of the city an unexpected suburban sprawl north of the ridges that cradled the river valley and the old town barrayarans seemed to date all their activities in terms of famous military eventsbefore the occupation during mad yuris war after the pretenders warbut in this rare case by a peaceful one the area had mostly been built up since gregor took the reins or in other words in the past two decades tej turned in at a modest industrial park and found a slot for the rented groundcar in front of what was soon to be a rather bewildered minor pipelaying firm star took her notecase and headed purposefully for the door but for a change dada did not go with her nor instruct tej to stay with the vehicle instead he gestured tej after him and walked off toward the street tej turned up the collar of her coat against the thick chilly foga change from the recent rainsand followed where are we going to see a man i know does he expect us not yet no appointment no comconsole contact and the rental car which had a mapping system that also served to precisely locate the vehicle for anyone who might be wanting to follow its movements had a legitimate place to be well fauxlegitimate tej found herself growing unwillingly alert dada added im not keen on bringing in an outsider but were now expecting and in fact counting on our visa not being extended time grows tight a reliable contact said shed used him as a carrier not long back and found the results satisfactory hell be open to our business and if he has his wits about him future business they walked two blocks and crossed over to another utilitarian building and through a door with a sign over it reading imola amp kovaks storage and transshipping a harriedlooking human receptionist presiding over a cluttered counter which gave tej a small unwanted flashback to her days at swift shipping looked up and said may i help you sir maam would you please tell ser imola that an old friend is here to see him hes very busy this morning but ill ask standard clerkspeak prep tej recognized from experience for greasing an unwanted visitor back out the door what name should i say selby a brief intercom exchange and the clerk was escorting them upstairs to another office also cluttered a man on the high side of middle age dressed in relatively unmilitary barrayaran casual business garb looked up over his comconsole desk frowning his frown changed to an expression of astonishment a touch of his hand extinguished the current display thank you jon he said please close the door the clerk disappointed in his curiosity did so only then did the man surge up and around his desk to grasp both of dadas hands and say shiv arqua you old pirate i heard you were dead an exaggeration again though not by much this time dad smiled without showing his teeth and turned to tej but then turned back and what name are you going by these days vigo imola vigo meet my daughter baronette tejaswini arqua tej shook hands wondering formerly on these business stops with her sisters or mother she had been named our driver or not introduced at all or left with the car people usually call me tej or lady vorpatril but none of her family had used her new name yet she stifled an unruly urge to trot it out here dada was plainly going into dealingmode delightful i would guess she gets her looks from her mother imolas gaze swept her up and down he scored a point or two by not lingering on her chest mostly fortunately said dada with his low laugh their host pulled up a pair of serviceable chairs and gestured them both to sit where do you two know each other from asked tej sometimes she got an answer after all in a former life vigo was my planetary liaison officer when i was a captain in the selby fleet said dada just before i met your mother and werent those the days said imola planting himself comfortably behind his desk once more was old selby insane to take that defense contract with komarr we were young and probably thought we were immortal said dada yeah i got over that about then said imola imolas underlying accent was komarran tej judged overlain by a long residence on barrayar in this urban environment very blended who wouldve thought that a backward planet like this could field such an aggressive fleet not your komarran comrades it seems huh imola shook his head at some old military memory so what the devil are you doing on barrayar i thought house cordonah had suffered an extremely hostile takeover prestene wasnt it yes the bastards at the name dada bit his thumb and made a spitting gesture its a long story very roundabout ill tell you the whole tale at some more leisured moment so you ended up in the transshipping business as you see imola waved around at his unpretentious company offices ah all of it ser imola smiled reached under his desk and turned something off or on sometimes if the price is right and the risks are low the second being more important than the first these days he heaved a sigh im not as ambitious as when we were younger nor as energetic nor as crazy your end should be low risk the pricewell need to discuss so what do you have for me imola inquired weight and volume perishability live or inert live costs more inert as it happens weight and volume to be determined though it wont be high bulk but you ship live cargo how does that jibe with low risk imola smiled in satisfaction we solve the perishability problem by shipping all such consignments cryofrozen the new generation of portable cryochambers being much more reliable with longer service cycles shipping deceased expats or illfated tourists who want to be treated or buried back home is a legitimate part of the business see i have a contact on the medical side who sends clients my way or sometimes helps prep them and if we occasionally slip in a few extras on the manifest the documentation is all in order dadas brows twitched up the cargo takes a risk for voluntary cargo well theyre willing for involuntary cargo their shippers are usually even more willing our losses in transit are actually lower and its vastly cheaper since they dont have to send handlers along to thwart escapes en route the method does depend on having adequate cryorevival facilities on the far end but thats not my problem imola waved a didactic finger the trick as always is not to get greedynot try to ship too often or too many at once there are only so many tragic accidents to go around we reference real ones whenever we can dada nodded approval very clever i see youre not too old to innovate it was my soninlaws idea to give credit where its due my daughter married this barrayaran boy some years after the annexation i wasnt thrilled at first but hes come along junior partner hes the kovaks our medical contact is his brother glad to hear youre keeping it in the family thatsalmost always safer another brief grimace of a smile heh daughters getting marriedthats a crap shoot to make the old days look sensible you dont know what theyll drag in my other one married this komarran fellow who is completely useless but at least lives five jumps away you folksve got the right idea out in the whole shivprevetted contracts money and considerations up front oh well dada did not follow this up to tejs relief can you get local ground transporta midsized cargo van say i have vans and loading crews that arent traceable back to you that could be done too imolas eyes narrowed with interest we would do our own loading could you get it by this weekend probably and very private storage could be made available deal would be park your van overnight in a certain underground garage in the old town send someone in on foot to drive it away in the morning we might need a second night in which case best have a different van one of us will meet you separately to oversee the unloadingsome of the cargo may be delicate tej tried to picture the implied scene a bucket brigade of arquas spaced along the mycoborer tunnel silently handcarting contraband all night they might just about do it heavy loads that could not be broken down might have to be regretfully abandonedhappily this did not include gold coins nothing inside the old lab could be very large though or its original owners could not have squeezed it down through the elevator shaft the one grandmama had said shed once been responsible for blowing up as last haut woman out once our target location is cleared and the goods safely stored dada went on the transshipping arrangements could be completed at leisure more carefully possibly in small batches where to not known precisely yet out of the barrayaran empire some towards the hegen hub some to escobar makes it hard to calculate a price you thinking percentage or flat fee until the items reach their final destination and are disposed of theyre solid not liquid i think you might prefer flat fee now rather than an unknown amount decanted off an unknown amount much later why not both said imola flat fee up front to be sure all possible expenses are covered and the percentage after success say fifteen percent thats pretty usual dada winced slightly could be we need to move quickly and quietly for a percentage i can do quickly and quietly so do we have a deal after a short hesitation dada rose and reached across the desk a brief handshake deal imola leaned back and prepared to make a note so whats the address of this garage of yours dada named it imolas hand froze shiv do you know whats across the street from that building oh yes sighed dada hence our discretion you may not have spotted the scanners but i guarantee any vehicle that parks within three blocks of impsec headquarters gets scrutinized somehow and recorded quite thoroughly scanned entering that garage yes butnot leaving it that ones cursory just to be sure outs match ins we checked ah imola frowned obviously thinking this through his anonymous van would be arriving empty and innocent yes the driver would know nothingone of the ways i stay in business around here is that i dont get involved with local politics strictly commercial i am vorbarra district guard and imperial customs are all bad enough impsecthats too high up for me give you a nosebleed those boys will i have no interest in local politics myself strictly commercial is this i certainly hope so hm imola stared at the address on his autofiler evidently memorizing it then deleted the screen you might have said you didnt think id pester you with something trivial did you no i suppose not you always were a beat ahead of the rest of us back when imola sighed do give my best to your lady shes still with you i suppose dada nodded and the rest of the clan all safe with us for now dada tej noticed did not go into the distressing details about ruby and topaz and eric mustering for a fresh move on prestene are you or something more or less or something dadas lips twitched or we might buy a tropical island imola looked nonplussed at this last but said eh good luck on that people just dont keep up with each other these scattered times does udine still have her fancy dance troupe quite the show i heard when you were all on cordonah station her jewels yes and they will dance again said dada firmly youll have to stop by next you get out that way after a few more anecdotes about the good old days which sounded like the repulsive old days to tej dada rose and they extracted themselves and exited to the street once more the fog was thinning or perhaps just condensing into a cold drizzle lets wait in the car dada directed when theyd made their way back to the pipelayers building no point in stepping on stars script she slid into the drivers side and dada into the seat beside her he turned to face her she eyed him sideways you werent quite straight with that man imola do you trust him or not the limits of trust depend much on whether you mean to do business more than once but its just good practice never to show all your cards in the first round of a deal one must maintain reserves besides what he doesnt need to know he cant tell not even under fastpenta speaking of sound practice he knows that game i suppose tej sighed you dont seem happy honey none of us are just now i expect true well well all be homesoon enough hes leaving out a few steps and the new house cordonah was going to be unavoidably different from the old tej suspected home would be changed or i will be you know dada went on you were udines special gift to me all the other kids i was happy enough to let her play the haut geneticist but you were merely genecleaned unmodified her unmodified me my almostnatural offspring i knew that star had once called her the control child it hadnt been a compliment i always wanted to see you do well to prove what for you dada i meant to hold out for something really special when it came to your marital contract still could you know mm said tej buttheres another possible deal in the air now how well do you like that barrayaran boy ivan xav i like him fine and one of the things she most liked about him she realized was that hed had nothing whatsoever to do with any arqua deals ever he was surrounded by his own barrayaran style of crazy true but surprisingly little seemed to have rubbed off on him should a deal emerge that did involve him would you be willing to be party to it what kind of a deal she asked automatically then said wait do you mean a marriage contract were kind of a done deal that way i thought count falco said so and theyd made it themselves with their own breath and voicesfunny barrayaran phrase that their own breath and no one elses the only way that deal could change is to be un done which could happen in so many ways i cant help but notice that youve not been pursuing any of them weve been busy and then you all arrived and weve been busier does your ivan xav know that you think its a done deal or your stepfatherinlaw i dont know tej realized did she even know herself for real for sure because if they dont i can certainly see no reason for you to tell them that could be slick trade them something they already have forheh considerations yes tej tried to keep her face from scrunching up in dismay has this got anything to do with that private talk you had with simon he looked cagey might her heart chilled ivan xav had seemed very sure that his umstepfather couldnt be suborned by threats or bribed by wealth but what about love in more than one form it was plain that the strange reserved man wanted some better relations with his stepson than he had yet been able to construct if only to please his high vor lady and more simon liked ivan xav in his own rightin his own quietly awkward waythough ivan xav didnt seem to see it the late great captain illyan had been superb with security it was said maybe not so deft with family hed evidently never had one before in all his long adult life or was that onlyhis long adult career but surely the man couldnt be compromising his peculiar barrayaran honor just to secure his stepsons marriage simon was a mystery how could you tell what he was thinking although it was bad enough that dada wanted to use her as a counter in his deals dada at least was dada baron cordonah for real simon had no right have you already made some kind of a deal with simon about me she demanded in alarm mm i wouldnt go so far as to call it a deal more of a bet thats worse oh it didnt involve you yet though it was clear that you and ivan xav weighed in his calculations what did it involve step one of our program herethe site mapping simon bet we couldnt do it in any way undetected by impsec that is on impsecs doorstep i bet we could he added after a moments reflection as long as one doesnt count simon himself as impsec of course we won what did we win she asked suspiciously round two which simon thinks star is pursuing as we speak the mycoborer fortunately still remains outside the realm of his otherwise farreaching imagination oh soevery round you win buys us another round yes but we only need two simons thinking three or four weasels that was term ivan xav kept using but which old weasel was the the weaseliest maybe simon simply wanted lady alys all to himself was ivan xavs protracted bachelorhood holding up simons own marriage the way it had evidently been holding up lady alyss longedfor release from the burning ritual maybe he thought he was trading not tej but ivan xavto be carried off by clan arqua to the whole as a prize or what would the the gregor allow thator applaud it the emperor had his own sons nowmaybe ivan xav was reclassified as redundant an heir in excess of need an embarrassing leftover and everyone relieved to have him be shunted out of the way tej didnt know whether to be distressed or really really annoyed with the whole lot of them arquan and barrayaran both dada watching whatever parade of emotions was passing across her face said a bit plaintively id do my best for you honey but you have to give your old dada a clue if i get one she sighed ill share his belly jumped in a muffled pained laugh that didnt make it out his mouth women eh didnt quite appear as a caption over his head but it might as well have she wanted to return men ugh and if it would help clan arqua to sell what was already given away didnt she have an obligation to allow that muchespecially as it might get her off the hook for further demands it wouldnt make any practical difference to her and ivan xavwould it damn it now im all confused again it was hardly a help that ivan xav didnt make her crazy when everyone else around them was doing so good a job star emerged from the door of the engineering firm looking selfsatisfied she and dada slid into the back for a short report on her fake tunneling bid tej started the groundcar again and pulled into the street oh about ivan xav tej called over her shoulder he was going to ask admiral desplains for some personal leave he hopes to get tomorrow free to join us oh hell said star rotten timing why couldnt he have waited till next week what will we do with him the same drill as with his friend byerly dada assured her unmoved not a problem speak for yourself dada tej did her best to slip away without him the morning of ivans first day off but he cornered her in the kitchen driving again he asked amiably sucking coffee what say i go with you itll be boring she told him drinking her own coffee faster who would have thought id ever be saying that about vorbarr sultana traffic live and learn im never bored with you she flashed him a nervous smile and there wouldnt be room i dont mind squeezing up he wondered how many rounds shed go on this hedging and had a brief insight into simons fascination with the clan but she gave over the argument and let him follow her down the street to the arqua hotel there he discovered shed cannily sited reinforcements and he somehow without intending it found himself assigned to drive another set of arquas around on an assortment of errands that extended into a lingering lunch they were joined in this meal by byerly trailing emerald and looking thwarted as diversions went ivan supposed it displayed a certain efficiency the polite runaround continued all day in this vein it was only by chance miscalculation and a couple of social lies that ivan managed to cross paths with his wife in his flat once more at nearly bedtime she was dressingnot for bed which more usually involved undressingin some casual sturdy clothes that looked more suitable for a walk in the woods than a night on the town oh she said looking around in surprise as he came in hi beautiful he kissed her hello even her return kiss felt evasive whats up just a few more chores for my family dont wait up for me at this hour you should be in bed with me he nuzzled her neck she slipped out of his grasp which he just managed not to let become a clutch we might not have much longer together on barrayar pidge is having trouble getting the visa extension good wait not good that doesnt include you you know lady vorpatril uh her evasiveness was shading into panic in her eyes it wasnt all that amusing tej he sighed we need to talk next week next week would be good for me i have to go now or ill be late not next week right now he captured her handit jerked in his grip but didnt jerk awayand led her to sit on the edge of the bed with him she offered him only a tightlipped smile she clearly wasnt going to start up to him eh tej i know a lot more about whats going on with you and your folks than you think oh she tried leading not conceding in fact i bet i know something you dont how can you know that you know something i dont when you dont what i know in the first place i dont see how you can i mean logically or you wouldnt be asking simon had recently tricked him into going first with much the same turn of phrase ivan was wearily reminded or at least the gist of it tej i know that your family is after a certain cetagandan bunker dating back to the occupation or at least after something in it and its sitting under that park in front of impsec you mapped it during that dance last weekend she froze for a moment and then came up with wellso simon was watching us simons onto you he has an an understanding with dada yes you might have figured that out i did yes but simon knows one thing that youyou arquasdont he waited to bygod make her say something anything her face screwed up in the effort to contain her words not to mention her curiosity but lost the fight what ivan felt like a lout no this wasnt going to be fun at all the bunker was found and emptied decades ago when impsec hq was first built the bunkers still there yes but theres nothing inside simons setting you all up for a fall the weaselly bastard no she snapped and a tiny doubt creeping into her voice cant be grandmama would have known and the baronne is so empty a trap without bait isnt tej could look remarkably mulish when she set her mind to it is isnt her jaw unset just enough for her to say and i can prove it to you how i wont tell you she was getting better with shifty maybe it was all the recent practice but ill make you a deal for it aa bet if thats more barrayaran what kind of a deal or bet if the labthe bunker is empty ill do what you want might that include stay on barrayar could he twist this into a ploy to make her stay he just kept that thought from falling straight out of his mouth he didnt know if shed think it was a jewel or a toad and if its not if its full then youll do what i want she frowned in reflection that seems balanced doesnt it which would bewhat ivan was learning caution around jacksonians bearing deals uh shed been caught short but was thinking fast to start withhelp carry stuff youre big and strong and and go on keeping your mouth shut about everything you see or hear and no cheating by giving people hints and after thatthere might be more this deal seems to getting a bit openended so what do you care if you really think the bunker is empty soshould he bet on simon ivan had a lot of trouble fitting simon illyan and wrong into the same sentence although aunt cordelia claimed it was historically possible and she should know not often wasnt after all the same thing as never and hed just be following simons own example with that bet he wondered how well that might work as a defense later not sanguine was that the phrase which had something to do with blood no this was not a helpful line of thought all right ivan heard his mouth saying because tej wasnt the only person in this room being driven to insanity by curiosity it seemed its a deal hed rather have sealed it with a kiss but she offered him a firm arqua handshake instead oh she said turning back at the bedroom door and bring a pair of slippers tej made ivan xav park his twoseater a good five blocks from impsec headquarters just to be sure which then entailed a long trudge through a cold drizzle he had grown more and more silent on the short drive over as shed explained about the mycoborer but his tone grew irate when she led him to the lower level of the garagequiet deserted and shadowy at this late hour why couldnt we have parked here shh she hissed back equally irate a bulky ground van was sitting directly across from the utility room evidently ser imola had done his part she tapped gently on the door it swung open stars hand shot out to yank her inside a couple of bright cold lights cast conflicting green shadows tej youre late star looked up in consternation at ivan xav shouldering in after her her hand went to the stunner holster riding her hip whyd you bring him are you crazy hes going to help hevolunteered sort of ivan xav stared around the little chamber in deep suspicion and tej wondered belatedly if she should have demanded that vornamesword thing on their deal or bet as well the access well to the mycoborer tunnel was uncovered a pulley was set up on a frame above the hole with ropes descending into the dark star scowled at ivan xav who scowled back she said id stun him where he stands but we cant let off energy devices then why are you even carrying that asked tej gesturing to the stunner last resorts come on everyones in ahead of us and i doubt theyll wait tej walked around the pulley thats new yes dadas idea he says itll speed getting things up the shaft and make it safer too no handtractors or grav lifts allowed either tej considered their flimsy telescoping ladder and nodded in relief star stepped back to lock and block the outside door then said all right everybody in tej led the way to the ladder ivan xav stopped short at the lip of the hole wait were going down there yes underground most tunnels are underground oh no ivan xavi forgot about your claustrophobia thing why didnt you say something im sorry i do not have a claustrophobia thing i have a perfectly rational dislike of being locked up in small dark wet spaces by people trying to kill me so you wont like panic down there no he said curtly are you sure because you could stay up here and help by manning the pulleyid count that ivan xav growled and swung down the ladder tej followed star brought up the rear the vestibule was quite a bit larger than when tej had last seen it a bench had been added now piled with assorted arqua wristcoms audiofilers and something she was afraid might be a very illegal plasma arc star divested her own wristcom and stunner tej followed suit everything electronic or that has a power cell has to be left here whispered tej and our shoes a long row of arqua footgear was piled along one wall tej counted the pairs everyone was here for the big moment she could hardly blame them despite everything her own breath came fast with excitement and anticipation ivan xav an unjoyful expression on his face pulled his slippers one by one from his jacket pockets and let them drop to the floor which seemed much firmer underfoot than it had the other day evidently jet was right about the curing rate for the mycoborer tubes after a long hesitation ivan xav pulled off his wristcom and emptied his pockets of forbidden gizmos including his car and door remotes and that neat military stunner that tej had first met on komarr tej and star each picked up a spare cold light from a box at the end of the bench ivan xav followed their example then after a narrow glance at tej proceeded to stuff his pockets with more tej bit her tongue on any comment it wouldnt hurt anything he could return the unused ones later star handed out hospital masks and plastic gloves all around what the hell said ivan xav its all right said tej you just dont want live mycoborer stuff to rub on your skin or get in your lungs i guess and you people turned this crap loose on my planet that is not my definition of all right if its that nasty id want a full biotainer suit well this is what grandmama said to use and she should know and weve been running in and out of here for days with just this and nothings happened to us ivan xav stared at tej with new alarm as if he expected to see flesheating fungus start spreading all over her skin on the spot his gaze flicked to star with equal curiosity if somewhat less concern you dont have to come along added star nobody invited you ivan xav donned the gloves and yanked the mask up over his face his deep brown eyes tej discovered could glower quite fiercely all on their own without any help from his mouth tej held up her cold light and started down the tunnel she whispered over her shoulder from this point on as little talking as possible right ivan xav whispered back the tunnel too seemed slightly larger in diameter than before ivan xav didnt even have to duck his head although he did anyway he was very careful not to touch or brush the walls in passing he plainly did not like the sitting and sliding around the two bendy parts at all he held up his cold light to the occasional random appendixholes his brow furrowing in disapproval tej tried not to feel defensive she hadnt invented the mycoborer a wide place in the passage was impeded by a big pile of dirt a few pale bones and a tattered backpack with electronic parts spilling out of it i thought grandmama was going to make jet and amiri clean this up tej whispered to star stepping carefully around it they did whispered star back but something shifted when we were out today and this all came spilling out of the wall again dada says jet has to come back and clean it up again before we start hauling goods out what the hell is this whispered ivan xav sharply holding his cold light down to illuminate the pile the bones sprang out in harsh relief its poor sergeant abelard tej whispered back i didnt actually find that dogtag necklace on the floor of a garage he was wearing it ivan xav knelt staring wideeyed not touching he was in a collapsed tunnel that our tunnel crossed or at least his foot was jet made the hole i didnt think that was such a good idea but you know brothers well i suppose you dont know brothers guys then ivan xavs hand turned up a flap of backpack then drew back i do not have claustrophobia hewell it was still a whisper but it had a lot of snarl in it it seemed he actually did possess emotional range beyond peeved i do however have a quite active unexploded bombs phobia this could beanything unstable for example are you people insane it cant be too unstable said star unsympathetically it didnt go off when it fell in here and it didnt go off when pidge tripped over it and kicked it a bit ago i wouldnt play with it mind but its not going to do anything spontaneous i dont think unlike ivan xav who looked quite close to something spontaneous possibly combustion but he just stood up and waved them on their next check was at a point where the mycoborer tunnel split into five channels three of them wrapped around a largediameter pipe from which the sound of rushing water filtered faintly ivan stared at it listening then shook his head he muttered something that sounded like oh sure of course theres water but didnt expand uh which way tej asked star she hadnt made it quite this far the other day but neither had the mycoborer star counted then pointed that one they trudged after her slippered feet shuffling after a number of meters and a few kinks but no more looptheloops a faint viridescent glow showed up ahead they rounded one more bend and climbed a slope to find a new vestibule brightly lit by wavering cold lights deadended against a flat wall and full of silent milling arquas dada and the baronne looked around and spotted ivan xav tej whispered the baronne with a shocked gesture at her barrayaran its all right tej whispered coming over to them hes with me dada scowled but is he with us he will be she promised ivan xav smiled tightly behind his mask but did not gainsay her yet amiri was just fitting some sort of handpumped suction device to an oval in the wall showing signs of work by cutting fluid and maybe something more physical he motioned jet forward shoulders straining they shifted the slab out of the wall and let it down slowly and silently amiri tossed in a couple of cold lightstej could hear them hit something and roll to a stopadjusted his mask and stuck his head through nine other arquas a ghem estif and one vorpatril held their breaths or was that eight other arquas one ghem estif and two vorpatrils what can you see demanded dada his hand reached out to clasp the baronnes she gripped back just as hard amiris voice floated back marvelous things chapter twentyone ivan had never thought of his nightmares as being insufficiently imaginative before tonight dark wet constricted underground check how had he left out biohazards after all that the frigging unexploded bomb just seemed aa redundant redundancy and the stray corpse a mere decoration how did i get into this mess miles isnt even here though the labyrinthine results of the mycoborer were impressive as well as alarming he had to admit the discovery of the supposedlyempty cetagandan bunker had been interesting though ivan wouldnt have been human if he hadnt found its transmutation to a ghemgenerals lost treasure vault riveting as irresistible to him as to any arqua but the belated news of its original provenance as a cetagandan haut biolab which tej hadnt let drop till they were almost here had to make it the most entirely resistible temptation he had ever encountered and that idiot amiri was going inside ivan hadnt had cause to dislike his new brotherinlaw before now but this was just wrong amiri turned to politely help his haut grandmama over the threshold of the oval theyd cut into the wall incidentally compromising any biohazard containment integrity the old lab had still held but hey who cared about that not the intent arquas it seemed the tall woman bent her head and twitched her long coat through the aperture as dignified as an aged queen returning to her country after some long exile other arquas filed through eagerly after her tej glanced back over her shoulder as she followed brighteyed with triumph ivan was not going to be able to get through the rest of this night without inhaling alas and tej had just slipped out of his view even though he edged closer and craned his neck he drew a long breath through his filter mask squeezed himself down and ducked in after them all arquas were spreading out through the chamber their bright greenwhite cold lights held aloft the place wasnt huge about eight by ten meters though ivan spotted a stairway going down to another level but it was crowded with crates and boxes and covered bins on the floor under and upon benches and desks and chairs some in neat tight stacksthose against the walls reaching the ceilingothers seemingly flung atop the rest in a scattered hurry a faint plume of dust had settled over the array fanning from a rubblefilled aperture on the far end but on the whole the place looked as pristine as the day it had been sealed off ivan wondered if he was now breathing hundredyearold air a few molecules of which might have passed through the lungs of prince xav or notyetmad prince yuri or other famous barrayaran ancestors lady ghem estif was staring around with satisfaction she stepped up on a crate and pulled down her filter mask most of the others followed her example ivan left his in place as he noticed nervously did the biologist amiri we should be able to speak to each other in normal tones inside here she announced to the arquas at large no loud thumps or shouting or screaming of course no screaming eh good shed reminded ivan of that it was dawning on him that hed just lost the biggest wager of his recent life the ramifications were spinning out beyond his boggled imagination but at least he wasnt running around the room mad with greed like the jacksonians this ones heavy emerald lifted a plastic box atop a pile and shook it a little something slid inside think it could be the gold tej rish and pidge crowded around drawn ivan looked over their shoulders as em pried open the top inside was another large rectangular box of fine polished wood the gold clasp yielded to her green fingers the velvetlined lid swung up oh said rish in disappointment its just a bunch of old knives tej held one up kind of elegant though ivan getting a good look into the tray of cutlery at last reached out and plucked it from her hand with trembling fingers this is a timeofisolation seal dagger counts sigil on the hiltdear god they all are the first tray of twenty knives lifted out to reveal another and a third ivans eye decoded the arms vorinnis vortala vorfolse vorloupulosholy crap vorkosigan as well and yes there was a vorpatrilit was like a rollcall of the old council of counts its a complete set a complete set of sealdaggers from all sixty countspalatine in existence a hundred years back some brilliant connoisseur ghemofficers collection do they have any value tej inquired ingenuously they dont look all that fancy ordinary vor seal daggers from the time of isolation can go for ten thousand marks up way up if its from anyone famous ten times that from a count or prince my cousin miles has one thats literally priceless which he used as a letter opener ivan recalled a complete set with provenance ivan tried to do the multiplication in his spinning head six to ten million barrayaran marks or betan dollars shiv inquired coming over either said ivan shaken very belatedly he realized he should have said oh its just a bunch of dusty rusty old knives if you dont want them ill take them off your hands and that was only the first crate this place held hundreds of them he suddenly wanted to run around the room madly breaking open bins and screaming jet pried open the top of another crate and peered within whats this he asked the air looking nonplussed ivan craned his neck it looked like a pile of old electronics and some slate slats lady ghem estif crossing from one side of the room to the other by threading her way through the piles stopped to look over his shoulder her frown echoed his after a long pause she pronounced artwork and after another or perhaps a weapon not sure just set it aside for now ceremonial objects wasnt that the catchall term ivan thought wildly he turned to find himself looking through the faded plastic side of another bin it seemed to be packed tightly with flimsies or maybe papers back then he lifted it down from its pile of brethren popped the top and was retroactively relieved not to have the contents turn to dustsomeone ought to be being careful with all this stuffbut remembering he was already wearing gloves tried to thumb through the top layer real oldfashioned paper yes some of the pages stuck together his eye picked out the salutation on a handwritten letter faded brown ink dear yuri but of course no saying it was that yurigingerly he wriggled it out his wildly skipping glance caught only some talk about requisitions and the closing salutation your brother in a better grade of arms xav duv galeni would have a stroke whats that asked shiv at his elbow ivan flinched his brain finally catching up with his mouth he said airily not much just some old papers and letters hastily he turned the page face down and closed the lid of the bin tapping it sealed again firmly and just for luck returned it to the top of its stack probably not worth hauling out go for the gold eh oh that as well said shiv on the other side of the chamber pearl had found another stack of small heavy cases locked and with some ninth satrapy seal incised on the tops star brought over a flat metal bar looted from a lab bench drawer together they pried the top case open pearl held up a cylindrical roll that gleamed through its plastic wrapper ah here are the gold coins you were right grandmama lady ghem estif was now moving around to all the cupboards and old dead refrigeration units in the lab examining their insides intently she waved blase acknowledgement of this thats nice dear tej and rish bopped over to see ivan replaced the dagger in its velvet slot controlled an urge to slip the vorpatril blade into his pocket reverently closed and latched the lid and followed pearl broke open the wrapper and let the coins spill out in a bright clinking stream handing them around for closer examination those ninth satrapy coins are worth way more than their face value on the collectors market ivan observed most of them were melted down after the occupation and the currency was burned although he noted the stacks of cases and gave up on the multiplication you might not want to let all those out at once or youll crash the prices shivs paw descended on his shoulder in an approving grip good thinking ivan xav well make a jacksonian of you yet though he too rolled a few of the coins around curiously in his hand his sample went back into his pocket when he was done shiv stepped up on a couple of crates and looked over the room with a calculating eye i know youre all excited to be opening presents children and so am i he called out over the stacks but work before pleasure that seemed an unjacksonian sentiment but it was perhaps how shiv had become a topdog jacksonian ivan reflected shiv went on well need to save the complete inventory for later in some more secure space time is as much of the essence as treasure tonight location location location they say and this is not one to linger in a faint disappointedbutnotdisagreeing moan from his progeny scattered about the room acknowledged this pronouncement shivs eye fell on his eldest daughter star youre supposed to be guarding the entrance i locked the door dada and i wanted to see yes yeshe waved an understanding handbut now you have back to your post you jet emno rish you go with him you can keep him on taskgo clean up that mess in the tunnel each of you carry something with you as you gowe dont have time for wasted trips tonight off with you they each grabbed a coin caseeven jet gave a little grunt lifting it to his shoulderand stepping over the high threshold filed out the oval hole in the wall some of it is bound to be trash murmured udine giving her husband a steadying hand as he stepped down off his makeshift podium those would be wasted trips as well mm true well if the next room down is like this one were going to need more than one van and more than one night we can take the obvious items tonight and leave some of us in here tomorrow during the day to triage the rest she nodded shiv herded more of his children into shifting the coin cases from their stack through the hole in the wall to a staging area in the mycoborer vestibule lady ghem estif meanwhile straightened up from a cupboard on the far side of the room with an ah of surprised satisfaction both ivans and udines heads swiveled around what did you find mother udine inquired zigzagging over to her ivan and tej followed lady ghem estif held up what might have been a really really elegant combat utility belt my old biotainer girdle i wonder if it still works and in a bemusing womanly addendum i wonder if it still fits she slipped out of her coat and cinched it about her waist and a sincerely delighted smile illuminated her face as she found that yes it did still fit one hand went up to fluff her short hair and the smile twisted her long fingers danced over what was evidently a control panel on the left side ivan jumped back as a flickering forcefield abruptly sprang out around her shoving over a stack of boxes which slid and fell with a few dull thumps she touched another control and its spherical shape became a more formfitting tall oval she looked as if she were standing inside a narrow translucent egg hey what about no electronic signatures ivan cried in panic wait no wrong he wanted them to be surprised by impsec didnt he in some way that he had nothing whatsoever to do with in order to keep his word to tej this could be perfect lady ghem estif glanced upward oh no one will pick up anything through these walls crap thought ivan nonetheless she turned the sputtering field back off ivan narrowed his eyes in belated recognition wait i saw something like that before back on eta ceta when miles and i had to go as the barrayaran diplomatic representatives to the late cetagandan empresss funeral twelve thirteen years ago the hautlady bubbles all the haut women traveled around in these float chairs with personal shields a lot like that one lady ghem estif looked at him in surprise indeed the biotainer girdles were made a symbol of haut status personally i disapproved of fitting them onto the float chairsrobbing them of their original purpose in pursuit of display really i do sometimes wonder if my old caste is becoming effete i begin to believe i was well out of it young people these days no sense of the right robust relation of form and function and they call themselves artists so said ivan taken aback to have the formerlysettled insides of his head so abruptly rearranged the hautlady bubbles actually started as biotainers but they dont work as suits anymore oh of course they still do that murmured lady ghem estif and headed purposefully for the stairs undine shrugged and picked up the nearest case turning toward the hole in the wall tej ivan xava warmer drop in her voice at his name acknowledged his volunteer statustime to start hauling quickly now tej dutifully picked up the next crate down and ivan more dubiously followed suitits weight tried to pull his arms out of their sockets what the hell should he be doing down here it had been all too easy to get sucked into the general excitement and forget that no his aims were not those of the rest of the people in this place maybe some opportunity would come as he helped lug all this stuff through that damned twisty tunneldark and confined true but hed hardly be alone theyd be just like a line of ants or termites or one of those other earth social insects in their little burrows but once hed carried his first load to the access well he might lay hands on his wristcom again and thenhis eye fell on tejthen he would have a real dilemma amiri pausing at the new doorway called over his shoulder to his sire do you think it will be more efficient to each carry these all the way or pass them along pass along shiv replied without hesitation also now lugging a case space yourselves evenly as to time though not distance those switchbacks are going to make slow spots amiri nodded and stepped through hell thought ivan but he might still work his way back to the access well just not as directly ivan was now almost as reluctant to leave this treasure vault so barely explored as he had been to enter it if he could just amiri stepped backward through the ragged oval aperture his empty hands reaching out above his head what was he doing stretching no one had yet had time to become that fatigued a total stranger with a stunner in his hand trained on amiris midsection stepped through after ivans heart jumped in his chest he stumbled to a halt then pearl whod also stepped out to the vestibule came through likewise walking backward and then another stunnerarmed man much older and a third not impsec in plainclothesivan wasnt sure what subliminal signs his backbrain was processing besides the general absence of byerly vorrutyer though god knew hed looked up close at enough impsec men in his lifebut he was sadly sure of it ordinary garage security guards no they wore uniforms very gently ivan set down the case he was carrying on the nearest stack to free his hands and eased in front of tej who had stopped short in shock do you know what this is ivan murmured to her almost voicelessly ser imola dada just hired him to be our carrier but but the stunners right not a whole lot of doubt about which way they were aimed either with only the briefest hiccup ivan translated the jacksonian carrier to the more forthright barrayaran smuggler it was a measure of the nights distractions that ivan hadnt even begun to wonder how shiv had planned to shift all this treasure offworld the question would have occurred to him eventually he supposed oh hell said shiv arqua in a tone of boundless disgust slowly setting down his own case the stunner in the older mans hand swiveled to point at him imola you damned fool i think not shiv the older man said affably shiv rolled his eyes first of all your timing is terrible the least application of thought might have told you that the time to go for us would be tomorrow night after wed emptied the vault for you and you could have caught us and the cargo both ive wondered about you komarrans ever since the conquest really i have got the drop on you all didnt we tomorrow night youd have been more on your guard imola glanced around the chamber although i begin to think you were holding out on me after all maybe after we send you on your way well come back and clear this place out by ourselves oh breathed shiv his anguished glance darting over their assailants power weapons and wristcoms you wont be by yourselves i guarantee it what a sinful waste of an opportunity mourned udine sliding up behind her husband i could just cry or spit it looked like venom hello there udine said imola with a nod of greeting and a slight prudent shift of his aim youve held up well i must say shiv said you were along he probably shouldnt have mentioned you it was just cruel to tempt a man like that do you have any idea what house prestene is now offering for arquas delivered to their doorstep individually or in bulk less than your fifteen percent would have been said shiv growled now youll get nothing and so will we oh no whispered tej in ivans ear i bet he wants to cryofreeze us thats how he smuggles people to keep them from fighting back horrid ivan could see that temptation arquas all over the chamber were shifting about trying to look unthreatening and not succeeding pearl said uncertainly should we make them stun us to slow them down by all means said imola grinning then we wont have to listen to you complain your transport awaitsmy groundvan will hold you all with room to spare so convenient of you to arrange it for us that wont be necessary said lady ghem estif in a loud but quavery voice all of you just hold still someone might be hurt she emerged from the stairwell and made her way in a newly tottery manner toward the doorway her hand held out trembled like that of a frail old woman on the verge of collapse whos that muttered one of the big goons backing imolaa few cuts below even budget ninjas in ivans quick appraisal but dangerous nonetheless when they were armed with distance weapons and you werent one of them he saw with indignation held ivans own good military stunner no doubt lifted off the bench in the entry vestibule in passing the grip of the cheap civilian model hed traded up for peeked from a pocket my grandmother said amiri suddenly watching hard shes a hundred and thirty years old you dont need to hurt her or kidnap heri bet prestene doesnt even have her on their list shes of no value to you you leave her alone they dont imola began then his eyes narrowed suddenly wait is that udines hautwoman mother his caution fell a moment too late ivan poised on the balls of his feet as lady ghem estif meandered up to the men and her shaky hand wandered to her belt with a deep spluttering snarl her forcefield sprang out at full power and spherical diameter knocking one man off his feet and pinning the shrieking imola up against the wall by the door ivan had his target all picked out the big bastard whod stolen his stunner the man tightened his finger on the trigger and fanned the room nothing happened except for ivan hitting him with all the force of his full weight in launch mode and knocking him back through the doorway the fellow was strong and nasty andkind of slow compared to ivans usual sparring partners some knuckles to his windpipe a few nerve jabs goon two willingly gave up the useless stunner to ivans wresting fingers in order to gather himself for a lunge that would put his outweighed opponent on the bottom of the pile and was thoroughly if briefly surprised when the stun beam hit his head at pointblank range instead ivan pushed himself up breathing well not too hardit was more the adrenaline than the exertionto find tej looking down at him with vast approval the metal bar gripped in her hand was redundant to need but might have proven a very wellchosen accessory to a vor ladys evening garb he grinned back in sudden exhilaration his filter mask had been torn off in the struggle he didnt bother to try to reaffix it and you said you were just a desk pilot murmured tej but its a barrayaran desk he murmured back and scrambled to his feet together they looked over ivans victim lying on his back with his legs bent over the jagged doorway they each took an ankle and dragged him through into the chamber and out of the path tej did not concern herself unduly with his head thumping over the lintel ivan was proud to note that was either really brave or really stupid said tej her admiration tinged by faint doubt jumping him unarmed like that ivan was tempted to claim the first but was afraid of being tarred with the second sheepishly he admitted the truth instead neither i could see he had filched my stunner its one of the new issue with the personallycoded grips only the upper ranks have theirs so far theyre still arguing over whether to give them to the grunts or not oh good said udine in passing you mother told me she didnt think you could be an idiot imola and his other partner had been overpowered and disarmed imola was still whimpering from his contact with the forcefield it must have been just like running up against a really big shockstick driven by a really angry haut woman her teeth bared and tight lady ghem estif turned off her antique biotainer field again with a last blurt of protest it powered down pidge now in possession of one of the other stunners bent to give the struggling goon one whom emerald and amiri together were barely holding down a buzz to the back of his neck he jerked and lay still em and amiri then combined to haul up the shaking older man that tej had named imola and push him to the wall id be delighted to test the mycoborer on him said lady ghem estif in a precisely measured voice but i suspect the results would be too slow perhaps i can find something faster downstairs no need said shiv padding closer to this old friendenemy well do something lower tech imola watched shiv approach him with fearful fascination he realized his new mistake when the taller udine whirled grabbed him by the neck lifted him off his feet and pressed him to the wall with all her halfhaut strength where are my children you worthless sack of greed glp he replied eyes bulging shivs voice in his other ear dropped to a tigers purr star jet rish you have to have passed them coming in what did you do with them ah a quick round of goodcordonahbadcordonah ivan recognized or badcordonahworsecordonah he suspected the roles were interchangeable between the two at need he wouldnt have interfered for worlds how many more men do you have out there shiv continued udine permitted imola a breath of air prudently he used the exhalation to gasp only saw one tall girl she waited a little and permitted him another really mboys took her downput her in the van another long pause four waiting on stragglers crossfire no escape udine after another pause that imola no doubt found quite lengthy let him drop he crumpled to the floor frantically rubbing his neck if thats so said em in doubt watching all this where are jet and rish tejs hand had found ivans during this show it tightened in alarm and how do we get out if theyre laying for us at the only exit asked amiri a bit plaintively oh said shiv sadly i imagine all we have to do is sit down and wait a bit ivan xavs stepda will be along to collect on his bet he added after a tightjawed moment dammit we were so close who the hell is ivan xav said imola clearly bewildered by these additions to the playlist or his stepda ivan hunkered down in front of the man i am he told imola with false geniality my stepda used to run that big buildingnot being quite sure how the lab was turned in relation to impsec hq or which side the erratic mycoborer had put them in on ivan made his wave vague but generally upwardfull of humorless men whom everybody but you has gone to great pains to not attract but thats all right im sure youll be getting to know them really well really soon and vice versa ivan thought imola had processed the impsec is coming for you part of this which really wasnt much of a stretch at this point but not the rest he stared at ivan in personal bewilderment then back at shiv in that case he croaked maybe we should team up again huh shiv just snorted i dont know dada said pidge tapping the captured stunner thoughtfully in her palm perhaps we should reexamine our op it felt as if a giants hands had cupped ivan and pressed inward at all points at once he didnt exactly hear the boom because his hearing had gone wonky in that instant but he felt it in his bones tej may have yelped in any case her mouth moved ivan fell back on his butt a couple of cases thudded to the floor knocked off their stacks and it was over all the arquas were working their jaws trying to get their eardrums to pop back imola cried in a voice that sounded as if it were coming from a great distance what the hell was that ivan climbed back up as far as his knees sergeant abelards time bomb he managed to get out over the ringing and hissing and rumbling most but worryingly not all of which seemed to be coming from inside his own head running thirtyfive years late chapter twentytwo tej drew breath against the appalling concussion that had seemed for a moment to crush her lungs and pushed herself upright from the stack of cases shed stumbled against she braced for an aftershock but except for the humming in her ears only silence came from the dark open doorway into the tunnel rish jet she gasped and bolted for the aperture she held up her cold light making dull gleams race over the uneven black walls and ran down the slope around the first or last bend behind her she could hear ivan xavs strained shout tej no and the thump of heavy slippered feet she didnt look back she dodged through the kink another straight descending stretch the next kink she was almost back to the storm sewer pipe the breach and the bomb hadnt been much beyond that what if rish and jet were trapped under some fall of dirt tons of dirt like the poor sergeant could they dig them out before they suffocatedif they werent crushed alreadyand were there any tools back in the lab forshe skidded to a halt filling the tunnel before her feet was a flat stretch of roiling dark water the downward slant of the tunnel here brought the roof to its level the water lapped at the tunnel top a sort of water sealshe could not make out any dirt or rockfall beyond it though the blast must have both broken open and collapsed the pipe to dam and back its flow up into the mycoborer maze she put one foot into the icy water how deep did it go could she swim through to the other sideor was there no other side the tunnel over there flattened ivan xavs hand grabbed her arm and yanked her back no he gasped dont you dare she gulped and tossed her cold light out as far as it would go it bobbed a moment and sank slowly but its glow was quickly occluded in the opaque brown murk of the bubbling water she could see nothing through it scum rings twisted on the moving surface as they stared aghast grandmama jogged uptej had never seen her move faster than a dignified stride before and finding her breathless was weirdly jarring she stared with them then hesitantly stepped back and put a hand to her belt the pale oval forcefield sprang out around her buzzing and sputtering no lady ghem estif said ivan xav that bloody thing is shorting out already it wont hold and once the water gets in itll kill you outright reluctantly her hand fell once more and the field died away her lips moved numbly in her carved face im afraid your evaluation is correct captain vorpatril she lookedold what can we do tejs whisper was not now for secrecy ivan xav glanced down where the waves nibbled at his toes back up waters still rising they all did so peering uneasily downward we must return to the lab and stay inside said grandmama with a glance around the freshest areas of the mycoborer tunnel have a certain amount of flex and rebound but that concussion may have cracked the more cured sections very unstable very unsafe it was pretty hardened around the the bomb said tej what if it collapsed on rish and jet what if theyre buried or drowning muttered ivan xav or buried and drowning oh god grandmama hesitated if they were close to the explosion i dont expect theyll have survived to experience either if they werent the last sentence fragment stopped rather than trailed she didnt finish the thought aloud ivan xav was swearing under his breath or prayingit was hard to tell which but his hand still gripping tejs arm too hard he turned her around and they all started back it was a squib he said after a minute what said tej sergeant abelards bomb if it was originally intended for impsec it should have turned this whole city block into a crater the explosives were deteriorated justnot quite enough but i saw those eyepins on his collar said tej because otherwise she would start talking about rish and jet and saying stupid hopeful unlikely things and the spinning words would hurt like razors would an impsec man have been trying to blow up impsec maybe hed been a bombdisposal man instead i looked him up said ivan xav yesterday maybe its day before yesterday by now his stricken gaze darted around the tunnel permanently night but for the jerking coldlight beams poking between his and grandmamas tight grips he was one of negris boys but all his records say is that he disappeared during the pretendership he could have been on the lord regents side trying to take out the building when vordarians troops held it or he could have been one of vordariansthey had men inside all the corps the whole military was dividedeither before or after once he swallowed once simon might have known which offhand they stepped back inside the lab where apparently some argument between dada and ser imola had just ended at any rate imola was sitting on the floor clutching his jaw and moaning and dada was rubbing his knuckles and being very narroweyed he looked up at them gaze widening did you find he began then seeing their faces cut himself off what did you find we cant tell how much of the tunnel is collapsed if any because evidently the blast cracked that storm sewer said grandmama water was pouring in it had filled the portion of the tunnel nearest the pipe already we cant get past said tej its rising said ivan xav can it get this high asked the baronne coming up behind dada in time to hear this her hand clutched his shoulder his hand rose and pressed hers it might said ivan xav i suppose it depends on how many of those damned random mycoborer branches lie below our level and how hard its been raining out there tonight dada moved quickly through the doorway and bent down to examine the oval slab of wall that had been removed hm he called back over his shoulder amiri made most of his cuts angled inward good boy if we can find something for sealant we should be able to boost this back up in place the pressure of the water on the outside will hold it if it comes to that i guarantee said ivan xav that we have impsecs full attention right now i expect theyll find that access well in the garage pretty quick if anyone can get through from that sidewell theyll get to us somehow sooner or later doesi hate to bring this upbut does anyone out there actually know were in here said pidge joining the circle collecting around the aperture star said tej after a minute ser imolas men if they didnt just toss her in the back of their van and all take off when the job went up said emerald if they had half a brain among them thats what they should have done they likely just about did have that sighed dada damned cheap rental meat ivan xav said amiri looking around at him in fresh hope surely theyll miss you when i dont show up at work in a couple of days sure said ivan xav then stopped and said ah no they wont im on leave nobodys expecting me he walked over to the stillunconscious man hed stunned bent and stripped him of his wristcom stepping out through the aperture he looked up then began trying to punch through a call nobody tried to impede him unfortunately no one had to nothing went through he came back and parted the protesting imola from his fancier one and tried again were pretty far underground said tej watching over his shoulder cheap civilian models he growled shaking it and trying again mine would have worked here still no signal damn simon will figure it out said tej trying to inject a note of confidence as she followed him back inside wouldnt he simon said ivan xav rather through his teeth for some reasonyou might know why shivis under the impression that you all havent even started to tunnel yet let alone arrived at your goal all the arquas suddenly disappearing off the face of barrayarmight have more than one hypothesis to account for it in simons twisty mind and you too without a word said amiri ive been kidnapped before said ivan xav you would be amazed how many memories tonight is bringing back to me all of them unpleasant tej would have held his hand but she wasnt sure it would be taken in good part just now he was looking a bit wild they all were and maybe she was too because ivan xav reached out and gripped hers and gave her a tight grimace that might have been intended for a smile no sign of rish and jet said em in a constricted voice tej shook her head throat too thick to speak they mightmaybe they were on the other side of it when that explosion went off em tried maybe they got out maybeimpsec will find them over there orimola said he didnt see them and they cant have got past him so maybe they went to hide up one of the other branches or down one tej had an instant and unwanted flash of it freezing water pouring into some mycoborer sidechannel knocking the two off their feet making the slope too slippery to scramble up or maybe em ran down which relieved tej of the urge to slap her silent but for a snap decision on dadas part it would have been em out there with their youngest brother tej reminded herself ivan xav hesitated then said couldnt you use the mycoborer to tunnel out tej was briefly thrilled with her barrayaran husbands simple genius but grandmama frowned she said it consumes oxygen as wellat a rate ofhm dont bother trying to calculate it sighed amiri the box is back at the entryway with the rest of our supplies a sickly silence all around how many cold lights do we have asked pearl patting her pockets she came up with a single spare this triggered a general inventory most of the arquas were carrying one or two extras ivan xav harbored a doubledozen plus a couple he quietly palmed to an inside pocket when almost no one else was looking rather a lot the baronne concluded but space them out dont start any others till the ones we have run down the eight cold lights presently providing their bright chemical glow made the lab seem a welllit workspace tej imagined it with only one or two and the word that rose in her mind was haunted and not just with all the history water said pidge and gestured inarticulately when tej gave her a look i mean water thats safe to drink i might find something to filter some said grandmama boilno likely not we brought plenty of food to keep everyone going all night said pearl glumly too bad its all back at the entrance with everything else em swallowed and said air these walls are pretty tightly sealed perfectly sealed as tej understood it except for their new door and maybe the old one filled with rubble the rooms are rather large said amiri his voice thin with a worry that undercut the actual sense of his words and there are two of them and the tunnel said tej andthere might be some oxygen exchange through the surface of the water out there works till we have to seal the door on it said pidge but there are twelve of us in here breathing quite a few arqua gazes swiveled to imola still sitting on the floor beside his unconscious hirelings and listening in growing horror nine would last longer said pearl tentatively premature growled dada though tempting very tempting yes but if we were going to do it at all sooner is better than later argued pidge in a tone that attempted to simulate lawyerly reason tej was almost glad that she quavered a little nevertheless said the baronne her tone was cool her gaze calculating her word mollifying yet imola shrank from her more than he had pidge no quaver there those two choked imola with an abrupt gesture at his snoring followers you could have those two he contemplated the inert forms then offered as if by way of a selling point theyd never know ill be sure to mention you said so purred dada when they wake up he strolled away to look over the contents of the chamber some more scouting for ideas tej suspected rather than treasure dada had never run short of ideas that she knew of he merely made more ivan xav looked at imola and just shook his head he leaned over and murmured to the man look on the bright side with all these other constraints its unlikely well have time to work around to the cannibalism he bared his teeth in an unfriendly smile imola flinched still probably better not to indulge in um too much heavy exercise amiri offered justsit or move quietly mm said pearl she and pidge moved off to poke quietly though a few more boxes opening presents seemed a lot less riveting now than it had been at first tej was watching ivan xav running his fingers along the side of a bin lips moving as he estimated the number of papers packed inside when a sharp scrape a loud pop a dull yellow flash of light and a yelp rising to a screech whipped her head around pearl had pried open the top of some ornatelyenameled bottle that shed unearthed which had exploded whatever liquid it contained had splashed upon her black jacket dancing with blue and yellow flames she recoiled flung the bottle away and leaped aside pearl dont run dont run ivan xav bellowed pearl mouth open and astonished only had three steps to do just that before ivan xav brought her down drop and roll roll his cry pierced pearls shock she overcame her flight reflex as he shoved her to the floor and pressed her flat smothering the acrid conflagration before it could do more than lick her face tej jerked toward them her world gone slowmotion and fastforward all at once momentarily unwatched imola shot to his feet ripped off the lid from another bin of papers flung them toward the spreading oilorchemical fire and pelted out the door ivan xav lurched to his knees and took in this new hazard with eyes sprung wide as grandmama hastened toward pearl sweeping off her coat the narrownecked bottle had not broken but it had spun trailing the lethal liquid it contained in a flammable spiral he lunged grabbed the emptied bin and upended it hastily over the wobbling bottle the scribble of oil and a few fluttering papers that had just reached it with an ugly flicker the flames trapped underneath sank and died tej took her second breath by the time the flush of adrenaline racing through her blood threatened to blow off the top of her head it was all over ivan xav holding the bin down as if it would fight him shoved himself up wheezing he climbed to the top of this new pedestal and stood glaring around the room at the various arquas frozen with surprise or hurrying grandmama wrapped her coat around pearl finishing the job of containment and a frightened amiri knelt at her side checking for damages ivan xav drew a long breath andgoodness he could yell could you people stop trying to come up with novel ways to kill me for just one hour or maybe the rest of the night i would so like that just the rest of the night just sit down just stop doing anything sit down and wait sensibly earth water air fireyoure running out of elements here amiri looked very impressed by this ringing baritone rant grandmamalooked less impressed if perhaps sympathetic rising from pearls side and helping her up she observed in some old earth mythologies there was imagined to be a fifth elementmetal as i recall ivan xav said through his teeth that was a rhetorical remark not a bloody suggestion but he stepped down off his podium and his ire into tejs frantic clutch nonetheless none of the horrific stuff seemed to have splashed onto him her shaking fingers found his hand covered hers closing it to his chest and stilling the shakes his jaw unclenched and he buried his face in her hair dada and the baronne had clambered through the obstacle course of boxes and crates from the other end of the room the baronnes face was gray dadas more greenish the baronne went to pearl and dada to the aperture to stare out angrily into the utter darkness where his enemy had vanished ivan xav and tej came over to his side dada ground his teeth muscles jumping in his jaw you were down there dead end you said should we chase him he inquired of ivan xav i wouldnt bother said ivan xav mouth almost equally stiff either hell come back on his own in which case we may as well save our breaths or hell drown himself trying to get out thus saving the exertion of cutting his throat or whatever im for damn sure not willing to sacrifice any more oxygen for his sake well if he doesnt come back before we have to put the door up i vote we dont go look for him growled amiri tej could only nod in dark agreement dada gave ivan xav a sideways look you were very quick there andcorrect training said ivan xav shortly he added after a reluctant moment and training accidents you learn these things one way or another i see you do dada gave him a short approving nod what was that stuff tej asked grandmama who had run her gloved fingers across a stray splash on the floor and was now sniffing them in chemical inquiry scent at one time i believe now merely stink i dont think it was supposed to do that she glanced around the room kindly do not open anything more that you cannot identify before ive had a chance to check it she instructed her descendents or at all grumbled ivan xav humor me pidge eyeing him in a subdued and wary way sank down on a crate and sat with her hands folded tightly pearl eyeing him more favorably joined her she seemed to have suffered only a light sunburn and singed white eyebrows pidge put an arm around her calming her lingering shivers tej assisted ivan xav in picking up the scattered antique papers very dry and crackling and carefully repacking them in their bin a little inconsistently he scanned them in covert curiosity as he reordered them the chamber grew really quiet when everyone stopped talking tej was halftempted to start another argument just to drive back the heavy silence instead she and ivan xav followed grandmama back downstairs tej because she hadnt seen that level yet ivan xav evidently with some notion of sharing his light to improve the general visibility down there or thinking that one wasnt enough or just to keep an eye out for the next emergency as long as we dont run short of lights before we run out of air he muttered i suppose the ideal would be to have them both run out together tej mused id rather have the light last longer tej decided not to try to argue with the illogic of this it wasnt as if they had a choice anyway the room below was similar to the one above except for a few separated office cubicles on one end grandmama commenced trying cabinets and former freezers once more something special youre looking for lady ghem estif ivan xav inquired politely can we help she waved away the suggestion justmemories so far with which you cannot aid me im afraid captain ivan xav shifted a few crates into a makeshift sort of sofa he and tej sat and he eased back and put his arm around her she leaned into him wondering how many tensofmillionsworth in anybodys currency they were sitting onfor that much money it should have been more comfortable the old lab was cool not cold the steady temperature of deep underground and not especially clammy but his warmth was welcome nonetheless for some reason she was put in mind of their first night back on komarr notquitecuddling on his couch and watching the vid of the unexpectedly graceful legless dancers in free fall shed been more afraid then than she was now strange ah said grandmama from the other side of the room filters clutching her prize she made her way back up the stairs theres a help tej said at least well have something to drink but then well have to piss said ivan xav i suppose we can go out in the tunnel pretend were camping or on maneuvers or we might find some pots in here a smile moved his lips for the first time since the nearfire priceless porcelain vases from the timeofisolation perhaps did they make porcelain back them not sure or carved jadeite bowls those were popular once i think worth thousands now hell maybe some ghemgeneral collected old barrayaran imperial chamber pots i know they had those seen em in the residence for all i know still used by the more conservative vorish guests a little laugh puffed her lips it was quiet for a time now what she said after a while wondering if it would help any to breathe less deeply likely not now what what he sounded if not sleepy very tired she was exhausted she realized what time was it so late it was early it felt like some cusp of night what did you do the last time you were stuck in a hole like this to pass the time it wasnt a hole like this it was a lot darker and smaller and wetter though air was not an issue this is practically a palace by comparison still well first there was a lot of screaming and pounding on the walls and more screaming i dont think that would help here it didnt help there either screaming back at death doesnt help pounding on the walls till your hands bleeddoesnt help she captured one now and stroked it till it unclenched releasing the memory what does help well miles eventually though i note that hes on another planet right now mind you he wasnt much helpthe first thing he wanted me to do was hide from the bad guys by going back down in that bloody hole did you well yes why itwas the right thing to do at the time it all worked out anyway and then huh you said first what was next oh when i was still trapped i actually got um a little strange after a while i tried to sing myself all the old imperial scout camp songs that i could remember from when i was a spotty whelp and then the rude versions except i couldnt remember enough of them and then i ran out he added after a minute but then i was alone and after another minute dont take this the wrong way or anything but i kinda wish i was alone again and youback in our bed maybe sleeping dreamlessly she returned his apologetic hug same to you lets be sensible and wish for both of us there while were wishing i mean its not like wishes are rationed good point exceptshe was glad he wasnt alone to face this unnerving reminder of what sounded despite his making light of it like the most terrifying hours of his younger life it was not an erotic moment imminent death by suffocation was a bit of a moodkiller but it was good to just sit not going anywhere cuddling contentedly tej he said and his voice was oddly uncertain theres a question ive been meaning to ask you for a while she blinked into the crowding shadows now would probably be a good time to get it in yeah he drew a long long breath it must be important theyd both been breathing shallowly when theyd remembered to tej will you stay with me for the rest of my life at the little jump of the laugh in her chest his encircling arm tightened heartened and heartening hed intended her to laugh she guessed ivan xav was good at that it occurred to her making light in dark places thatmight not be too hard a commitment i suppose right now well its not the sort of question a fellow wants to take a chance with you know his voice was rueful they were both she noticed holding on harder how much courage had that question taken more than the first time hed asked she suspected she turned her head to watch his profile looking out into the shadows of the chamber where would i go upstairs i would follow you to the ends of the bunker he promised which kind of was the ends of their universe currently who could promise more she too drew a long breath because he was worth it do you know what the third thing was i was going to ask you if id won our bet which i did do just pointing that out tell me my little wheelerdealer i was going to ask if i could stay with you when my family left ah his voice brightened his lips curved up now isnt that a happy coincidence i thought so she hitched around and pillowed her head on his shoulder he stroked her tangled curls if it seems too good to be true her dada had used to warn tej it probably is a much lesser man than ivan xav might have appeared to offer escape enough from her beloved overpowering constricting maddening family not quite anyone with a pulse but such a choice had been scarily close a few times and then she wouldnt have this maybe only love gave you more than what youd dealt for oh so thats what this is oh soif you spurned a miracle because it seemed to come too easily would you ever get another she suspected not hang on to this one then hang on for all youre worth their breathing slowed in their shared warmth that was good you know what i like best about you ivan xav she asked newly shy in her illumination he turned his chin into her hair in an inquiring sort of way my shiny groundcar my vorish insouciance my astounding sexual prowess mymy mother dear god youre not taking me for the sake of getting my umstepfather well i do like them both very much but no what i like best about you ivan xav is that youre nice and you make me laugh she smiled now into his shoulder thatdoesnt seem like much he sounded a bit taken aback yes she sighed but consider the context he stared out into the dark room ah he said after a minute oh ivan xav makes light for me even here to the ends of their universemaybe even to the ends of their lives where light would be wanted she was pretty sure they both fell silent for a time conserving heat together tej stretched the crick in her neck and said remember the first thing you said to me his face scrunched up hi there nametag i have this vase to go to barrayar she giggled no after that do you recall that entirenever mind but you made an indelible first impression so did youyou shot me no rish did her breath caught at the name and ivan xav went still they both looked up toward the face of the lab with the tunnel entrance but it remained very quiet on the floor above tej controlled her wobble tried to recapture their fragile moment of peace but maybe all such moments were fleeting if the good ones fleet so must the bad ones if you dont pack them up and carry them with you likelike antitreasures well we couldnt let you get away that would have beena huge mistake speaking of understatements the greatest mistake of her life and she wouldnt even have known it the chill of that thought was like some predatory shadow passing overheadand passing on he saved my life in more ways than one no it was about your first rule of picking up girls dont remember that helied prudently she suspected you said youd never give up till i laughed she hesitated she laughs you live id be willing to take that for a prophecy right about now he admitted the never give up part sounded good too yeah he sighed they rested and waited ivan thought he might have dozed off for a little but biology ruled all things thirst and a need to pee drove them both back upstairs all too soon together tej had said together she had meant together hadnt she this time yes thank god for doovers team arqua under the baronnes capable direction had addressed biologys most immediate demands several large plastic bins had been emptied of old clothing some were now filled with turbid water slowly settling one was set up in a corner behind a stall made of yet more priceless boxes adequate camp toilet and with a tightly fitting lid that they might have cause to be grateful for later a dripfilter was measuring out drinks rather slowly for the crowd but sips were shared around in fine antique glassware its gold leaf showing sigils suggesting thealas incompleteset had been the personal property of the infamous count pierre le sanguinaire vorruyter that ivan didnt even attempt to mentally appraise imola had returned trousers soaked to his thighs he sat back in his surly huddle and didnt say much the water was now lapping the outer wall of the bunker shiv amiri and ivan then combined to switch the vacuumhandle to the other side of the door slab and heave it back up into place just beating the rising tide the jagged seam around the slab grew dark and wet at a steady pace creeping upward but only a small dribble leaked through to be captured by some mats found downstairs ivan was impressed by shivs levelheadedness in this emergency which set the tone and the example for his whole family bluntly curbing the potential chaos but then anyone who had once suffered defeat by admiral aral vorkosigan in a pitched space battle likely had much higher standards for emergencies than most mortals the thought of his uncle caused stern lectures on prisonerofwar regulations to rise to ivans mind so he supervised the waking of goons one and two to allow them to piss and drink he didnt argue though when shiv put the woozy men back to sleep with another stun shot along with imola who had started to restively complain again for good measure unconsciousness would slow their metabolisms and breathing right it was all for the common good the younger women in the crowd including tej then began to sort through the piles of clothing that had given up their containers to the drinking water reserves no new lethality sprang from the benign diversion and ivan slowly relaxed it was almost all fine court wear in both cetagandan and barrayaran styles including some old military dress uniforms that amiri and in a bit ivan were compelled to somewhat sheepishly model ghem and vor respectively the cetagandan garb was challengingly complex with a nonobvious fastening etiquette that lady ghem estif was drawn into advising upon it was while they were engaged upon this enterprise that pearl picked up and shook out a long outercoat and something fell out of the folds to the floor with a clink ivan controlled his flinch oh said lady ghem estif she bent and swept it up into her palm and stared avidly i certainly didnt expect to find this there what is it grandmama tej inquired the females gathered around to look my old brooch the old haut woman smiled i thought it was lost ivan stiff in some dead barrayaran princes uniform that was a trifle too small for him wandered over to see it was not a very pretty piece of jewelry an array of beads that looked more like ball bearings set in a symmetrical array cetagandan thenmodern art but it seemed to mean a lot to the old lady for she instantly fastened it to the inmost layer of her clothing very good pearl the fashion show was brought to a close by the gradual fading of the cold lights ivan skinned out of the scratchy wool and heavy rather greenish gold braid roused to a new and unexpected pity for his military ancestors and gratefully redonned his weekend civvies manky as they now were with the nights exertions the baronne cracked a new light and set it up on a central box people drifted away in small groups to the edges of the chamber to make bedrolls of sorts out of the fine fabrics sleeping was encouraged on the basis of slowed breathing all around the confiscated but otherwise useless wristcoms of imola and his minions at least allowed them to track the time about three hours before the late winter dawn ivan judged if it had been a work day hed be getting up in about an hour he and tej cuddled in by one wall shiv and udine by another the remaining jewels pearl and emerald made themselves a bedroll and pidge and amiri anchored close by not quite intruding on their space lady ghem estif alone sat up her eyes gleaming in the shadows watching whoknewwhat parade of memories pass before her minds eye ivan snuffled up around tej using her as a comfy body pillow and let his face hide itself in her hair the scent of it was soothing he had an edgy relationship with darkness just at the moment but maybe letting his eyes close would make it seem more natural he was certainly too keyed up to sleep ivan shot awake into a deep thrumming noise that seemed to come from the very walls reverberating directionlessly around the room the cold light propped on the box fell over and rolled to the floor another cold light snapped into existence from shiv and udines side of the room ivan added one of his own and sat up raising it high tej was awake and on her feet already looking sleepshocked ivan clambered up after her what the hell is that shouted amiri as the thunder continued unabated it shifted changed pitch stopped for a moment then started up again ivan moved around trying to get a bearing he eventually decided up by process of elimination either vorbarr sultana is undergoing a surprise bombardment from space he shouted back or some engineers are shifting a hell of a lot of dirt in a hurry with a heavyduty gravlifter welcome as this sign was it occurred to ivan that being directly under a big gravlifter at work was not the healthiest possible location especially if the operators were working blind stay away from the middle of the room he shouted where there any stronger places like doorways to cluster under no not exactly would downstairs be safer maybehe was about to suggest this when the noise stopped he couldnt decide if the thunder or the silence was more unnerving everyone around the room was staring upward now with a range of expressions ranging from hope to fear with a few side jauntslady ghem estifs expression was bland in its haut mask shivs was blackly ironic tejstuck tight to ivan that worked for him the uproar started and stopped again a dozen agonizing times in the next hour it was getting loudercloserthe vibrations took on a strange whiny lighter timbre weird thumps followed from the ceilingroofhowever you wanted to think of it an earsplitting shriek dust began to sift down from a circle slowly being drawn over the center of the room ivan darted forward and rescued the sealdagger box then skittered back to tejs side trying to calculate the weight of a twometerwide disc of very thick very peculiarly reinforced plascrete and its probable momentum after a threemeter drop would it go right through the floor to the chamber below possibly but in the event when the circle completed itself the slab hung suspended and then miraculously fell up hooray for gravtractors cold gray light filled the room and a woosh of chilly air that made ivan realize just how much of a damp reek of exhalation had been starting to accumulate down here accounting for his growing headache if it hadnt had a dozen other probable causes their tunnel door slab groaned shifted and abruptly blew out into the mycobore vestibule damp but now empty of water the draft increased whistling wildly for a moment then dropped to a steady flow a soldier in groundside halfarmor dropped through the hole on a rappelling line his dramatic entrance was spoiled when he landed askew on a pile of boxes which fell over and him along with it though he found his feet at once a number of arquas around the chamber prudently held up their hands palmoutward clearly empty of weaponry a second man dropped beside the first as the point man began shouting in excitement into his wristcom were through sir weve found them the third man in was the last individual ivan would ever have expected to see dangling at the end of a rappelling harness byerly vorrutyer and looking vastly uncomfortable too with a few pieces of military gear slapped over his rumpled civilian suit ivan handed tej the precious sealdagger box and advanced to catch him and incidentally protect the crates he was in danger of kicking over in his awkward landing i hate heights by gasped as ivan guided him down to his feet well i hate depths ivan returned to each his own i guess evidently chapter twentythree tej tore her gaze from the gray circle of heaven or at least barrayaran sky now visible through the roof of the lab and being crossed by banking military grav vehicles she set down the box of those daggers ivan xav was so taken with and hurried to his side in time to interrupt the start of some what took you so long exchange with byerly have you seen rish and jet on your end she demanded byerly jerked around to her no theyre not safe with you star hoped they might be star is rescued thats one tej shook her head they were in the tunnels when the old bomb went off tej pointed toward their entry we havent seen them since we were trapped on this end by the rising water and theywe dont know ive only seen star said by shes in a state or she wasshes waiting now above with er everybody he freed himself from his harness and hurried to the aperture the second soldier now kneeling by the tunnel door and laying out equipment flung out a stern hand and said wait please sir he picked up and aimed a remote probe go rover the little grav device blinked on a brilliant headlight and flew away into the shadows the soldier became intent upon his control panel ivan xav took byerly by the shoulder and pulled him back corps of engineers he said mystically you just have to get out of their way but by sputtered if shes still in uh if theyre in there then well find out in a couple of minutes without having to send a second rescue team to rescue the first lady ghem estif thinks the tunnels are very unstable after the explosion and the immersion by stood and jittered a moment then wheeled about and made a quick headcount of people in the chamber he had to start over at least once both lips and fingers moving then all the arquasand you ivanare accounted for except rish and jet and who are the three spares imola and his brace of goons were just waking up groggy and disoriented ser vigo imola tej put in a very bad man whom impsec should arrest at once and his two unfortunate employees at least id think he was a bad boss i bet they will too and thats not his real name oh good we were looking for him by went to consult briefly with the first soldier who had gathered all the arquas together and was inquiring in a notunfriendly military bellow all right to start with are there any medical emergencies here when by came back ivan xav asked so while weve been sitting around in the treasury all night contemplating the true nature of wealth what have you been doing going mad in white linen pretty much by midnight when i realized that all my surveillance subjects plus you had simultaneously vanished i knew something was up when the first garbled news came through of someone trying to incompetently bomb impsec i didnt connect it instantly because you know id thought simon and shiv had a pretty friendly rivalry going till then also i thought shiv would have done a better job probably allowed ivan xav it had started when an impsec ground patrol went to check out some excess energy signals coming from that garage on the next block and they surprised a quartet of thugs dragging an unconscious woman into a van municipal guard work but you know allegres boys dont mind a little livefire practice on a dull night plusone told me laterthere was a chance she might be grateful they took down two of the thugs but the other two disappeared into your tunnel and the impsec patrol chased them in there was an exchange of stunner fire and then the surprise said ivan xav so impsec set off the bomb it would be hard to calculate whose fire did it said by a bit primly the scene of the crime being presently buried under some ungodly number of tons of mud but someones energy beam apparently intersected the old explosive at this point the flare went up bigtime one of the patrollers and one of the thugs had to be dug out was anyone seriously hurt tej interrupted both but not critically it really wasnt at all clear what was going on for a couple of hours till the medics finally got star waked up then of course all hell broke loose especially after some foolsomebody finally thought to call and wake up your mother and simon ah said ivan xav uneasily star swore there would be survivors in the bunker even though the sensors were picking up nothing from it the rest of the night was setting up the engineering as soon as the searchandrescue boys figured out it would be impossible to go in from the garage end its a real circus up there ivan xav glanced upward his lips twisting he walked over to the first soldier and advised him let your command post know to treat this as a class two biohazard area at least the soldier wheeled and you areoh captain vorpatril yes sir he spoke into his audio pickup the engineering tech crouched at his control panel overhearing this stopped inhaling but after a minute gave up and continued his task coming back ivan xav said id want to dub it a class five myself but my grandmotherinlaw would probably correct me but that should discourage too many tourists till someone can get the appraisers down here for inventory this place is going to need guards and guards on the guards well theyve certainly come to the right place by mused is there really a fortune down here or was star exaggerating for fear we might not dig you out for answer ivan xav took him over and showed him the box of sealdaggers in which he seemed to have taken a possessive interest byerly sobered considerably and that was just the first crate we opened said ivan xav you should see some of the rest not to mention the half ton or whatever it is of occupation gold byerly looking spooked stared out over the sea of crates then went aside and spoke into his audio pickup tej went back to hover over the engineering tech hovering over his control panel so was the first to hear him say good girl rover he looked up with a grin that made him suddenly look his real agewell no he probably wasnt fourteendespite his military garb found em theyre following rover home now she and byerly both leaned through the door watching anxiously as a bright light appeared in the throat of the tunnel scrambling after it two exhausted muddy chilled figures byerly reached out and dragged rish over the threshold and was suddenly plastered all over with lithe blue woman a somewhat darker shade than usual you rescued us rish cried a view that unfairly left out the rest of the army that seemed to be involved but which byerly did not bother to correct jet stumbled into a welcoming committee of arquas and it was several minutes before the critique began we were just working on the dirt pile rish told them all when we saw lights coming down the tunnel that werent ours we retreated all the way back to the storm sewer then ducked up the biggest blind alley there was a ruckus down on the other end shouts and stunner fire and we drew backjust in time i thinkwe were both neardeaf for an hour after the blast when we looked the entry end was collapsed and the other was already filling with water we retreatedand kept retreatingand the water kept rising then our cold lights gave out ivan xav listening shuddered in vicarious horror then went over and gave her a quite spontaneous and perhaps not altogether appreciated hug uh thanks ivan xav rish said extracting herself and giving him a bemused stare she went on with her narrative we were down to this little air pocket when this weird noise and vibration started it went on forever starting and stopping then it was like someone pulled the plug on the drain the water went downwe followed it we were trying to decide whether to attempt to wade the tunnel when the lovely robot probe found us she smiled at the engineering tech who smiled back a bit uncertainly beautiful blueandgold ladies with pointed ears were not in his prior experience tej guessed nor very many other ladies of any hue byerly who certainly did not share this deficiency took rishs cold hand and rubbed it in any case when the medical evacuation floater arriveda small one to fit through the roof holerish and jet were sent up in the first load imola inc were sent up next each individually with an armed guard with him the baronne and grandmama followed then dada and imiri then pidge and em pearl went next byerly joining her to keep an eye on his subjects tej waited to go with ivan xav they watched pearl and bys floater rise you know he said in an oddly faraway voice the other thing i wanted to do was take you dancing wed never got to it thought about that last night all the things wed never got to do yet years of things she began to suspect they would never run out i would like that their hands found each other id like that a lot its a deal then his grip tightened when the floater came back he helped her into it with all the panache of a vor lord of old handing his fine timeofisolation lady into his carriage lady vorpatril i could get used to that the medevac floater was little more than a glorified stretcher designed to hold one patient lying down but in a pinch two sitting up plus its operator in the control saddle ivan sitting crosslegged opposite tej stared through the canopy as they angled out the lab roof and ascended through the new access well which was shaped like a narrow cone widening at the top more engineers on floaters were spraying some kind of fixative on the walls to stabilize the dirt as they rose past circus was an understatement ivan realized with a sinking heart as they cleared the lip of the well and briefly gathered more height the new hole was dug down through what had been the lower end of the little park the opposite side was now occupied by a conical mountain of what seemed inexplicably twice as much dirt spilling over the park boundaries the sidewalks and on two sides into the streets beyond which were blocked with barricades municipal guards were rerouting traffic fortunately still sparse on this early weekend morning the pavement shone with a wet gleam but it had finally stopped raining heavy military engineering equipment was parked seemingly at random all over the place soldiers hurried about or stood and gawked portable floodlights on stands not yet turned off in the pale dawn shone everywhere a command post under a temporary tarp roof was set up just beyond the corner of the expark overlooking the excavation and blocking more street several medical groundvans waited beyond it their emergency lights blinking in a thumbtwiddling sort of way above security vehicles circled out beyond them what ivan guessed were news aircars also circled telephotos no doubt trained on the bizarre scene even as he watched a biohazards team arrived half suitedup along with a group of older and lessfit fellows a couple of whom ivan recognized as senior functionaries from the imperial accounting office looking a bit out of place on this active outdoor site they all went to argue precedence with the engineers beyond its walls and courtyard the looming impsec building overlooked it all in addition to an increased complement of patrollers at the gate on this side quite a few officers with ivan suspected no actual reason to be there sat on the upper steps or lingered outside the walls watching the show ivan spotted one companionably sharing a breakfast rat bar with his fellow before the floater descended between the command post and the waiting medvans when the canopy opened ivan helped tej out and waved off a medtech trying to descend on them when he turned toward the command post he realized that might have been a premature gesture a little tactical malingering could have been a better ploy a mob of people were approaching mamere and simon who was looking very gray and strained led the wave but ivan spotted general allegre and commodore duv galeni right behind them both were in full uniform their military greatcoats flapping about their knees in the raw air but neither was shaved and ivan could only wonder at what wee hour each had been booted out of bed to scramble for this in any case he had to extract himself from the frantic maternal hug before turning to notsalute since he was in civvies but at least present a suitable acknowledging nod to his grim superiors tej was next in line for the hug ivan was glad to see simon just gripped his hands a weird troubled expression on his face and said nothing though he also took the opportunity to embrace tej as what man would not ivan thought he heard him whisper in her ear tej i am so sorry but he wasnt sure allegre caught his eye vorpatril he bit out are you responsible for this mess god i hope not said ivan fervently an uneasy memory of all the documents hed so blithely signed off on back at the shuttleport about a subjective year ago rose in his mind the transition from brave rescuee to courtmartial accusee might be just a slip of the tongue away despite his fatigue and pounding headache ivan tried to come alert he could only pray that the discovery of the immense treasure waiting below would pacify everyone eventually once they got it all sorted out meanwhile spread the blameivan turned to allegre and asked did you ever find out anything more about sergeant abelard and his bomb what said allegre startled this gave ivan the opportunity to tell that tale and present the dogtags happily still in his pocket star had only evidently got as far as conveying the skeleton and old bomb parts ivan could see allegre was gratified to have at least one answer to his highpiled heap of morning mysteries presented as it were on a platter especially as it didnt seem like anyone would be doing any dna work on the poor dead bastard any time soon if any body fragments could be found after the blast also it punted the ball back into impsecs lap if at a thirtyfive year remove which could only be to the good is there really a treasure worth millions of marks down there simon demanded next galeni was right at his shoulder for this one simon there were millions in the first crate we opened hundred of millions down there at the least guess ivan turned to galeni and crates of hundredyearold documents packed to the ceiling barrayaran and cetagandan theyre going to take years to sort i found a holograph letter from prince xav to prince yuri in one of them he pulled the folded letter out of his jacket and handed it across to duv who took it one glance and his mouth which had opened to say somethingprobably about correct document conservation starting with not folding up rare items and stuffing them in ones pocketjust stayed open ivan had never seen duvs eyes go so wide across the road a stressedoutlooking captain raudsepp finished loading imola and his followers into a security van with the assistance of a couple of burly patrollers then turned and plowed back through the crowd to ivan lady vorpatril is safe thank god but i swear those clowns didnt slip in through any shuttleport on the planet no they probably drove downtown from the northern suburbs what shiv would call local rental meat that imola fellow has a shipping company out there as raudsepp continued to look unsettled ivan added charitably both the district guard and imperial customs are going to be very pleased with impsec in the person of you for nailing him smuggling conspiracy to aid kidnappingseems hes been up to his neck in sneaking people offplanet in the form of cryocorpses all very nasty imolas affairsll keep folks busy digging for weeks i expect commendations all round at the end but i wasntbut i didnt hes all yours now finders keepers i say raudsepp perforce had to dash back to the security van flashing its lights and ready to leave but ivan was satisfied hed given the man lots to think about besides or with luck instead of captain vorpatrils peculiar lapse in providing timely snitch reports on his inlaws byerly appeared at ivans side aiming for tej he had evidently been trying to herd arquas into the waiting medical vans shiv and udine had broken from the pack and followed close on his heels tej stared across apprehensively are they arresting us allegre looked as if he thought this would be a good idea but byerly reassured her no or anyway not yet theyre just taking everyone to impmilthe imperial military hospitalfor trauma examination and therere those unresolved biohazard issues are you going along ivan asked by for the love of god get someone who speaks oldhighmedical onto lady ghem estif as soon as you can shes a woman who knows where all the bodies are buried if anyone does byerly nodded understanding and turned tej are you coming with your family udine cut in your dada and i think you should stay with your husbandlady vorpatril tej ivan could see in her expressive face took a moment to process the full implications of this her parents might only be thinking of distancing their daughter from whatever legal entanglements were about to engulf the rest of the clan but he rather thought tej meant something more when she lifted her chin threaded her arm though ivans and said i think i should stay with my husband too ivan slipped his other hand over hers and pressed it warmly yes stay right there for the rest of my life which was looking hearteningly longer than it had mere hours ago but he wasnt about to suggest amending his lastnights proposition shiv gave a short nod and looked up to meet simons searching gaze he stuck out a big hand well its been an adventure dealing with youcaptain illyan excellently played illyan as if compelled took it and shook it thank you though i fear you were mainly ambushed by mischance andwe may not be done dealing yet baron cordonah shivs brow furrowed at this but he allowed byerly now looking like a sheepdog on the verge of a nervous breakdown to chivvy him and his spouse off to the waiting medvans udine glanced once back over her shoulder her eyes narrowing in new curiosity the vans pulled away in a convoy without sirens to ivans relief he wasnt in the mood for sudden loud noises just now at some highpriority ping from his earbug allegre stepped aside what here no wave him off after another moment his back straightened in an involuntary brace yes yes hes right here noi must protestyes sire that last was delivered with a somewhat defeated sigh and he strode away to the covered command post ivan was therefore less than surprised when a few minutes later imperial armsmen outriders in their blackandsilver winter uniforms appeared around the corner their float bikes bracketing a long silver groundcar it sighed to the pavement armsmen and impsec guards exchanged codes with one another and gleaming even in the dawn murk the rear canopy rose gregor in a vorbarra house uniform rubbed his face and handed off the cloth to an urgent fellow whom ivan recognized as his faithful valetthis was one commanderinchief who was not going to appear at the scene of any emergency unshaved if his man had anything to say about itand exited the groundcar under the anxious supervision of his senior armsmen everyone braced as he approached except for lady alys who granted him a chindip that evoked a curtsey allegre and galeni saluted gregor returned a fitting imperial nod ivan this was one voice that seemed unapologetically glad to find him gregors embrace was sincere they told me you were drawn up from the tomb alive but i had to see for myself lady tej im so glad he bowed over her hand she managed a reasonably graceful obeisance his eye fell on simon watching this with his mouth gone wry and simon what the hell the why was i blindsided look was very clear in the emperors eye which ivan could only be grateful was not turned on him yet simon gave him a beleaguered head tilt you know that long lunch appointment i made with you for tomorrow yes i should have made it for yesterday gregor accepted this with an extremely provisional nod well discuss that later gregors gaze swept over the disrupted landscape general allegre allegre steeled himself good work the general let out a pent breath as gregor went on id like to have a personal word with your commander of engineers if you please allegre went over to the command post and fetched the man whod been directing the platoon of engineers spread all over the site through the portable comconsoles there ivan recognized him colonel otto one of the top men in the vorbarr sultana local command like galeni he had a doctorate tucked away under his military rank he too was in uniformsensible black fatigues under his greatcoat with proper engineering mud splashed about thick on his engineers boots he accepted his emperors personal congratulations on his nights work with a pleased but slightly distracted expression released from the imperial attention otto took ivan aside vorpatril what can you tell me about this socalled mycoborer shit were dealing with that woman star wasnt too helpful it eats big holes right through dirt branching semirandomly i think it turns the inorganics into its tunnel walls but im not sure you need to catch up with lady ghem estif before noon by preference and dont let her snow yourequisition a highpowered biologist from the imperial science institute when you go she has more samplesbe sure to confiscate them and get them into the hands of the isi as a construction application it could be worth millions as a tool or as a weapon ivan sighed as a toolit needs development as a weaponit seems good to go but you really need the isi boffins on it ottos mouth twisted up in joyless understanding allegre his hand to his earbug trod over to them otto theres a captain roux at the security perimeter one of your boys do you need him now the new security perimeter added due to gregors ivan hoped temporary complicating presence gregor was over having some possiblystern words with simon and lady alys tej was listening intently and putting in a brave gloss now and then yes i do let him through said otto if mud made the engineer roux had to be some sort of boy genius ivan thought as the captain cruised up and quickly dismounted from a float bike otto looked merely artistically flecked by comparison the salutes exchanged between roux and his superior were almost as perfunctory as those of impsec analysts as they got down quickly to business gregor noting this arrival strolled near enough to eavesdrop but not enough to force an interruption we finally traced that damned storm sewer colonel roux reported slightly out of breath it empties into the river about a kilometer below the star bridge it was blocked way the hell up but it became unblocked in a hurry about an hour ago we lost our remote probeswept out in the mudflow thank god we hadnt sent any men in yet we were estimating efflux at one to three cubic meters a second allegre coming over in time to hear the tail end of this said one to three cubic meters a minute are going to drain the water backup fairly quickly yes roux glanced up took in the eyepins and the generals rank tabs and managed a normal salute courteously returned not per minute sir per second and not rainwater mud its likeits like a mud cannon the stream was still shooting straight out about ten meters before it arced into the river when i left gregor edging closer at this fascinating wordpicture stopped and looked at something across the street his head tilting slightly allegres brow wrinkled so where is it all coming from thats a good question and well address ourselves to it as soon as weve dealt with your last five urgent requests general said colonel otto looking harassed now if youll just let my people get on with their jobs guy called gregor still staring has impsec hq always been sort oftilted up on one side or is that an optical illusion allegre looked around his gaze grew arrested gregor went on uncertainly id not seen it before from this angle of view maybe its just more of dono vorrutyers subtle disproportions devised from his cracked theories on the psychology of architecture ivan wheeled around as well so did everyone else simon alys clutching his arm and tej came over to ivans side ivan blinked he squinted gregor wasnt wrong the left side of impsec building did look slightly higher than the right orthe right side lower than the left in the courtyard visible through the open iron gates a lone cobblestone erupted out of its matrix and bounced clacking in a moment a few more followed looking and sounding like popcorn just starting to pop big granite chunks of popcorn a soldier crossing the courtyard yelped and dodged this unexpected kneecapping bombardment a loud crack a visible fissure propagated up the unclimbable front steps zigzagging with a horrible grinding shriek the bronze doors topping the high front steps twisted slightly apart what the hell said allegre starting forward otto grabbed his arm and held him back wait sir oh its straightening up said tej ornot no said otto his engineers eye sweeping the crenellated roofline the other side is sinking too from both side doors an efflux of men in green uniforms began at a rate ivan guessed of about a cubic meter a second theyre leaving their posts said allegre caught somewhere between approval and anguish simon his teeth pressed into his lower lip released the stress to say at a guess those would be the fellows who grew up in earthquake country guy and after another minute under his breath as the evacuation continued more sporadically the ones still inside youll want to commend the ones outside those are the ones id promote allegre moved away speaking harshly into his pickup pausing to listen to his earbug colonel otto after one more wildeyed stare ran for his bank of comconsoles simons lips parted and his eyes grew big as the building continued very slowly to sink it went as a unit nothing collapsing old donothearchitect had been deranged not incompetent but inexorably in the course of the next ten minutes in a silence only broken by undervoiced swearing nearby and a few cries from beyond the spiketopped walls its first story was entirely swallowed by the earth the bronze doors hit ground level and kept going the frieze of pressed gargoyles above them sank from view as if being dragged down to their old hell the descent finally slowed at a point where occupants on the third floor could have stepped out of their windows to the ground if there had been any windows a few men rappelled off the roof instead well said gregor in a choked voice theresa surprise a startling cackle broke from simons lips he clapped a hand over his mouth and managed in a more measured voice my god i hope no one has been injured except then he cackled again louder lady alys gripped his arm in worry gregors fretful armsmen finally managed to drag him away from this riveting show and back to his groundcar surrounded by its blackandsilverclad outriders it rose on its fans and slowly pulled away ivan thought he saw a familiar face pressed to the canopy looking backward in stillstunned fascination as it rounded the corner on the route back to the residence we arent doing anything useful here simonlove said lady alys after a few more silent staring minutes perhaps we should go home ivannow youre rescuedtej will you come with us we want to hear more about your your ordeal and im sure anyone who wants us will be able to find us there she cast one more astounded glance back over her shoulder at thethe upper half of impsec headquarters emergency teams of every description were thick on the ground now arguing with each other about access said simon faintly im sure they will and allowed himself to be drawn off chapter twentyfour tej had the impression that afternoon that impsec would have preferred to drop a giant concealing tarp over their whole twoblock area of vorbarr sultana but it was much too late between the dramaticnot to mention noisy muddy and publicengineering rescue the rumors of almoststolen treasure crime lords offworld invasion secret bombings ugly kidnappings of beautiful women smugglers and much much more all playing out in the eye of the imperium that was the old town capitaland all of it overtopped by the swallowing of one of the most notorious structures on the planet by the planetabout the only thing the barrayaran government managed to keep a lid on was the details of the mycoborer itself the arquas had better hope gregors damagecontrol people succeed on that one ivan xav advised tej all the rest could just get them jailed barrayar is still traumatized from some of the cetagandan weaponized biologicals and chemical warfare experiments during the occupation the news that you all have managed to release a mutant alien fungus into our biosphere could get you torn limb from limb the dismemberment of mad emperor yuri would be nothing to it the angry mobs would fill the city theyd tear the pieces to pieces and the military couldnt stop them because most of the military would be joining them but the mycoborer was from earth tej offered hesitantly not cetagandan at all old earth is practically the definition of not alien and grandmama said it was safe big big heaving mobs said ivan xav as far as the eye can see simon illyan nodded in reluctant agreement the arqua clan was released from impmil that evening with clean bills of health and returned not to their hotel but to an empty apartment a few floors down from lady alyss penthouse uniformed impsec guards stood at the foyer doors with more patrolling downstairs the arquas things minus all communications devices arrived much later transported from their hotel after a detour for close examination by whatever highclearance security people could be spared at present ivan xav wondered aloud just how many winterfair leaves had been summarily cancelled over this and indicated that this grudge too would be added on the debit side of the house cordonah ledger at least in the dark matter column they were not yet officially arrested though tej heard that ser imola had been satisfactorily the legal phrase for their own state was detained at the emperors pleasure a term that had pidge wrinkling her nose and conducted by an impassive sentry ascending to lady alyss flat to look it up ivan xav explained morosely that it would more accurately be described as detained at the emperors displeasure but it seemed it trumped at least temporarily their visa termination though tej gathered that deportation on that point could be brought back into play at any time requests for media interviews penetrated despite all the sequestration pidge said hesitantly it might be a way to start to put a good spin on all this pave the way for our defense i said lady ghem estif austerely would be more than happy to give this benighted world a piece of my mind baron and baronne cordonah looked at each other no interviews said the baronne not one word right sighed dada evacuation of critical equipment and files continued out the roof of impsec hq under tight military escort to be temporarily relocated in an assortment of nearby government buildings appropriated for this emergency illyan wincing at the pictures in passing muttered only god but the evidence rooms are going to be a bitch when they get down to them the edifices ongoing descent it was said had slowed to an almost imperceptible rate but by midnight lord dono the architects masterpiece had sunk to the fourth floor simon kept his appointment the next day with emperor gregor he returned over an hour late it is not often he remarked either to lady alys or the air generally it was hard to tell that gregor permits himself the selfindulgence of sarcasm i could see that it was very relieving for him with an added mutter of we live to serve he disappeared alone into his study and did not come out till dinner when the imperial accounting office auditors inventorying the old cetagandan bunkerunder the general direction and command of commodore duv galeni pulled off his departmental duties for the special assignmentreached an estimate of eleven hundred million marks they stopped publicly reporting what said pidge peering over ivan xavs shoulder is an imperial court of inquiry she squinted most secret you could think of it as a subpoena said ivan xav with fangs but it would bebe a charming understatement suggested tej peering over his other shoulder no said ivan xav in a distant tone not charming ivan had looked forward to escorting tej on her first trip to the imperial residence but not under these circumstances she stared up apprehensively at the sprawling pile a great irregular rectangle of fourtosixstoryhigh wings with odd inner links in style a bit like vorkosigan house bloated by a factor of four but with modern additions dating back to one postwar rebuild or another the east portico was one of the older more ornate and impressive entrances mameres groundcar was just finishing disgorging her and simon and the senior arquas and one ghem estif as ivan pulled up behind it in his twoseater they caught up with the group at the double doors to be herded through by gregors own majordomo the mans expression this morning was grim and suspicious though as he caught sight of simon it took refuge in very very blank ivan won grim and annoyed followed by a pair of residence guards to pick off stragglers presumably the majordomo led around and unusually down ivan had not often seen this subterranean section of the residence devoted to a pocket of practical conference rooms as it was never open during the assorted public ceremonies or festivities such as the annual imperial winterfair ball coming up soon the chamber into which they were gated felt more like a small if unusually wellappointed university lecture hall than a courtroom at the front was a lectern and a comconsole table and more seats were arrayed in a semicircle of gently ascending rows it might have held forty people in a crush which this was apparently not to be despite the milling otherarquasplusbyerly who had arrived just before them a table at the side was set up with mercifully coffee teas and an assortment of pastries ivan wasnt sure if it represented hospitality or a sign that this was going to be a very long session ivan made certain tej had coffee with creamshe declined the pastries with a wan smile not a good signand edged over to by did you get a personal invitation or are you here as an impsec plainclothes guard he muttered both by muttered back courtesy of gregor and allegre though ive had my own debriefings with impsec plural they had time oh im special this week by grimaced and not in a good way i told them i needed backupnever mind and then it was time for everyone to hastily put down their drinks and swallow their last bites as the majordomo announced simply your attention for emperor gregor vorbarra ivan after much dithering had chosen a good suit instead of his military dress greens for this gregor curiously had made a similar choice severe in dark blue he was trailed by his senior armsman and his chief secretary who went to set things up at the lectern gregor accepted assorted uncertain headducks with a wave of his hand that seemed to say yes but not yet the armsman hurried to supply him with coffee and ivan saw with a twinge of guilt a couple of painkiller tablets which he swigged down before turning to take command of the front of the room the rest were directed to seats the seniors in the front row along with pidge tej and ivan at the end where he could see everyone without craning his neck much and byerly and the remainderrish star pearl emerald amiri and jetin the next the armsman took up a parade rest at the side of the room where he could keep an eye on everyone the secretary seated himself at the comconsole table preparing to record everything gregor set down his coffee on the lectern and turned to stare unamiably out over his captive audience there are a number of interlocking jurisdictions and issues legal and practical involved in last weekends events in my twicecapital first are the questions of crimes misdemeanors and the creation of public hazards in the city of vorbarr sultana and the vorbarra district for this the highest legal venue is the vorbarra district counts court of which i am as count vorbarra senior judge and final arbiter next what might be construed as an attack on a critical imperial military installation for which as commanderinchief of the barrayaran military service i am again the ultimate authority and finally there are matters involving the welfare of the imperium as a whole for which as emperor i amagainfinally responsible it is my intention to stack up all of these jurisdictionshe didnt say in one big heap but ivan fancied he could hear itand get through the major issues this morning all at once in short i offer you a star chamber you have a choice whether to accept this offer and my authority and abide by the outcome or not you may have a moment to consult among yourselves before you reply pidge rose and darted to the senior arquas gregor went aside for more coffee and a bite of pastry ivan could only think yes for the love of mercy get your blood sugar up sire he joined the huddle simon and mamere he noted stayed seated pidge was saying if we want to hold off retribution for as long as possible with delaying actions now is our chance you know i had the sequence of court fights all mapped out if i may advise said ivan pitching his voice low shiv put out a hand to quell pidge who scowled at the interruption please do said the baronne about ten thousand people are lined up behind you competing for a slice of gregors time but hes offering you this morning on a platter he wont make that offer twice also his clothes what about them asked shiv his heavy face dark in bafflement signal if hed planned to go after you about the local issuesincluding that damned mycoborerhed have come dressed in his vorbarra house blackandsilver if he meant to crush you for what you did to his impsec headquarters hed be in his service dress greens but hes wearing his politiciansuit instead that means he wants something he doesnt already have that means there may be the offer of what you might call a deal depending if you dont waste his time and if you dont piss him off how does one piss him off asked shiv eyes narrowing well wasting his time would be a good way to start and how can you tell asked tej with an anxious glance past his shoulder at the podium if hes pissed off i mean um ivan hesitated you all probably cant but ask me he backed away to give the arquas one last chance to confer privately to his intense relief shiv turned and stated house cordonah chooses to abide by the authority of this star chamber lady alys didnt say a word but her hand pressed to her lips looked to ivan like hope rewarded which made him really wonder what all those allseniorfemale confabs among moira udine and alys had covered these past few days the secretary glanced at a signal from his wristcom then rose to go to the chamber door and receive from the majordomo a new delegation of men ivan recognized them all duv galeni was wearing his dress greens all the polished imperial officer this morning general allegre likewise as was colonel otto too secure in his expertise to be daunted by his surroundings and entirely mudfree equally secure in his expertise not to mention his ego was dr vaughn weddell from the imperial science institute one of their major bioboffinsmolecular xeno genetic all of the above he was followed by is i senior administrator susan allegre possibly there as his handler as he usually needed one possibly to track and gate any other demands on the institute that might emerge this morning at any rate when they were directed to seats she went with weddell and not her husband when the room had settled once more gregor continued there are two possible approaches to solving a dilemma in justice or elsewhere begin with the facts and follow out their logic where it leads one or begin with the desired outcome and reason backward to the necessary steps to achieve it we shall see if it is possible to do both and meet in the middle to begin at the beginning with some anchoring factscommodore galeni were you able to find out how the information about the cetagandan bunker and its contents were first lost to impsec and the source of sergeant abelard and his bomb we know his fate yes sire i made considerable progress on both questions yesterday and last night since his last report in other words so some of this was going to be new to gregor as well a wave of the emperors hand directed duv to the front gregor leaned on the podium and duv took up a practiced lecturers stance beside the comconsole table his eye took in his audience almost as curiously as his audiences eyes took in him in examining what documents and records remain from the construction of impsec headquarters almost eighty years ago i was able to trace the officer who signed off on the bunker inspection a captain geo pharos he was impsec he had as his listed assistant a sergeant of engineers vlad norman one month later both men along with three civilian employees were killed in that onsite construction accident where according to the subsequent engineering reports two floors in progress collapsed due to incorrecttospec sizing and improper installation of the bracing connectors buggered to fit was the er engineering term underlined in the holograph report twice in the third row colonel otto brows rising with keen interest nodded galeni cast him an acknowledging sort of analysts salute galeni continued for which unauthorized shortcut emperor yuri on his architects recommendation had the construction boss hanged and bracing on the girders and connectors throughout triply reinforced but thats another tale ah those were the days muttered otto ivan couldnt tell if it was with irony or approval there are two possible explanations for the lapse at the time in revealing the if i may say it extraordinary contents of that bunker one pharos and norman may have simply blown off the inspection due to laziness or time pressures assuming that the thenthirtyyearold bunker held nothing of interest or danger the project was already over budget and latehence apparently the business with the girder connectionsso this hypothesis cannot be totally ruled out or two that they discovered the contents but chose to conceal the news hoping to come back secretly later and make some private profit for themselves normans prior military records are unexceptionable but the temptation as we have discovered was large pharos has possibilities in this directionthings around yuri were already getting worrisome by then which he would have been in position to see at close range so he might have been driven to this alternate method of providing for his future by either greed or fear or both of course do you have a favored explanation yet inquired gregor galeni shook his head the most interesting question of history is always what were these people thinking but im afraid its often also the most elusive unless some new documentation surfaces in my searches thats as far as i can honestly take the tale very good said gregor meaning probably a slightly disappointed very well and abelard i should mention in a personal communication i received from the viceroy of sergyar last night aral says he doesnt remember ever ordering anyone to blow up vordarians impsec building such a decision ought to have made it up to his level he said but in the confusion of the times its perfectly possible it didnt and ah a few other remarks about excessive initiative in subordinates but theyre not pertinent here galeni had come alert but now his shoulders slumped slightly i was hoping he could clarifyoh well at least we know it couldnt have been ordered by negri against vordarian because negri was dead on the first day illyan cleared his throat and spoke up actually some such beyondthegrave sleeper order from chief negri would have been perfectly possible back then his hand and lady alyss found each other down between their seats galeni appeared to suffer a brief pang from having what might have been his only certainty plucked from him ah well in that case abelard had an exemplary record prior to the pretendership thatgets us no forwarder because its quite clear that many officers and men at the time did honestly think vordarian might be the best thing for barrayar hence regent vorkosigans generous pardons after gregor put in galeni nodded warily abelard was a senior guard on impsec hq itself he certainly knew the territory he was er under his records break off abruptly at the start of the hostilities and dont take up again till after during the cleanup when he was finally listed as missing missing period mind youneither in action nor absent without leave hes certainly not accused of desertion at this point i would want to turn his remains and those of his equipment over to a forensic pathologist to look for any other physical cluesthe nature of the bomb or the construction of the tunnel in which he was found might have helpedbut ah indeed sighed gregor with a lessthanpleased glance at the arquas assembled is that pissed tej whispered in ivans ear not yet he whispered back sh so whats your best guess said gregor as a former impsec analyst galeni suppressed a pained look ivan wondered if he was reciting accuracy brevity clarity to himself possibly with an added pick the best two out of three my feeling and his emphasis suggested his low opinion of that wordwas that he was probably one of the many men cut off from their units who resorted themselves as they could find each other and prosecuted the war as best they could on their own that still doesnt prove for which side given more time my next suggested direction of inquiry would be to send field agents to locate as many of his old mates still alive as we could and interview them ivan glanced back at allegre his slight wince suggested he was praying please gregor not this week gregor may have heard that prayer in any case he went on and how is emptying the bunker coming along pidge shot to her feet may i note a point of purely barrayaran law your ersir shed at least retained ivans hasty instruction no dont call him sire hes not your liegelord so hes not your sire in any case gregor granted her a curt nod she went on barrayaran law supports the claim of a tenpercent finders fee for lost items including historical artifacts confiscated by district or the imperial governments hell pidge thats meant for lost wallets muttered ivan under his breath he thought only tej heard him by the squeeze on his arm but pidge glanced his way in irritation before she went on more firmly house cordonah jointly wishes to put in such a claim upon the contents of lady ghem estifs old workplace because without us it would never have been found at this time said illyan not quite in an undervoice intact countered pidge given yet more time who knows who else might have found and raided it before you people ever got around to looking gregor held up a palm i am aware of the precedent baronette we will return to the point later collective or imperial we in any case pidge in a moment of blessed acumen nodded and sat down gregor said continue please commodore galeni gave a short nod ive placed professora helen vorthys and her picked team of conservators in charge of all papers documents and data devices the last of which we cleared out yesterday and sent to a secured location at the imperial university sorting and preservation has only just started gregor waved a hand and our best guess of the value of the rest of the items inventoried and removed so faras of this morning i checked on the way hereisgaleni cleared his throat unaccountably drythree point nine billion marks make that accountably dry ivan corrected his observation gregor who had hitched himself up on the edge of the comconsole table nearly fell off it shiv arqua rubbed his forehead his face screwing up like a man suffering from the sharpest twinge of existential pain in history almost four billion marks duv choked gregor really so far we hope to have cleared the upper floor by the end of the week i have absolutely no idea what well find on the lower one more of the same as i recall murmured lady ghem estif silence fell throughout the room as everyone present paused for a bit of simple arithmetic i would note in passing observed duv recovering his driest professorial tones that the current value of the art and artifacts is very much higher that the what one might call street value would have been a hundred years ago appreciation in both senses yet quite a number of people must have known what was in there because it certainly took more than one man to fill it up i really have no idea why no cetagandan entrepreneur has been back since lady ghem estif gave a muffled sniff dulcetly and waited gregor opened his hand to her a bit ironically enlighten us milady if you please because most of the items were the property of the ruling ghemjunta and most of the ghemjunta were executed upon their return to eta ceta said lady ghem estif she added they had planned to be back in person of course ivan had no idea if it was the historian or the security analyst ascendant in his hungry tones but duv said i do hope youll have time to chat with me later lady ghem estif she held up her own hands palm out in a gesture that had little to do with surrender that will not be up to me thank you commodore galeni that will do for now said gregor colonel otto do you have a perhaps fuller and more detailed account than your preliminary one of why my imperial security building is now largely an underground installation from a technical perspective since ivan recalled among the cries coming from the command post the other day some anguished engineering bellows of it sank it sank the sucker just sank he suspected otto did galeni stood down and otto came up sire his nod to gregor was very respectful his glower at the arquas not were still modifying details of our picture as new data come in but i think what i have here is a correct general outline he shoved a data chip into the readslot on the comconsole table a largescale threedimensional image in outlines of colored light sprang into view above the vid plate otto gestured with a lightstick groundlines in dark brown surrounding buildings in light brown impsec building in green all six floors and the several subbasements a boxy cage of coldlighthued lines the bunker another short stack of boxes in blue cattycorner to the one in green the old storm sewer a translucent tube of red light running at a diagonal far under the street we suspect sergeant abelards old tunnel might have had its startpoint from the storm sewer by the way its possible that a patch there might have provided a weak pointa darker red blob with uncertain dotted outlinesthat blew out when the bomban ominous purple pinpoint accurately placed as far as ivan could tellwent off as much of the remaining mycoborer tunnels as we could map starting as a solid yellow tube descending from the garage under the office building across the back corner a second solid end snaking back from the vestibule hugged up next to the bunker our current best guess of what existed in between the two ends prior to the bomb blast dotted yellow outlines branching and rebranching directly under the impsec subbasements the mycoborer walls appear to cure very hard strong in compression but weak in tension and brittle at some point during the firefight between the criminals and the impsec guards who pursued them underground someones stray stunner beam struck the old bomb on the tunnel floor setting it off scrupulously ottos picture did not suggest whose stunner this triggering energy pulse came from a flare of purple light filled the tunnel network the air and gasses in the tunnels transmitted a strong concussion to the walls throughout we dont yet know if there was further chemical reaction the stretching in tension cracked and in some places shattered the walls both visible and micro cracks at the same time the weak portion of the storm sewer abutting or closely abutting the mycoborer tunnel blew out a section of the drain just down from the breach collapsed the water so dammed diverted through the breach and the shattered tunnel began to rapidly fill water not being compressible this actually helped keep the network from collapsing for quite some time water from the ongoing heavy rain drainage further penetrated and weakened the cracked walls and began mixing under considerable pressure with the formerly dry and solid subsoil in effect the branching mycoborer tunnel turned into a giant sponge under the impsec headquarters a bulky irregular region under the green cage filled with red light the pressure mounted the red light grew more intense the sponge swelled both illyan and allegre had exactly the same expressions of horrified fascination on their faces ivan noted in a brief look around at the time that my engineers dug down to the bunker roof with gravliftersa white circle appeared on the ground level of the park and grew downward to the blue box in a neat conepossibly at the moment that we cut through the roof the storm sewer unplugged itself i suspect but cant prove yet that the vibrations from our rescue work might have helped that along in any case the sewer unplugged and began draining the mycoborer tunnel network of what was now a hell of a lot of liquid mud the impsec building directly above acted as a giant weight compressing the sponge and expressing its contents out the newly opened exit channel pulses of red light marched down the storm sewer and the restotto sighedwe all witnessed slowly as the red sponge flattened its filaments collapsing the green cage began to sink below the brown ground lines how far down dyou think well end up asked general allegre from his back row not much farther i think a man should just about be able to jump off the roof to the ground without breaking his legs that is a little silence followed this wordpicture if allegre contemplated suicide over all of this he was going to have to find another method than the traditional parapet ivan reflected gregor stirred himself and broke the hypnotized hush with thank you colonel otto that was very clear thank you sire but the big question i want answeredhe pointed to the sewer linewe know damned well that bits of mycoborer tunnel walls had to have been mixed with the mud which has mostly ended up in the river whats it doing downstream his glare at the arquas was impartial but far from impassive for the answer to that question i hope dr weddell will have more information than this time yesterday doctor at gregors gesture otto stood down and weddell took his place weddell was a distinguishedlooking researcher in his sixties his past ivan had reason to know was considerably more speckled than his appearance would suggest but that didnt make him less able to do his job possibly the reverse weddell cleared his throat nervously well sire as we all know absence of evidence is not evidence of absence nevertheless my field teams have not yet found live mycoborer cells downstream from the capital we have on the other hand positively identified a few fragments of former tunnel wall and if the one is present the other should be too one bright spotthe live cells weve been studying do not appear to like an environment of salt water so if any reach the sea it is unlikely they will survive there told you that murmured lady ghem estif three days ago weddell gave her a rather driven look while i do strongly recommend we continue to monitor it is my opinion that the mycoborer is less a hazard than several other biological nightmares you barrayarans have lived with for years not excepting this planets own native ecosystem prudence yes panic no add it to the list and go on id say tej listening intently blinked hey she whispered to ivan that fellows a jacksonian or he was i know ivan whispered back so does gregor dont tell anyone else gregor eyed weddell would you personally today drink water taken from the river downstream of vorbarr sultana in his present mood gregor was not above personally testing that very question ivan suspected on weddell that was did he have a liter bottle tucked away behind the podium yes said weddell steadily if it was first boiled to destroy all the eighteen other potentially lethal pathogens usually present normal local water treatment should protect your subjects and anyone stupid enough to drink untreated water on this planet deserved their removal from the gene pool weddell in ivans prior experience of the man was perfectly capable of thinking just that but also smart enough not to say so here at any rate gregor turned his head dr allegre has that assertion about the water treatment been tested she sat up and responded itcould easily be done it sounds plausible in other words no please have your people conduct appropriate tests immediately and report back as soon as possible yes sire she bent her head to her wristcom very well dr weddell continue to monitor closely yes gregor waved him back to his seat by the administrator some headstogether conversation seemed to go good you didnt screw up and so how about our funding otto looked as if he didnt believe a word of it dr allegre would presumably pacify the equally dubious general allegre later gregor stared at the rows of arquas the arquas stared back shiv did impassive very well indeed udine threaded her fingers through her short hair lady ghem estif looked willing to match her onehundredandthirty years against anything barrayar could throw at her nowin my third hat but not talking through it no not gregor we come to larger imperial concerns shivs dark eyes narrowed in a sudden intensity to nearly match gregors as you should realize barrayar has no practical interest in aggressive ventures in jacksonian local space but as you should be even more keenly aware all bets are off if the cetagandan empire makes such a move directly or through puppets to gain control of your wormhole exits my analysts posit that house prestene is currently such a puppet contemplating an attempt on a wormhole monopoly shiv rumbled other house alliances however temporary have traditionally resisted such attempts repeatedly gregor returned levelly two down three to go shiv shrugged fell is a tough nut to crack baron fell is still very aged at last report udine murmured true gregor didnt blink as it happens barrayar could use an ally in the whole one ally would in fact be better than five due to ah reciprocal destabilization issues viz cetaganda for which a covert ally would be even more use for that tenpercent finders fee mused shiv you might find more than one house for sale yes but no amount of money can make one stay bought who does not freely choose to hm gregor held up a finger ten percentless expenses shivs brows rose in inquiry by some miracle gregor continued there was no loss of life in last weekends disasters are you saying you wouldnt trade in lives gregor gave him a cool look on the contrary i trade in lives every day they are the coin in which barrayar has paid for my mistakes since i was twenty years old but it does mean that the first item on the deductions list will not be generous survivors pensions i see said shiv and do go on said udine so instead i would begin with all the operational expenses of the last week and onwards that this emergency has entailed shiv was drawn into a seems fair kind of nod a frugal wifely hand on his arm restrained further premature expression and he settled back we also it would seem require a new impsec building shivs teeth set slightly simon by his widening eyes looked as if he were stifling a cry of vicarious joy guy allegre who had shifted to the edge of his seat at the new wider turn in the conversation sat back in his own do go on mode the old building isextremely hard to value in its current location some would consider it a priceless historical relic betan dollar came a low imploring mutter from the other end of the row gregor managed to ignore the interjection in any case it certainly seems wise to escrow some amount of funding for its eventual cleanup or disposal mm said shiv much more critical is the need to escrow an appropriate amount for any cleanup of mycoborer contamination that may yet be found that will not be underfunded both isi people perked up this won a pained grunt from shiv butapparently hed learned something about barrayar in this visitno argument because of all the choices of points to dig in his heels about that would have been the most disastrous even more offensive than quibbling over the survivors pensions a very small smile curled gregors lips it will not be all take and no give from my er imperial hands however to help speed your and your familys return to the whole i propose to throw in gratis your own jumpship unarmed but i am assured speedy gregor gave a general wave of his index finger orbitward this surprised a choke from byerly vormerciers yacht youd foist that he cut himself off the decor i am given to understand is questionable but the mechanics are sound my inspecting engineers have guaranteed it vorrutyer here has traveled in it and can so testify yeah itgoes so long as it goes away the quirk of gregors eyebrows indicated i expect you can get some entertainment out of its resale later shiv tapped his thick fingers together looking amused for almost the first time this morning ill look forward to that the other gift i mean to give to take with you ismy personal liaison an experienced impsec surveillance agent and as i understand it very nearly a soninlaw since i believe you have some preferences for keeping important transactions in the family gregor opened his hand to byerly sitting in the second row next to rish she twisted to look at him in surprise this obviously wasnt the first time by had heard this proposal from gregorwhen the hell had they had time to meet but it was plain that he was still digesting it itll be allnew he said weakly rish recovering her composure remarked i could probably help you out with that by reciprocity after all shiv turning around eyed her in tolerant speculation allegre put in as a kind of backhanded encouragement your domestic affairs handler has been afraid you were getting stale vorrutyer he thought you needed a new challenge no i dont byerly mouthed to his lap shoulders hunching slightly but he didnt dare look around at allegre while he did allegre went on ill leave you and the arquas to evolve your own plausible cover story but at a glance you seem spoiled for choice he managed a thin smile for rish shiv and udine looked at each other udine glanced up may the two of us be excused to confer in private for a moment of course said gregor they retreated to the hallway not exactly private there were guards out there as well but out of earshot of the room they were gone a long time during which there was a lot of shifting and stretching and a run on the coffee and remaining pastries and on the adjoining lav allegre and simon teamed up to have colonel otto rerun his colorful visual aid a few times at various speeds it was really hard to read simons emotions but he didnt seem to get tired of the show at length shiv and udine returned to take up a united stance before gregor gregor vorbarra said shiv i do believe you are a worthy grandson of your famous grandfather ezar he stuck out his hand you have your deal meticulously gregor shook each of their hands in turn baron baronne he couldnt quite seem to bring himself to say thank you under the circumstances but he did manage good luck in your future endeavors shiv about to turn away turned back emperor gregor i do have one purely private favor to ask a notquitenod invited him to go on may i have the pleasure of informing the man known as vigo imola of the estimated valuation of the contents of the bunkerin person a slight hesitation as whatever lurid visions of eleventhhour collusion crossed gregors wellhoned imagination happily his imagination didnt stop there a faint smile turned his lips fifteen percent was it not i believe i see your point he motioned to byerly vorrutyer may escort you armsman in front and secretary trailing gregor paused on his way out to deal with whatever next crisis might be crowding his queue because a threeplanet empire delivered upset snakes by the basketload to this mans office every damned morning yeahfor all the talk of men coveting the emperors throne ivan had never yet heard anyone speak of coveting his desk ivan gregors mouth twisted captain and lady vorpatril i want to see you tomorrow my secretary will call with your appointment chapter twentyfive when orders were dropped from that high up they packed a lot of momentum when they hit ground level in ivans experience so he wasnt surprised when things which had seemed to be hovering in a holding pattern for the past four days moved fast deportation was to be the cover story it turned out which had the added advantage of being perfectly true just not perfectly complete since the members of house cordonah were for their own reasons as anxious to depart as barrayar was to be rid of them they swallowed the appearance of defeat and disgrace without choking much and also the excellent farewell luncheon smoothly supplied by dowager lady vorpatril after everyone was escorted by the impsec guards downstairs to pack except lady ghem estif captured by duv galeni and carried off to simons office along with a keenly interested simon the two hours they were closeted duv indicated to ivan when they all emerged were not nearly enough for a centurys worth of debriefing im going to send an analyst along on their jumpship as far as komarr or maybe pol station he told ivan simultaneously calling up contact codes on his wristcom and one of helen vorthyss postdocs or grad students if she can scramble one in time thatll give five to ten more days damn i wish i could go myself he made his hurried call to the surprised but interested professora chasing down one of his own people took a little longer scattered all over town as they were at the moment but at that point all he had to do was snap commands and some poor impsec schmucks winterfair plans were sudden smoke ivan hoped there would be compensations therell be a couple of dozen theses on the declassified papers alone duv predicted confidently with honors well that was probably someones idea of a reward yeah because there was no accounting for taste youre classifying this stuff after a hundred years isnt that paranoid even for impsec well be declassifying most of it as fast as we can get through it but there are some things about the old ghemjuntanever mind his lips compressed and opened again to release a but you know that history book i gave lady tej yes i think there may have to be a new edition ivan walked him out to the hallway by the time duv reached the lift tubes in the penthouse foyer he was jogging and fielding more calls from his wristcom eight billion marks ivan couldnt help thinking and he worries more about the papers or the truth perhaps what price that gregor was providing a courtesy military jump pilot and crew for vormerciers yacht for the run to the borders of the empire at pol station this ivan gathered was to make sure they arrived there and nowhere else the ten days of travel time would be plenty to tightbeam ahead and arrange whatever commercial crew the arquas wanted to hire on for the next leg vetted ivan trusted for ingenious bounty hunters jet would be rejoining the jewels but amiri was to travel with his family only as far as komarr then transfer to a government courier vessel for a free ride to escobar and a safe delivery back to the durona clinic any stray bounty hunter who made it that far would be lily durona and mark vorkosigans problem or rather vice versa definitely vice versa ivan reflected his life was simplifying nicely but not ivan trusted too much a little uneasy he took the lift tube down from his mothers flat to find tej tej when shed had about as much as she could stand of listening to amiri burble about how happy he was to be going back to escobar wandered into her parents temporary bedroom the flat had been hastily furnished with rental beds and a few sofas and chairs the night theyd all been dumped in here by the barrayaran authorities a lot of the meals had been taken upstairs at lady alyss place no one had urged anything more permanent the baronne and lady alys or rather lady alyss competent dresser under their joint supervision was just finishing packing the baronne was remarking not my plan at all but it will certainly do flexibility as shiv says she broke off and both mothers looked across at tej as she entered lady alys rather bemusedly the baronneher lips tightened but not in anger lady alys tactful as always murmured i should just see to a few things upstairs udine i hope to speak with you later tej dear motioning her dresser to close the case and follow she withdrew tej wasnt sure if she was grateful or not spacious as the flat was the arquas had more than filled it that and all the disruptions of the past few days had allowed tej to dodge intimate teteatetes pretty much since the rescue the baronne plucked at her bangs her new nervous gesture tej hoped her hair would grow out quickly have you packed the baronne asked abruptly tej swallowed straightened no nor am i going to the baronne eyed the set of her chin you know when you father and i told you to go with your barrayaran husband the other day it was merely because we hoped you could thus avoid arrest or whatever other retribution the barrayarans had in mind yes i got that we certainly didnt mean mean it tej suggested the baronne cleared her throat it was a ploy tej it was not possible at that moment to predict that events were going to turn out so favorably we wanted to protect you if not ourselves then someone someone needed to babysit me if rish was going to be out of the job yes but when i said i would stay with ivan xav i meant it the baronne made an abortive gesture the cars are coming to take us all to the shuttleport in another hour surely too short a time to make such a permanent lifebargain in i made it in a minute the first time well provisionally how long did it take you to decide you wanted dada tej asked suddenly curious that is neither here nor there said the baronne circumstances were very different i see said tej biting her lip to hide a smile also wanting and arranging are two different things the latter requires planningactionsometimes sometimes flexibility yes the baronne realizing she was being diverted tracked back anyway if you wontyour dada and i were thinkingperhaps you could ride along with us at least as far as pol station it would give us more time together tej controlled a shudder at the vision her and her entire family packed into what byerly had implied was a notverylarge spaceship with less escape possible than from an underground bunker we just had twentyfive years together baronne dont you think its time for a break i thought id say my goodbyes right here the military shuttleport isnt that much of a treative seen itand theyll be wisking you all through i expect i expect echoed the baronne only notdisagreeing because she couldnt at least about the shuttleport this all seems so rushed weve had the past four days you must have guessed something like this was coming or some barrayaran incarceration which would have required an entirely novel plan weve not been saying goodbye for the past four days i was no one noticed although theyd all had a lot else on their minds to be fair also i get jumpsick and that would be ten jumps five each way youmight decide not to go back you could choose freely once you reached pol station yes i thought that might be your secret plan there would be more jumps going on andtej took a deep breath only partly for controli can choose freely right here right now and i have do i have to like yell thankfully not because the baronne after a silence responded i suppose you will be safer here at least for the immediate future her family tej was reminded wasnt exactly going directly home although fell station as long as the old baron was in charge was going to make a reasonably secure initial base youll have byerly she offered then paused in doubt in tandem with the baronne and a war chest of what was it four hundred million barrayaran marks thats only one hundred million in betan dollars the baronne was swift to point out a few serious bribes some competent mercenaries and it will dwindle in a hurry five percent that tricky dealer gregor got us down to this was not tej understood a point against gregor personally im sure you and dada will be able to makes ends meet somehow tej soothed her youre both very clever it will be a challenge the baronnedidnt quite grumble but when i get my hands on those prestenes the retribution will be famous yes make them pay tej agreed cordially glad to give her mothers thoughts this more positive direction by her standards what do you see in that barrayaran boy anyway the baronne asked querulously dodging back despite tejs best efforts he just doesnt seem very ambitious mm said tej one womans defect is another womans delight i supposeits all the things he sees in me that you dont the baronne peered at her in doubt which are what tejlove besides your figure clearly she waved away this as a given at least with respector lack of respectto ivan xav everything baronne on the other handwas it really necessary to bloody her forehead trying to solve a problem already going away on its own within the hour at that that seemed a very ivan xav approach so restful the great charm of her and the baronne living on two different planets tej decided was that they could both stop trying to fix each other she grinned crookedly leaned up and gave her mother a peck on the cheek instead an appreciation of his figure really tej but the baronnes hand stole to the kissed spot nonetheless dada and byerly arrived back then the baron with a heartening bustle and ivan xav strolled in on their heels ending this little motherdaughter ordeal moment again until the next time tej wondered if it would be redundant to think dont ever change baronne tej rish byerly and ivan xav rendezvoused briefly in the living room as the luggage was staged around them so how did it go with ser imola tej asked by succinctly by tilted a hand i was sent in part to impede long conversations but it wasnt necessary you could just see the man fold into himself he added after a contemplative moment and prisonsmock orange is so not imolas color it was all quite quite satisfying and you ivan xav asked byerly grimaced though a speculative glance under his unfairly long lashes at the listening rish undercut his putupon air running around like a mad thing of course im going to have to leave a moving company to clear my apartment and put it all in storage i packed last nightit was like trying to decide what to grab from a burning building the story is im shipping out just ahead of imminent arrest for collusion with your inlaws for grandthefthistory i am to be a barrayaran renegade he struck a pose rakes regress or something im sure youll do well tej tried to console him its bloody jacksons whole where enemies are killed and eaten we do not said rish indignantly byerly waved this away i speak of course metaphorically though he looked as if he werent entirely sure well if you get in over your head just try channeling your greatgreatgrandfather bloody pierre advised ivan xav he added after a moment or your greatgreatgrandmother for you either one by cast a sneer at him ivan xav grinned undaunted he explained aside to tej and rish it was said that the only two people le sanguinaire feared were his wife and dorca vorbarra and no ones too sure about dorca really said tej the golden glasses theyd all been drinking tunnel water from the other night becoming more interesting in retrospect vorrutyer family history by told her is the very essence of unreliable news source dont listen to vorpatril he sighed though it is evident that you will congratulations ivan if i failed to say that earlier thank you ivan xav returned bland and then it was time to all pitch in and help carry things down to the garage where three luxurious governmental groundcars were pulled up waiting going out in style tej detected lady alyss diplomatic hand at work the arquas might as easily have been carted away in one big prison van a pair of men in blackandsilver livery arrived in a separate quite unremarkable groundcar and transferred to the boot of one of the other vehicles a pair of familiar heavy boxes with old ninth satrapy seals on the tops the senior of them approached the baron and baronne and saluted my imperial masters compliments sir and he commends to you this souvenir of your visit may it help to speed you on your way dadas brows shot up tej tried to calculate the value in either barrayaran marks or betan dollars of fortyfour kilos of old cetagandan gold coins but ran afoul of her lack of experience with the antiquities market precisely two boxes out of forty murmured dada five percent how scrupulous of him he raised his voice to the vorbarra armsman tell your imperial master that baron and baronne cordonah are as pleased to accept his memento as he is to bestow it a little edged dont you think dada but the armsman took it in expressionlessly and marched off with his fellow to tej was fairly sure deliver the words verbatim the bulk of the payout would arrive later by some boring tightbeam transfer with a meticulous deduction for this paymentinkind but she was sure otherwise in full lady alys and simon arrived from upstairs lending a touch of formality to the final farewell dada came over to ivan xav and tej standing together they tell me he said that in some barrayaran weddings the father is expected to give away the bride that struck me as valuing her much too low just a figure of speech sir ivan xav assured him looking amused in actual high vor marriages the behindthescenes dealings over the details of the marriage contract can go on for months well thats a little better the baron allowed your gregor has to have obtained his skills from somewhere ivan xav added as if by way of consolation and after all youre getting byerly in trade the baron smiled thinly yes i know he turned to his daughter your mother tells me tej that she did convey our invitation for you to ride along to pol station yes yes dada said tej but im staying right here she gripped ivan xavs arm firmly he covered her hand with his own you know metheres no such thing as a last chance this side of death said dada if ever you want to come home thank you dada said tej wondering how many karma points she was totting up for not pointing out that actually he hadnt secured a home for her to come to yet it had better be a lot on impulse she pulled him aside placed her hands on his shoulders and looked him in the eye it was a shock to her to discover they were the same height look at it this way dada youre coming away from barrayar with everyones freedom a ride and a war chest not to mention the covert alliance with the gregor i cant imagine any house heir alive who could match that brideprice right now its princely more literally than anyone here quite lets on barrayarans and do you think that youd have had any of it if i hadnt married ivan xav mm youve got a great deal here dont screw it up but i didnt deal not for him he returned in some very dadaish frustration and i always meant to for you i understand the corners of her mouth tugged up but ivan xav is a gift she leaned not up but over and kissed him on the cheek it worked to divert him too from his argumenthe patted her in distraction she led him back and linked arms with her barrayaran husband once more sotake good care of her then captain vorpatril formally dada shook ivan xavs free hand his eyes narrowed right down suddenly cold and hard his grip did not loosen and youd better believe that i can find some way to touch you if you dont no doubt at all sir ivan xav assured him he flinched under the pressure of that stare and paw but she was proud to see didnt step back thats not necessary dada said tej through her teeth yes yes tej love and it was all swallowed up in last embraces waves cries the clicking of silvered canopies the hiss of groundcar engines andsilence more golden than cetagandan coins rubbing his hand on his trouser seam ivan xav said plaintively is asking who can i kill for you usually how people say i love you in jacksonian no just dada tej sighed though the baronne is more dangerousshe might not ask ee said ivan xav ive been reading your histories said tej giving him a hug dont try to tell me some of your ancestors didnt think the same way starting with your aunt cordelias famous winterfair gift to your uncle aral and she wasnt even barrayaran severed heads really only the one he protested and i he added drawing himself up with dignity am a much more modern barrayaran tej pressed a smile out straight im sure you are lord vorpatril their meeting the next morning with the gregor was very short ylla said ivan xav in a confounded voice where the hell is ylla epilogue senior military attache at the barrayaran consulate on the planet ylla might have been a more exciting assignment had there been any junior military attaches or indeed any other employees aside from one dispirited homesick and slightly alcoholic consul eking out the dregs of his diplomatic career ivan and tej had arrived at what passed for the planetary industrial capitalthe city was about half the size of new eviasin what was midwinter for its hemisphere rainy cold smoggy and dull since tej was still in a quivering heap from far too many wormhole jumps in tooclose succession she had greeted it and their dingy provided apartment with no more protest than a moan well that wouldnt do hitting the consulate with what he would have considered average effort for a slow day at imperial headquarters ivan began ruthlessly applying opsstyle efficiencies to his duties and when he ran out of those to the consuls it didnt take long to figure out that ninetyfive percent of the consulates business came in over the perfectly adequate planetary comconsole net and that the consulate therefore could be sited anywhere with a shuttleport shopping for a more salubrious climate didnt take much longer he had the whole placelock stock comconsoles and consulmoved to a large delightful island near the equator by the end of his third week with money left over in the new budget to hire a clerk tej responded to the tropical light like a flower by the end of his first month ivan had his duties pared down to a neat three mornings a week with the occasional odd hour or popup trip to the orbital stations and after that it was all clear sailing not that people did much sailing on yllas extensive oceans nor swimming eitheryllan seawater tended to give humans strange rashes and while humans were highly toxic morsels in the diet of the native sea monsters the monsters were extremely stupid and kept not figuring this out but the view out over the swimming pool from their houses verandah was luminous and beautifulhe waved at tej over there in the big hammockand the sea wasnt bad to look at either a person of simple tastes could live really well really cheaply on ylla with the application of a little application and with a more generous budget even better mail call he told tej she looked up with a wide smile and set aside her earbug tightbeam messages from home were erratic at best what with all the jumps through which they had to be carried they could arrive out of order spread out or all in a wodge todays delivery had been a wodge he handed her a data disc to plug into her own reader set on the table along with a promising pitcher and a couple of glasses one halffull the other upside down and waiting just for him is that iced tea or fruity girly drinks fruity girly drinks want some actually yes he kicked off his sandals climbed into the other end of the hammock arranged the big cushions behind his back took up his own reader and laced his bare legs with hers she was acquiring an almost shivcolored tan which looked worlds better on her than on her dada making her sherrycolored eyes shine out like the gold coins on her favorite ankle braceletwhich along with a skimpy swimsuit she was currently wearing the ninthsatrapycoin anklet and a few more stunning baubles had been a birthday present sent by her fond dada a few months back ivan had plans for that suit later in the afternoon the chiming anklet could stay busy morning she inquired as the hammock settled eh not really i spent most of it editing my first annual performance review her brows rose in surprise i shouldnt think youd need tothe consul loves your work oh sure i was just toning down the ecstasy a bit before letting it loose in the tightbeam to home wouldnt want to give people ideas like for transfers to anywhere but back home that is when do you suppose theyll let us come back to barrayar gregor guessed two years a year ago havent heard anything to change that yet what gregor had actually said was dammit ivan you do realize its likely going to take two bloody years for this mess to blow over at least what were you thinking which ivan had thought a trifle unfair but that hadnt seemed the moment to say so and then ivan too had gotten to discover how much packing for galactic exile on hours notice was like grabbing your life from a burning building a little silence fell as they both began reading so what did you get tej inquired when his first huh invited interruption birthday greeting from admiral desplains ivans thirtysixth birthday had passed very pleasantly two weeks ago theyd stayed home he tells me that my replacement is a very efficient young man but lacks my political nous and is less entertaining thankyouithink admiral ivan read on i gather that he misses me but that he doesnt encourage me to think of coming back to ops because by that time i should be moving up and on if im interpreting this correctly you probably are said tej with touching faith in his ability to decipher elliptical hints from senior officers likely justified in this case you had something from the whole letter from rish she tapped her reader so frustrating she hates writing so she never puts in enough detail but shes too cheap to send a recording written messages were indeed the least expensive tightbeam communication to send by the long and winding wormhole routes which was why almost everything that made it as far as ylla was in this form repairs on cordonah station are almost complete she says the reunited jewels have danced their first public performance again now that topazs replacement legs have taken i hope the baronne tracked down whatever nasty prestene headmeat came up with that idea she scowled in person ivan had never met topaz but he hoped so too far more cruel than shaved hair that amputation had sounded it had allegedly been ordered in revenge for topaz helping the baron and baronne to escape their prestene captivity all those months ago a loyalty now redeemed good the revenge cyclehe declined to touch and your brother eric did they finally decide if he was cryorevivable mm yes buthuh her brows rose theyre still keeping him on ice for a while you know that prestene capturing the station was inpart an inside job appears eric was the inpart part tired of waiting for his inheritance and so he received the reward from prestene that anyone with a clue might have guessed was comingunless he saw which way things were going and turned to fight them at the end give him credit rish says he does seem to have been thinking of forcible retirement for dada not patricide but apparently someone figured out how to cut those costs dada and the baronne must have known this but back on barrayar they didnt give me the least hintoh my that boy is so grounded i expect my parentsll keep him as a threat in reserve for a while in case star and pidge arent able to work out their little differences as to who should be heiress thats one way to keep them yoked together ivan tried not to picture eric arquas cryochamber being used as a coffee table but who knew sowill they ever revive him in a few years i expect when star and pidge are firmly in place and then hell get to be their little brother ivan wasnt sure he wanted to know what family memories fueled her evil chuckle in other words house cordonahs internal politics are nearly back to normal so glad im here and not there her anklecoins chimed as her foot rubbed ivans calf i am too he declared without reservation does she write anything about byerly she scrolled on a short way no not really but if anything dire had happened to him she would have saidi thinkso i suppose all is well i have one from him whats the date on yours a quick crosscheck assured ivan that bys letter had followed almost a week after rishs so that was all right so far at least i cant accuse byerly of writing or talking too little though finding the message in the missive is a bit like looking for the meat in those meatballs they sell off the carts in the great squareholy crap ivans lurch nearly tipped the hammock tejs bright eyes widened in inquiry you know that broochthing that your grandmama picked up off the floor in the bunker yes by finally found out what the hell it was i was thinking hautlady bioweapons myself but i didnt like to say anything at the time i didnt think we needed more complications to getting everyone on their way home without being jailed and if she wanted to use them on prestene that was between her and the baron and baronne nothing to do with barrayar right weirder than that even ivan blinked and a whole lot to do with barrayar seems the beads on the brooch contained something like a hundred thousand sporulated genetic samples from barrayarans born in the vorbarra district before the end of the time of isolation it was the bloody genesurvey library oh my tej hesitated will the barrayarans be mad imnot sure i mean we never knew i suppose you do now byerly will have reported right yeah ivan read on you couldwell not you but someone crazy could clone all our ancestors from those samples you realize i wonder if there was anyone famous in there tej tilted her head considering this that might actually be made lucrative buy your own clone of prince xav or worse mad emperor yuri ye gods no his speeding eyes widened lady ghem estif offered to sell them back to the star creche thats terrible said tej but went on in earnest critique she should have set up a bidding war between the star creche and barrayar at the very least the baronne could have advised her whats the point of having an auction with only one bidder ivan swallowed this practical jacksonian view without gulping much or at least without comment tej added with keen interest what did they offer her i cant believe by didnt find out that he did ten million betan dollars heres where it all goes sideways she set up a handoff in a neutral locationhouse dyne tej nodded that makes sense while byerly was knocking himself out trying to steal the thingah there you go evidently he did offer to buy it firstbut he couldnt get past her rishapparently refused to take sides so anyway they dragged this star creche envoy an actual haut lady in her bubble and everything though im not sure how you could telli wonder if it was pel all the way out from eta ceta to the whole together with a suitcase full of bearercreditwell not a suitcase probably doubtless an elegant little card but anywayand a platoon of really scary bodyguards and the dyne guy had the bond in hand all cleared and ready to hand over and lady ghem estif set the brooch down in a little forcebubble with evidently a hidden plasma charge stood back and set it offblinding light but no concussionand turned it all to elemental gases right in front of them by says he thought he was having a heart attack and then he wished hed had wow said tej but why why would anyone in effect set fire to ten million betan dollars well grandmama tej pursed her lips then took a sip of fruity drink as she apparently thought this through grandmama was really incensed at being culled from the haut back when that was a hundred years ago shes held this grudge for over a century tej gave a nod itsits a girl thing she offered ghem estifarqua style ye gods should i keep this in mind tej smiled a sharp little smile and for a moment he could see shiv in her face what did my parents think about it all ivan read on by could stand to have one of those accuracybrevityclarity tutorials but maybe allegre favored a different style and he did still seem to have been quite upset when hed composed this hysterical was probably not too strong a term the baronne seems to have thought it wasteful the baron just laughed despite all the motherinlaw jokes everyone tells tej said meditatively grandmama always did get along very well with dada i think it was because she spent the whole of her life up until the barrayaran annexation of komarr following all the rules no matter how stupid they were and being screwed over for it and dada finally taught her how to break them and break away from them by wants to know did either of usmeaning probably youknow about the brooch i think hes asking though its hard to tell nope said tej tell him sorry i guess ivan finally started on his own frosty fruity drinknice kickas tej scrolled down heres one to me from your mother she said she and simon are back safely from their big galactic trip during which nobody tried to kill kidnap or otherwise vex anybody after all though she says she was a little afraid for some tau cetan customs inspectors at one point but she got simon calmed down simon and lady alyss exile had not been nearly so summarily ordered as ivan and tejs a mere suggestion conveyed through empress laisa to her social secretary that she was overdue for a nice long holiday though ivan doubted that any imperial nuances had been lost en route ivan remembered that part of his last conversation with gregor too gregor had been pacing exasperated when hed wheeled and burst out and simonwhat the hell ivan hesitated while his hope that this might be a rhetorical question died a lonely death then ventured i think he was bored gregor bored gregor jerked to a halt taken aback i thought he was exhausted right after the chip breakdown sure profoundly so for a while everyoneeven mamere and simon himselfassumed he was some fragile convalescent butquietlyhe does everything quietlyhes grown better i thank your mother for that yes yeah really ivan shied from trying to imagine the biography of a postchipsimon minus alys but it might have been a much shorter tale hes fine when shes with him but shes been going off to the residence a lot lately leaving him to his own devices and then shiv came along and pushed all his old buttons and well here we all are gregor contemplated the hereness of everyone grimly i see i think he needs something to do not a fulltime job occasional varied not too much like his old job thatwill take some careful thought ivan hoped their long trip had given gregor time for that thinking he couldnt help noticing in retrospect that despite the reported outbreak of imperial sarcasm it had been the illyan plan for the arquas that gregor had finally adopted more or less and that it seemed to be working so far tej still readingmamere could be chattywent on oh good the new impsec building has been dedicated not built opposite the old one they found another site with fewer holes under it theres a kindness ivan put in miles used to say that the one advantage of working in impsec hq was that you couldnt see impsec hq they got simon to cut the ribbon ah thats sweet she says they wanted to name it after him but he declined the honor very firmly so its going to go nameless for now i suppose they can circle back after hes dead ivan plowed on to his next letter huh aunt cordelia writes to me i really enjoyed meeting her and your uncle aral when we stopped at sergyar said tej she says she liked you too and to be sure to allow time to stop again on our way back she seems to assume well be let to come backthats heartening simon and mamere dropped in on their way home too evidently probably what triggered this simon and aral enjoyed their trip out to see the new settlementso glad for a chance to catch up with alysheard all about their nice visit to beta colony yes mamere wrote me all about that too what what what said tej agreeably mamere hadnt written her only son everything about her trip to beta colony evidently she took simon to the orb or was it the other way around no i guess not female collusion i bet he read on his face screwing up then demanded of the auntless and therefore blameless air why do you think you have to tell me these things aunt cordelia tejs lips twitched so what does she tell you they signed up for some sort of oneweek deluxe instructional course that doesnt sound tooroleplaying because mamere thought it might be easy for simon to get into on account of having done covert ops in his youth and the first day was pretty rocky but once she persuaded simon to stop treating the mandatory psychological interest survey as a hostile interrogation things smoothed outandthank god now aunt cordelia switches to telling me all about commodore joles new sailboatthe sergyaran seas dont dissolve human skin the way yllas do happily he took them all out for a sail good and no one drowned much better better than what tej was still laughing at him he feared justbetter ivan took refuge in what dignity a man wearing nothing but shorts and sipping fruity girly drinks could muster and also in the drink we should go to the orb on the way back mused tej i mean its famous for its erotic arts instruction which ive already had but ive always wanted to see it ivan was torn yeah so have i butwhat the hell is the mandatory psychological interest survey nobody ever mentioned that before not even miles tej brightened my betan tutors told me all about that its not like a multiplechoice testits more like a brain scan while they run all kinds of images and stimuli past you and then put the responsedata through their analysis program they pitch it to the customers as a way of helping people with limited time sort through the menu of offerings to find what will please them mostand it does do that but it also screens for problem customers are they turned away no no they just get a different level of supervision they mean a lot of varied things by problem you see some people are very distressed by insights that the survey reveals about them things that they didnt want to know and then they have to be sort of gently talked down ivan considered this warily i think simon already knows everything about himself that he doesnt want to know he never seemed much given to selfdeception all those years of nonadjustable memory i can believe that but a new reason for some people not to talk much about their visits to the famous orb glimmered in ivans mind the next time he caught up with miles speaking of that devil ah heres one from my cousin lordauditoranddontyouforgetit oh those are always very interesting tej perked up ivan read for a minute or so his lips parting oh my god the investing angel who bought the old impsec site from the imperial government turns out to have been my clonecousin mark vorkosigan for a betan dollar no not that much nepotism but he bargained them way down by accepting all legal liabilities apparently his engineers found a way to raise the building back to ground level again and stabilize the subsoil it took several months but they got it up pretty much whole that must have been almost as bizarre a sight as sinking it was but her brows drew down what in the world is the man going to do with an ugly old government building it was pretty much gutted wasnt it stripped more than gutted i gather surprisingly intact mark vorkosigan enterprises new headquarters he needs one no ivan scrolled on his lips drew back in an uncontrollable grin ooh snarky miles i just bet youre upset come on urged tej grinning as if he were the best show in town marks turning it into a theme hotel restaurant and nightclub with an espionage museum very educational he plans to sell the whole impsec experience to the tourists both backcountry and galactic apparently will people pay to sleep in old impsec cells and offices and things i meanit seems more like a place people would have paid to get out of that was then this is nowoh my oh youll have to read this miles is so pissed but he cant say so directly because mark the grand opening is in a couple of weeks and its already booked solid for the first two months ivan couldnt help adding after a moment of somewhat skewed beatific vision i wonder if therell be an adults only section because mark he wanted to go back and start over right then just to savor the letter on all its levels but there was more taking another direction oh no miles and ekaterin have decanted another one going into production coz i suppose you are still trying to outruneverything and pictures why babies all look alike i swear ooh send over tej held out a demanding hand he extended her his reader now displaying flat scans of what he was assured was a baby girl one lady elizabeth vorkosigan his newest niece uncle ivan good god the urchins would probably be up to calling him that by the time they got home to vorbarr sultana and aunt tej as well now how is it i can have my identity changed by something i didnt even do he cautiously considered the sobriquet da that one at least might be his own doing tej was not thankfully goopy the way some women got when presented with baby pictures but the look in her eye was curious and when she raised her face to his again speculative one wouldnt she said neutrally want to start an infant in a replicator here and then have to drag it decanted or otherwise back through all those stressful wormhole jumps to barrayar more sensible to wait a bit a bit ivan agreed the memory of so comfortably ignoring his thirtysixth birthday drifted across his mind but some deadlines demanded attention you knowim going to be a twentyyears man in just four more years that used to seem forever away and now itsnot what does that mean in barrayaran or vor as the case may be milspeak yet another dialect for you its the time a midgrade officer like me either takes early retirementnot all that early reallyor retakes his oaths and gets serious about tracking for high command they used to encourage men to stay in but they dont so much these days theyd rather have new young fellows with new young training sowhat do you want to do or do instead opting out would be a surefire way to avoid unwanted promotion he tried to remember his early military idealism before the glitter had worn off in retrospect he wasnt sure it had been idealism so much as a burning hunger for a status to overawe his fellow obnoxious eighteenyearolds whichseemed much less important now is that your answer then might be it also depends on the alternatives on offer the consul thinks i should consider the diplomatic corps thatsreally not an unusual secondcareer path for a twentyyears man like me tejs lips curved up theres no one like you ivan xav ivan decided not to argue with this flattering viewpoint tej tried it out in her mouth ambassador vorpatril ambassador and lady vorpatrilthey like you to come as a set and theyd fall all over themselves for your language kink but theres an apprenticeship first even if i were fasttracked unless we were sent to the backside of nowhere he looked around and added conscientiously again tej let her gaze pass over the golden yllan landscape the odd but lovely deep bluegreen forwantofabetterterm vegetationmuch the color of a very chilled rishthe wide shining corrosive sea well someone has to be she allowed judiciously it could involve a lot of wormhole jumps mm but only once every few years i couldsteel myself and it would keep us far away from both our families i can see the appeal in all in truth it was a problem for another day ivan decided when life and chance handed you an afternoon as idyllic as this one promised to be it seemed profoundly ungrateful not to pay attention ivan ran a toe up tejs shin and began attending
