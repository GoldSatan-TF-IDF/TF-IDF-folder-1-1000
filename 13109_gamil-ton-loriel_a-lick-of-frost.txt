laurell k hamilton a lick of frost the th book in merry gentry series to jonathon who walks the stair with me acknowledgments the staff dark mary and sherry chaos would ensue without them charles who requested not to be chief security officer as i put in the last acknowledgement but to be head grunt i should have remembered that his highest official rank had been sergeant sergeants work for a living they are not officers my writing group the alternate historians tom drennan rett macphearson deborah millitello marella sands and mark sumner insanity ensues with or without them but with them its much more fun chapter i was sitting in an elegant conference room in the top of one of the gleaming towers that make up part of downtown los angeles the rooms far wall was almost entirely of glass so that the view was nearly agoraphobic theyre predicting that if the big one the big earthquake that is hits this section of l a will be eight to fifteen feet deep in glass anything on the streets below will be cut to pieces crushed or trapped underneath an avalanche of glass not a pretty thought but it was a day for ugly thoughts my uncle taranis king of light and illusion had pressed charges against three of my royal bodyguards he had gone to the human authorities with charges that rhys galen and abe had raped one of his courts women in all the long history of his reign in the seelie court he had never gone outside to the humans for justice faerie rule faerie law or truthfully sidhe rule sidhe law the sidhe had ruled faerie for longer than anyone could remember since some of those memories stretched back thousands of years maybe the sidhe had always been in charge but it tasted like a lie the sidhe do not lie for to truly lie is to be cast out of faerie exiled since i knew that the three bodyguards in question were innocent that raised interesting problems with lady caitrins testimony but today we were just giving statements and depending on how that went king taranis was standing by for a group call which was why simon biggs and thomas farmer both of biggs biggs farmer and farmer was sitting beside me thank you for agreeing to this meeting today princess meredith one of the suits across the table said there were seven suits across the wide gleaming table with their backs to the lovely view ambassador stevens official ambassador to the courts of faerie was sitting on our side of the table but he was on the far side of biggs and farmer stevens said a word on faerie etiquette you dont say thank you to the people of faerie mr shelby princess meredith as one of the younger royals will probably not be offended but you will be dealing with some nobility who are much older not all of them will allow a thank you to pass without grave insult stevens smiled when he said it his blandly handsome face sincere from his brown eyes to his perfectly cut brown hair he was supposed to be our voice to the world but truthfully he spent all his time at the seelie court sucking up to my uncle the unseelie court where my aunt andais the queen of air and darkness ruled and where i might rule someday was too scary for stevens no i didnt like him michael shelby a u s attorney for l a said i am sorry princess meredith i didnt realize i smiled and said its fine the ambassador is correct a thankyou wont bother me but it will bother your men shelby asked some of them yes i said i looked behind me to doyle and frost they stood behind me like darkness and snow made real and that wasnt far from the truth doyle had black hair black skin a black designer suit even his tie was black only the shirt was a rich royal blue and that had been a sop to our lawyer he thought black gave the wrong impression made him seem threatening doyle whose nickname was darkness had said i am the captain of the princesss guard i am supposed to be threatening the lawyers hadnt known what to say to that but doyle had worn the blue shirt the color almost glowed against the rich perfect black of his skin which was so black there were purple and blue highlights to his body in the right light his black eyes were hidden behind wraparound blackonblack sunglasses frosts skin was as white as doyles was black as white as my own but his hair was uniquely his own silver like metal beaten into hair it gleamed in the tasteful lighting of the conference room gleamed like something you could have melted down and made into jewelry he had tied the top layer of it back with a barrette that was silver and older than the city of los angeles itself the dovegray suit was ferragamo and the white of his shirt was less white than his own skin the tie was darker than the suit but not by much the soft gray of his eyes was bare to the room as he scanned the far windows doyle was doing it too behind his glasses i had a bodyguards for a reason and some who wanted me dead could fly we didnt think taranis was one of the people who wanted me dead but why had he gone to the police why had he persisted in these false charges he would never have done all this without an agenda we just didnt know what that agenda was so just in case they watched the windows for things that the human lawyers couldnt even begin to imagine shelbys gaze flicked behind me to the guards he wasnt the only one who kept fighting not to glance nervously at my men but it was assistant district attorney pamela nelson who was having the most trouble keeping her eyes and her mind on business the men across the table gave the guards the glances men give when they see another man who they are almost certain could take them physically without breaking a sweat u s attorney michael shelby was tall athletic and handsome with a gleam of white teeth and the look of someone who had plans to rise above being the u s attorney for the los angeles area he was over six feet and his suit couldnt hide the fact that he worked out pretty seriously he probably didnt meet many men who made him feel physically weak his assistant ernesto bertram was a slender man who looked too young for his job and far too serious with his short dark hair and glasses it wasnt the glasses that made him look too serious it was the look on his face as if hed tasted something sour the u s attorney for the st louis area albert veducci was here too he didnt have shelbys tan in fact he was a little overweight and he looked tired his assistant was grover hed actually introduced himself only as grover so i didnt know if it was his first last or only name he smiled more than the rest of them and was attractive in that friendly walkyouhomeoncampus way he reminded me of guys in college who were either as nice as they seemed or absolute bastards who only wanted sex for you to help them pass a class or for me to be close to a real live faerie princess i wouldnt know which kind of nice guy grover was for a while if things went well id never figure it out because id probably never see him again if they went badly we might see a lot of grover nelson was the assistant district attorney to the district attorney for los angeles county her boss miguel cortez was short dark and handsome he looked great on camera id seen him on the news often enough here the trouble was that he like shelby was ambitious he liked being on the news and wanted to be on the news more this accusation of rape against my men had all the earmarks of a case that could make your career or break it cortez and shelby were ambitious it meant that they would either be very cautious or very incautious i wasnt sure which mood would help us the most yet nelson was taller than her boss close to six feet in her nottoohigh heels her hair was a vibrant red that fell in waves around her shoulders it was that rare shade that is deep rich and as close to true red as human hair can get her suit was well cut but conservative and black her buttonup shirt white her makeup tasteful only that flame of hair to ruin the almost mannish exterior she portrayed it was as if she were hiding her beauty and drawing attention to it at the same time because she was beautiful a sprinkling of freckles underneath the pale makeup didnt detract from the flawless skin it added her eyes were green and blue at once depending on how the light caught them those undecided eyes couldnt stop looking at frost and doyle she tried to concentrate on the legal pad she was supposed to be making notes on but her gaze kept rising and finding them as if she couldnt help herself that made me wonder if there was more going on than just handsome men and a distracted woman shelby cleared his throat sharply i jumped and looked at him im terribly sorry mr shelby were you speaking to me no i was not and i should have been he looked down the table on his side i was brought into this as a more neutral voice but let me ask my fellow members of the bar if they are having trouble forming questions for the princess several of the lawyers spoke at the same time veducci just raised his pencil in the air veducci got the nod my office has dealt more closely with the princess and her people than the rest of you which is why im carrying certain remedies against glamour what sort of remedies shelby asked i wont tell you what im carrying but cold steel iron fourleaf clover stjohnswort rowan and ash either the wood or the berries have been known to work some say bells will break glamour but i think high court sidhe wont be bothered much by bells are you saying that the princess is using glamour against us shelby asked his handsome face no longer pleasant i am saying that sometimes when dealing with king taranis or queen andais their presence overwhelms humans veducci responded princess meredith being part human though beautiful he nodded in my direction i nodded at the compliment has never affected anyone so strongly but a lot has been happening in the unseelie court in the last few days ambassador stevens has filled me in as have other sources princess meredith and some of her guard have moved up the power grid so to speak veducci still looked tired but now his eyes showed the mind inside that overweight overworked camouflage i realized with a start that there were other dangers besides ambition veducci was smart and hinted that he knew something about what had happened inside the unseelie court did he know or was he fishing did he think wed give something away it is illegal to use glamour on us shelby said angry he looked at me now and his look was no longer in the least friendly i looked back i gave him the full force of my tricolored eyes molten gold at the outer edge then a circle of jade green and last emerald to chase around my pupil he looked away first dropping his gaze to his own legal pad his voice was tight with controlled rage we could have you arrested or deported back to faerie for trying to use magic to sway these proceedings princess im not dong anything to you mr shelby not on purpose i looked at veducci mr veducci you say that simply seeing my aunt and uncle was difficult am i difficult now from my colleagues reactions i believe you are so this is the reaction that king taranis and queen andais have on humans similar veducci said i had to smile this is not funny princess cortez said his words full of anger but when i met his brown eyes they dropped from me i looked at nelson but it wasnt me distracting her her problem was behind me which one are you staring at the most i asked frost or doyle light or dark she blushed in that pretty way human redheads have im not come ms nelson confess which one she swallowed hard enough that i heard it both she whispered we will charge you and these two guards with undue magical influence in a legal proceeding princess meredith cortez said i agree shelby said neither i nor frost and doyle are doing this on purpose we are not stupid shelby said glamour is an active magic not a passive one most glamour yes but not all i said i looked down the table at veducci theyd put him farthest from the center of the table as if being from st louis made him less or maybe i was just overly sensitive for my hometown did you know veducci said that when you see the queen of england they call it being in the presence ive never met queen elizabeth and im not likely to so i dont know how it works for her ive never spoken to a human queen but the phrase in the presence to be in the presence of the queen means more when its the queen of the unseelie court to be in the presence of the king of the seelie court is also a treat what does that mean cortez asked a treat it means gentleman and ladies that being king or queen in faerie gives you an unconscious aura of power of attractiveness you live in l a you see that it works in lesser ways for major stars or politicians power seems to breed power dealing with the faerie courts has made me believe that even us poor humans do it to be around the powerful rich beautiful talented whatever it isnt just human nature to suck up i think its glamour i think that success of a certain level has a glamour to it and you attract people to you they want to be around you they listen to you more they do what you say more humans have a shadow of real glamour now think about someone who is the most powerful figure in faerie think about the level of power surrounding them ambassador stevens shelby said shouldnt you have been the one who warned us about this effect stevens smoothed his tie played with the rolex watch taranis had given him as a present king taranis is a powerful figure with centuries of rulership he does have a certain nobility that is impressive i have not found queen andais as impressive because you only talk to her from a distance over the mirrors with king taranis by your side veducci said i was impressed that veducci knew that because it was absolutely true youre the ambassador to faerie shelby said not just to the seelie court i am the united states ambassador to the courts of faerie yes but you never step foot into the unseelie court shelby asked uh stevens said running his fingers over and over the watchband i find queen andais a little less than cooperative what does that mean shelby said i watched him play with the watch and a tiny bit of concentration showed that there was magic on it or in it i answered for him it means he thinks the unseelie court is full of perversion and monsters they were all looking at him now if it had been purposeful glamour on our part they wouldnt have is that true ambassador shelby asked i would never say such a thing but he believes it i said softly well all make a note of this and make sure the proper authorities know of your gross dereliction of your duties shelby said i am loyal to king taranis and his court it is not my fault that queen andais is a sexual sadist and quite mad she and her people are dangerous i have said so for years and no one has listened to me now we have these charges proving what i have been saying so you told your superiors that you feared the queens guard would rape someone veducci asked well i no not exactly what did you tell them shelby asked i told them the truth that i feared for my safety at the unseelie court and that i would not be comfortable there without an armed escort stevens stood up very tall very certain of himself he pointed at frost and doyle look at them they are frightening the potential in them to do carnage why it just radiates off of them you keep touching your watch i said what he blinked at me your watch king taranis gave it to you didnt he i asked you accepted a rolex watch from the king cortez made it a question he sounded outraged but not at us stevens swallowed and shook his head of course not that would be totally inappropriate i saw him give it to you ambassador i said he ran his fingers over the metal thats simply not true shes lying the sidhe dont lie ambassador you know that thats a human habit stevenss fingers were practically rubbing a hole through the watchband the unseelie are capable of every evil their very faces show them for what they are it was nelson who said their faces are beautiful you are fooled by their magic stevens said the king gave me the power to see through their deceptions his voice was rising with each word the watch i said so this shelby gestured at me beauty is illusion yes stevens said no i said liar he screamed shoving his chair back so that it rolled on its wheels he started walking past biggs and farmer toward me doyle and frost moved like two halves of a whole they simply stood in front of him blocking his way there was no magic to it except the force of their physicality stevens stumbled back from them as if hed been struck his face contorted in terror and he cried out no no some of the lawyers were standing now cortez said what are they doing to him veducci managed to yell above stevenss screams i cant see anything we are doing nothing to him doyle said his deep voice cutting under the higherpitched voices like water undercutting a cliff face the hell you arent shelby yelled adding to the noise of stevenss screams and those of the others i tried yelling above the noise turn your jackets inside out no one seemed to hear me veducci bellowed shut up in a voice that smashed through the noise like a bull through a fence the room was stunned into silence even stevens stopped screaming and stared at veducci veducci continued in a calmer voice turn your jackets inside out its a way to break glamour he moves his head toward me almost a bow i forgot that one the others hesitated for a second veducci took off his own jacket and turned it inside out then put it back on it seemed to galvanize the rest most of them began taking off their jackets nelson said as she folded her jacket so the seams showed im wearing a cross i thought that protected me from glamour i answered her crosses and bible verses would only work if we were of the devil we have no connection to the christian religion either for good or ill she looked down as if embarrassed to meet my eyes i didnt mean to imply anything of course not i said my voice was empty as i said it id heard the insult too often to take it to heart one of the things the early church did was to paint anything they could not control as evil faerie was something they could not control as the seelie court became more and more humanfriendly the parts of faerie that could not or would not play human became part of the unseelie court since the things that humans perceive as frightening are mostly at the unseelie court we got painted as evil over the centuries you are evil stevens screamed his eyes bulged his pulse was racing and his face was pale and beaded with sweat is he sick nelson asked in a way i said softly enough that i wasnt sure any of the other humans in the room heard me whoever had done the spell on the watch had done too good a job or a bad one the spell was forcing stevens to see nightmares when he looked at us his mind wasnt coping well with what he was seeing and feeling i turned to veducci the ambassador seems ill perhaps he should be taken to see a doctor no stevens yelled no without me here they will take over your minds he grabbed biggs who was closer without the kings gift you will all believe their lies i think the princess is right ambassador stevens biggs said i think you are ill stevenss hands dug into the insideout designer jacket that biggs was now wearing surely you see them for what they are now they look like all the sidhe to me except for the color of captain doyles skin and the princess being petite they look like nobles of the sidhe court stevens shook the bigger man the darkness has fangs the killing frost has skulls hanging from his neck and she she is withered dying her mortal blood contaminates her ambassador biggs began no you must see it as i do they didnt change at all when we turned our jackets inside out nelson said she sounded a little disappointed i told you we are not doing active glamour on any of you i said lies i see the horror of you stevens hid his face against biggss broad shoulders as if he could not bear the sight of us and perhaps he could not it is easier not to look at them though shelby said cortez nodded i can focus better now but they look the same beautiful cortezs assistant said cortez gave him a sharp look and the assistant apologized as if that one word was totally out of line stevens had begun to sob into biggss designer suit you must get him away from us doyle said why one of the others asked the spell on the watch makes him see monsters when he looks at us i fear his mind will break under the strain of it without king taranis nearby to ease the effects cant you just undo the spell veducci asked it is not our spell doyle said simply cant you help him nelson asked i think the less contact with us the better for the ambassador stevens had seemed to be trying to bury his face into biggss shoulder the ambassadors hands twisted in the seams and lining of the coat being near us is hurting him frost said speaking for the first time since the introductions his voice did not have the depth of doyles but the width of his chest gave it weight get some security up here biggs said to farmer and though farmer was a very powerful man in his own right and a full partner he moved for the door i guess when your daddy is one of the founders of a firm and you are the leading active partner you still have clout even over other partners we stood in silence the humans awkward body language and facial expressions saying that they were terribly uncomfortable with the display of mad emotion it was a type of madness but the three of us sidhe had seen worse wed seen madness that had magic to it the kind of magic that could steal the breath from your body on a laughing whim uniformed security came i recognized one of the guards from the entrance desk they had a doctor with them i remembered reading several doctors names on the board beside the elevator apparently farmer had exceeded his orders but biggs seemed very pleased to hand the sobbing man over to the doctor no wonder farmer had made partner he followed orders to the letter but built on them made them better no one said anything else until they led the ambassador from the room and the door closed quietly behind him biggs straightened his tie and tugged at the wrinkled suit jacket inside out or right side out the suit was ruined until a dry cleaner got hold of it he started to take the jacket off then glanced at us and stopped i caught his eye and he looked away embarrassed its all right mr biggs if youre afraid to take your jacket off ambassador stevenss mind seems quite broken i would advise the doctor to have a licensed practitioner of the arts look at the watch before you simply remove it why hes worn that watch for years it may have become a part of his psyche his mind to simply remove it could do more harm biggs reached for a phone why didnt you say something before he was led away shelby asked i only now thought of it i said i thought of it before they left doyle said why didnt you speak up cortez asked it is not my job to protect the ambassador its everyones job to help another human in such a state shelby said then he looked surprised as if hed just heard what hed said doyle gave the smallest curl of lips but i am not human and i think the ambassador is weak and without honor queen andais has lodged several complaints with your government about the ambassador she has been ignored but even she could not have foreseen such treachery as this treachery of our government against yours veducci asked no king taraniss treachery against someone who trusted him the ambassador saw that watch as a mark of high favor when in fact it was a trap and a lie you disapprove nelson said do you not also disapprove doyle asked she started to nod and then looked away blushing apparently even with her jacket turned she couldnt help reacting to him he was worth reacting to but i didnt like that she was having this much trouble the charges would be hard enough without us making the prosecutors blush what would the king have gained from poisoning the ambassador against your court cortez asked what have the seelie always gained from blackening the name of the unseelie i asked ill bite shelby said what have they gained fear i said they have made their people fear us what did that gain them shelby asked frost spoke the greatest punishment of all is to be cast out of the seelie court the golden court but it is punishment because taranis and his nobles have convinced themselves that once you join the unseelie court you become a monster not just in actions but in body they tell their people that they will become deformed if they join with the unseelie you talk like you know nelson said i was once part of the golden throng long long ago frost said what did you do to earn exile shelby asked lieutenant frost doesnt have to answer that biggs said he had stopped fussing with his suit and was back to being one of the best lawyers on the west coast is the answer prejudicial to the charges brought against the other guards shelby asked no biggs said but since the lieutenant is not included in the charges filed the question is outside the scope of this investigation biggs had lied smoothly effortlessly lied as if it were the truth he actually didnt know if frosts answer would have been prejudicial because he had no idea why anyone but the three guards in question had been exiled from the seelie court though in galens case he hadnt been exiled because hed been born and raised in the unseelie court you cant be exiled from what youve never been a part of biggs had carefully not allowed any questions that might interfere with a linear defense of his clients this is a very informal proceeding veducci said with a smile he radiated harmless goodolboy charm it was a trick bordering on a lie hed researched us hed dealt with the courts more than any of the other lawyers he was either going to be our greatest ally or our most difficult opponent he continued still smiling and letting us see those tired eyes we are all here today to see if the charges that king taranis filed on behalf of the lady caitrin should be followed up with more formal proceedings cooperation would give strength to the princess guards denials since all of the guards have diplomatic immunity we are here out of courtesy biggs said we do appreciate that veducci said do bear in mind shelby said that king taranis has stated that all of the queens guard and now the princess guard are a danger to everyone around them most especially women he stated that this rape did not surprise him he seemed to think it was the inevitable outcome of allowing the queens raven guard unlimited access even inside faerie one of the reasons he brought these charges to the human authorities an unprecedented action in all the history of the seelie court is that he feared for us if a sidhe noble of lady caitrins magical powers could be so easily taken then what hope did mere humans have against their lusts unnatural lusts i said shelby shifted his gray eyes to me i did not say that no you didnt but im betting my uncle taranis did shelby gave a little shrug he doesnt seem to like your men much that is true or me i said shelbys face showed surprise and i wished i could have told if it was genuine or if he were lying with his face the king had only good things to say about you princess he seems to feel that you have been he seemed to change what he was about to say at the last moment led astray by your aunt the queen and her guards led astray i made it a question he nodded thats not what he said is it not in so many words no it must have been truly insulting for you to pretty it up like this i said shelby actually looked uncomfortable before i saw ambassador stevens and his reaction to you and the possible spell on his watch i might have simply stated what the king said shelby gave me a very straightforward look lets say that stevens has made me wonder at the vehemence of king taraniss dislike of all your guard all my guard again i made it a question with the upward lilt of my voice yes i looked at veducci he charges all my men with crimes no only the three mentioned but mr shelby is correct king taranis stated that your raven guard is a danger to all women he thinks that having been made celibate for so long has driven them insane veduccis face never changed as he let out one of the biggest secrets of the faerie courts i opened my mouth to say taranis wouldnt have told you that but doyles hand on my shoulder stopped me i looked up at his dark figure even through his black glasses i knew the look that look said careful he was right veducci had stated earlier that he had sources at the unseelie court taranis might not have said it at all this is the first weve heard that the king is accusing the raven guard of being celibate biggs said he had glanced at doyle but now put his attention back on shelby and veducci the king felt that the longenforced celibacy was the reason for the attack biggs leaned in to me and whispered is this true were they forced to be celibate i whispered against his white collar yes why he asked my queen willed it so that was true as far as it went but it kept me from sharing secrets that queen andais wouldnt want shared taranis might survive her wrath i wouldnt biggs turned back to the opposing side we are not conceding that this alleged celibacy took place but if it did the men in question are no longer celibate they are with the princess now and not the queen the princess has stated that the three of them are her lovers there would be no alleged celibacyinduced biggs seemed to search for the right word madness he made light of it with his voice his face and a hand gesture it was a glimpse of what hed be like in court he just might be worth all the money my aunt was paying shelby said the kings statement the charges filed are enough to allow the united states government to confine all of the princess guard to the lands of faerie i know the law youre referring to briggs said many in jeffersons government didnt agree with him allowing the fey to settle here after they were exiled from europe they insisted on a law that would allow them to permanently confine to faerie any citizen of faerie deemed too dangerous to be allowed among the human citizenry it is a very broad law and has never been invoked its never been needed before cortez said doyle had stayed at my back his hand resting on my shoulder either he knew i needed comforting or he needed it i laid my hand on top of his so we could touch bare skin to bare skin he was so warm so solid just the touch made me feel more certain that it would be all right we would be all right its not needed now and you all know it biggs said he tsked at them trying to scare the princess by threatening to send all her guards back to faerie shame on you the princess doesnt look scared nelson said i gave her the full weight of my tricolored eyes and she couldnt hold my gaze you are threatening to take the men i love away from me i said shouldnt that frighten me it should she said but it doesnt seem to farmer touched my arm a clear letmetalk gesture i leaned back into the weight of doyle at my back and let the lawyers talk which brings us to the law in question farmer said the royals of any court are exempt from the law mr shelby has mentioned we are not proposing to exile princess meredith to faerie shelby said you know that the threat to put all her guards under some sort of legal confinement to faerie is outrageous farmer said shelby nodded fine then just the three who are charged with rape mr cortez and i are both duly appointed officers of the united states attorneys office we are within our duty and rights to simply put the three guards back into the land of faerie until these charges are settled i repeat the law as written cannot be applied to the royals of any court of faerie farmer said and i repeat that we arent threatening to do anything to princess meredith shelby said but we arent referring to that royal farmer said shelby looked down the line of lawyers on his side im not sure were following your argument princess merediths guard are royal for now what does that mean for now cortez asked it means that when inside the seelie court they have a throne on the royal dais in which they take turns sitting beside the princess farmer said they are her royal consorts being her lover doesnt make them royal cortez said prince phillip is technically still queen elizabeths royal consort farmer said but theyre married cortez said but in faerie at any court you arent allowed to marry until you are with child farmer said mr farmer i said touching his arm since this is informal perhaps it would go more quickly if i explained farmer and biggs whispered back and forth but finally i got the nod i was going to be allowed to talk oh goody i smiled at the other side of the table leaning a little forward hands nicely folded on the table my guards are my lovers which makes them royal consorts until one of them makes me pregnant then that one will be king to my queen until the choice is made they are all royalty in the unseelie court the three guards who have been charged by the king should be sent back to faerie shelby said king taranis was so afraid that ambassador stevens would see that the unseelie court was beautiful that he put a spell on the man a spell that forced him to see us as monstrous a man who would do such a desperate thing would do many other desperate things what do you mean princess to lie is to be cast out of faerie but to be king is sometimes to be above the law are you saying these charges are falsified cortez asked of course they are false you would say anything to save your lovers shelby said i am sidhe and i am not above the law i cannot lie is that true shelby leaned down and asked veducci he nodded its supposed to be true but either the princess is lying or lady caitrin is lying shelby looked back at me you cannot lie i have the ability but to do so is to run the risk of being cast out from faerie i squeezed doyles hand tightly i just got back i dont want to lose it all again why did you leave faerie the first time princess shelby asked biggs answered that that question is off limits and outside the charges in question the queen had probably given him a list of questions i couldnt answer shelby smiled very well is it true that the raven guards were forced into centuries of celibacy may i ask a question before i answer that you can ask anything you like princess but i may not answer i smiled at him and he smiled back doyles hand tightened on my shoulder he was right mustnt flirt until we knew exactly how it would be perceived i toned the smile down and asked my question did king taranis himself say that the ravens were forced into centuries of celibacy ive so stated shelby said no i mean as truth mr shelby please bear in mind that even a princess may be tortured for going against her queens orders you admit that they torture people at the unseelie court cortez said they torture people at both courts mr cortez queen andais just doesnt hide what she does because shes not ashamed of it are you stating for the record cortez said this will be a sealed record biggs said unless it goes to court yes yes cortez said but are you stating for the record that king taranis allows torture to be used as a punishment in the seelie court answer my question truthfully and i will answer yours cortez looked at shelby they exchanged a longerthannormal look then both of them turned back to me yes they said at the same time the two men looked at each other and finally cortez nodded at shelby who said yes king taranis stated that the fact that the raven guard had been forced into centuries of celibacy was the reason they were a danger to women he further stated that to then have the forced celibacy lifted for only one little girl referring to you princess was monstrous for no one woman could satisfy the lusts of centuries so the celibacy was the motive for the rape i said that seems to be the kings reasoning shelby said we havent looked for a motive beyond the usual for rape the usual i thought ive answered your question princess now are you stating for the record that the seelie court tortures its prisoners frost came to stand beside doyle meredith think upon this before you answer i looked behind me met his worried eyes the soft gray of winter skies i held my other hand out to him and he took it taranis let our cat out of the bag frost its only fair we let one of his out frost frowned at me i do not understand this talk of cats but i fear his anger i had to smile at him even as i agreed with him he began this frost i will only finish it he squeezed my hand and doyle squeezed the other so that my hands were crisscrossed over my chest holding them i held their hands while i said mr shelby mr cortez you asked me am i stating for the record that king taraniss golden court tortures as a punishment i am so stating the record was supposed to be sealed but if either of these secrets got into the press this little family feud was going to get very ugly very fast chapter the lawyers decided that doyle and frost could answer some general questions about what it was like being part of my personal guard to give some background to the atmosphere that rhys galen and abe had been living in i wasnt sure it was going to be helpful but i wasnt a lawyer so who was i to argue doyle sat on my right frost on my left my lawyers farmer and biggs moved a few seats down to give them room shelby got the first question and there are now sixteen of you with access only to princess meredith for your um needs if you mean for sex then yes doyle said shelby coughed and nodded yes i do mean sex then say what you mean doyle said i will do that shelby sat up a little straighter i imagine it must be difficult to share the princess im not certain i understand the question well not to be indelicate but waiting for your turn must be hard after so many years of denial no it is not hard to wait but of course it is shelby said youre putting words in the witnesses mouth biggs said sorry what i mean captain doyle is that after so many years of needs unmet it must be difficult to only have sex about every two weeks or so frost laughed then caught himself and tried to turn it into a cough doyle smiled it was the first truly broad smile that hed had since the questions had started the white flash of his teeth in all that dark dark face was startling if you werent used to it it was like having a statue suddenly smile at you i fail to see the humor in being forced to wait weeks for sex captain doyle lieutenant frost i would see no humor in that either doyle said but when the number of men grew larger princess meredith changed some of the parameters for us all im not following nelson said parameters doyle looked at me perhaps you better explain princess when i had only five lovers it seemed fair to make them wait for their turns but as you point out waiting two weeks or more after centuries of celibacy seems like another form of torture so when the number of men went up to double digits i upped the number of times i make love during a given day you dont get to see powerful highpriced lawyers look that embarrassed often but i got to see it then they all looked at each other nelson actually raised her hand ill ask if no one else will the men let her ask how many times a day do you make love it varies but usually at least three times three times a day she repeated yes i said and gave her blank pleasant face she blushed to the roots of her red hair i was sidhe enough that i didnt understand this american trait of being totally fascinated with sex and totally uncomfortable with it veducci recovered first as i had figured he would even at three times a day princess meredith that leaves an average of five days between lovemaking sessions for the men five days is a long time when youve been denied for centuries couldnt your three guards have tried to find something to occupy their time in between waiting a fiveday wait implies that im only sleeping with one man at a time mr veducci and most of the time im not veducci smiled at me it was a nice smile it went all the way to his eyes and folded the bags into smile lines that said here was a man who knew how to enjoy life or had once it was like a glimpse into a younger less tired version i smiled back at him responding to that joy you are totally comfortable with this line of questioning arent you princess meredith he asked i am not ashamed of anything ive done mr veducci the fey outside of some of the seelie court see no shame in sex as long as it is consensual all right he said ill ask the next one how many men at a time do you routinely sleep with he shook his head when he asked as if he couldnt believe he was asking it i dont think thats appropriate biggs said ill answer it i said are you sure its sex theres nothing wrong with sex i held biggss gaze until he looked away i turned back to veducci average is probably two at a time i think the max that ive ever done at once is four i looked at doyle and frost four i made it a question i believe so doyle said frost nodded yes i turned back to the lawyers four but two is average biggs recovered a little so you see gentlemen ladies a twoday wait between sex or less there are married men who have to wait longer than that for their needs to be met princess meredith cortez said yes mr cortez i looked into his dark brown eyes he cleared his throat and said are you telling us the truth you have sex three times a day with an average of two men at a time and sometimes up to four is this what you want in the record it is sealed farmer said but if this does go to court then it may not be is this really what the princess wants the public to know about her i frowned at him its the truth mr cortez why should the truth bother me do you honestly not understand what this information could do to your reputation in the media i dont understand the question he looked at biggs and farmer i dont say this often but is your client aware of what this record even sealed can be used for i did discuss it with her but mr cortez the unseelie court does not view sex in the same way as most of the world they certainly dont view it as mainstream america views it my colleague and i learned that when we prepped the princess and her guard for these talks if you are hinting that the princess might be more careful what she admits to having done with her men then save your breath she is absolutely not bothered by anything she has done with any of her men not to bring up a painful subject but the princess didnt seem very happy in the media when her exfiancé griffin sold those polaroids to the tabloids a few months back cortez said i nodded that did hurt me i said but because griffin broke my trust not because i was ashamed of what wed done i thought we were in love when those pictures were taken there is no shame in love mr cortez you are either very brave princess or very naive if you can use the word naive to a woman who is having sex with nearly twenty men on a regular basis i am not naive mr cortez i simply dont think like a human woman farmer said king taraniss allegation that the three guards he accused of this crime did so out of unmet sexual needs is a false assumption it is based on the kings own lack of understanding of his sister court is the unseelie court so different from the seelie court when it comes to matters of sex nelson asked may i take this one mr farmer i asked you may the seelie try to ape human behavior theyre stuck somewhere between the centuries of fifteen hundred to eighteen hundred but they try to play human more than the unseelie many of those exiled to our court have been exiled because of simply wanting to remain true to their original natures and not let themselves be civilized in a human manner you sound like youre lecturing nelson said i smiled i did a paper in college on the differences between the two courts i thought it might help the teacher and the other students understand that the unseelie court wasnt the bad guy you were the first of the fey to attend human college in this country cortez said he shifted through some papers in front of him but not the last some of the socalled lesser fey have actually gotten degrees since then my father prince essus thought if one of the royals went then our people might follow he thought that learning and understanding the country we lived in was a necessary part of the fey adapting to modern life here your father never saw you attend college though did he cortez asked no i said the one word was clipped doyle and frost reached for me at the same time their hands found each other at the back of my shoulders doyles arm stayed there frosts hand moved to cover one of my hands where i kept them still upon the tabletop they were reacting to the tension in me but it let everyone in the room know how concerned they were with me dealing with this topic they hadnt reacted to talk of my exfiancé griffin i think all my men thought they had washed his memory clean from me with their own bodies i felt the same so theyd read me right doyle was usually a good judge of my moods frost who had his own moods was learning mine i think this topic is closed biggs said i am sorry if i caused the princess distress cortez said but he didnt sound sorry i wondered why hed brought up my fathers assassination cortez like shelby and veducci struck me as men who didnt do things without a reason i wasnt sure about nelson and the rest i was counting on biggs and farmer being calculating men but what did cortez hope to gain from mentioning my fathers death i am sorry to cause distress but i do have a reason for bringing the topic up cortez said i dont see what relevance it could possibly have on these proceedings biggs said the murderer of prince essus was never apprehended cortez said in fact no one was even seriously suspected is that correct we failed the prince and the princess in every way doyle said but you werent a guard for either of them were you not at that time lieutenant frost you were also part of the queens ravens when prince essus died none of the current bodyguards of the princess were members of prince essuss crane guards is that correct that is not true frost said cortez looked at him excuse me frost looked at doyle who gave a small nod frosts hand tightened over mine he didnt like to speak in public it was a phobia we have half a dozen guards with us here in los angeles who were once part of prince essusss cranes the king seems very certain that none of the princes guards are guarding the princess cortez said it is a recent change frost said his hand tightened on mine until i used my free hand to play my fingers across the back of his one it would comfort him two it would keep him from forgetting how strong he was and hurting my hand i played my fingers on the smooth white skin of his hand and realized it didnt comfort just him doyle moved closer to me so that he was more obviously hugging me i leaned into the curve of his arm letting my body settle into the line of his while i continued to stroke the back of frosts hand i still see no reason for this line of questioning biggs said i agree farmer said if you have any more questions that are relevant to the actual charges we might entertain them cortez looked at me he gave me every ounce of those dark brown eyes the king thinks that the reason your fathers murderer was never caught is that the men investigating it were the murderers doyle frost and i went very still he had our attention now indeed he did speak plainly mr cortez i said king taranis accuses the raven guard of prince essuss murder you saw what the king did to the ambassador i think that level of fear and manipulation speaks for my uncles state of mind right now we will follow up on ambassador stevenss condition shelby said but doesnt it make sense that the reason no clues were found is that the men looking for the clues were hiding them our oath to the queen would forbid us to do harm to her family doyle said your oath is to protect the queen correct cortez asked we now belong to the princess but the oath remains the same yes king taranis alleges that you killed prince essus to keep him from killing queen andais and putting himself on the throne of the unseelie court the three of us stared at cortez and shelby this was laundry so dirty that the queen had tortured people who had merely hinted at such things i didnt ask if taranis had actually said it because i knew no one else at his court would have dared queen andaiss anger anyone less than the king himself and she would have called them out to a personal duel for such rumors andais had a lot of faults i knew that but she had loved her brother he had loved her too its why he hadnt killed her and taken the throne even though he felt that he would have been a better ruler if he had lived and my cousin prince cel had tried to take the throne my father might have killed cel to keep him off the throne cel was insane i think literally and a sexual sadist who made andais look mild my father had feared the unseelie court at the hands of cel i feared it now to save my life and the lives of those i loved and to keep cel off the throne were the reasons i was still trying to be queen but i wasnt pregnant and whoever got me pregnant would be king to my queen i had realized only a day or so ago that id have given up everything to be with frost and doyle including being queen but for one thing to keep these two men with me might require me to give up my birthright and i was too much my fathers daughter to let cel have our people but the regret in me was growing do you have a reply to the accusation princess meredith my aunt is not perfect but she loved her brother i believe that with all my heart if she discovered who killed him her wrath would be the stuff of nightmares none of her guard would have dared such a thing are you sure of that princess i think you might want to ask yourself mr cortez mr shelby what king taranis hopes to gain by this accusation in fact you might wonder what he might have gained from my fathers death are you accusing the king of your fathers murder shelby asked no i am simply saying that the seelie court has never been a friend of my fathers family whereas one of the queens guard killing my father would have earned them a death by torture i think if king taranis could have plausible deniability of the deed he would reward his own guard for it why would he kill prince essus i dont know do you believe he was behind the assassination veducci asked that fine mind was all there in those eyes i didnt until now what do you mean by that princess he asked i mean i cant see what the king hopes to gain by the accusation against my guard it makes no sense and it makes me wonder what his true motives are here he seeks to divide you from us frost said i looked at him studying that handsome arrogant face i knew now that the cold arrogance was his mask when he was nervous divide me from you how if he could plant such an ugly doubt in your mind would you ever trust us again i looked down at the table at his pale hand on mine my fingers against his skin no i wouldnt if you think about it frost continued the rape accusation is also meant to make you doubt us i nodded maybe but to what purpose i dont know unless he has taken leave of his senses at last doyle said he has a purpose to all of this but i confess that i do not see what it could gain him i do not like that we seem to be deep in a game and i do not know what we are playing doyle stopped talking and looked across the table at the lawyers forgive us please we forgot where we were for a moment do you believe that this is all some sort of inter court politics veducci asked yes doyle said veducci looked at frost lieutenant frost i agree with my captain last he looked at me princess meredith oh yes mr veducci whatever else we are doing it is most certainly inter court politics his treatment of ambassador stevens makes me begin to wonder if we are being used here veducci said are you saying mr veducci biggs said that you are beginning to doubt the validity of the charges made against my clients if i find out that your clients did what they are accused of i will do my best to punish them to the greatest extent that the law allows but if these charges turn out to be false and the king has tried to use the law to harm the innocent ill do my best to remind the king that in this country no one is supposed to be above the law veducci smiled again but this time it wasnt a happy smile it was more predatory that smile was enough i knew who i feared the most on the other side of the table veducci wasnt as ambitious as shelby and cortez but he was better he actually still believed in the law he actually still believed that the innocent should be spared and the guilty punished you didnt often see such pure faith in lawyers who had spent more than twenty years on the bar they had to give up their belief in the law to survive as a lawyer but somehow veducci had held on he believed and maybe just maybe he was beginning to believe us chapter we had adjourned to a different room the room was smaller than the conference room but then so were some singlefamily homes there was a huge mirror on one wall the glass of which held small imperfections bubbles near one corner the mirror had an almost smoky quality in a few spots its frame was gilt edged and worn with age it had belonged to the original mr biggss greatgrandmother we were here in mr biggss inner sanctum to make a phone call of sorts though no phones would be involved galen rhys and abeloec had had their turn at the questioning in the conference room they hadnt been able to do much but deny the charges abe had stood there with his perfectly striped hair black shades of gray white all perfectly even and artificial like some artful modern goth but it wasnt a good dye job it was real his pale skin and gray eyes matched the look he looked odd in his charcoalgray suit no amount of tailoring could make it look like the clothes he would have chosen himself he had been a party guy for centuries and his clothes usually reflected that abe had no alibi because hed been trying to crawl into a bottle with a drug chaser at the time of the accused attack hed been clean and sober only about two days but the sidhe cant truly be addicted to anything just as they cant truly drink or drug themselves into oblivion it was an upside downside the fey couldnt get addicted but they couldnt use liquor or drugs to hide from their problems either you could get us drunk but only up to a point galen looked cool and boyishly elegant in his brown suit they wouldnt let him wear his signature green because it brought out the green undertones in his white skin what they hadnt seemed to understand was that brown made the green undertone darker still and much more noticeable his green curls were cut short with only one thin braid to remind me that his hair had once fallen in a glorious sheet to his ankles he had the best alibi of the three because hed been having sex with me when the alleged attack took place once i would have described rhys as boyishly handsome but not today today he seemed every inch the grownup all of him he was the only one of the guards with me today who was less than six feet rhys was still handsome but hed lost some boyish quality or gained something else a man who was more than a thousand years old and had once been the god cromm cruach couldnt grow up could he if hed been human thats what i would have said that the events of the last few days had helped him grow up at last but it seemed arrogant to think that my little adventures could affect a being who had once been worshipped as a god his white hair curled over his shoulders and down the broad plane of his back he was the shortest of my sidhe guards but i knew that the body under the suit was the most muscled he took his workouts very seriously he wore an eye patch to cover the main scars from an injury hed received centuries ago the one eye he had left was lovely three circles of blue like lines of sky from different days of the year his mouth was soft and rich and one of the most pouting of the men as if his lips begged to be kissed i didnt know what had wrought this new seriousness in him but it gave him a new depth as if there was more to him than there had been only a few days ago he was the only one of the three who had been outside the faerie mound our sithen when the attack was supposed to have happened he had actually been attacked by seelie warriors and accused to his face of the crime they had come out into the winter snow hunting my men with steel and cold iron two of the only things that can truly injure a sidhe warrior most of the time even duels between the courts are fought with weapons that cant bring true injury true death to us its like one of those action movies where the men beat the hell out of each other but keep coming back for more steel and cold iron were killing weapons that alone had been a breach of the peace between the two courts the lawyers were arguing lady caitrin alleges that the attack took place on a day that my clients were actually in los angeles biggs said my clients cant have done something in illinois when they were in california all day on the day in question one of the accused was working for the grey detective agency and was in view of witnesses all day that would have been rhys he loved being detective for real he loved undercover work and had enough glamour to be even better at it than a human detective galen had enough glamour to do it too but he couldnt play the part undercover or decoy work was only partly looking right you also had to feel right to the person you were trying to catch id done my share of decoy work in years past now no one would allow me near the dangerous stuff so how had lady caitrins attack taken place before we got to faerie time had started running differently in faerie again time had started running very differently in the unseelie sithen around me doyle had said time is running oddly in all of faerie for the first time in centuries but it was running even more oddly around you meredith now that you have left faerie time is running oddly but no more oddly for one court than another it was both interesting and disturbing that time had run not exactly backward for me but it had stretched out it was january for us and the courts but the date still wasnt the same the postyule ball that my uncle taranis had been so insistent on me attending was finally safely past wed all decided it was too dangerous for me to attend the accusation against my guards confirmed that taranis was up to something but what taranis had a plan and whatever it was it would be dangerous to everyone but him king taranis has explained that time runs differently in faerie than it does in the real world shelby said i knew that taranis hadnt said the real world because to him the seelie court was the real world may i ask your clients a question veducci asked hed stayed out of the squabbling in fact this was one of the first times hed spoken since we had changed rooms it made me nervous you can ask it biggs said but ill decide if they answer it veducci gave a nod and pushed away from the wall where hed been leaning he smiled at us all only a hardness to his eyes let me know that the smile was a lie sergeant rhys were you in the lands of faerie on the date that lady caitrin accuses you of attacking her of allegedly attacking her biggs said veducci nodded at him were you in the lands of faerie on the date that lady caitrin alleges this attack took place it was nicely worded worded so that it was hard to dance around the truth without actually lying rhys smiled at him and i got a glimpse of that less serious side hed shown me most of my life i was in the lands of faerie when the alleged attack took place veducci asked the same question of galen galen looked more uncomfortable than rhys had but he answered yes i was abeloecs answer was simply yes farmer whispered to biggs and asked the next round of questions sergeant rhys were you here in los angeles on the date of the alleged attack the question proved that our lawyers still didnt quite understand the quandary of time in faerie no i was not biggs frowned but you were all day we have many witnesses rhys smiled at him but the day in los angeles was not the identical day as the day that lady caitrin accused us of this alleged attack it is the same date biggs insisted yes rhys said patiently but just because its the same date doesnt mean its the same day veducci was the only one smiling everyone else looked like they were thinking too hard or were wondering if rhys was crazy can you clarify that veducci asked still looking pleased this isnt like a sciencefiction story where we have traveled back in time to redo the same day rhys said we arent truly in two places at once for us mr veducci this day is truly a new day our doppelgängers are not in faerie reliving this day that day in faerie is past this day here in los angeles is a new day it happens to have the same date so outside of faerie it appears to be the same day repeated so you could have been in faerie on the day she was attacked veducci asked rhys smiled at him almost tsking on the day she was allegedly attacked yes this will be a nightmare for a jury nelson said wait until we get done demanding a jury of their peers farmer said smiling almost happily nelson paled under her tasteful makeup a jury of their peers she repeated softly could a human juror truly understand being in two places on the same date farmer asked the lawyers looked at each other only veducci didnt share in the confusion i think hed already thought of all of this technically his job description made him less powerful than shelby or cortez but he could help them hurt us of everyone on the opposing side veducci was the one i wanted to win over the most were here today to try to avoid this going to a jury biggs said if they attacked this woman then at the very least shelby said they must be confined to faerie you would have to prove their guilt before you could get a judge to meet out a punishment farmer said which leads us back to the fact that none of us really want this to go to court veduccis quiet voice fell into the room like a stone thrown into a flock of birds the other lawyers thoughts seemed to scatter like those birds flying up in confusion dont be giving our case away before weve even begun cortez said not sounding happy with his colleague this isnt a case cortez this is a disaster were trying to avert veducci said a disaster for whom them cortez said pointing at us for all of faerie potentially veducci said have you read your history about the last great humanfaerie war in europe not recently cortez said veducci looked around at the other lawyers am i the only one here who read up on this grover raised his hand i did veducci smiled at him as if he were his favorite person in the world tell these intelligent people how the last great war started it began as a dispute between the seelie and unseelie courts exactly veducci said and then spilled over all the british isles and part of the continent of europe are you saying that if we dont mediate these charges the courts will go to war nelson said there are only two things that thomas jefferson and his cabinet made unforgivable offenses for the fey on american soil veducci said they are never again to allow themselves to be worshipped as deities and they are never to have a war between the two courts if either of those things happen they will be kicked out of this the last country on earth that would have them we know all this shelby said but have you considered why jefferson made those two rules especially the one about war because it would be damaging to our country shelby said veducci shook his head there is still a crater on the european continent almost as wide as the widest part of the grand canyon that hole is what is left of where the last battle of the war was fought think about if that happened in the center of this country in the middle of our most productive farming country they looked at each other they hadnt thought about it to shelby and cortez it had been a highprofile case a chance to make new law involving the fey everyone had taken the short view except veducci and maybe grover what do you propose we do shelby asked just let them get away with it no not if they are guilty but i want everyone in this room to understand what might be at stake thats all veducci said you sound like youre on the side of the princess cortez said the princess didnt give a united states ambassador a bespelled watch so he would favor her how do we know the princess didnt do it to trick us shelby said he sounded like he even believed it veducci turned to me princess meredith did you give ambassador stevens any object magical or mundane that would sway his opinion of you and your court in your favor i smiled no i did not they really cant lie if you ask the questions right veducci said then how did lady caitrin accuse these men by name and description she seemed genuinely traumatized that is a problem veducci admitted the lady in question would have to be lying an outright lie because i asked the questions right and she was unshakable he looked at us at me do you understand what that means princess i took a deep breath and let it out slowly i think so it means that lady caitrin has everything to lose here if she is caught in an actual lie she could be cast out of faerie exile is considered worse than death to the seelie nobility not just the nobility rhys said the other guards nodded he is right doyle said even the lesser fey would do much to avoid exile so how is the lady lying veducci asked us galen spoke voice low a little uncertain could it be an illusion could someone have used glamour so strong that it fooled her you mean made her think she was being attacked when she wasnt nelson asked im not sure that would be possible on a member of the sidhe veducci said he looked at us what if it wasnt completely an illusion rhys said what do you mean i asked you make a tree by planting a stick in the ground you create a castle from the ruin of one he said it would be easier to do such a thing if you had something physical to build upon doyle said what could you build on for an attack galen asked doyle looked at him the look was eloquent but galen didnt understand it i got it first you mean the stories of our people appearing as dead warriors coming into the widows beds that kind of thing yes doyle said illusion used as a disguise very few in faerie have such power of illusion now frost said there might only be one in all of faerie who could pull it off galen said his green eyes were suddenly very serious you cant mean frost started to say then stopped we all thought it abe said that son of a bitch veducci spoke as if hed read our minds it made me wonder if without his protections from faerie magic id have read him as a psychic or more the king of light and illusion how good are his powers of illusion fuck shelby said you did not just say that you did not just give them reasonable doubt veducci smiled at us the princess and her men had reasonable doubt when they stepped into the room but they would never have accused the king out loud in front of us theyd have kept their secrets even from their lawyers i had an awful idea i moved toward veducci only doyles hand on my arm stopping me from touching the man he was right they might see that as magical interference mr veducci are you planning on accusing my uncle of this plot on the mirror call today i thought id leave that to your lawyers my skin was suddenly cold i felt the blood drain from my face veducci looked uncertain and almost reached out to me are you feeling all right princess im frightened for you for all of you and for us i said you do not understand taranis he has been absolute ruler of the seelie court for more than a thousand years that has led to an arrogance you cant even begin to imagine he pretends to be the jolly handsome king for you humans but he shows quite a different face to those of us in the unseelie court if you accuse him bluntly of this i do not know what he will do would he hurt us nelson asked no but he might use magic on you i replied he is the king of light and illusion i have stood in his presence just over a minor call and he has almost bespelled me i almost fell to his power and i am a princess of the unseelie court you are human if he truly wanted to bespell you he could that would be illegal shelby said he is a king with the power of life and death in his hands i said he doesnt think like a modern man no matter how much he apes it for the press i felt dizzy and someone brought me a chair doyle knelt beside me are you unwell meredith he whispered nelson asked are you all right princess meredith im tired and scared i said you have no idea what the last few days have been like and i darent tell you does it have anything to do with this case cortez asked i looked up at him you mean the reason that im tired and scared yes no it has nothing to do with these false accusations i reached for doyles hand make them understand that they must tread carefully with taranis doyle took my hand in his and said i will do my best my princess i smiled up at him i know you will frost came to the other side of me and touched my cheek you are pale even for one of us with moonlight skin you are pale abeloec came closer to me i had heard that the princess was human enough to catch colds i thought it was a nasty rumor you cant catch colds nelson asked they cant i said pressing my cheek against frosts hand and still holding on to doyle but i can i dont get them often but i can get them in my head i added the very first mortal faerie princess it was one of the reasons for all the assassination attempts on the unseelie court there were factions that believed that if i sat the throne i would contaminate all the immortals with the disease of mortality i would bring death to them all how do you argue against a rumor like that when they cant even catch a cold and i was about to talk to the most bright and shiny of them all king taranis lord of light and illusion goddess help me if he realized that i was coming down with some petty human illness it would just confirm for him how weak i was how human i was its almost time for the king to contact us veducci said looking at his watch if his time is running on schedule with ours cortez said veducci nodded true but may i suggest that we get some cold metal for the rest of you to carry cold metal nelson made it a question i think some of the office supplies of this fine law firm might just help the rest of you have clear vision when we deal with king taranis office supplies cortez said you mean like paper clips maybe veducci said he turned to me what do you think princess would a paper clip be helpful it depends on what its made out of but a handful of them might help we can test it for you rhys said how veducci said if it bothers us to touch it itll help you i thought it was only lesser fey that couldnt touch metal cortez said some of them can actually be burned by the touch of some metals but even the sidhe dont truly enjoy most manforged metal rhys said still with that smile burned just by touching metal nelson said we dont have time to discuss the wonders of the fey if were going to get those office supplies veducci said farmer hit the intercom and spoke to one of the many secretaries and personal assistants who had seemed to be in the offices outside he requested metal paper clips and staples i suggested box cutters pocket knives shelby grover and the other male assistant all had pocket knives you were pretty fascinated with the princess veducci said id add a handful of something else just in case i watched veducci hand out the office supplies hed taken charge and no one had questioned it he was supposed to be our enemy but he was helping us had he told the truth was he here for justice or was it a lie until i found out what taranis wanted i couldnt afford to trust anyone veducci came to stand in front of where i sat he nodded at doyle and frost who were still pressed to me one on each side may i offer the princess some extra metal to hold she is carrying metal as are we all the guns and swords we see them then veduccis eyes flicked to me are you saying the princess is armed i was actually i had a knife strapped to my thigh in a holder id worn before i had a gun at the small of my back in one of those new sideways holsters that were designed to be worn there we didnt actually expect me to use the gun for shooting but it was a way to carry a lot of metal steel and lead on me and not make it obvious to taranis hed see me wearing metal as an insult the guards could get away with it because they were guards they were supposed to be armed the princess is carrying what she needs to protect herself doyle said veducci did a little bow from the neck then ill put the office supplies back in the box trumpets sounded sweet and clear as if they rained music down upon us from some great height it was the sound of king taranis calling on the mirror he was being polite and waiting for someone to touch the mirror on our side the trumpets sounded again as we all stared at the blank mirror doyle and frost got me to my feet rhys came in at my side as if theyd discussed it beforehand doyle moved forward letting rhys take his place at my side rhys gave me a onearmed hug and whispered sorry to move your favorite out of his spot i turned and looked at him because jealousy was supposed to be a human emotion rhys let me see in his face that he knew that my heart had chosen even if my body hadnt he let me know that he knew how i felt about doyle and that it hurt him one look full of so much doyle touched the mirror and rhys whispered smile for the king i let the smile id practiced for years slide over my face the smile that was pleasant but not too happy it was a court smile a smile to hide behind and think thoughts that had nothing to do with smiles at all chapter the mirror filled with light shining golden sunlight until we all had to turn our eyes away or be blinded by the brilliance the brilliance of taranis king of light and illusion a mans voice i think it was shelbys spoke from the dimness of my closed eyelids what the hell is this the king boasting i said i shouldnt have said it but i wasnt feeling well and i was angry angry at having to be here at all angry and scared because i knew taranis well enough to be certain that the other shoe had not even begun to drop boasting a joyous male voice said this is not boasting meredith this is what i am hed used only my name and none of my titles it was an insult and we were going to let him get away with it but more surprising he hadnt announced himself formally he was being as informal as if we were talking privately it was almost as if to him the human lawyers didnt really count veduccis voice spoke out of the blinding light that had become the room king taranis ive spoken to you several times and never been so blinded by your light if you could have pity on us mere humans and dim your glory just a bit what think you of my glory meredith the joyous voice asked and the sound alone made me smile even as i squinted to save my eyes frost squeezed my hand and that touch of skin on skin helped me think taranis was not a power of flesh and sex to combat what he was so good at you had to use the magic you were good at just to be able to think in taraniss presence i reached for rhys until my hand found the bare skin of his neck and cheek the touch of both of them helped me think i think your glory is wondrous uncle taranis hed been familiar first using only my first name so i figured id try to remind him that i was his niece that i wasnt just some unseelie noblewoman to impress i wasnt too insulted except by his use of my first name he did the same kind of crap to queen andais the two of them had been trying to outmagic each other for centuries i had simply been dropped into the middle of a game that i had no hope of winning if andais herself could not shut down taraniss magic in a mirror call then my own much more humble abilities were outclassed my men and i had known that coming into this call i had hoped that with the lawyers present taranis might tone things down a bit apparently not uncle makes me sound old meredith taranis you must call me taranis his voice made it sound like we were old friends and he was so very happy to see me the voice alone made me want to say yes to anything and everything any other sidhe being caught using his voice and magic on another sidhe like this would lead to a duel or to being punished by their queen or king but he was the king and that meant that people didnt call him on it but id been forced to call him on something similar the last time id spoken with him like this could i afford to start out as rude as id ended the last time taranis then uncle could you please tone down your wonder so that we may all look upon you is the light hurting your eyes yes i said and there were other affirmatives from behind me the fullblooded humans must have been in real discomfort by now then i will dim my light for you meredith he made my name sound like a piece of candy on his tongue something sweet and thick and suckable frost drew my hand to his mouth and kissed my knuckles it helped me shake off the effect that taranis was trying hard to get from me hed done this last time a magical seduction so powerful it damn near hurt rhys snuggled closer to my side nuzzling along my neck he whispered hes not just trying to impress us all merry hes aiming straight at you i turned into his face even with my eyes still closed against the light he did this last time rhyss hand found the back of my hair turning my face toward his not exactly this merry hes trying harder to win you over rhys kissed me it was a gentle kiss i think more conscious of the red lipstick i was wearing than of any sense of decorum frost rubbed his thumb over my hand their touches kept me from sinking into taraniss voice and the pull of the light i felt doyle standing in front of me before i actually opened my eyes he kissed me on the forehead adding his touch to the others as if he already knew what taranis was doing he moved to my left and at first i didnt realize what he was doing then taraniss voice came not nearly as happy as hed sounded before meredith how dare you come before me with the monsters that attacked my lady standing there as if they had done no wrong why are they not in shackles his voice was still a good rich voice but it was just a voice even taranis couldnt make those words that outrage work with the warm seductive tone the light had dimmed some doyle was blocking some of my view and partially blocking rhys from the kings view but id seen this show before taranis was dimming the light so that it looked as if he were forming from the brilliance forming a face a body his clothes out of light itself biggs said my clients are innocent until proven guilty king taranis do you doubt the word of the nobles of the seelie court i didnt think the outrage was feigned this time im a lawyer your highness i doubt everything i think biggs meant it as humor but if he had he didnt know his audience taranis had no sense of humor that i was aware of oh he thought he was funny but no one else was allowed to be funnier than the king the last rumor from the seelie court was that even taraniss court jester had been imprisoned for impertinence id have complained more if andais hadnt slain her last court jester some four or five hundred years before was that meant to be humor the kings voice reverberated through the room like a roll of quiet thunder it was one of his names taranis thunderer once hed been a sky and storm god the romans had equated him with their own jupiter though his powers had never been as far reaching as jupiter apparently not biggs said trying to put a pleasant face on it taranis was finally revealed in the mirror he was edged with glow as if the colors of everything about him wavered his hair and beard were at least his true color the reds and orange of a spectacular sunset the locks of his curling hair were painted with the glory of the sky when the sun sinks to the west his eyes were truly multipetals of green jade grass shades of leaves it was as if a green flower had been substituted for the iris of his eyes as a small child before i knew that he disdained me id truly thought him handsome oh my god nelson said in a breathy voice i looked behind myself at her the wide eyes the almost slack face youve only seen the pictures of him pretending to be human havent you he had red hair and green eyes not this not this she said cortez her boss took her elbow and got her to a chair cortez was angry and was having trouble hiding it interesting reaction on his part taranis turned those greenpetaled eyes toward the woman few human women have seen me in all my glory in many years what do you think of me in my true form pretty girl i was pretty sure that you didnt get to be assistant district attorney in los angeles by letting men call you pretty girl but if nelson had a problem with it she didnt say so she looked besotted with him drunk with his attention abe came to join us in our huddled group galen trailed behind him looking puzzled it was abe who leaned in and whispered there is some magic here that is not merely light and illusion if it were almost anyone else i would say that he has added love magic to his bag of tricks doyle drew abe closer to us all and whispered a spell powerful enough that it is affecting ms nelson they all agreed we hadnt meant to ignore taranis but he was so terribly busy flirting with nelson that it was easy to forget that just because a king is ignoring you doesnt mean that you are allowed to ignore the king i did not come here to be insulted he said in that thundery voice once it would have impressed me but id been intimate with mistral he was a storm god too but one who could make lightning pour down a hallway inside the faerie mound taraniss rumbly voice just couldnt compare to mistral in fact as the men parted so that i could see my uncle more clearly he looked a little overdone like a man whos overdressed for a date i looked at the men clustered around me and realized that all of them had touched me rhys wrapped around my waist and side frost on the other side arm a little higher doyle with his strong dark hands on my face abe with his hand on my shoulder so he could lean in and not fall even sober his balance seemed shaky sometimes galen had touched me because he always touched me when he could it was as if id reached a critical mass of touch i could think i was no longer besotted like the good miss nelson once id thought that andais appearing on the mirror calls draped in men had a been a way to taunt and shock taranis and his court in only two mirror calls of my very own id learned that there was a method to her madness for me either five was the magic number or the mix of these five mens powers was what works either way it was going to be a different phone call than it would have been if taraniss spell had worked on me interesting meredith taranis called meredith look upon me i knew that there was power to that voice i felt it as one would sense the ocean whispering and close but i was no longer standing in the water i was no longer in danger of drowning in that voice i see you uncle taranis i see you very well i said and my voice was strong and firm and caused the arch of a perfect sunsetcolored eyebrow to raise i can barely see you through the crowd of your men he said there was a tone to his voice that i couldnt discern anxiety anger something unpleasant doyle galen and abe began to move away from me even frost started to pull away only rhys stayed wedded to my side the moment their hands fell away taranis was edged with light stay where you are my men i said i am your princess he is not your king the men hesitated doyle moved back to me first and the rest followed his lead i put his hand to my face and tried to tell him with my eyes what was happening the spell was aimed so surely at me like an arrow for my mind alone how could i explain to them without words what was happening rhys settled himself more firmly around my waist tucking me close leaving just enough room for frosts arm to slide back across my shoulders abe went to stand behind me placing a hand on my shoulder closest to rhys galen joined him and though clearly puzzled added his hand to my other shoulder closer to frost i gave the hand that wasnt wrapped around rhyss waist to doyle the moment they were all touching me even through clothing the light around the king was gone taranis was handsome but that was all meredith taranis said how can you insult me like this these men attacked a lady of my court savaged her yet you stand there with them touching you as if they are your court favorites but uncle they are some of my favorites meredith he said and he sounded shocked like an elderly relative who just heard you say fuck for the first time biggs and shelby both tried to move in and smooth things over i think the reason the lawyers hadnt interfered more before was that even the men were getting a side swipe of the spell that taranis had brought to this meeting either he had brought this magic for some specific purpose or he always held this magic when dealing with queen andais and now me i had not been able to sense it when we last spoke to taranis but then neither had doyle or any of the other men it wasnt just me who had grown in power from our few days in faerie the goddess had been a very busy deity we had all been changed by her touch and by the touch of her consort the god i will not speak of this matter in front of the monsters that savaged a woman of my court taraniss voice rolled through the room like the whisper of a storm the humans all reacted as if it were more than a whisper i was safe behind the hands of my men from whatever taranis was trying to do shelby turned to us i think its a reasonable request to have the three accused wait outside while we talk to the king no i said princess meredith shelby said youre being unreasonable mr shelby youre being magically manipulated i said smiling at him he frowned at me i dont understand what you mean by that i know you dont i said i turned to taranis what you are doing to them is illegal by human law the very law you have appealed to for aid i have not asked for human aid he said you accused my men under human law i petitioned queen andais for justice but she refused to acknowledge my right to judge her unseelie sidhe you rule the seelie court i said not the unseelie so your queen made clear to me so when queen andais denied your request at her court you turned to the humans i appealed to you meredith but you would not even answer my calls queen andais advised me against it and she is my queen and my fathers sister i heeded her advice it had actually been more of an order shed said that whatever evil taranis had planned i should avoid him when someone as powerful as andais says to avoid someone for fear of what they will do i listen i had not been so arrogant as to believe that taraniss entire purpose was to simply have me talk to him on a mirror call andais had not believed that it was his purpose either but now today i was beginning to wonder i could think of nothing i could offer him that would make this much effort worthwhile but now because of human law you must speak to me he said biggs said the princess agreed to this meeting out of courtesy she was not compelled to be here taraniss eyes never even moved to look at the lawyer but you are here now and you are more beautiful than i remember i was very lax in my attentions to you meredith i laughed and it was a harsh sound oh no uncle taranis i think you were quite thorough in your attentions to me almost more thorough than my mortal body could endure doyle rhys and frost all tensed against me i knew what they meant by it have a care dont give away court secrets in front of the humans but taranis had begun it dragging us out before the humans i was only following his lead will you never forget that one moment in your childhood you nearly beat me to death uncle i am not likely to forget it i did not understand how fragile your body was meredith or i would never have touched you so veducci recovered first saying is king taranis admitting that he beat you as a child princess i looked at my uncle so large so imposing so regal in his gold and white court clothes he is not denying it are you uncle taranis please meredith uncle seems so formal his voice was wheedling from the way nelson began to walk closer to the mirror i think the tone was meant to be seductive he is not denying it doyle said i am not speaking to you darkness taranis said and his voice tried to thunder again but as the seduction had not worked so now the threat fell flat as well king taranis biggs said are you admitting that you beat my client as a child taranis finally turned to him frowning biggs reacted as if the sun itself had smiled at him he actually stumbled in his speech and looked uncertain taranis said what i did years ago has no bearing on the crime that these monsters committed veducci turned to me how badly did he beat you princess meredith i remember how red my blood was on the white marble i said i looked at veducci as i spoke though i could feel taraniss magic pushing at me calling me to look at him i looked at veducci because i could and because i knew that it would unnerve the king if my gran my grandmother had not interfered i believe he would have beaten me to death you hold a grudge meredith i have apologized for my actions that day yes i said turning back to the mirror you have recently apologized for that beating why did he beat you veducci asked taranis roared that is not the business of humans hed beat me when id asked why maeve reed once the goddess conchenn had been exiled from his court she was the golden goddess of hollywood now and had been for fifty years we were all still living on her estate in holmby hills though the recent addition of so many men was beginning to tax even her space maeve had given us some new room by going to europe it was far enough away to stay out of taraniss way or that was the hope maeve had told us taraniss deep dark secret he had wanted to marry her after putting away a third wife for barrenness maeve had refused pointing out that the last wife hed put away had gone on to have children with someone else she dared to tell the king that it was he who was barren not the women a hundred years ago maeve had told him this but he had exiled her and forbidden anyone to speak to her because if his court found out that a century ago he had known that he might be barren and said nothing did nothing if the king is barren the people and land are barren he had condemned them to a slow death as a people they lived almost forever but no children meant that when they died there would be no more seelie sidhe if his court found out what he had done they were within our laws to demand a living sacrifice with taranis in the starring role he had twice tried to kill maeve with magic horrible spells that no seelie would admit to doing he had tried to kill her and not us even though he had to wonder if we knew his secret he feared our queen or perhaps he didnt think his court would believe anyone who was part of the unseelie court perhaps that was why maeve was the threat and not us if you abused the princess when she was a child that may affect this case veducci said i now regret my temper in that moment with this woman taranis said but my one thoughtless moment decades ago does not change the fact that the three unseelie sidhe before me did worse to the lady caitrin if there is a pattern of abuse between the princess and the king biggs said then his accusations against her lovers may have a motive behind them are you implying a romantic motive for the king cortez put a great deal of disdain in his voice as if it were laughable he wouldnt be the first man to beat a girl as a child then turn to sexual abuse as she grew older biggs said what did he accuse me of taranis asked mr biggs is trying to prove that you have romantic intentions toward the princess cortez said and i am telling him that this is not so romantic intentions taranis repeated slowly what does he mean by that do you have sexual or marital intentions toward princess meredith biggs asked i do not see what such a question has to do with the savage attack by those unseelie monsters on the beautiful lady caitrin all the men touching me tensed again or went very still even galen they had all realized that the king had not answered the question the sidhe only avoided answering a question for two reasons one sheer perversity and a love of word games taranis had no love of word games and was one of the least perverse of the sidhe two that the answer was something that they didnt want to admit to but the only answer taranis could possibly want to avoid was yes it couldnt be yes he couldnt have romantic designs on me he couldnt i looked up at doyle and frost i looked for a clue as to what to do did i ignore it or pursue it which was better which was worse cortez said though we have sympathy with the princess childhood tragedies we are here to investigate a new tragedy the attack by these three men on lady caitrin i looked at cortez he actually looked away from my gaze as if his statement sounded harsh even to his own ears you do understand that you are all being magically influenced by him i asked i think i would know if i were being influenced princess meredith cortez said the nature of magical manipulation veducci said coming forward is that you dont know its happening its why its so very illegal biggs faced the mirror are you using magic to manipulate the people in this room king taranis i am not trying to manipulate the entire room mr biggs taranis said may we ask a question doyle asked i will not speak to the monsters of the unseelie court taranis said captain doyle is not accused of any crime biggs said i realized that the lawyers on our side were having less trouble with taraniss magical presence than those on the other side except for veducci who seemed to be doing just fine the lawyers had entered into a agreement with taranis just a verbal one but that would be enough for someone of his power to have more of a hold over all of them it was the subtle magic of kingship if you agreed to be a true kings man there was power to that agreement taranis had once been chosen by faerie to be king and even now there was power to that old bargain they are all monsters taranis said he looked at me gave me all the longing those greenpetaled eyes could hold meredith meredith come to us before the power of the unseelie makes of you something horrible if i hadnt broken his spell on me earlier that appeal might have drawn me to him but i stood safe among my men and our power i have seen both courts uncle i found them both equally beautiful and horrible in their own ways how can you compare the light and joy of the golden court to the darkness and terror of the darkling throne i am probably the only sidhe noble in recent history who can compare them uncle taranis meredith please taranis i didnt like his insistence that i call him by name and not title in front of the unseelie he was always very aware of his title in fact he hadnt asked for all his appellations to be read it wasnt like him to forgo anything that built him up in the eyes of others very well uncle taranis the moment i said it there was more weight in the air it was harder to breathe hed joined his name to the spell of attraction so that every time i said his name it would bind me more tightly that was against the rules duels had been fought over less between the sidhe in any court but you did not challenge the king to a duel one he was king and two hed once been among the greatest warriors the sidhe could boast he might be diminished but i was mortal and id swallow any insult he tossed our way maybe hed counted on that doyle said we need a chair for our princess the lawyers brought a chair apologizing for not thinking of it sooner magic can do that make you forget what youre about make you forget the mundane things like chairs and that your legs get tired until you realize that your body hurts and that youve been ignoring it i sat down gratefully id have worn lower heels if id known id be standing this much there was some confusion as i sat so that for a moment not all my men were touching me taranis was edged with golden light then the men settled into their places and he was ordinary again all right taranis was as ordinary as he would ever be frost stayed standing at my back with his hand on my shoulder id expected doyle to take his place at my back as well but it was rhys who stood at my other shoulder doyle knelt on the floor beside me with one hand on my arm galen moved in front of me so that he sat tailorfashion at my feet leaning his back against my hosecovered legs one of his hands moved up and down my calf an idle gesture that would have been possessive in a human but might have simply been nerves in one of the fey abe knelt at my other side mirroring doyle well not exactly mirroring doyle had one hand on the pommel of his short sword his other hand quietly on mine abes hand gripped my other hand squeezing if hed been human id have said he was afraid then i realized that this might have been the first time since taranis cast him out that he had seen his exking abe had never been one of queen andaiss favorites so he wouldnt have been included on the mirror calls between courts i leaned over enough so i could lay my cheek against his hair abe looked up startled as if he hadnt expected me to return his gestures the queen was more for receiving than giving in everything but pain i gave his surprise a smile and tried to tell him with my eyes that i was sorry i hadnt thought what seeing the king might mean for him this day i must take part of the blame that you sit among them so happily meredith taranis said if you had only known the pleasure of a seelie sidhe you would never let them touch you again most of the sidhe around me now were once part of the seelie court i said simply leaving off his name i wanted to know whether if i ceased to say uncle he would try to get his name to pass my lips for some other madeup reason id felt the pull of magic when i said his name they have been nobles of the unseelie court for centuries meredith taranis said they have become twisted things but you have nothing to compare them to and that was a grave oversight on the part of the seelie i am most heartily sorry that we neglected you so i would make it up to you what do you mean they are twisted things i asked i thought i knew but id learned not to jump to conclusions when i dealt with either court lady caitrin has told of the horrors of their bodies none of the three of them are powerful enough in glamour to hide their true selves during intimacies biggs came to my side as if id asked the ladys statement is quite graphic and reads more like a horror movie than anything else i looked at doyle you read it i did he said he looked up at me his eyes still lost behind the dark glasses did the lady in question accuse them of being deformed i asked yes he said i had a thought the same way the ambassador saw you all doyle gave the smallest movement of the corner of his mouth hidden from the mirror i knew what that almost smile meant i was right and he thought i was on the right track okay if i was on the right track where was this little train going how deformed did the lady say they were in her statement i asked so much so that no human woman would survive an attack biggs said i frowned at him i dont understand it is the old wives tale doyle said that the unseelie have bone and spikes on their lower members oh i said but strangely that rumor had a basis the sluagh sholtos kingdom within our court had had nightflyers they looked like manta rays with tentacles that dangled but they could fly like bats they were the flying hounds of the sluaghs wild hunt a royal nightflyer carried a bony spine inside his member that stimulated ovulation in female nightflyers it also proved that you were of royal nightflyer heritage because only they could make the females give up their eggs so that they could be fertilized rape by a royal nightflyer might have given rise to the old faerie horror story sholtos father had been one of the nonroyals because his sidhe mother hadnt needed the spine to make her ovulate hed been a surprise baby in many ways he was gorgeously wonderfully sidhe except for some extra bits here and there mostly there king taranis i said and again his name pulled at me like a hand tugging for attention i took a deep breath and relaxed into the weight of rhys and frost at my back my hands on doyle and abe galen seemed to sense what was needed because he slid his arm between my calves so that he wrapped himself around one of my legs and forced both my legs apart a little wider so he could cuddle more tightly there were very few of my guards who would have been willing to look so submissive in front of taranis i valued the few who were more willing to be close to me than to keep up appearances i tried again king of light and illusion are you saying that my three guards are so monstrous that to lay with them is painful and horrible lady caitrin says that it is so he said he had settled back into his throne it was huge and golden and was the only thing that had not changed when his illusions were stripped away he sat on what would cost even today a kings ransom you said that my men could not maintain their illusion of beauty during intimacies is that correct the unseelie have not the power of illusion that the seelie possess he sat more comfortably on his throne legs spread as some men do as if to draw attention to their masculinity so when i make love to them i see them as they truly are you are part human meredith you do not have the power of a true sidhe i am sorry to say that but it is well known that your magic is weak they have fooled you meredith each time he said my name the air was a little thicker galens hand slid up my leg until he found the top of my thighhigh hose and could finally touch bare skin the touch made me close my eyes for a moment but it cleared my head once what taranis had said might have been true but my magic had grown i was no longer what i had been had no one told taranis it was not always wise to tell a king something he would not like taranis had treated me as lesser or worse all my life to discover that i might be the heir to his rival court would mean that his treatment of me had been worse than politically incorrect he had made me his enemy or so he might think he was far from the only noble in both courts to find themselves scrambling to make amends for a lifetime of ill treatment i know what i hold in my hand and in my body uncle you do not know the pleasures of the seelie court meredith much awaits you if only you could know it his voice was like the ringing of bells it was almost music on the very air nelson started walking toward the mirror again her face was full of wonder whatever she saw was not real i knew that now i have told the lawyers twice that you are bespelling them uncle but whatever you are doing to them makes them forget that you make them forget the truth uncle the men in the room seemed to take a deep collective breath i have missed something biggs said we all have veducci said he went to nelson who was standing in front of the mirror staring up as if the wonders of the universe were in that glass he touched her shoulder but she didnt react she just kept gazing up at the king veducci called back cortez help me with her cortez looked like hed been asleep and had woken up somewhere else what the hell is going on he asked king taranis is using magic against us all i thought the metal would protect us shelby said he is the king of the seelie court veducci said even the things im carrying arent enough protection i dont think a few office supplies are going to cut it today he put a hand on each of the womans shoulders and started pulling her back from the mirror he called back over his shoulder cortez concentrate help me with your assistant he yelled it and the shouting seemed to startle cortez he started forward still looking startled but he moved he did what veducci asked the two of them drew nelson back from the mirror she didnt fight them but her face stayed upturned to taraniss form as he sat above us all that was interesting i hadnt realized before that something about the mirrors perspective put him slightly higher than us of course he was on his throne in the actual throne room he was on a dais he was literally looking down on us the fact that i had only now realized that told me clearly that whatever spell he was throwing at me was having some effect i was at the very least not noticing the obvious you are breaking human law doyle said by using magic against them i will not speak to the monsters of the queens guard then speak to me uncle i said you are breaking the law by the magic you are casting you must stop it or this interview is over i swear by any oath you choose taranis said that i am not deliberately using magic on any fullblooded human in this room it was a pretty bit of lying so close to the truth that it wasnt a lie at all i laughed frost and abe started as if the sound hadnt been what they had expected oh uncle will you also take any oath of my choosing that you are not trying to bespell me he gave me every ounce of that handsome manly face but the beard sort of ruined it for me i wasnt a fan of facial hair but that could be because i grew up at andaiss court for whatever reason the queens wish that her men not have beards and such had become a reality most of them couldnt have grown a good beard if theyd wanted to sometimes the queens wish becomes reality in faerie id seen the truth of that old saying in faerie for myself i could police my words aloud but when my very thoughts could become real that had been terrifying i was glad to be out of faerie and back to a more solid reality where i could think what i liked and not have to worry about it becoming real i thought my own thoughts while taranis pushed at me with his face his eyes the fantastic color of his hair he pushed the spell hed conjured at me it was like a weight on the air a thickness on my tongue as if the very air was trying to become what he willed it he was in faerie and perhaps there at his court it would have worked exactly like that whatever he wanted from me i might have been forced to give him but i was in los angeles not in faerie and i was very glad to be here glad to be surrounded by manmade steel concrete and glass there were fey who would have suffered illness simply by stepping into such a building my human blood let me be unaffected my men were sidhe and that was also sterner stuff meredith meredith come to me he actually held his hand out to me as if he would reach through the mirror and fetch me some of the sidhe could do just that i didnt think taranis was one of them doyle stood wrapping one hand around mine but standing feet apart free hand loose at his side i knew that stance he was giving himself room to draw a weapon it would almost have to be a gun because i had the hand he would have needed for the sword at his side frost moved a little farther from the back of my chair his hand still loosely on my shoulder i didnt have to look at him to know that he was doing his own version of doyles preparations galen stood up which broke his contact with me taranis was suddenly edged with golden light his eyes glowed with all the heat of green growing things i started to rise from my chair rhyss hand pressed me down so that i couldnt move doyle said galen galen went back to one knee so he could touch my leg the touch was enough the glow faded and the compulsion to stand faded this is a problem i said abe leaned against my other arm causing his long striped hair to pool around the chair he laughed that warm masculine sound merry merry you need more men it seems to be a theme with you i smiled because he was too right they would never arrive in time frost said i called out biggs veducci shelby cortez all of you cortez had to stay with nelson to keep her in her chair so she didnt go to the mirror but the rest came to me meredith taranis said what are you doing getting help i said doyle motioned the men to stand between us and the mirror they formed a wall of suits and bodies it helped what in danus name was the spell i knew better than to invoke the name of the goddess i really did but i had had a lifetime of saying it like a human who says what in the name of god you dont really expect god to answer do you the room smelled of wild roses a wind eased through the room as if someone had opened a window though i knew no one had merry cool it rhys said softly i knew what he meant we had managed to keep some secrets from taranis about just how active the goddess was being for me in faerie this was the beginning of full manifestation if the goddess even a shadow of her appeared in this room taranis would know he would know that he needed to fear me we werent ready for that not yet i prayed silently goddess please save your power for later do you not give our secret away to this man the smell of flowers grew stronger for a moment but the wind began to die down then the smell began to fade like expensive perfume when the wearer leaves the room i felt a tension go out of the men around me the humans simply looked puzzled your perfume is amazing princess biggs said what is it well talk about cosmetics later mr biggs i said he looked embarrassed of course i am sorry there is something about you people that just makes a poor lawyer forget himself his words could be terribly true i was hoping that no one in this room discovered just how true they could be king of the seelie court you insult me and my court and through me my queen i said meredith his voice breathed through the room and caressed my skin as if it had fingers nelson whimpered stop it i yelled and there was an echo of power to my voice if you do not cease trying to bespell me i will have this mirror blanked and there will be no more talks they attacked a woman of my court they must be given over to us for punishment give us proof of the crimes uncle the word of a seelie noble is proof enough he said and now his voice didnt sound seductive it sounded angry but the word of an unseelie noble is worth nothing is that it i asked our histories speak for themselves he said i wished i could have afforded to have the lawyers to move so that i could see taranis but i did not dare with him blocked from my sight i could think i could be angry then you call me a liar is that it uncle not you meredith never you one of the men you accuse was with me when the lady caitrin claims he was raping he could not have been with her and with me at the same time she lies or she believes someone elses lie doyles hand tensed in mine he was right id said too much dammit but these word games were hard so many secrets to keep track of and so hard to decide who knew what and when to tell anyone anything meredith he said his voice pushing against me again almost like a touch meredith come to me to us nelson made a sound like a soft scream cortez said i cant hold her shelby went to help him and i could suddenly see the mirror i could see the tall imposing figure the sight was enough to add weight to his words so it was like a push meredith come to me he held his hand out to me and i knew i should take his hand knew it the hands and bodies of my men pressed on my shoulders arms and legs keeping me in my chair i hadnt meant to but i must have tried to rise i dont think i would have gone to taranis but but it was good that i had hands to hold me down nelson was screaming hes so beautiful so beautiful i have to go to him i have to go to him the womans struggles sent cortez and shelby crashing to the floor with her security doyles deep voice seemed to cut through the hysteria what biggs said blinking too rapidly call security doyle said send for help biggs nodded again too rapidly but he walked to the telephone on his desk taraniss voice came like something shining and hard as if words could be stones thrown against your skin mr biggs look upon me biggs hesitated his hand hovering over the phone keep her in her seat doyle said then he let me go to walk toward biggs he is a monster biggs taranis said do not let him touch you biggs turned wideeyed and stared at doyle he backed away hands up as if to ward off a blow oh my god he whispered whatever he saw when he looked at my handsome captain was not what was there veducci turned around from where he still stood in front of me he took something from his pants pocket and threw it at the mirror dust and bits of herbs hit the surface but they stuck to the glass as if it were water the dry bits floated there making small ripples on the supposedly solid surface in that moment i knew two things one that taranis could make the mirror a mode of travel between one place and another an ability most had lost two that he had truly meant come to me if i had gone to the mirror he could have pulled me through goddess help us biggs seemed to wake from the spell and grabbed the phone like he had a purpose they are monsters meredith taranis said they cannot bear the touch of sunlight how can anything that hides in the dark be ought but evil i shook my head your voice is only words now uncle my men stand in sunlight straight and proud the men in question looked at the king except for galen who looked at me it was a questioning look was i better now i nodded for him shared with him a smile id been giving him since i was fourteen taranis bellowed no you will not bed the green man and bring life to the darkness the goddess has touched you and we are the people of the goddess i fought to keep my face blank because that last comment could mean so many things did he already know that the chalice of the goddess had come to me or had rumor planted something else in his head the scent of roses was back galen whispered i smell apple blossoms each of the men smelled the scent they had smelled when the goddess had manifested for them she was not just one goddess but many she was the face of all that was female not merely a rose but all that grew upon the earth was in her scent doyle came back toward us is this wise meredith i dont know but i stood and they let their hands fall away from me i stood in front of my uncle alone with the men lined around me the lawyers had moved back frowning puzzled except for veducci who seemed to understand a great deal more than he should have we are all people of the goddess uncle i said the unseelie are the dark gods children there is no dark god among us i said we are not christians to people our underworld with terrors we are children of the earth and sky we are nature itself there is no evil in us only differences they have filled your head with lies he said truth is truth whether in sunlight or darkest night you cannot hide from the truth forever uncle where is the ambassador he will search their bodies and find the horrors that the lady said were there there was a wind in the room now a gentle breeze that held that first warmth of spring the scent of plants was mingling so that i could smell galens apple blossoms doyles scent of autumn oak leaves and deep forest and rhyss sweet cloying lily of the valley frosts was a taste like flavored ice and abes was honeyed mead the scents and tastes combined with the scent of wild roses i smell flowers nelson said her voice uncertain what do you smell uncle i asked i smell nothing but the corruption that stands behind you where is ambassador stevens he is being tended by a human wizard by now they will cleanse him of the spell you placed upon him more lies he said but there was something in his face that belied the strength of his protests i have bedded these men i know that their bodies hold no horrors you are part human meredith they have bewitched you the wind grew and pushed at the surface of the mirror with its bits of floating herbs like wind on water i watched the glass ripple what do you smell uncle i smell nothing but the stench of unseelie magic his voice was ugly with anger and something else i realized in that moment that taranis was mad id thought all his crimes had been arrogance but looking into his face my skin ran cold even with the goddesss touch taranis king of the seelie court was mad it was there in his eyes as if a curtain of sanity had lifted and you couldnt miss it there was something broken in his mind consort help us you are not yourself your majesty doyle said softly in his deep voice you are the dark and i am the light taranis raised his right hand palm outward i felt my guards move forward toward me they piled on top of me pressed me to the floor protecting me with their bodies i felt heat even through the flesh that protected me i heard a noises then nelson was screaming and the lawyers were yelling i spoke from the bottom of the pile with galen pressed tightly against me what is it whats happened more male voices from the far door security had arrived but what good were guns when someone could turn light itself into a weapon could you shoot through the mirror and hit anything on the other side you could shoot out the mirror but the bullet should stop at the glass taranis could hurt us could we hurt him other voices seemed to be coming from in front of us from the mirror i tried to peer around galens arm and the spill of abes long hair but i was trapped in the dimness of their bodies with the feel of more weight atop me so that i was trapped and useless until the fight was over i knew better than to order them off of me if they thought it was safe theyd move and get me out of the room until that moment they were offering their lives to shield mine once id been relieved to know that now some of them were as precious to me as my own life i had to know what was happening galen what is happening ive got two layers of hair in front of me im as blind as you are he said abe answered me taraniss guard is trying to calm him why did nelson scream i asked my voice was squeezed a little from the weight of everyone atop me i heard frosts voice yelling get her out i felt the movement before galen grabbed my arm and pulled me to my feet abe had my other arm and they were running for the far door running so fast they simply carried me between them taranis screamed behind me meredith meredith no they wont steal you from me light goldenbright burning light haloed behind us the heat hit our backs first i recognized rhyss voice yelling i heard running behind us but i knew that they would be too late unlike the movies you cant outrun light not even the sidhe are that fast chapter abe stumbled beside me almost jerked me down but galen swung me in his arms and sprinted for the door he moved in a blur of speed that left the room in streamers of color it was almost as if he didnt so much open the door and go through it but was moving so quickly that the door wasnt solid enough to stop us i wasnt sure if the door opened or not but we were on the other side of it he turned me in his arms so that he was carrying me like a child or a bride on her wedding night he moved down the hallway at a quick trot away from the door and the sound of battle inside i could order galen around more than most of the guard i thought about ordering him to stop but i wasnt certain what was happening what if stopping was the wrong thing to do what if the men i loved had given their lives to save me and my stopping here would make that sacrifice worthless it was one of those moments when i would have given almost anything not to be princess there were too many decisions too many moments like this where lose or win i would still lose he put me down but kept my hand as if he knew i might go back hed pressed the button to call the elevator i heard the machinery behind the doors whirring i couldnt leave i knew in that instant that when the doors opened i wouldnt get on i couldnt leave them i couldnt leave them not knowing who was hurt and how badly i stepped back pulling on galens hand he looked at me his green eyes a little wide his pulse still thudding against the side of his pale throat above the tie and collar the lawyers had made him wear i shook my head merry we have to go my job is to keep you safe i just shook my head and pulled on his hand i tried to pull him back toward the doors that had closed behind us or had not opened for us to go through i still couldnt remember the door opening the harder i thought about it the less i seemed to remember of that one moment it probably meant that galen had indeed taken us through the door impossible especially outside of faerie impossible but it had happened hadnt it the elevator doors opened galen stepped inside but i kept his arm stretched out because i did not step forward merry please he said please you cant go back i cant go forward either if i am to be queen then i have to stop running to be ruler of a faerie court means i must be a warrior too i must be able to fight he tried to pull me inside i put a hand on the wall to keep some leverage you are mortal he said you could die we could all die i said the sidhe are no longer immortal you know it and i know it he put a hand on the door that tried to close on him but were harder to kill than a human you injure like youre human merry i cant allow you to go back inside that room i had a moment to understand that somehow this was a deciding moment what kind of queen would i be you cannot allow galen i must rule or not rule i cannot have it both ways i pulled my hand free of his and he didnt fight me he just looked at me searched my face as if he didnt know me you really are going back and short of me throwing you over my shoulder i cant stop you can i no you cant i started walking back down the long hallway that we had just raced down galen fell into step beside me he unfastened the buttons of his jacket and took out the gun he was wearing he switched off the safety and chambered a round i reached behind my back to the nice little sideways holster and took out my own gun id replaced the lady smith that doyle had taken off of me in faerie once before he was mine it was the gun i was accustomed to and a popular backup gun for a lot of police officers mostly male strangely the original push for the gun had turned off a lot of women one of the colors the grip had come in had been pink but in black or steeled blue it was still a good gun and the one i was most used to i didnt draw my gun as smoothly as galen had but it was a new holster and a newish gun it would take practice to be smooth if taranis was mad i might get all the practice i needed chapter the far set of elevator doors opened and a security guard stepped out emergency medical techs rushed behind him with a wheeled gurney and medical bags two more emts with another gurney and more equipment followed them a second security guard brought up the rear the emts hesitated for a second as the security guard in the front pointed at the right door the door wed come out of of course my pulse was in my throat who was hurt and how badly one of the emts a woman saw our guns without thinking i pulled glamour around my hand so that it looked as if i held a small clutch purse the woman frowned shook her head and followed her partner galen whispered nice purse i glanced at his hand and saw a small bouquet of flowers it looked real even to me the security guard recognized us or at least me princess i cant let you go inside until weve secured the area police are on the way do your job i said i hadnt argued with him i hadnt lied but as soon as they went through the door id be right behind them theyd called emts and police what in danus name had happened in there the doors hushed closed behind the gurney galen and i just started walking toward the doors no discussion was necessary id made up my mind and he would follow my lead there were moments when that was exactly what i needed from my men galen opened the door and used his body to shield me just in case if the fighting had still been ongoing hed have shoved me back but i think we both believed that if the fighting was ongoing theyd have had the emts wait for the police not just let them inside galen hesitated for a moment i heard voices some panicked some calm all a little too loud abes voice saying goddess i wish i still drank a womans voice well give you something for the pain i pushed at galens back to let him know that i wanted to see he took a breath deep enough that it shuddered through his body then he moved inside the room and let me see what lay beyond one set of emts was clustered around abe where he lay on his stomach nearest the door theyd swept his long hair to one side exposing scorch marks on his back taraniss hand of power had burned through suit jacket and shirt to the skin underneath one of the bluesuited security guards came toward us you need to wait outside until the police come princess meredith biggs with his expensive suit singed on one sleeve said please princess we cant guarantee your safety i looked at the big mirror i heard taraniss screams in the distance but he wasnt visible he was screaming let me go im your king unhand me the seelie noble who stood front and center in the mirror was hugh belenus he was in fact sir hugh but didnt always insist on it like most of the seelie court he was also one of the officers of taraniss personal guard unlike the unseelie court all the guards at taraniss court were male even if you were a queen you didnt get female guards i had never realized before that hugh resembled the king in one way his long straight hair was the color of flames not sunset like taraniss but the color of moving flame red yellow and orange frost and rhys were standing in front of the mirror talking with hugh where was doyle he should have been with them i had to walk farther into the room to see past the milling lawyers and security guards until i found the second set of emts with a second injured figure on a gurney doyle lay on the gurney motionless there was something wrong with his clothing it was torn up as if great claws had raked it the world narrowed down as if the edges of the room were collapsing down down until all i could see clearly was him in that moment i didnt care about the mirror or hugh or that taranis had finally done something that he couldnt hide from the rest of the sidhe there was just that still dark form on the gurney and nothing else galen stayed with me his free hand on my arm i wasnt sure if he was guiding me or holding me back i stood beside the gurney staring down at the tall muscled form of my darkness doyle who had fought a thousand battles before i was born doyle who had seemed indestructible like his namesake you cannot kill the dark it is always with us his clothing wasnt torn it was burned like abes his black skin just didnt show the marks from a distance the way abes paler skin had but there were shallow burns across his upper chest and one shoulder and his face one half of his face was bandaged from forehead to nearly chin i knew that the fact that theyd tended his face first meant it was worse than his chest there was a bag of clear liquid on top of his body a flexible tube ran from it to his arm where there was tape and a syringe i looked at the two techs will he unless shock sets in its not lifethreatening one of them said then they were pushing him toward the doors but weve got to get him to the burn unit burn unit i repeated i felt slow and stupid weve got to go the other tech said and his voice was gentle as if he knew i was in shock rhys was beside me merry we need you at the mirror galen can go with them i shook my head rhys grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me away from doyle so i had to look into his face we need you to be our queen right now not doyles lover can you do that or are we on our own here anger was instant anger that made my blood run hot i started to say how dare you but just then taranis yelled how dare you touch your king i swallowed the words but couldnt keep the anger off my face merry im sorry im more sorry than i can say but we need you now my voice came tight warm but controlled very controlled call the house send one of the healers to the hospital or maybe both the healers i nodded the anger beginning to fade under the thought that i didnt know how bad doyle was hurt or abe both i said ill call them i promise but frost needs you at the mirror i nodded i understand rhys kissed me on the forehead i blinked up at him he got his cell phone out of his pocket i told galen go with them to the hospital my duty is you your duty is to go where your princess tells you to go now do it please galen theres no time he hesitated for a breath then he gave a nod that was almost a bow and trotted after the rapidly moving gurney i hadnt gotten to kiss doyle goodbye no it wasnt goodbye he was one of the sidhe the greatest magicians and warriors that faerie had ever known he would not die from burns not even magical ones i believed my own words in the front of my head but the back of the mind is a cluttered dark place that has nothing to do with logic and everything to do with fear i made myself start walking toward frosts tall figure one step at a time i realized i had the gun still naked in my hand the glamour hid it but my concentration was bad did i want the seelie to see the gun did i care no should i care probably i moved my jacket aside to put the gun back in its holster i had to stop walking to do it but i put it away one of the main reasons i did it was because if taranis managed to break free of his men and come back to the mirror i didnt trust myself not to use the gun that i knew would be bad no matter how momentarily satisfying it might be i was a princess trying to be a queen and that meant i couldnt indulge in fits of temper they were too costly as todays little disaster had proven damn taranis damn him for not stepping down years ago i took a deep breath that shook around the edges my stomach rolled with all the emotions i couldnt afford right now i walked toward frost and the mirror and sir hugh i prayed to the goddess that i wouldnt fall apart in front of the seelie andais had temper tantrums that were infamous now taranis had shown himself to be even more unstable i walked to the mirror and prayed that i would be the ruler we needed right now i prayed that i wouldnt fall apart or throw up nerves just nerves please goddess let doyle be all right once i said the prayer i truly meant i felt calmer yes i wanted to be a good queen yes i wanted to show the seelie that i wasnt as crazy as my aunt and uncle but truly none of it mattered to me as much as the man theyd just carted away on a gurney it wasnt the way a queen thought it was the way a woman thought and to be queen means you have to be queen first and everything else second my father had taught me that taught me that before an assassin had killed him i pushed the thought away and went to stand by my killing frost i would be the queen that my father had raised me to be i would not embarrass doyle by being less than hed told me i could be i stood straight drawing myself up to every inch of height that i had the threeinch heels helped although standing beside frosts tall figure i couldnt help but seem delicate but i stood there and did my duty and it tasted like ashes in my mouth chapter sir hugh belenus gave a low bow that showed that his firecolored hair had started the day in a complicated braid but singed ribbons trailed from its remnants when he stood up i could see that the front of his tunic all the way through two layers of undershirts had been blasted apart to expose the pale golden skin underneath the clothing was ruined scorched but his body seemed untouched sir hugh stood in front of taranis at the end frost said he took the brunt of the blow meant for abeloec frost said what am i to say to that i asked and my voice sounded completely normal the very normality of it was almost shocking a little voice in my own head thought how can i sound so calm training shock if sir hugh were not one of the elder sidhe you could thank him for risking himself to save our warriors frost said i looked up at the tall man beside me i stared all the way up to those gray eyes and found that they reflected a bare tree in a winter landscape like a tiny snow globe caught in his eyes only his own magic or anxiety would fill his eyes with that image always before it had dizzied me to stare into frosts eyes when they filled with that other place today it seemed cool calming today he had the icy strength of winter in his eyes a coldness that protected you kept your emotions from eating you alive i understood in that moment part of what had let frost survive the queens petty torments he had embraced the coldness inside i touched his arm and the world was a little steadier there was something moving in the landscape of his eyes something white and horned i had a glimpse of a white stag before frost bent to kiss me it was a chaste kiss but that one gentle touch let me know that he understood what the calmness cost me that kiss let me know that he understood what doyle meant to me and what he meant to me and what he did not i turned back to the mirror with frosts hand in mine sir hugh said i saw a vision in the sunlight a white stag it walked ghostlike just behind the two of you how long has it been since you saw such a vision frost asked hugh blinked black eyes at me but there were orange sparks and swirls in that blackness like the ashes of a fire long banked a long time you dont seem surprised at your vision sir hugh i said there are swans in the lake near the seelie mound swans with gold chains around their necks they flew above us for the first time ever in this country the night of your battle with the wild hunt rhyss voice came casually from behind us have a care what you say hugh we have lawyers present rhys came to stand on my other side but made no move to take my other hand yes our king has chosen a most regrettable moment to show this side of himself regrettable moment i said and didnt try to keep the sarcasm out of my voice such mild words for what has just happened i cannot afford anything but mild words princess hugh said this insult to us cannot go unanswered i said voice still calm if i were speaking to the queen of air and darkness i would worry about a war or perhaps a personal challenge between monarchs but i have heard that princess meredith nicessus is a more temperate creature than her aunt or even her uncle a temperate creature i said temperate woman then hugh said and gave another low bow no insult was meant in my choice of words princess i beg you not to take offense i will do my best not to take offense except where it is given i said hugh stood and his handsome face with its small neat beard and mustache fought to not look worried hugh had been a god of fire once and that was not a temperate creature many of the elemental deities seemed to take on the aspects of their elements i had seen that intimately with mistral once a god of storms and i hugh said will endeavor not to give offense nelsons voice came from behind us how can you be so calm didnt you see what just happened they took your lovers out on stretchers her voice held an edge of hysteria that promised to get worse i heard soothing male voices but didnt try and catch the words as long as they kept her quiet and away from me i no longer cared there would be no charges brought against my men for the supposed attack on lady caitrin because if the seelie played hardball we could bury them with what taranis had just done and we had some of the top lawyers in the country as our witnesses if doyle and abe hadnt gotten hurt it would have been a lovely thing the far doors opened and more emts came through the police were here i had no idea what had taken them so long to arrive but maybe my sense of time had been affected shock can do that it wouldnt even do me any good to look at a clock because i hadnt looked at one before for all i knew only minutes had passed it may have just seemed longer what are we to do about this incident sir hugh i asked there is no way to keep it quiet he said too many humans know more will find out when your men reach the hospital it will be the greatest scandal the seelie court has had in this country your king will deny that he did this i said he will try and blame us somehow he has not tried his rather human version of the truth since you helped release the wild magic princess meredith what does that mean exactly sir hugh i asked it means as much as i dare about my opinion of my king it means that when you released the wild magic it awakened some he seemed to search for a word certain things things that do not take well to oathbreakers or other things he frowned as if even he wasnt happy with what hed just said oathbreakers and liars fear the wild hunt frost said i did not say that hugh said i havent heard this much verbal tapdancing from a seelie noble in a long time rhys said hugh smiled at him you havent been at court in a long time did you know what taranis was doing i asked we had suspicions that the king was not himself so polite i said so mild but accurate hugh said what else has happened for you to be so cautious firelord rhys asked i think that is a conversation for a more private audience pale lord i cant argue with that rhys said i was beginning to get the feeling that rhys and hugh knew each other better than id realized what do we do about this day and this moment i asked i am but a humble lord of the sidhe hugh said i do not carry the blood of the royal line in my body what does that mean i asked it means that the humans arent the only ones who have laws hugh stared at me with his blackandorange eyes he seemed to be trying to tell me something without saying it out loud the seelie would never go for it rhys said go for what i asked looking from one to the other the king lost his temper with one of the serving wenches hugh said a huge green dog appeared between him and the target of his anger a cu sith i said yes a cu sith after all these long years a green dog of faerie is among us again and protects those who need protecting it would not allow the king to strike the serving girl she seemed more terrified that he would blame her for the dog but the king lost his anger in the face of the great dog i remembered the dog from the night of the wild hunt the night when wild magic had been everywhere huge black dogs had appeared and when some touched them they had changed to other dogs dogs out of legend and a cu sith had run out into the night toward the seelie court i would be interested to see whose hand the cu sith would call master or mistress i said if we invoke this law rhys said it will be civil war in your own court hugh perhaps it is time for a little civil disobedience hugh said what law i asked rhys turned to me if the monarch is unfit to rule the nobles of the court can vote him or her incompetent they can force him or her to step down andais abolished the rule in her court but taranis never bothered he was too confident that his court loved him so youre saying what i asked that hugh force a vote among the nobles and they choose a new king it had possibilities depending on whom they chose not exactly merry rhys said is she always this humble hugh asked often rhys said what i asked frost said the seelie nobles will never accept her you dont know what has been happening here since she unlocked the magic i think the vote may go in her favor the vote go in my favor i finally caught on oh no you arent serious yes princess meredith if you will agree to accept it i will endeavor to make you our queen i just stared at him i tried to gather my wits my training at court and all i could manage to say was how sure are you that this will work sure enough to speak of it that means very sure rhys said i dont believe the seelie will accept me as their queen hugh but i know that before such a thing goes forward we must speak to our queen speak to andais if you must but whatever you are to the unseelie you have brought back the old magic to the outside of the hill inside we are still dead and dying but our spies tell us that your faerie mound grows lives even the mound of the sluagh is alive once more king sholto brags of your magic princess king sholto of the sluagh is a kind man hugh laughed an abrupt surprised sound kind the king of the sluagh the nightmares of all faerie and you call him kind i find him so i said hugh nodded kindness it is not an emotion we have had in this court in years i for one would like more of it i understand that rhys said hugh looked off to one side of the mirror where we could not see i must go talk to your queen but when the rest of the nobles know what taranis did to lady caitrin and that other nobles helped him the vote will go against him did he get the lady to lie or did he bespell her too rhys asked he used his illusions to make three of our nobles appear as the three of you but he made them monstrous with projections and spines and hugh shivered her body was quite broken she is even now still confined to her bed even with our healers he looked at me if you have need of healers for your men but ask and it will be yours we will ask if we need them i said and i fought the urge to say thank you because hugh was old enough to be offended by it what did the king hope to gain by such evil frost asked we arent certain hugh said but we can prove that he did it and lied about it and that the nobles involved lied as well it is an abuse of magic that has almost no precedent among us and you can prove it rhys asked we can he looked off to the side again he turned back to us but there was a look of concern on his face i must go talk to your queen be ready he gestured and we were looking at our own reflections this smacks of court intrigue frost said i watched rhys and myself both nod solemnly in the mirror neither of us looked very happy veducci came up behind us you have been given amazing news princess meredith why dont you look happier i answered his reflection rather than turning around it has been my experience that court intrigue usually ends badly the seelie court has treated me worse than the unseelie court all of my life i do not believe that a few new magics will make me queen of a people who despise me if by some miracle it happens as sir hugh has stated then i will have two sets of assassins to deal with instead of one as soon as i said it i knew i shouldnt have my only excuse was the total shock of what had just happened rhys spoke quickly i assume the charges against me and my friends are dropped veducci turned to him if what sir hugh has just said is true then yes but until the lady herself drops the charges they dont go away even with what hugh just said frost asked as you pointed out court intrigue can get ugly people lie the sidhe do not lie i said veducci stared hard at me have there been assassination attempts on your life other than the one that happened at the airport where you were shot at she cant answer that without talking to queen andais rhys said he put his arm across my shoulders frost did not give up my hand so i stood pressed to both of them i couldnt tell if rhyss gesture was to reassure me or himself it had been one of those days when we all needed a hug you do realize that is an answer veducci asked what kind of lawyer knows to carry just the right herbs in his pocket to disrupt such a spell i said i dont know what you mean he said with a smile liar i whispered it because i heard steps behind us biggs and shelby were there biggss suit jacket was gone his shirtsleeve was rolled back and there was a bandage on his arm i think king taraniss actions today put his accusations against my clients in serious doubt we cant say yes to that without talking to some shelby stopped cleared his throat and tried again well get back to you he gathered his assistant and went for the door the nice young woman who fixed up my arm says i have to ride with them to the hospital biggs said my assistant will take you to a room where you can rest and gather yourselves before you have to leave thank you mr biggs i said i am sorry that the hospitality of faerie was not up to its usual standards he laughed that is the most polite way i have ever heard anyone apologize for such a fucking mess he raised his injured arm a little it was hard on me and on your men but if your uncle the king had to choose a moment to have his meltdown this wasnt a bad time for it it certainly hurt his case and helped ours i suppose thats one way of looking at it i said rhys hugged me bumping his cheek against my hair cheer up sweets we won no the seelie came to the rescue and saved our asses i said the female emt came to touch biggss shoulder were ready to go nelson was strapped to a gurney and looked unconscious cortez was beside her looking more annoyed than worried did ms nelson get burned too i asked biggs opened his mouth to answer but the med techs made him go with them veducci answered me she seems to be having an adverse reaction to the spell that the king put on you the look he gave me was entirely too knowledgeable he knew magic he wasnt a registered practitioner but that didnt mean anything a lot of humans who had psychic ability chose not to use it as a job a look like that used to get a question rhys said what question would that be veducci asked which eye can you see me with rhys said i tensed beside him because i knew how this story always ended veducci grinned the answer youre supposed to give is neither the truth is both eyes frost said and his voice was way too solemn for comfort veduccis grin faded around the edges none of you are trying to hide what you are everyone can see you cheer up veducci rhys said the days when we used to put your eye out for seeing the wee folk are long past the sidhe never held with that if you could see us the biggest danger from the sidhe was abduction we were always intrigued with the humans who could see faerie rhyss voice was light and teasing but there was an edge of seriousness to it that made veducci look wary was i missing part of this conversation maybe did i care a little but id care more after i got to the hospital and checked on doyle and abe you can all be mysterious later i said i want to go check on doyle and abe now veducci reached into his jacket pocket and held something out to me i thought you might want these it was doyles sunglasses one side of them was melted as if some hot giant hand had crushed them into melted wax my stomach fell into my shoes then back up to my throat i thought for a second that id throw up then my head thought i just might faint i hadnt seen doyles face underneath the bandages how bad was it do you need to sit down princess veducci asked and he was all solicitous he actually moved to take my arm as if i wasnt already standing between two strong arms frost moved so that the lawyer couldnt touch me we have her veducci took a step back i see that he gave a small bow and went back to the security guards who were talking to the police a uniformed officer was waiting for us i need to ask you a few questions he said can you ask them on the way to the hospital i need to check on my men he hesitated do you need a ride to the hospital princess meredith i glanced at the clock behind the desk wed been driven here by maeve reeds driver in her limo hed planned on doing some errands for ms reed then coming back to pick us up in about three hours or at least check on us surprisingly it hadnt been three hours yet a ride would be lovely thank you officer i said chapter doyle and abe had a room to themselves in the hospital though when we hit the door with our nice escort of uniformed officers it was hard to tell who belonged in the room and who didnt there was a crowd of my other guards and medical staff way more medical staff than needed to be here and predominantly female and why did the uniforms who drove us come inside apparently the police were a little fuzzy on whether the attacks on my guards was another attempt on my life better safe than sorry they seemed to think seeing the number of men rhys had ordered to meet us at the hospital apparently he had thought the same thing abe was on his stomach trying to talk to all the pretty nurses he was in pain but he was still who and what hed always been he had once been the god accasbel the physical embodiment of the cup of intoxication it could make you a queen it could inspire poetry bravery or madness so the legends said hed opened the first pub in ireland and was the original party boy if he hadnt been wincing every so often i might have said he was having a good time instead he might just be putting on a brave face or he might be enjoying the attention i still didnt understand abe well enough to guess i had to weave my way through the crowd of my own lovely guards on most days i might have noticed them but today they were just blocking my view of the one guard i wanted to see some of them tried to speak to me but when i answered no one they finally seemed to understand they parted like a curtain of flesh and i could finally see the other bed doyle lay terribly still there was an iv hooked up to one arm feeding him clear fluid there was a small drip with knobs which probably meant that some of the clear liquid was painkiller burns hurt halfwen stood tall and blond and beautiful beside his bed she wore a dress that had been in style in the s or earlier a plain sheath that clung in all the right places but was short enough at the ankles to give her room to move when id met her shed been in armor a guard in my cousin cels service hed forced her to kill things for him and forbade her to use her amazing healing gifts because she refused his bed true healers were rare among the sidhe now and even the queen had been shocked at the waste of halfwens talents shed been one of the female guards who had left cels service to join me in exile queen andais was also shocked i think at the number of female guards who chose exile over staying to serve cel i wasnt shocked cel had come out of his months of imprisonment crazier and more sadistic than when hed gone in hed been put away for trying to kill me among other things his freedom had been the deciding factor of me going back into exile the queen admitted in private that she could not guarantee my safety around her son halfwen and others had come west with tales of what cel did to the first female guard he took to his bed it was the stuff of serial killers except she was sidhe and she would heal she would survive survive to be his victim again and again and again at last count i had a dozen female volunteers a dozen in a months time there would be more because cel was insane and the women had a choice now andais hadnt understood how so many of them could prefer exile to cels attentions but then the queen had always overestimated his charms and underestimated his repulsiveness dont let me mislead you prince cel was as handsome as most of the unseelie sidhe but pretty is as pretty does and what he did was ugly i stood by doyles side but he didnt know i was there if i still had the wild magic of faerie at my command i could have healed him in an instant but the magic had spilled out into the autumn night and done wonders and miracles and was still working them in faerie however we werent in faerie we were in los angeles in a building built of metal and manmade things some magics would not even work in such a place halfwen i said why have you not tried to heal him a doctor short enough that he had to look up at halfwen but could look down at me said i cannot allow the use of magic on my patient i looked at him gave him the fullon stare with the triple irises some humans if theyve never had to meet our eyes are bothered by it it can be a help in negotiations or persuading why can you not i read his nameplate dr sang because it is magic that i do not understand and if i do not understand a treatment i cannot authorize it so if you understood youd stop interfering i said i am not interfering princess meredith you are this is a hospital not a royal bedchamber your men are disrupting the operation of this hospital by their very presence i smiled at him and felt my eyes stay cool and untouched by it my men have done nothing it is your staff that is failing i thought all the hospitals in the area had been briefed about what to do if one of us was brought in didnt they tell you what to wear or carry to help the staff function the fact that your men are using active glamour to bespell our nurses and female doctors is an insult dr sang said galen spoke from the other side of the room he was slumped down in one of two chairs ive told him over and over that we arent doing anything it isnt active glamour but he wont believe me he looked tired a tightness around his eyes and mouth that i hadnt noticed before the sidhe dont age really but there are signs of wear the way a diamond can be cut by the right kind of blade i do not have time to explain to you but i wont allow you to stand between my people and my healers i said she admits he motioned at halfwen that her powers are not at full strength outside of faerie shes not certain she can heal him the more often his bandages are opened especially with this many people here the greater the chances that hell get a secondary infection dr sang said the sidhe do not get infections doctor i said forgive me if im a little skeptical about that princess but this man is my patient dr sang said i am responsible for him no doctor he is mine he is my darkness my right hand he would see himself as responsible for me but i am trying to be his queen which makes me responsible for all my people i reached out to touch his hair but drew back i did not want to wake him if all we could offer was pain for the healing we would disturb him but simply because i could not bear to be so close and not touch him was not reason enough to wake him from the sleep that the drugs and shock had given him my hand ached to touch him but i forced my hand into a fist at my side rhyss hand wrapped around my fist i looked into his single triblue eye his handsome face with the scars that had taken his other eye only partially hidden by the white patch hed worn today id never known rhys any other way the face that rose above me when we made love or looked up at me from the bed was this face scars and all it was simply rhys i touched his cheek would i love doyle less if he was scarred no though it would be a loss for both of us it would mean that the face i had grown to love would be forever changed but dammit he was sidhe a simple burn shouldnt have damaged him like this as if rhys read some of my thoughts he said he will live i nodded but i want him healed what about me abe called from the other bed and as so often he sounded vaguely drunk it was almost as if hed spent so many years inebriated that he fell back into the behavior of it a dry drunk i think they called it as if even without the drink and drugs he wasnt entirely sober i want you healed as well i said of course i do but abe knew where he stood in my affections and he wasnt in my top five he was okay with that he like many of the guards who had only been with us a few weeks was just so happy to be having sex again that he hadnt had time to get his ego bruised by the competition i really must insist princess that you and all your men leave dr sang said the uniformed officer officer brewer said sorry doctor but more guards is okay with us are you saying that these men may be attacked inside the hospital itself he asked officer brewer looked at his partner officer kent kent the taller of the two just shrugged i think theyd been told to stay near me but not what to tell civilians wed stopped counting as civilians to an extent when we were attacked now we were in a different category for the police potential victims maybe dr sang frost said i am in command of the princess guard until my captain tells me otherwise my captain lies here he motioned toward doyle you may be in charge of the guard but you are not in charge of this hospital the doctor didnt even come up to frosts collarbone he had to tilt his head back at an extreme angle to look the taller man in the face but he did it and he gave him a look that clearly said that he wasnt backing down we do not have time for this princess hafwen said i looked into her tricolored eyes a ring of blue silver and an inner ring of lights as if light could be a color what do you mean we are outside faerie that limits me as a healer we stand in a building of metal and glass a manmade structure that also limits my powers the longer the injury stays untended the harder it will be for me to do anything for it i turned to dr sang you heard her doctor you need to let my healer do her job i could remove him from the room frost said im not sure we can allow that officer brewer said sounding uncertain how would you remove him officer kent asked good question officer brewer said we cant really condone violence against the doctors we dont need violence rhys said he nuzzled my ear playing with my hair that one small touch made me shiver a little i turned so i could see his face more clearly wouldnt that be unethical too i asked do you really want doyle to look like me i know he doesnt want to lose an eye it plays hell with your depth perception he smiled and tried to make it a joke but there was a bitterness to it that no smile could hide i kissed the bow of his mouth he had one of the most beautiful mouths of all the men pouting and full it softened the boyish handsomeness of his face into something more sensual he pushed me away toward the doctor the doctor doesnt understand and we dont have time to talk it to death merry um officer brewer said what are you planning to do princess meredith i mean he looked at his partner it was obvious that they felt out of their depth truthfully i was surprised that there werent more police here already there were uniforms at the door but no detectives no higher echelon it was almost as if the top brass was afraid of us right now not afraid of the danger they were police it was what they did but afraid of the politics by now the rumors had spread goddess knew that king taranis attacking princess meredith was juicy enough but stories have a tendency to grow in the telling who knew what the police had been told by now this case wasnt just a hot one it was a potential career killer think about it letting princess meredith get killed or having king taranis injured on your watch either way you were screwed doctor sang i said he turned to me still frowning angrily i dont care how many policemen back you on this there are too many people in this room for effective treatment i closed my eyes and let out a breath most humans have to do something to conjure magic i spent most of my life shielding so i didnt perform magic by accident before my hands of power had come to me just months ago i spent time trying not to be distracted by passing spirits small everyday wonders now all the practice keeping things out helped me keep things in because my natural talents as maybe my genetic heritage had been kicked up a notch along with everything else rhys said stand back boys the men moved back and moved the two police officers with them they gave the doctor and me a small circle of space he glanced at them eyes puzzled whats going on i raised a hand to touch his face but he grabbed my wrist to keep me from doing it the problem for him was that i didnt need to touch him him touching me was just fine his eyes widened a look of near terror transfixed his face he wasnt looking at me but somewhere deep inside himself i was trying to be gentle to use just enough and no more of the seelie side of my nature but fertility magic is sometimes an unpredictable thing and i was nervous dr sang whispered oh my god goddess i whispered and leaned in toward him i drew him away from the beds away from halfwen i never touched him only drew my arm away his own grip on my wrist drew him with me i touched his face with my free hand i hadnt thought about what lay on that hand inside faerie the queens ring as it had come to be called was magical in the human world it was an ancient piece of metal so old that the metal was soft the ring was worn into an odd shape from centuries of being on the hand of one woman or another andais had admitted that she had taken it from the hand of a seelie whom she had killed in a duel a fertility goddess i think andais had taken the ring because she hoped it would aid the fertility of her own court but she was a power of war and destruction she was carrion crow and raven the ring was not at its best with her she had given it to me to show her favor to prove that she had indeed chosen her hated niece as a potential heir but my power was not the battlefield and death i touched the mans face with that old metal and it flared to life for a second i thought it would tell me if he was fertile the way it could with the men of our court but that wasnt what the ring wanted from dr sang i saw what he loved he loved his job he loved being a doctor it consumed him i also saw a woman delicate with shoulderlength black hair shining in the sunlight from large windows that looked out on the street she was surrounded by flowers she may have worked there she smiled at a customer but it was all silent as if the sound didnt matter i saw her face brighten like the sky after rain when the sun breaks through as she looked up and saw dr sang come through the door the ring knew that the woman loved him i saw two yards that bordered each other here in los angeles i saw younger versions of the two of them theyd grown up together theyd even dated in high school but he loved medicine more than any woman she loves you i said his voice came strangled how are you doing that you see it too then i said voice soft yes he whispered dont you want children a family i saw her standing in the shop again she was staring out at the passing tourists she held a cup of tea with both hands two shadowy figures hovered around her one boy one girl what is that he asked voice so full of emotion that he sounded in pain the children you would have with her are they real he whispered they are but they will only be flesh if you love her i cant the phantom boy by her side turned and seemed to look directly at us it was unnerving even to me the doctor trembled under my hand stop it he said stop it i drew my hand away from him but he still had his own hand on my wrist you must let me go i said he looked at his hand as if he hadnt known that it was there he released me his eyes were almost panicked he looked behind me at doyle and said get away from him one of the female doctors said dr sang its a miracle he can use his eye again he went to join the other nurses and doctors hovering around doyles bed he had to shine his own light in doyles nowopened eye he shook his head this isnt possible will you allow me to do the impossible on abeloec now halfwen asked with a small smile i think he would have argued but he just nodded halfwen went to the other bed and i got to do what id wanted to do from the moment i stepped into the room i touched doyles hair he looked up at me his face was still blistered and raw but the black eye that stared up at me was whole he smiled until the corner of his mouth met the burns then he stopped he didnt wince he simply stopped the smile he was the darkness the dark doesnt flinch my eyes were hot and my throat was so tight i couldnt breathe i tried not to cry because i knew that if i did i would lose control he laid his hand on mine where it lay on the bed railing just his hand on mine and the first tears squeezed out dr sang was beside us again he said what you showed me was a trick to get me to let your healer work on him i found my voice thick with tears it was no trick but a true seeing she loves you there will be two children a boy first then a girl she is in her flower shop if you call now you may get her while she is still drinking tea he looked at me as if i had said something frightening i dont think a man can be both a good doctor and a good husband that is for you to decide but she will miss you how can she miss me if i have never been hers the nurses were very quiet listening to all of this goddess knew what hospital gossip would make of it i did not see another face in her heart if you are not hers i am not certain she will ever marry she should marry someone she should be happy she thinks you would make her happy shes wrong he said but more like he was trying to convince himself perhaps or perhaps you are the one who has been wrong he shook his head he gathered himself to himself like other people would pull a warm blanket around their shoulders i watched him rebuild his doctor persona ill have one of the nurses redress the wounds can your healer do this to human wounds sadly our healing magic has always worked better on faerie flesh i said not always rhys said but in the last few thousand years yeah dr sang shook his head again i would like to know how this healing works halfwen would be happy to try and explain it at a different time i understand you want to get your men home yes i said my tears had stopped under the doctors questions i realized that he wasnt the only one who had drawn himself to himself in private i could fall apart but not here in front of so many given the opportunity the nurses and doctors could sell my emotional pain to the tabloids and i didnt want that dr sang went for the door as if he needed to get away from us he paused with the door partially open it wasnt a trick or an illusion i swear to you that what we saw together was a true vision does that mean wed live happily ever after he asked i shook my head its not that kind of fairy tale there will be children and she does love you beyond that i think you could love her if youd let yourself but that may require work on your part to love someone is to lose a certain amount of control over yourself and your life and you dont like that no one likes that i added i smiled at him as doyle squeezed my hand and i squeezed back some people are addicted to falling in love doctor some people love that rush of new emotions and when that first rush of lust and fresh love is spent they move on to the next thinking the love wasnt real what i felt in her and potentially in you is the love of years love that knows that first rush of freshness isnt the real thing its the tip of the iceberg you know what they say about icebergs princess meredith no what do they say make sure the ship youre riding in isnt called titanic several of the nurses laughed but i didnt hed made a joke because he was scared truly scared something made him believe that he couldnt love both medicine and a woman that he couldnt do justice to both maybe he couldnt but then again rhys moved up beside me beside us he put his arm across my shoulders not too tight faint heart never won fair maiden he said what if i dont want to win the fair maiden dr sang asked then you are a fool rhys said with a smile to soften the words the two men stared at each other for a long moment some knowledge or understanding seemed to pass between them because dr sang nodded almost as if rhys had spoken again he hadnt i would have sworn to that but sometimes silence speaks between one man and another much louder than any words one of the greatest differences between men and women is that certain silence that women do not understand and men cannot explain dr sang went for the door before he and rhys had had their moment of understanding i would have bet even money on whether the good doctor would call the woman in the flower shop but something about what rhys had said had tipped the scales somehow now all i wondered was whether he call first or simply go to her rhys hugged me and kissed the top of my head i turned my face up so i could look at him his smile was casual almost teasing but that one clear blue eye held something that was not casual in the least i remembered a moment when the queens ring had first come back to life on my hand i had seen a ghostly baby before one of the female guards every man in the hallway had stared at her as if she were the most beautiful thing in the world every man except for four doyle frost mistral and rhys even galen had stared at her later id had it explained that only true love would make you not gaze upon a woman that the ring had chosen i had used the ring to see who among my guards would be the father of that almostchild and given the female guard and the male guard to each other it had worked she had missed her period and the tests were positive it was the first pregnancy among the unseelie since i was conceived i truly loved doyle and frost to a lesser extent i couldnt imagine being without either of them mistral had been my consort in the moment when the ring had come back to life so the magic had not worked on him instead he was part of the working of the magic but rhys he should have looked at that guard but he had only looked at me which meant that he loved me and he knew that i did not love him the people of faerie are not supposed to be jealous or possessive of their lovers but to love truly and not have it returned is a pain that has no cure i raised my face to him inviting a kiss his face lost all trace of humor he was as solemn as the look in his eye he kissed me and i kissed him back i let my body grow soft and cling to him as our lips found each other i wanted him to know that i valued him that i saw him that i wanted him i felt his body respond even through our clothes he drew back first a little breathless a hint of laughter to his voice lets get our wounded home and we can finish this i nodded because what else could i do what can you say to a man when you know you are breaking his heart you can promise to stop doing what is tearing him apart but i knew that i couldnt wouldnt stop loving doyle and frost i was breaking frosts heart a little too because he knew that doyle had a bigger piece of my affections if we had not been so intimate together i might have been able to hide from frost but he had taken to being with doyle and me whenever we were intimate there were too many men now to not share but it was more than that it was almost as if frost feared what would happen if he left me alone with doyle for even one more night what do you do when you know you are breaking someones heart but to do anything else would break your own i promised rhys sex with my kiss and my body i meant it but it wasnt lust that prompted the offer i suppose in a way it was love just not the kind of love a man wants from a woman chapter we left the hospital to find a barrage of reporters someone had talked we answered none of the yelled questions although they got plenty of pictures of doyle in a wheelchair the fact that hed accepted it at all proved how hurt he still was abe on the other hand had taken a wheelchair because he was lazy and liked attention though he had to sit to one side to save his back halfwen had healed him but again not completely we werent in faerie and our powers werent even close to their best the reporters knew what exit we were taking someone inside the hospital would take home money for either directing us to where the press waited or telling them where we were coming out either way we were a moneymaking enterprise today cameras blinded us hospital security had called the police before we even got outside so there were other uniforms besides the two who still trailed us officers kent and brewer hadnt liked me as much since i had done magic on the doctor they seemed afraid of me but they did their duty they walked in front and helped their fellow officers keep the crowd back there was a moment when the reporters pressed forward and the line collapsed toward us then my guards moved forward and the line steadied some of the men put their hand on the shoulder or back of the security guard or cop nearest them i watched the humans stand a little straighter it was as if by touch some of my guard could give courage and strength i couldnt remember them ever being able to do that before or was it just that the men who could do it had never been with me what had i brought out of faerie with me into this modern world even i wasnt certain i watched them give courage with a touch the way i could wake lust and wondered if the touch would give them luck and courage for their day or if it would fade like the lust i could inspire when we had some privacy id ask there were too many of us for just one limo there were two limos and two hummers one of each was black the other white i had time to wonder if someone had a sense of humor or if it was an accident i tried to help doyle inside a limo but rhys moved me back so that frost and galen could help their captain inside it seemed to take a long time my vision was ruined with the flashing of cameras someone screamed over the mass of noise darkness why did king taranis try to kill you rhyss hands tensed on my shoulders until that moment i and probably he had thought that some flunky had talked but that one question said that whoever had talked to the press had known entirely too much the only people who had seen what happened were security guards and lawyers both professions that you were supposed to be able to trust someone had betrayed that trust we were finally inside the stretch limo abe was already lying on his stomach on the main seat doyle sat in one of the side seats stiffly upright i moved to sit with him but he motioned me toward abe let him rest his head in your lap princess i frowned at him wanting to ask why he was pushing me away my expression must have asked for me because he said please princess i trusted doyle he had to have his reasons i sat on the end of the big seat and eased abes head into my lap he rested his cheek against my thigh and i stroked the heavy weight of his hair id never seen it braided before like a goth version of a candy cane black gray and white i guess theyd had to keep his hair away from the wound on his back somehow frost sat on the seat opposite doyle galen moved to take a seat but doyle said take the second suv rhys will take the first we have too many guards who know only faerie be their modern eyes and ears galen rhys patted him on the back come on galen gave me an unhappy look but he did as he was told it was frost who said we need aisling in here and usna doyle said frost nodded as if that made sense to him it didnt to me not yet but then i hadnt had centuries of battle to get me past that shock and disorientation that seemed to follow like a fog the door shut and we had a few minutes while rhys and galen fetched the men they had asked for why them i asked aisling was exiled from the seelie because their sithen their faerie mound recognized him as the king in this new land not taranis doyle said his voice sounded normal not even a hint of tightness only his arm in its sling tied tightly to his chest and the bandage across his face showed what his voice should have held so he needs to know that hugh is trying to give away his kingdom i said no abe said from my lap it is not aislings kingdom now but the sithen used to choose the ruler i said yes abe said as the lia fail stone did once for the kings of ireland but the sithen can be a fickle thing it liked aisling more than two hundred years ago hes not the same man who was exiled time has changed him the seelie mound may not want him now abes voice sounded tired trailing off around the edges i put my hand against his cheek that one small touch made him smile usnas mother is still a favorite at the seelie court frost said and she still speaks to her son so usna might know if hugh was part of a plot to get rid of taranis i said frost nodded doyle said yes i looked at both their faces so distant and cold it reminded me of the way they had been when they first came to me why were they being like this i was royal so i shouldnt show weakness by asking but i was also in love with them so while there was only abe to witness it i asked why are you both being so distant they exchanged a look and even through the bandages on doyles face i didnt like that look it promised nothing that i would want you are not with child meredith doyle said voice still so controlled you are beginning to make it clear that you have chosen us but if you are not pregnant then we are not your king you must look at the other men with more favor you get badly hurt and you go all crazy on me i said doyle tried to turn his head and look directly at me but apparently that hurt too much so he had to turn his whole body it is not crazy it is sanity you must not give your heart where your body does not go i shook my head dont make decisions for me doyle i am no longer a child i choose who comes to my bed we fear frost said and he didnt look happy saying it that your caring for us is making it difficult for the other men im sleeping with them considering that weve only been back a few weeks i think ive given them plenty of attention frost gave a small smile sex is not all that a man craves even after a thousand years of abstinence i know that i said but i only have so many hearts to give and that doyle said is the problem frost told me how you behaved when i was injured you cannot play favorites meredith not yet a look of pain crossed his faced but i didnt think it had anything to do with his injuries you know i feel the same but you must be with child meredith you must or there will be no throne no queenship abe spoke his hand resting on my leg beside his head hugh didnt say merry had to breed to be queen of the seelie he just offered her the throne i tried to remember exactly what sir hugh had said abes right i said perhaps magic is worth more to them than babies frost said perhaps doyle said or perhaps hugh plays some other game the limo door opened and we all jumped even doyle and abe abe allowed himself a small pain sound doyle was silent only his face showing the pain for a moment by the time usna and aisling had climbed into the car it was back to its usual stoic expression the two new men found seats usna sat beside frost aisling beside doyle doyle said tell them to drive frost hit the intercom button take us home fred fred had been driving for maeve reed for thirty years hed grown gray and older while she remained beautiful and untouched by the years he said do you want the cars to stay together or do you want me to try to outrun the press frost looked at doyle doyle looked at me i had had more experience than any of them in being pursued by the press i hit the intercom button above me though i had to stretch for it fred dont try to outrun them today theyll hound us just get us home in one piece will do princess thanks fred fred had been dealing with the royalty of hollywood for decades he seemed unimpressed with real royalty but i guess when youve been driving the golden goddess of hollywood around whats a princess to that chapter usna relaxed his tall muscled frame against the seat as if we were on a pleasure drive a sword hilt poked out of his long loose hair which fell around him in a riot of red black and white the hair was patched not striped like abes usnas eyes though large and lustrous were the plainest shade of gray that any of my guards could boast but those shining gray eyes stared out through a veil of hair hed had three reactions to his first time in the big city one he carried more weapons than he ever had in faerie two he seemed to hide behind his hair he was always peering out of it like a cat hiding in the grass until it springs on an unwary mouse three he had joined rhys in the weight room and added some bulk to that slender frame the cat analogy came from the fact that he was spotted like a calico cat and that his mother had been changed into the form of a cat when pregnant with usna shed been pregnant by another seelie sidhes husband and the scorned wife had decided that her outside should match her inside usna had grown up avenged his mother and undone the spell and his mother was living happily ever after in the seelie court usna had been exiled for some of the things he had done to avenge her hed thought it was a fair trade but it was aisling from his seat beside doyle who asked not that i am complaining princess but why are we in the main car we all know that you have your favorites and we are not among them his comment about favorites echoed what doyle and frost had said earlier but dammit wasnt i entitled to have favorites i looked into aislings face but could only truly see his eyes because he wore a veil wrapped around his head as some women did in arabic countries his eyes were spirals of colors that reached out from his pupil not rings but true spirals the color of those spirals seemed to change as if his eyes couldnt decide what color they wanted to be he wore his long yellow hair in complicated braids at the back of his head so the veil could be securely tied once looking into aislings face had caused anyone male or female to fall instantly in lust with him the legend said love but aisling had corrected me it was lust unless he put effort into the magic then it could be love once even true love could have been broken by aislings touch it had worked outside and inside faerie once upon a time wed proven that he could still make someone who hated him fall madly in love give up all her secrets and betray every oath because of his kiss it was why i had yet to bed aisling he and the other guards werent sure if i was powerful enough to resist his spell his veil today was white to match the oldfashioned clothes he wore there hadnt been time to make new clothes for the newest guards so they wore the tunics pants and boots that would have looked perfect in about fifteenthcentury europe maybe a little later fashion moved slowly in faerie unless you were queen andais she was fond of the latest and greatest designers as long as they liked black usna had borrowed jeans tshirt and a suit jacket from someone only the soft boots that peeked from the leg of the jeans were his own but then a cat is less formal than a god talk to them meredith doyle said and there was the tiniest bit of strain in his voice the limo was a smooth ride but when you have seconddegree burns that started the day as thirddegree burns well i guess theres no such thing as a truly smooth ride his comment had sounded too much like an order but the strain in his voice made me answer the strain and the fact that i loved him love makes you do all sorts of foolish things do you know who attacked us i asked i know taraniss handiwork when i see it aisling said the other guards said taranis went mad and attacked you all usna said he drew his knees up tight arms laced around them so that his eyes were framed with his jeans and his hair it was a frightened childs pose and i wanted to ask if being among all this manmade metal was hard on him some of the lesser fey would eventually die locked inside metal it made prison a potential death sentence for faerie folk lucky that most of us didnt break human law what prompted the attack aisling asked im not sure i said he just went crazy i actually dont know what happened in the room because i was buried under a mound of bodyguards i looked at abe still lying in my lap and glanced at frost and doyle what did happen the king attacked doyle frost said what neither will say abe said is that only doyle throwing up his gun to deflect the spell saved him from being blinded taranis tried for his face and he meant it to either kill or permanently maim i havent seen the old fart use his power that well in centuries arent you older than he is i asked peering down at him he smiled older yes but in my heart im still a pup taranis let himself grow old inside most of us cant age the way a human can but inside we can grow just as old just as unwilling to change with the times the gun deflected taraniss hand of power usna asked yes doyle said and he made a motion with his good hand not all of it obviously but some guns are made out of all sorts of things that faerie magic doesnt like i said im not certain about the new polymerframe guns doyle said the metal ones yes but since plastic doesnt seem to bother the lesser fey i wouldnt swear that the new polymer guns would deflect anything why doesnt plastic bother the lesser fey usna asked its as manmade as metal more so maybe its not the manmade part but the metal part that counts frost said until we know i think only guns with more metal than plastic should be used by the guards doyle said everyone just nodded when doyle fell the humans started screaming and running frost said taranis used his hand of power on the room but he seemed confused as if he didnt know what to target when he stopped firing galen and i were ordered to get the princess you out of the room and we tried abe said thats when taranis decided on me he shivered a little his hand tightening on my leg i leaned over and laid a kiss on his temple im sorry you got hurt abe i was doing my job was abeloec his target aisling asked or did he try for the princess and miss frost doyle said i believe he hit what he was aiming at but when abeloec fell galen picked the princess up and he moved in a way that i have not seen anyone move except the princess herself inside faerie frost said galen didnt open the door did he i asked no frost said galen carried you through the door usna asked i dont know one minute we were in the room the next we were in the hallway i honestly dont remember what happened at the door you blurred then vanished at the door frost said in that first moment meredith i wasnt certain whether galen had gotten you out or another seelie trick had stolen you away then what happened i asked the kings own guard jumped him abe said truly aisling asked abe grinned oh yeah it was a sweet moment his most trusted nobles attacked the king usna asked as if he couldnt believe it abes grin widened until it crinkled the edges of his face sweet isnt it sweet usna agreed was the king so easily subdued aisling asked no frost said he used his hand of power three more times the last time hugh stepped in front of him and used his own body to shield the room and the people inside it hugh the firelord was able to take taraniss power at pointblank range aisling asked yes frost said his shirt was scorched but his skin seemed untouched i said and how did you see hugh aisling asked if galen had gotten you outside to safety she came back frost said and his voice was not happy i could not leave you to the seelies treachery i said i ordered galen to take you to safety frost said and i ordered him not to frost glared at me and i glared back you couldnt leave doyle hurt maybe dying usna said softly maybe yes but also if i am ever to rule truly rule a court of faerie i must be able to lead in battle we arent humans to keep our leaders in the back the sidhe lead from the front you are mortal merry doyle said that changes some rules if i am too mortal to rule then so be it but i must rule doyle speaking of ruling abe said tell them what hugh said about our princess being made queen of the seelie court that cant be true usna said he was staring at abe and me i swear it is true abe said has hugh lost his senses aisling asked no offense princess but the seelie will not allow an unseelie noble who is part brownie and part human to sit on the golden throne not unless the court has changed a great deal in the two hundred years of my exile what say you usna doyle asked are you as shocked as aisling tell me first if hugh gave reasons for his change of heart he spoke of swans with golden chains and there is a green faerie dog in the seelie court once more frost said my mother tells me the cu sith had stopped the king from beating a servant usna said and you didnt share this with anyone abe asked usna shrugged it didnt seem that important apparently some of the nobles have taken the dogs disfavor as a sign against taranis doyle said also he went buggers mad as a march fucking hare abe said well there is that doyle said aisling looked at me they offered you the throne of the seelie court truly hugh said something about a vote among the nobles and that if it went against taranis which he seemed confident it would he would get them to vote me in as heir apparent what did you say aisling asked i said wed have to talk to our queen before i could answer their generous offer will she be pleased or pissed usna asked i think it was a rhetorical question but i said i dont know doyle said i do not know frost said i wish i knew we had a chance of being caught between a ruler of faerie who was crazy and a ruler of faerie who was simply cruel i had found years ago that the difference between madness and cruelty doesnt matter much to a victim chapter doyle and frost picked usnas mind for other bits of unimportant news from his mother about the seelie court there was a lot of it apparently taranis had been acting erratically for some time aisling asked as we pulled into the gates of maeve reeds estate why did you request me for this talk taranis forbade anyone to speak to me of the seelie court on pain of torture so i have no intelligence to report the seelie sithen recognized you as king when we arrived in america doyle said you were exiled because of that i am aware of what cost me my place at court aisling said so the princess is in effect being offered your rightful throne doyle said aislings eyes went wide even through the veil his astonishment showed obviously he had not put two and two together and come up with that the door to the limo opened and fred held the door we all stayed sitting while we waited for aisling to digest this close the door for a moment fred i said the door closed just because the sithen recognized me more than two hundred years ago does not mean that i would still be its choice for king aisling said and it is not me to whom the nobles are making this offer i wanted you to hear it first aisling doyle said i did not want you to think that we had forgotten what faerie itself offered you once aisling looked at doyle for a long moment that was a very decent thing for you to do doyle you sound surprised i said he looked at me doyle has been the queens darkness for a very long time princess i am beginning to realize that some of his finer emotions may have been buried under the queens orders that is the most polite way ive ever heard anyone say that we thought you were a heartless bastard doyle abe said aislings eyes crinkled at the edges i think he was smiling i would not have put it quite that way doyle smiled i think many of us will find that under the princess care we are more ourselves than we have been in a very long time they all looked at me and the weight of that look made me want to squirm i fought it off and sat there trying to be the princess they thought i was but there were moments like now when i felt that i could not possibly be everything they needed no one could meet so many needs i got a whiff of a spring breeze and flowers a voice that was not a voice but more something that thrummed through my body hummed along my skin and whispered we will be enough i knew it was the old idea that with god or goddess on your side you could not lose but there were moments when i was no longer certain that winning meant the same thing to me that it did to the goddess chapter we were met by a boil of bodies at the door to the big house dogs faerie hounds met us with barks bays yips and noises that sounded like they were trying to talk since they were supernatural in origin i wouldnt have put it past them there were so many dogs trying to greet so many different masters at the door that we couldnt move forward as dogs will they were acting as if we had been gone days instead of only hours my hounds were like greyhounds but not quite there were differences in the head the ears the line of body from shoulders to tail but they had that muscled grace in color they were white a pure shining white like my own skin but with marks of red again like my own hair minnie short for miniver was white save for half her face and one large spot of red on her back the face was very striking red on one side white on the other as if someone had drawn a line neatly down her face mungo my boy was a little taller a little heavier and even whiter with only one red ear to give him color some of the larger hounds looked like irish wolfhounds had before theyd gotten mixed with anything less beefy there were only a few of them among the greyhounds but the few towered over everything else like mountains rising above a plain some had rough coats some smooth but all were a variation of red and white then you had the terriers that spilled around our ankles they too were mostly white and red except for a few who were black and brown the old black and tan brought back to existence by wild magic was the breed that most of the modern terriers are descended from rhys had the most terriers but then he was a god of death or had been our people see the land of the dead as an underground place most of the time so the fact that he had earth dogs was logical he didnt seem to mind that he had none of the graceful hounds or the huge war dogs he knelt in the mass of barking growling dogs all so much smaller and glowed with the joy that all of us showed we had always been a people who honored our animals they had been much missed there was one other exception to the color of the dogs doyles hounds they were not as tall as the wolfhounds but meatier black muscle over bone they were the original shape the dogs had come to us in black dogs what the christians called hellhounds but they had nothing to do with the devil they were the black dogs the black of void and nothing from which comes life before there is light there must be darkness doyle tried to walk unaided but stumbled frost gave his strong arms to his friend strangely there was no dog to greet frost he and only a few others had touched the black dogs but they had not changed into some other hound for them none of us knew why but i knew it bothered frost he feared i think that it was a sure sign that he was not enough to be truly sidhe once he had been the hoarfrost jack frost and now he was my killing frost but there was always that insecurity that he was not born sidhe but made hovering above the sea of dogs were small winged fey the demifey to be wingless among them was a mark of great shame all that had followed me into exile had been wingless until i brought new magic back to faerie penny and royal twins with dark hair and bright wings waved at me i waved back to be greeted like this by a cloud of demifey and our dogs was an honor i never thought i would have i offered to help frost with doyle but doyle refused he wouldnt even look at me his supposed weakness had cut him deeply one of the big black dogs pushed at me and gave a soft growl mungo and minnie both moved up hackles beginning to raise that was not a fight i wanted to see so i backed off calling them to my hands my hounds were capable of protecting me if they had to but against the black dogs they looked fragile i stroked their heads mungo leaned against my leg and the weight was comforting i wanted nothing more than a nap with my dogs on the floor by the bed or at the door not all my men liked a furry audience and sometimes neither did i regardless we had one more task to do before we could rest we called my aunt andais queen of air and darkness as soon as we got inside i would have put doyle and abe to bed immediately but doyle had pointed out that if someone else told the queen before we did that i had been offered her rivals throne she might view it as treason she might view it as me jumping ship andais didnt take rejection any type of rejection well she was already fairly pissed that so many of her most devoted guards had dumped her for me i didnt see it as dumping her for me i saw it as them choosing a chance for sex after centuries of forced celibacy for that most men would have gone to any woman it helped that i wasnt a sexual sadist and auntie andais was but that too was a fact best not shared doyle had insisted on being present for the call he wanted her to see what taranis had done i think he thought the visual aid would cut through her usual fits of temper she was more stable than taranis but there were moments when my aunt didnt seem entirely sane would she like this unexpected news or hate it i honestly didnt know doyle sat on the edge of my bed i sat beside him rhys sat on my other side hed jokingly said you promised me sex but i know you youll get distracted unless i stay by your side it was a joke with some bite in it for rhys and me but doyle said yes to his staying with us too quickly it let me know that my darkness was hurt worse than hed let on frost stood at the corner of the bed its easier to go for a weapon when you are standing galen stood beside him hed insisted on being included in the call and nothing anyone had said could dissuade him in the end it had been easier to just give in galens arguments that we needed at least one more ablebodied guard on the call had some merit but i think he like me wasnt sure what andais would do with the news from the seelie court he was afraid for me and i was afraid for us all abe lay on the far side of the bed he hadnt wanted to be included but hadnt argued with doyles order i think abe was afraid of andais of course so was i rhys moved to the mirror his hand was close to the glass but not quite touching it everybody ready he asked i nodded doyle said yes no abe said but my vote doesnt count apparently frost just said do it galen just watched the mirror with eyes that were a little too bright it wasnt magic it was nerves rhys touched the mirror using such a small piece of magic that i didnt even feel it the mirror was cloudy for a moment then the black bedroom of the queen appeared but she was not there her huge blackdraped bedspread was empty except for a pale male figure he lay on his stomach across the black fur and sheets his skin wasnt just white or even moonlight skin like mine but so pale it had a translucent quality to it it was what skin would have looked like if it could be formed of crystal except that this crystal was cut with long crimson slashes on arms and legs shed left his back and buttocks untouched which probably meant the cuts were for persuasion and not torture andais liked to go for the center of the body when she was causing pain for the sake of pain the blood shimmered in the lights again with a jewel quality that id never seen in blood before the mans hair spread to one side of his body catching the light in small prism rainbows he was so still that for a moment i thought there was some awful wound we could not see then i saw his chest rise and fall he lived he was hurt but he lived i whispered his name crystall he turned slowly obviously in pain he laid his cheek against the fur underneath him and stared at us with eyes that looked empty as if there was no hope left it hurt my heart to see that look in his eyes crystall hadnt been a lover of mine but he had fought with us in faerie he had helped defend galen when he might otherwise have died the queen had decreed that all the guards who wished could follow me into exile and then too many of them had opted to come so she had had to take back her generous offer the men who had left were safe with me the men who had not been in the first few groups that sholto lord of that which passes between had brought to los angeles had been trapped in faerie with her trapped with a woman who didnt take rejection well when theyd openly chosen another woman i was seeing what the other woman my aunt thought about that i reached out toward the mirror as if i could touch him but it wasnt one of my powers i could not do what taranis had done so easily earlier today princess crystall whispered and his voice was hoarse roughened i knew why his voice sounded like that screaming will do that i knew because i had been at the queens mercy more than once the queens mercy had become a saying among the unseelie sidhe as in id rather be at the queens mercy than do that andais had seen exile from faerie as worse than any torture she could devise she did not understand why so many of her fey had chosen it just as she hadnt understood why my father essus took me and our household into exile in the human world after andais tried to drown me at six years of age if i was mortal enough to die by drowning then i wasnt sidhe enough to be allowed to live sort of the way youd drown a puppy that your purebred bitch dropped after you realized it wasnt the mating of your dreams but some mongrel that had gotten inside the fence andais had been shocked when my father left faerie to raise me among the humans and she had been equally shocked when many years later nearly her entire guard would have followed me into the western lands for her to leave faerie was worse than death and she couldnt understand why it wasnt a fate worse than death to everyone else what she failed to understand was that the queens mercy had become a fate even worse than exile i stared into crystalls luminous hopeless eyes and my throat tightened around the tears that i knew i could not afford to shed andais had left us a present to look at but shed be watching and she would see tears as weakness crystall was her visual aid her example to us to me i wasnt certain what the message was supposed to be but in her mind there was one but goddess help me other than her jealousy and hatred of rejection i couldnt see any message here oh crystall i said i am sorry his voice had reminded me of the sound of chimes in a gentle wind now it was a painful croak you did not do this princess his eyes flickered toward what i knew was the outer door though i could not see that part of the room his face closed down and for a moment where there had been hopelessness there was rage a rage that he stuffed down and hid behind eyes that showed as neutral a face as he could find i prayed that andais hadnt seen that moment of rage shed try to beat it out of him if she had the queen swept into the room dressed in a loose flowing black robe it left open a triangle of white flesh the flat perfection of her stomach and a trace of her belly button there was a thin cord tied across the high tight planes of her breasts that kept the front of the outfit from spilling open completely there were long wide sleeves that left most of her forearms bare she must have been called away on important business to have put on that much clothing with crystall still in her bed he wasnt hurt enough for her to be finished with him shed tied her long black hair back in a loose tail of hair the ribbon shed chosen was red id never seen her wear red before not even a spot of it the only red the queen liked on her person was other peoples blood i couldnt have explained it but that red ribbon made my stomach clench tight and my pulse speed andais slid onto the bed in front of crystall but close enough that she could stroke the untouched flesh of his back she stroked him idly as you would a dog he flinched at her first touch then settled down and tried not to be there she looked at us with her tricolored eyes charcoal to the color of storm clouds to a pale winter gray that was nearly white her eyes went so perfectly with the black hair and the pale skin she was so made for goth fashion like abe except she was scarier than any goth on the planet andais was serialkiller scary and she was my fathers sister my queen and there was nothing i could do about either aunt andais i said we have arrived from the hospital to tell you much news we had already agreed that we needed to be clear from the beginning that we were telling her the news at the first opportunity my queen doyle said doing an awkward sitting bow as far as the bandages would allow i have heard many rumors this day she said in a voice that some thought was a throaty seductive sound but that had always filled me with dread goddess knows what the rumors are rhys said as he moved back to stand by the bed near me the truth is weird enough he said it with a smile and his usual teasing lightness she gave him a flat look that was anything but friendly there would be no lightening her mood if that look was any indication she turned those angry eyes back to doyle what could possibly injure the dark itself her voice was angry and almost disinterested she knew somehow she already knew who the hell had talked when the light appears the darkness must leave doyle said in his best flat nothing voice she ran the bright redness of her lacquered nails down crystalls back she left red lines though she didnt quite break the skin crystall turned his face away from the mirror and from her afraid i think that he could not control his expression what light is bright enough to conquer the darkness she asked taranis king of light and illusion is still potent in his hand of power doyle said his voice even emptier than her own she dug fingernails into crystalls back just below the shoulder blade as if she meant to dig a handful of flesh out of his back blood began to show around her hand like water filling a hole in the ground slowly seeping upward you seem preoccupied meredith whatever could be the matter her voice was almost conversational except for that edge of cruelty i decided to concentrate on the things that might distract her from tormenting the man in her bed taranis attacked us through the mirror in the lawyers office he injured doyle and abeloec he was trying for me when galen got to me safety oh i doubt he meant to injure you meredith even in his madness i suspect he was trying for galen i blinked at her the way she said it meant that she knew something that we did not why would he target galen ask yourself first niece why he accused galen abeloec and rhys of raping the lady caitrin her hand dug deeper into crystalls flesh causing tiny red lines to begin to trickle over his skin i do not know aunt andais i said and fought to keep my own voice even and empty i was trying not to show either fear or anger though right now fear was by far the strongest emotion she was pissed and i didnt know why if she knew about the offer of the seelie throne to me then she might be pissed at that but if i blurted it out shed think i felt guilty and i didnt she was always so difficult to deal with like being in the middle of a minefield you know you have to get to the edge but how to do that without getting blown up that was always the question oh come meredith think or are you so little unseelie and so much seelie that all you can think about is fertility i thought my fertility was supposed to be the thing i thought about most if i am to be your heir aunt andais she drew her fingers together forcing a sound from crystall shed made bloody scratches in his back like some evil flower carved into his flesh she raised her pale hand so i could watch his blood drip down her fingers are you going to be my heir meredith or is there another throne that calls to you more there shed said enough that i could address it it is true that when taranis was subdued by his nobles they offered me a chance at his throne you told them yes she hissed it at me standing and striding toward the mirror i did not i told them we would have to discuss such news with our queen with you aunt andais before i could say yes or no she was at the mirror now blocking our view of the bed and crystall her anger had awakened her power her skin was beginning to glow her eyes were filling with the light but not the way that most of the sidhes eyes glowed with power she seemed to have light behind her eyes as if someone had set a candle behind all that gray and black for the rest of us for the most part the individual colors glowed but not her she was queen and she had to be different i heard you jumped at the chance you ungrateful little bitch you have been lied to then aunt andais i fought to keep my voice neutral yes remind me that you are my bloodline my last chance to have someone of my line to rule after me if you would but get with child meredith goddess knows youre fucking everything in sight why are you not with child i do not know aunt but i do know that we came directly here from the hospital we came into the house and to this mirror we came to call you and tell you all that has happened i swear to you by the darkness that eats all things that i did not tell the seelie i would sit upon their throne i told them we would have to speak to our queen before we could answer them her eyes had begun to dim her power was beginning to fold away something tight in my stomach eased a little i had used an oath that no fey would have taken lightly there were powers older even than faerie and they waited in the dark to punish oathbreakers you truly did not agree to sit on the golden throne and forsake our court i did not i must believe you niece of mine but the seelie court is thick with knowledge that you will be the next queen of their court doyle reached across his body and touched me with his good arm at the same time that rhys touched my shoulder i touched doyles thigh lightly and laid my hand on rhyss hand what they say or think i cannot control but i did not agree to it why not she asked i have friends and allies among the unseelie court to my knowledge i have no such thing at the seelie court you must have powerful allies there meredith they are voting taranis unfit to rule even as we speak they will then vote you queen they would not do that unless you had been approached by the nobles of that court you must have been courted by them before now there must have been many secret meetings that i did not know of and that none of our guards reported to me i was beginning to see where her anger was coming from and i couldnt entirely blame her one of the reasons i said no and made clear that i must speak with you first was exactly that aunt andais i have not been approached in any way by the nobles taranis was almost unnaturally persistent in his desire to have me at one of their yule celebrations but other than that i have not had dealings with the seelie court i swear this to you that is why the offer makes me suspicious as to what they truly want of me i know hugh he is a political animal he would not have offered it to you unless he had a reason to do so you swear to me that he has never before approached you about this i swear i said darkness tell me exactly what happened i fear my queen that i will be useless for this to my deep shame i was unconscious through most of it you dont seem that injured halfwen healed me at the hospital or i would still be there abeloec she said abe stirred behind us on the bed hed tried very hard to go unnoticed yes my queen do you know why taranis would target you he sat up slowly careful of his back and ended by half kneeling almost on all fours behind us once my power was necessary for the choosing of a queen as meabhs power was to the choosing of a king i think taranis heard rumors that my power was returned to me in part i think he feared that i would help turn meredith into a true queen of faerie if we had known that any noble was dreaming of offering her the throne then the accusations against me would have made some sense he wanted me away from the princess galen she said why did he target you galen looked flustered for a moment he shook his head i dont know come galen greenknight green man why i had a thought he knows the prophesy that cel got from the human psychic i said yes meredith because you and the green man will bring life back to the courts taranis has made the same mistake my son did he thinks that galen is the green man of the prophesy neither of them remember our history the green man means the god the consort i said andais nodded she turned those eyes to rhys and you why you have you figured it out yet he heard the rumor that im cromm cruach again if i were truly back to my original strength then he would fear me rumor has it that you can bring death to a goblin with a touch again is that rumor true i have done it once he said but whether it will work again i do not know the rumor might be enough for taranis she said she seemed calmer which was good she looked at doyle i understand why he attacked you if i were to try and kill the princess i would kill you first but he was wrong in not targeting our killing frost she turned those calm eyes to the big man standing so silent beside the bed to kill meredith and survive would require both your deaths wouldnt it killing frost frost licked his lips he was right to be nervous this was not a conversation that we wanted to be having with our queen that is true my queen he said did the seelie court make the same condition on you that i do do you need to be with child before you can sit their throne no they offered the throne with no conditions except that the nobles of the seelie court vote taranis out and me in what do you think of that meredith i am flattered but not stupid i am wondering if the nobles are playing some game of their own choosing and the offer to me is simply to buy them time to consolidate their own bid for the throne a vote to put me on the throne would slow the process of choosing a new king or queen for the seelie court to a crawl andais smiled did doyle reason it out for you no my queen doyle said the princess is well aware of the seelie courts potential for treachery is it true that taranis almost beat you to death as a child yes i said in my head i added as you tried to drown me out loud i kept my mouth shut andais smiled as if shed hit on the same memory and it was a happy one for her meredith meredith you must learn to control your entire face your eyes betray how much you hate me i lowered my gaze not sure what to say that wouldnt be a lie she laughed and it was both a lovely sound and a sound that made me shiver as if it were my own body lying on her bed unable to protect itself from what would come next i wanted to save crystall from her but i couldnt figure out a way to do it me trying and failing would just make her hurt him worse shed think it meant he was special to me and it would amuse her all the more to slice him up now that i know that you have not been meeting with hugh and the seelie nobles in secret i agree that they mean you treachery perhaps you will be their stalking horse to lure out all the wouldbe assassins or perhaps it is what you say that they simply throw your name into the ring to slow the process while someone else consolidates their own power i think the latter the more likely but the offer is so completely unexpected that i have not had time to think clearly on it what she meant was that shed been convinced that id betrayed her with the seelie court so shed been too angry to think clearly i kept my reasoning to myself i had my face enough under control that i could look back up at her or i hoped i did how do you tell if your own face is neutral the fact that taranis knows of the prophesy that cel got from the human prophet means that one of cels trusted people is spying for the king of the seelie court she tapped her chin with one bloody fingernail but who there was a sound from the mirror almost the clanging of swords i glanced at the clock we are expecting a call from kurag goblin king i said you have call waiting on your mirror she said i nodded ive never heard of such a thing who did the spell i did rhys said his face was still softly amused but there was a wariness around his eyes you will have to bespell my mirror as well gladly my queen he said voice pleasantly neutral the clang of swords sounded again perhaps you should come back to court and do that today with apologies aunt andais rhys is to bed me if we can get time between calls and emergencies would it upset you to see his pale flesh bleeding on my bed like crystalls there was no safe answer to that question i do not know what you want me to say aunt andais the truth would be nice i sighed doyle squeezed my hand rhys tensed beside me it was then that galen lost it what does it matter taranis attacked us today he went so crazy that his own nobles jumped him and dragged him away hes about to be voted out as king of the seelie court and you want to spend time tormenting merry about us he actually stepped close to the mirror and continued to yell at her doyle almost died today merry could have died today and then youd never have a child of your blood on any throne the seelie nobles are up to something dangerous that involves our court and you want to play these stupid painful games we need you to be our queen not our tormentor we need help here goddess save us but we do we might have jumped him to keep him quiet but i think we were all too stunned to do anything the silence was heavy broken only by galens toofast breathing andais stared at him as if hed just appeared it wasnt a friendly look but it wasnt an unfriendly look either what help would you have of me greenknight try to find out why hugh offered the throne to merry really why what reason did he give she asked in an amazingly calm voice that there are swans with gold chains and that a cu sith stopped the king from beating a servant the seelie think merry is to blame or gets credit for the return of the magic and does she andais asked with that edge of cruelty beginning to creep back in you know she does galen said and there was no anger just a sort of righteousness as if it was just truth perhaps andais said she turned her gaze to me i will try and find out if hugh is being honest or as treacherous as we think you must have some magic over men that i do not see meredith you have not even fucked crystall yet he seems strangely loyal to you i will break him to my ways again then i will choose another of the men who would have deserted me for you sidhe who would have rather followed you into exile than stay with me in faerie she said the last almost in a thoughtful voice as if she truly didnt understand it the truth was that it wasnt faerie they wanted to leave but her sadistic care but that was a truth better kept to myself if the seelie offer is a genuine one meredith you might consider taking it a thrill of fear ran through me aunt andais i dont understand every man who prefers you to me makes me hate you a little more soon my hatred for you may outweigh my desire for you to sit my throne on the golden throne of the seelie court you would be safe from my anger i licked my suddenly dry lips i do nothing to anger you on purpose my queen and that is what is so maddening about you meredith i know you do not do it on purpose you simply are and somehow by being yourself you part my nobles and my lovers from me your seelie magic wins them away i carry the hands of flesh and blood those are not seelie hands of power aunt yes and cels prophet said that if someone of flesh and blood sat the unseelie throne he would die he thought it meant your mortality but it didnt she looked at me and there was something other than cruelty though i wasnt sure what exactly cel screams your name in the night meredith he means my death if he can manage it she shook her head he has convinced himself that if he lay with you you and he would have a child and he would be king to your queen my mouth couldnt get any drier but my heart rate could get faster i do not think that would work aunt andais work work it is fucking meredith the mechanics of it would work just grand i tried again while doyle and rhys gripped me harder even abe moved in at my back to put his face against my hair touching to comfort me i suppose what i meant was that i do not think cel and i would make a good ruling couple do not look so frightened meredith i know that cel would not make you pregnant but he has convinced himself of it i suppose i am warning you he no longer wants you assassinated but he would kill every lover you have if he could is he i tried to think of a way to say it free to he is not imprisoned but he is under guard at all times i do not want my own guards to kill my only son to protect my heir she shook her head go call the goblin king back i will try to find out if hughs offer of the golden throne is true or false she was walking back to the bed as she spoke the last few sentences but first i will take out my anger and frustration at you on your crystall know that every cut is a cut i would make on your lilywhite skin if i didnt need your body whole she crawled onto the bed and reached for crystall a knife had appeared in her hand either by magic or it had been tucked into the sheets frost got to the mirror first and cleared it with a touch we were left staring at our own images my eyes were a little too wide my skin pale crap rhys said that about summed it up chapter the mirror rang again a strident clash of swords as if blades had screamed down the sides of each other it made me jump rhys looked at doyle and me doyle said let abe and me get out of sight the fewer people in faerie who have this rumor the better i think he gave my hand a last squeeze then he tried to rise with his usual effortless movement but paused in midmotion it wasnt a flinch so much as that he simply stopped trying to stand i put a hand on his back to steady him frost grabbed one of his arms and it was probably more him than me that helped doyle stand upright doyle tried to move away from frosts arm but stumbled frost got a firmer grip on his friend doyle actually leaned a little on the other man which meant he was in a lot of pain you didnt take the pain medication that the hospital gave you did you i asked the mirror clanged again an even angrier sound than before as if the next sound of swords would break one of the blades the goblins are not known for their patience meredith doyle said in a tight voice you must answer the call he started off and didnt fight frost from helping him which meant he was very hurt indeed more hurt than hed let on the thought of my darkness being this injured made my stomach and chest tight not just because i loved him but because he was the greatest warrior i had frost might be as good in battle but for strategy it was doyle i needed him in so many ways it must have shown on my face because he said i have failed you taranis tried to burn your face off rhys said you failed no one the evil sound of swords filled the room again go rhys said ill stay with her you dont like goblins frost said rhys shrugged i killed the one that took my eye thats got to be good enough revenge besides i wont let you and merry down by being a big baby go rest take your meds ill take doyle galen said we all looked at him if merry cant have doyle by her side for this call then she needs frost he said abe had managed to get off the bed on the other side i see that no one cares that i might need help do you need help galen asked as he moved to take doyle from frost he actually held his other hand out to abe abe looked into his face for a breath then shook his head but stopped the movement as if it hurt i can walk boy the kings men jumped him before he could do his worst on my back he moved toward the door slowly but surely doyle let galen help him out of sight of the mirror and toward the door frost came to stand with me and rhys rhys reached toward the mirror then hesitated i hate that you are going to be with these two tonight weve had this discussion rhys for every halfsidhe goblin whom we bring into his full power our alliance with the goblins is lengthened by a month we need their threat to keep us safe i said the mirror made its ugly sound again the goblins do not wait with patience frost said we need them rhys i said i know i hate it but i know rhys said a look passed over his face too quickly for me to read one of these days id like you to be able to do things just because you want to do them not because youre forced to do them i wasnt sure what to say to that rhys reached out toward the mirror the metallic shriek rose to a crescendo i fought the urge to cover my ears i couldnt afford to show weakness in dealing with the goblins the two high courts of faerie would use weakness to their advantage goblin culture simply saw weakness as a reason to abuse you you were either prey or predator to the goblins i was working very hard not to be prey the mirror was suddenly a perfect window onto the goblin throne room their king was not there though ash and holly stood alone before the empty stone throne it was ashs hand on the glass when we saw them his magic making the mirror sound like a battle he blinked solid green eyes into the mirror there was no pupil only a blind expanse of perfect grass green surrounded by a little white his hair was yellow cut short because only the sidhe are allowed long hair on their men but his skin was gold kissed not sparkling with golden bits like aislings but it was close both the twins had seelie skin sunlight skin moonlight skin like mine and frosts was plentiful at both courts that golden color almost like a tan was exclusively seelie the eyes were goblin except for the color holly strode to the mirror to stand by his brother he was identical except that his eyes were the color of red holly berries like his namesake the red color with no pupil was not just goblin but red cap goblin rhys moved back from the mirror to stand on the other side of me so that i was sandwiched between him and frost the bargain is over holly said his handsome face contorted with rage he was usually the one to lose his temper first to keep us waiting like this is to make us lose respect in front of all ash said he didnt sound much more reasonable than his brother which was bad since ash was the voice of reason for the two of them queen andais kept us overlong frost said rhys just moved closer to me as if the twins anger alone could hurt me their eyes flicked to him then back to me is this true princess ash asked the queen had much to show us i said and let my voice hold some of the upset i felt about crystall and his fate in her bed shes been entertaining the sidhe you left behind ash said holly actually looked uneasy his anger fading which was unusual for him has the queen spoken to the two of you i asked they exchanged a look ash answered apparently the queen enjoyed watching us lick her blood off of your skin we didnt think that any sidhe even unseelie sidhe would be so goblin in their tastes andaiss blood had gotten on me in her most recent attempt to kill me shed been unhappy with me that day lately shed been happier with me so her murder attempts had stopped and she was paying my legal bills she offered you her bed frost asked we are not talking to you killing frost holly said i put a hand on frosts arm letting him know that it was all right i must weigh the pride of all the men in my life i said frost is one of those men and if tonight comes to pass as we have all planned you will be too i know you feel that we insulted you by ignoring your call but all of us have to wait upon the queens wishes we do not holly said you turned her down i made it a question we began the bargaining with what would be done and by whom ash said but she will not allow harm to come to her body she only wishes to do harm to others she actually tried to bargain that she would torture the two of you during sex i asked yes holly almost shouted it she did not know that it was the gravest of insults to offer that to you i said but you knew ash said i nodded i visited the goblin court many times over my childhood it was one of the few courts in faerie where my father felt that it was safe to bring me as a child he would not have allowed you inside the seelie court ash said no i said the goblins are not tamer than the sidhe holly said his anger flaring again no but the goblins are honorable and do not break their rules i said is it true that the queen tried to kill you when you were a child ash asked i nodded again it is so you were truly safer here with us than with your own kind ash said with the goblins and with the sluagh holly laughed a harsh unpleasant sound you were safer with us and with the nightmares of faerie than with the pretty sidhe i find that hard to believe the sluagh like the goblins have laws and rules and they abide by them my father knew your ways and taught those ways to me it is why we are here speaking today you have bargained most carefully princess ash said and there was no lust when he said it though it was sex wed been bargaining over no there was respect in his face in his eyes id earned that respect i am not surprised to see frost for lately he is half of your constant companions but it is not usually rhys who holds your other hand ash said where is the darkness holly asked yes princess he has become like your shadow ash said but today you have only frost and rhys by your side and it is well known that rhys does not like goblin flesh ash said he made that last comment sound suggestive rhys tensed beside me one hand going to my shoulder but otherwise he held his temper did they know that we had been attacked if they did know would they see it as an insult if we didnt tell them the goblins were our allies but not our friends if the goblins are your allies ash said then should you have secrets from them they knew i made my decision is the rumor mill traveling so fast in faerie there are those among the goblins who watch the human news they saw the darkness in a wheelchair coming out of a human hospital we did not see it so gave it no credit but now he is missing from your side my brother and i ask again where is your darkness he is healing but injured ash said he seemed a little eager at the news i fought not to lick my lips or show some other nervous habit i spoke smoothly he is injured yes it must be grave for him to leave your side ash said darkness in a wheelchair like an invalid holly said i never thought i would see such a shameful thing there is no shame in taking care of an injury among the sidhe i said a goblin so badly injured would either take his own life or others would take it for him holly said then glad i am that i am not goblin i said for i injure all too easily id mentioned my frailty on purpose i hoped to turn their attention from doyle and toward the sex we might be having tonight ash and holly had never been with a human they had never been with anyone who could be injured so easily and death true death by accident with no cold metal involved was a novelty yes ash hoped to be king ash and holly both hoped that i could bring them into their sidhesided magic as i had others but it wasnt hunger for power that filled hollys face with eagerness it was hunger of a very different kind ashs face remained thoughtful not caught up in his brothers lust holly would be the one who might lose control and hurt me by accident but it was ash who would hurt me on purpose he was just a little less goblin in his thoughts and a little more sidhe if i could awaken true magic in him he would be truly dangerous kurag goblin king would do well to watch him the goblins do not inherit their throne they take it by force of arms and they keep it the same way the king is dead long live the king i will not be distracted princess ash said not even by your white flesh am i so poor a prize then i asked and lowered my eyes the goblins liked their partners either bold as brass or demure i wasnt capable of their level of boldness so demure it was ash gave an abrupt laugh you know exactly what you represent to us princess holly stepped close to the mirror so that his handsome face filled more of the view there was no distortion as with a camera it was always as if the glass only separated one part of a room from another he pressed his fingers against the glass he looked at me and there was something in his eyes beyond sex i shivered and looked away from him i wish i could smell your fear through this glass he said in a voice gone low and rough with need frost moved closer to me rhys put his arm around my waist i wanted the comfort but we were dealing with goblins and they would use it against us we agreed to darkness and one other watching our fucking ash said but he is injured so i say we have no audience no i said voice soft then all our negotiations must be redone ash said frost started to say something but i touched his arm you and holly have the chance to bring magic true magic back to the goblins you have a chance to be in the running for king of the unseelie court you will not pass up such power because doyle is too injured to watch us fuck you will allow me to choose two other men to guard my safety and to make certain we all have a care tonight we do not take orders from the sidhe holly said this is not an order this is simply the truth i looked at ash who was deeper into the room farther from the mirror we have given you our word princess holly said the goblins unlike the sidhe keep their word we will do only what has been bargained for nothing more we will do nothing that you do not agree to the guards will be there to see that in the midst of pleasure you do not get carried away but they will also be there for another reason i said and what would that be ash asked to make certain that i do not lose myself to the moment lose yourself holly said what does that mean it means that we bargained that you would do nothing i did not agree to or ask for i fear that i may in the heat of the moment ask for things that my body cannot survive what holly asked frowning shes saying that she likes to be hurt and she might ask for things that would damage her ash said lying sidhe holly said i swear to you that i do not lie i must have guards to keep me safe from myself holly hit the mirror hard enough to make it shake on his end it made me jump you are afraid of us he said the sidhe do not crave that which they fear i cannot speak for anyone but myself do you want me to hurt you holly said i looked up then gave him my gaze full on and let him see the truth oh yes chapter eventually the mirror was just a mirror again the goblins would arrive tonight with a guard of red caps to make certain this was not sidhe treachery with doyle injured i had to choose new guards to watch us and frankly the ones i trusted most didnt want the duty frost would have stood with doyle if ordered but he didnt really enjoy seeing me with other men he was okay with doyle and himself being in the same room at the same time with me but he didnt share with anyone else rhys was more openminded about the sharing thing but it would have been a type of torture to ask him to watch the goblins with me being a prisoner of the goblins had been what had cost him one eye you meant that about wanting them to hurt you didnt you rhys asked yes i said do you know how disturbing that is i thought about it then nodded you either get it or you dont i do not get it either frost said i kept quiet because frost actually got it more than he thought he did he didnt like causing me pain but a little tie me up tie me down worked just fine as foreplay for him but since he didnt consider bondage the same thing as causing pain i didnt argue with him doyle gets it rhys said i nodded you enjoy normal sex right rhys asked normal is a judgment the kind of sex i like is just the kind of sex i like rhys he took a deep breath and started over i dont mean to sound judgmental what i mean is do you have less bondage sex with the rest of us because you think we wont do what you want i guess i want to know that you really enjoy being with me i put my arms around him but kept us far enough apart so i could gaze up into his face i love being with you all of you but sometimes i like something rougher i wouldnt want to have the goblins idea of sex every night but the thought does excite me he shivered and it wasnt from pleasure no it was definitely fear i know now thanks to you that only my ignorance of goblin culture cost me my eye if i hadnt been just another arrogant sidhe id have known that their culture allows even prisoners to negotiate sex i could have forced them not to maim me but i saw the sex as torture and you cant bargain with torture when a goblin tortures you youll know it he shuddered again i hugged him trying to squeeze that haunted look from his face we need to decide whos going to guard my back tonight he hugged me tightly im so sorry merry but i cant i just cant do it i whispered into his hair i know and its all right i will do it frost said i turned in rhyss arms so i could see frost his face was at its arrogant best coldly handsome what i saw was that it wasnt his lack of enjoyment of what would be happening that would hamper his ability to guard me but rather just how much he might secretly enjoy it that would hamper him he had a tendency to let his emotions cloud his judgment tonight would push too many of frosts buttons for him to guard me well if doyle had been there to help force him through his emotional baggage then maybe but doyle wouldnt be there tonight who could i ask to do this the mirror suddenly showed the queens bedroom we had put a spell on the mirror to keep anyone else from simply peeking in but the queen had taken that badly so she had ready access to the mirror it meant we had no privacy but it kept andaiss anger to a more manageable level it also meant that id started sleeping in some of the smaller rooms in the house my excuse that sex exhausted us and we just fell asleep elsewhere was holding so far the queen was covered in blood from about midarm to her lower body it was hard to tell with the black she was wearing but the cloth seemed to be stuck to her body with the wetness of it she held the blade in one hand so covered in blood that i knew it must be slippery i didnt want to look at the bed but i had to i stayed in rhyss arms and we both looked at the bed in that slowmotion way you do when you both want to see and never want to see it had to be crystall but he was just a bloody form in the shape of a man only his shoulders and the width of his hips made me sure of the man part he was still on his stomach still where wed last seen him one arm lay half off the bed the hand hanging in midair the hand twitched involuntarily as if something shed done to him had affected the nerves tears simply spilled down my face i couldnt stop them rhys pushed my face against his shoulder so i wouldnt have to see for once i let him id seen what andais wanted me to see though i had no idea why she wanted me to see it what shed done to crystall was usually reserved for traitors enemies people she meant to get information out of or prisoners who were to be tortured for crimes she had reduced him to a red ruin for what for what i wanted to scream it at her rhyss arms tightened around me as if he had read my intent you lied about taking rhys to your bed she said at last no i said we just got off the mirror from the goblins i wiped at my eyes and turned to face my queen how i hated her you seem a little pale and uncertain for sex niece of mine her voice purred with pleasure at the effect she was having on me was that it just a game to see how awful she could make me feel was crystall so unimportant to her that he was just a body to use to hurt me i will have sholto fetch rhys home he can enchant my mirror as he enchanted yours then he can join me as hes always wanted to she looked at rhys then she gave him the full look of those triple gray eyes you do still want me dont you rhys that was a dangerous question rhys spoke carefully who would not want to lie with your beauty but you wanted merry to be with child and i must be here to do my duty by her as you ordered me to do and if i ordered you home she asked you gave your oath that all the men who had come to my bed would be mine i said you swore it except for mistral he i did not give to you to keep she said except for mistral i said voice soft and fighting to be even would it upset you more to see rhys stretched across my bed like this again a dangerous question i thought of several things to say then settled for the truth yes you cannot love them all meredith no woman can love them all true love no my queen but love them yes i love them because they are my people i was taught that you take care of those who are in your charge my brothers words keep haunting me from your mouth she flung her hand up and i think not on purpose sent blood splattering across her side of the mirror sir hugh has contacted me there is talk that taranis will be forced to be a sacrifice to bring life back to his people there is talk of regicide meredith talk that the seelie court has suffered under his reign of madness there was something about the way she said that last that made my stomach clench frost said he was quite mad this morning my queen yes killing frost yes you are still there still by her side the seelie want me to know that they mean no insult by offering you their throne is it done then frost said no not quite but you have perhaps a day and a night before hughs faction either loses or gains control of enough nobles to bring our princess to their throne hugh told me that i still had cel to bring to my throne that it wasnt as if meredith were my first choice did hugh have any idea how much he had endangered me andais was not much more stable than taranis i had no idea how she would react to such talk from the seelie court you look frightened meredith she said shouldnt i be why are you not thrilled at the possibility of being queen of the seelie because my heart lies with the unseelie court i said finally she smiled then does it does it truly half my sithen is covered in white and pink and gold marble there are flowers and vines everywhere the hallway of immortality which has stood as a place of torment for millennia is covered in flowers galens magic dissolved the cells and i cannot make the sithen rebuild them i have people tear up the flowers in the hallway but they simply regrow overnight i do not know what you want me to say aunt andais i thought the only revolution i had to worry about was one of arms and politics you have shown me that there are other ways to lose power meredith your magic is possessing my sithen even with you in los angeles the changes creep farther every day like some kind of cancer she laughed but it held an edge of pain a cancer formed of flowers and pastel walls if i let the seelie have you will my kingdom go back to what it was or is it too late is that what the seelies see meredith that you will remake all of faerie in their image you are destroying your heritage meredith if i do not stop it there will soon be no dark court left to save it was not deliberate on my part aunt if i give you to the seelie will it stop i looked into those eyes eyes that held less sanity than they should have i dont know what does the goddess say i dont know she speaks to you meredith i know she does but have a care she is not some christian deity to take care of you she is the same power that made me i know the goddess has many faces i said do you meredith do you really i just nodded enjoy rhys while you can because once you sit the seelie throne my guard revert to me they guard only our noble line i have not agreed she waved me to silence i no longer know how to save my people and our culture i thought you were the solution but though you may save faerie you seem to be destroying the unseelie way of life did the goddess offer you a choice for how to bring life back to faerie yes i said softly she offered you blood sacrifice or sex didnt she yes i said i couldnt keep the look of astonishment off my face dont look so shocked meredith i was not always queen once no one ruled here who was not chosen by the goddess i chose death and blood to cement my tie to the land i chose the unseelie way what did you choose child of my brother there was a look in her eyes that made me afraid to tell the truth but i could not lie not about this life i chose life you chose the way of the seelie if there is a way to bring power that does not kill why is it wrong to choose it whose life did you spare i licked suddenly dry lips do not ask doyle no i said then who she screamed it at me amatheon i said amatheon he is one of your newest lovers he helped cel torment you as a child why i dont understand aunt why why what i asked why save him why not kill him to bring life back to the land he was a willing sacrifice why kill him if i didnt have to i asked she shook her head sadly that is not an unseelie answer meredith my father your brother would have said the same thing no my brother was unseelie my father taught me that all in faerie from lowest to highest have value no she said yes i said i thought of you while i cut crystall up meredith the only hesitation i have about giving you to the seelies is that if i do i cannot kill you without starting a war i dont want to lose the option of torturing you to death meredith i think once you are dead your magic will fade and the traitorous goddess that comes to you will fade with it would you condemn all of faerie to death because it is not the faerie you wish it to be frost asked it his face astonished no and yes with that the mirror went blank again we were left staring at our own reflections we all looked pale and shocky today no good news seemed to go unpunished chapter i was ready to lie down and get some rest and relaxation it promised to be a long night but i wasnt allowed to be alone not even just to sleep between taraniss treachery and queen andais being able to see in the mirror at will rhys and frost were just not willing to risk me being alone i couldnt argue with them so i didnt even try i just started undressing so i could climb between the covers if it had been doyle and frost they would both have stayed and we might have slept or we might have done something more active but rhys and frost had never shared me not even for sleep there had been a moment of awkwardness as i undressed and they looked at each other it was rhys who finally said i want sex with you before the goblins tonight but ive seen that look on frosts face before what look frost asked but i didnt ask because i could see it and id seen it before frosts need and uncertainty were plain in his eyes in the lines of his mouth i want sex rhys said but you need reassurance and that takes longer to get i do not know what you mean frost said in a cold voice his face was at its arrogant best again that moment of uncertainty hidden behind years of courtly living rhys smiled its all right frost i understand really i do there is nothing to understand frost said i slipped naked under the covers almost too tired to care who won the conversation i settled against the pillows and waited for one of them to climb into bed with me i was so tired so overwhelmed with all of the days events that it didnt seem to matter who slept next to me as long as someone did doyle isnt just your captain frost youve been each others right hands for centuries youre feeling the lack of him we are all feeling the lack of him healthy at our sides frost said rhys nodded yes but only you and merry feel his loss this deeply i do not understand you frost said thats okay rhys said he looked at me the look asked me did i understand i thought i did come to bed frost sleep with me i patted the bed doyle told me to take care of you until he is able i smiled at the face that was trying for blankness and failing around the edges then come to bed and take care of me frost you promised me sex and i am going to hold you to it rhys said frost hesitated by the bed we have never shared the princess and we arent going to now rhys said ill share sometimes with the newer men because merry likes me better than she likes them he smiled and i returned the smile then his face sobered and there was something far too serious in his face but i could not bear to share her with you and see how she feels about you i know she loves you more you and doyle but i do not wish the fact rubbed into my body like salt into a wound rhys i said he shook his head and pushed a hand toward me dont try to save my ego youd have to lie to do it and the sidhe dont lie it was frost who said rhys i do not mean to cause you pain you cant help being who you are and she cant seem to help loving you i tried to hate you for it but i cant if you get her pregnant and i end up back with andais then ill hate you but until then ill try to share with some grace i wanted to say something to make it better but what could i say rhys was right any comforting words would have had to be lies i do not slight you on purpose my white knight i said rhys smiled we are both equally pale my princess we knew going into this that only one man can be king even i think that doyle and frost together make a good ruling pair for you too bad that even among the darkness and the killing frost there will be a winner and a loser with that rhys left closing the door behind us i heard him speak to the dogs who must have been waiting outside the door we did not let the dogs in when we spoke to andais because she had touched the black dogs and they had not transformed into special dogs for her the magic had not known her and she resented it frost feared that the lack of a dog meant he was not sidhe enough andais simply hated the fact that the returning power didnt seem to know her she was queen and all the power of her court should have been hers but it didnt seem to be working that way i almost called to rhys to let the dogs in but didnt because it would be a reminder to frost of what he lacked the door closed softly but firmly and i was left looking up at the man who had stayed frost took off his suit jacket and the moment he did i could see all the weapons he was carrying there were many guns and blades but he was always armed for war i counted four handguns and two blades in the front of the leather there would be more because there were always more weapons than met the eye with the killing frost you smile why he asked softly he began to undo the buckles that held the leather in place i would ask what army you had planned to fight today with so many weapons but i know what you feared he removed the weapons carefully and laid them across the bedside table the armament on the wood was heavy with the potential for destruction where did you put your gun frost asked its in the drawer of the bedside table you took it off as soon as you entered this room didnt you yes i said he went to the closet and hung the jacket on a hanger he started unbuttoning his shirt with his back still to me i do not understand why you would do that one a gun is not truly comfortable two if i had needed my gun in this bedroom it would mean that all of you were dead if that happened frost one gun in my hands would not save me he turned with the shirt unbuttoned to his waist he pulled it the rest of the way out of his pants and tired as i was seeing him tug the shirt out of his pants watching him undo the last few buttons made my pulse speed just a little his skin was a strip of whiteness against the lesser whiteness of the cloth he slid the shirt over his shoulders exposing his muscled strength in inches hed learned that sometimes watching him slowly undress helped whet my appetite for him he hung his shirt on an empty hanger even buttoning the collar so it would hang right and not wrinkle but in doing so he let me see the long line of his back and shoulders hed even swung all that silver hair over one shoulder so that the muscled smoothness of his back was an unobstructed show there were times when watching him hang up his clothes drove me nearly mad and had me making small eager noises before he was ready to come to bed today would not be one of those days the view was lovely as always but i was tired and did not feel completely well part of it was grief and shock but also the nagging knowledge that i was coming down with a cold or a virus frost had never had cold he had never had so much as the sniffles he turned to face me his hands sliding around the top of his pants hed had to undo the belt earlier to take off the rig of weapons i had to be more tired than i knew to have missed him unbuckling his belt he started with the button at the top of his pants and i rolled over i rolled so my face was buried in the pillow and i could not watch he was too beautiful to be real too amazing to be mine i felt the bed move and knew he was on the bed with me merry what is wrong i thought you enjoyed watching me i do i said still not looking at him how did i explain that i was having one of those rare moments when my mortality seemed too real and his immortality too large a reminder am i not enough to please you without doyle by my side that made me turn and look at him he was sitting on the edge of the bed one leg bent at the knee toward me his pants gapped where hed undone the buttons but not the zipper his belt framing the undone work he was slumping a little so that the fine muscles and lines of his stomach bunched i had a choice of looking down to his lap and what i knew was still covered by his pants or up to the beauty of his chest and shoulders and that face in a different mood i would have gone down but sometimes a man needs you to pay attention to things above the waist before you move below i sat up keeping the cover in front of my breasts because with me nude sometimes frost forgot to listen and i wanted him to hear me he sat there with his hair pooling like silver fire around his bare skin he would not look at me even though i knew he could feel the bed move as i inched close enough to touch his arm frost i love you his gray eyes rose once then went back to staring at his big hands where they lay in his lap do you love me alone without doyles body beside me my hand tightened on his arm while i tried to think what to say this was certainly a conversation i hadnt expected to be having i did love frost but i did not always love his moods i find you as desirable now as i did that first night he rewarded me with a small smile that was a very good night but you avoided answering my question he gave me the full force of his eyes then which is answer enough he started to get up and i pressed my hand on his arm not to force him but to try to keep him where he was he let me keep him sitting on the bed though he was stronger than i would ever be there that note of regret again i sighed and tried to cut through his mood and mine to get to something better is it because i turned away and did not watch you undress he nodded i dont feel well i think i am coming down with a cold he looked at me uncomprehendingly remember that some of you thought that what happened inside faerie had made me immortal like the rest of you he nodded again if im coming down with a cold then it is not so i am still mortal he put his hand over mine where it lay against his arm why would that make you look away from me i love you frost but loving you means that i will have to watch you stay young and handsome and perfect while i age this body that you love will not remain i will grow old and i will know death and i will be forced to look at you every day and know that you do not understand when i am very old you will still take off your clothes and be as beautiful as you are now you will always be our princess he said and his face showed that he was trying to understand i took my hand away and lay back on the bed staring up at that impossibly lovely face tears burned at the back of my eyes and tightened my throat so that i could choke on regret with everything that had happened today all that had gone wrong all the danger around us i was ready to cry because the men i loved would always remain as beautiful as they were today but i would not it wasnt death i feared really it was the slow decay how had maeve reeds husband borne watching her remain while he grew old how do love and sanity survive such a thing frost leaned over me and his shoulders were so broad that his hair fanned out around me like some shining tent a waterfall caught in midmotion to glitter in the dim light of my room you are young and you are beautiful this night why do you borrow such sorrows when they are far away and i am right here he whispered the last words above my lips and ended with a kiss i let him kiss me but didnt kiss him back did he not understand well of course he didnt how could he or or i pushed a hand against his chest and got enough space to look into his face have you loved someone and watched her grow old he sat back abruptly and would not look at me i wrapped my hand around as much of his wrist as i could it was too big for me to encircle it you have havent you i asked he would not look at me but finally he nodded who when i asked i saw her through a pane of glass when i was not the killing frost but just frost i was just the hoarfrost made into something alive by the belief of the people and the magic of faerie he looked at me and there was uncertainty in that look you saw me in a vision once what i began as i nodded i remembered you came to her window as jack frost i said yes what was her name rose she had golden curls and eyes like a winter sky she saw me at the window saw me and tried to tell her mother that there was a face at the window she had second sight i said he nodded i almost let it go but i couldnt i just couldnt what happened she was always alone the other children seemed to sense that she was different she made the mistake of telling them the things she could see they named her witch and her mother with her she had no father from the talk among the other villagers she had never had a father i heard them as i painted frost on their houses whispering that rose was begotten by no man but the devil they were so poor and i was just another part of the winter cold that hurt them the most i wanted so to help her he raised his big hands as if he were seeing different hands smaller and less powerful i needed to be more did you ask for help i asked he looked at me startled do you mean did i ask the goddess and consort to help me i nodded he smiled and it lightened his face made a joy shine through that he hid most of the time i did i smiled back at him and you were answered yes he said still smiling i went to sleep and when i woke i was taller stronger i found them fuel for their fire all that long winter i found them food then the joy fled from his face i took the food from the other villagers and they accused her mother of stealing rose told them that her friend left it her shining friend i took his hand in mine they accused her of withcraft i said softly yes and theft i tried to help but i didnt understand what it was to be human or even fey i was so new merry so new to being anything but ice and cold i was a thought made into a being i did not know how to be alive or what it meant you wanted to help i said he nodded my help cost them everything they were jailed and condemned to death the first time i called cold to my hands a cold so deep that it could shatter metal was for rose and her mother i broke their bars and rescued them but thats wonderful yet his hand convulsed around mine and i knew the story didnt end there can you imagine what the villagers thought when they found the metal bars shattered and the two women gone can you imagine what they thought about rose and her mother nothing they hadnt already believed i said softly perhaps but i was a piece of winter i could not build them a shelter i could not keep them warm i could do nothing but take them out into the dead of winter with every human within reach turned against them i sat up and tried to hold him but he wouldnt let me he turned away and finished his story they were dying because where i went winter followed i was still too much an elemental thing to understand my own magic when all was lost i prayed the consort came to me and he asked me if i would give up all that i was to save them i hadnt been alive very long merry and i remembered what it had been like before i didnt want to go back to that but rose lay so still in the snow her hair fading into the whiteness that i said yes i would give up all that i was if it would save them it seemed a suitable sacrifice since my meddling no matter how well intentioned had brought about their misery he stopped talking for so long that i came to him and wrapped my arms around him from behind this time he let me do it he even leaned back against the pull of my body so that i cradled his upper body against my kneeling one i whispered what happened there was music in the snow and taranis lord of light and illusion came riding on a horse made of moonlight you have no idea how amazing a golden court could be when they rode out in those days merry it wasnt just taranis who could make a steed out of light or shadow or leaves it was truly magical he and his men lifted them out of the snow and began to ride away toward the faerie mound i was content to lose her if it meant she lived i waited to be blasted back to nothingness and i was content i had saved them and my existence for theirs seemed right i wont say my life for theirs because i wasnt alive yet then not as i am now i hugged him close and he gave me more of his weight so that i leaned back against the foot of the bed and cradled him i kept one hand on his chest so i could feel his words rumbling up through his body she woke held in the lap of one of the shining court my little rose woke she cried out for her jackie for her jackie frost i came to her as i had from that first moment i came to her because i could do nothing else she pushed herself from the arms of that shining lord of the sidhe and came to me i was not as i am now merry i was young and childlike the goddess gave me a body that could do more but i was not one of the shining court i was a lesser fey in every way i suppose to human eyes i might have appeared as a boy of perhaps fourteen or younger i looked a good match for my rose he lay still in my arms what happened to her mother i asked she is still a cook at the golden court i kissed his forehead then asked what happened to rose we found shelter and i used my magic to carry her far away from her village people didnt travel then as they do now and twenty miles was enough distance that we never saw any of the others again she taught me how to be real and i grew with her what do you mean you grew with her i looked like a boy of fourteen as she was a girl of fifteen as she grew so did i it was not sword and shield that i first learned with these arms it was axe and any other work a strong back could do to help take care of his family you had children i whispered no i thought it was because i wasnt real enough now since you remain without child i wonder if it is simply not my fate to have children but you were a couple i said yes and a priest who was more friendly than christian even married us but we could not stay in any one village for long because i did not age i grew with my rose until i am as you see me now then i stopped but she did not i watched her hair turn from yellow to white her eyes fade from the blue of winter to the gray of snowy skies he looked up at me then and there was fierceness in his face i watched her fade but i loved her always because it was her love that made me real merry not faerie not wild magic but the magic of love i thought i was giving up what life i had to save rose but the consort had asked if i would give up everything i was and i did i became what she needed me to be when i realized that i would not age with her i wept because i could not imagine being without her he came to his knees and put his hands on my arms and stared down into my face i will love you always when this red hair is white i will still love you when the smooth softness of youth is replaced by the delicate softness of age i will still want to touch your skin when your face is full of the line of every smile you have ever smiled of every surprise i have seen flash through your eyes when every tear you have ever cried has left its mark upon your face i will treasure you all the more because i was there to see it all i will share your life with you meredith and i will love you until the last breath leave your body or mine he leaned down and kissed me and this time i kissed him back this time i melted into his arms his body because i could do nothing else chapter we ended with him above me his hair had come unbound and fell around us like silver rain if rain could be soft as silk and warm as your lovers body our skin glowed as if wed swallowed the moon and it was shining out of every inch of our skin i knew my hair was a mass of red shining fire because i could see the light of it from the edges of my eyes his hair began to spark and shine as he moved above me catching the light the way snow glitters in moonlight id had other lovers who brought the sun to bed with them but frost was a winters night with all its beauty and harshness he was too tall or i was too short for him to lie down on top of me it was neither enjoyable for me nor easy to breathe so he held his upper body above me with the shining strength of pale muscled arms gazing down the length of our bodies watching him slide in and out of me made me cry out made me look away as if the sight of it was too wonderful and i had to find something else for my eyes to meet what i met were his eyes his eyes were gray like a winters sky but now with his power riding him they were more than just gray in the gray of his eyes was a glimpse of a snowcovered hill with a bare winter tree upon it there was a moment of vertigo as if i could have fallen into that landscape into his eyes and been somewhere else i closed my eyes then because i was never certain where that hill was or what tree it would be the rhythm of his body in and out of mine the size of him gliding in and out of my body was beginning to fill me up the first faint glow of orgasm began to build merry merry look at me there was urgency in his voice that rough urgency that said that he too was close i opened my eyes and his were just above mine wide staring demanding that i not look away he moved one hand so that he gripped my hair near one cheek i want to watch your face he said his voice breathy and deep with effort there was snow in his eyes falling on that lonely tree and the hillside beyond something moved in his eyes a figure the rhythm of his body changed grew more urgent and it was too much i could not watch his eyes while his body ran through mine i tried to watch his body moving above mine but his grip on my hair tightened forcing my face to look up into his his face was the face of my beloved frost there was no vision in his eyes to distract me from the beauty of his face the fierceness in his eyes i whispered almost almost almost then one last thrust and almost was now i screamed and only his grip gone almost cruel in my hair kept my neck from bowing he kept our faces staring into each other tolerated no looking away we stared at each other as our bodies rode the pleasure his strength demanded that we share this the most intimate of moments with no flinching no looking away nothing to save us from the wildness in each others eyes we fell into that wildness that nearfrantic fierceness he cried out above me as i screamed my pleasure then his body collapsed atop mine and he lifted me in his arms with his body still sheathed inside me he knelt pinning me to the headboard i grabbed the wood to keep me where he seemed to want me he had gone but he was not spent he proved that as he began to pound me against the wood the bed shivering with the strength of it the entire frame of the bed protesting the abuse i screamed for him and fought to keep my hands on the wood to hold myself in place as he plunged inside me as deeply as he could deep enough from this angle that pleasure and pain rode each other as frost rode me i let go of the bed and ran my nails down his white skin where i bled him the glow of his skin split but it wasnt blood that ran out blue glowing lines followed the lines of my mails and painted our skin there was a moment when i saw a thorn vine around my forearm and the head of a stag traced across his chest his body shuddered against mine inside mine as i painted his body with my pleasure and his pain he pressed me in his arms so that i saw the glow on his shoulder and that sign of power i had seen before as the vine on my arm i realized that the tattoo that had first appeared in faerie was the same image as in his eyes we stayed frozen a moment pressed against the headboard his heart beat so fast and so hard i felt it against the side of my face like a hand he took us slowly to our sides so that we finally lay across the head of the bed on what pillows had not been knocked off i had forgotten how magnificent you could be frost the voice was not mine it came from the mirror where a second before i could not have moved fear made me sit up and grab for spilled sheets dont cover yourselves andais said from the mirror we drew the sheets over us i said do not cover yourselves or have i ceased to be your queen there was an evil tone in her voice that made us push the sheets back shed seen the end of our lovemaking no reason to be shy now i supposed frost kept himself pressed against me so that he was as hidden as he could manage i found my voice first and said my queen what brings you to our mirror i thought i would see rhys with you or was that a lie when you said youd be with him rhys will have his turn my queen she stared at frost as if i were not there i looked at him his body dewed with the sweat of his exertions his hair a glorious tangle of silver to decorate all that pale muscled strength he was beautiful beautiful in a way that even among the sidhe not everyone could boast ironic that one who had not begun as sidhe would be among our most handsome men but now that i knew that he had been shaped by love not a desire for power but selfless love i understood for love makes us all beautiful the look on your face meredith as you gaze upon him what are you thinking love aunt andais i am thinking of love she made a disgusted sound know this niece of mine if the killing frost is not your king i will have him back and i will see if he is as good as he looks he was your lover once hundreds of years ago i remember she said but not like it made her happy i didnt understand the look on her face or the tone of her voice i didnt truly understand why she had been so determined to catch me with rhys or was she eager to catch me without him was she looking for an excuse to order rhys back to faerie if yes then why she had never treated him as one of her favorites not in the memory of anyone i knew i see fear in your eyes my killing frost she said my arms tightened around him i couldnt help it would you protect him from me meredith i would protect all my people from harm but this one is special to you isnt he yes i said because anything else would be a lie frost look at me she ordered it he raised his eyes to her are you afraid of me frost he swallowed hard enough that it sounded painful and said in a voice gone rough yes my queen i fear you you love meredith dont you he answered yes my queen he loves you niece but he fears me i think you will discover that fear is a more potent threat than love i dont want to threaten him one day you will one day you will find that all the love in faerie is not enough to keep the man you love obedient you will want fear on your side and you are too soft to wield it i am not frightening i know that aunt andais i look at you and i see the future of my court and i despair if love is the future of our court aunt andais then i am hopeful she looked once more at frost as if he was something to eat and she was starving i hate you meredith i truly do i fought not to say what i was thinking but she said your face betrays you say what is in your mind niece i hate you meredith what does that make you want to say to me i hate you too andais smiled like she meant it the bed behind her had been stripped down to its bare essentials apparently crystalls torture had produced too much blood even for her to sleep in i think i will have mistral tonight meredith i will do to that strong body what i did to crystall earlier i cannot stop you i said not yet you cant with that the mirror was blank again i was left staring at my own startled reflection frost did not look at the mirror he just crawled off the bed and started getting dressed he didnt even bother to clean up first he just seemed to need to be dressed and i guess i couldnt blame him he spoke without looking at me all his concentration on getting his nakedness covered as quickly as possible i told you once that i would rather die than go back to her i meant it meredith i know you did i said he started buckling on his weapons i still mean it i reached up to him he took my hand kissed it and gave me the saddest smile id ever seen frost i if you are going to be with rhys before evening id use another room i would not want her as an audience again today ill do as you suggest im going to check on doyle he had his clothes in place and all his weapons he was tall and handsome and coldly beautiful he was my killing frost as arrogant and unreadable as when id first met him but i carried with me the memory of his eyes wide and frantic as he plunged inside my body i knew what lay inside that cool controlled man and i valued every glimpse of the real frost a glimpse of the man who had fallen in love with a peasants daughter and given up everything he ever knew to be with her he walked out of the room tall and straight and to most eyes unmoved but i knew why he left me there in the bed he left because he was terrified that his queen would come back for a second peek chapter i took frosts advice and went to one of the smaller guest rooms in maeve reeds huge guesthouse shed offered us the main house while she was away in europe where shed fled because taranis had tried to kill her twice with magic maybe soon we could tell her that taranis was no longer a threat to her or anyone but i still had to get through today id have liked to have found a place of our own by now but with nearly twenty men to house and feed i couldnt afford it i was still refusing to take aid from my aunt i knew all too well how long and dangerous were the strings that she attached to all favors the adrenaline had worn off and i was more tired than when i had started the day i was coming down with something dammit i believed frost would love me but i wasnt sure how i would feel aging while they all remained young and fair there were moments when i wasnt certain that i was a good enough person to be a good sport about that the room was dark blackout curtains had been added to the rooms only window the mirror over the dresser had been removed so that the wall was blank and peaceful there would be no unexpected calls in here it was one of the reasons id chosen the room i needed rest and i had had all i wanted of surprise mirror calls today kitto had joined me and he lay curled beside me under the smooth softness of clean cotton sheets his dark curls rested on the curve of one of my shoulders his breath warm on the mound of my breast his arm lay over my stomach his leg over my thigh his other arm up where he could play idly with my hair he was the only man in my guard shorter than i was short enough that he could curl around me as i curled around the taller men he was one of the first men to join me in exile in the weeks that hed been away from faerie doyle had forced him to use the gym there was muscle under the white smoothness of his moonlight skin now muscle that had never been there before he was with the face of an angel that had never quite gotten through puberty but then goblins dont have to shave and in that his body had taken after that half of his heritage i played with the soft curls of his hair which had grown to touch the tops of his broadening shoulders the hair was as soft as galens as soft as my own my other hand was curled around his back my fingers traced the smooth line of scaled skin that ran down his spine the scales looked dark in dim light but in brighter light his skin ran with rainbows in the kissable mouth that rested against my breast were retractable fangs connected to poison glands his father had been a snake goblin the fact that his father had raped his mother instead of eating her was unusual apparently snake goblins were a cold lot in every way passion did not move them but something about kittos mother had wakened heat in his fathers cold heart she had then abandoned her baby beside a goblin mound when she realized what he was goblins have been known to eat their own young and sidhe flesh is highly prized his own mother had put him out to be killed instead hed been taken in by a goblin female who had meant to raise him to a bigger size to eat him but something about kitto had moved her too and she had not had the heart to kill him there was something in him that did indeed bring out the desire to care to take care of to protect he had offered his life to save mine more than once yet i still could not see him as my protector he raised huge almondshaped eyes to me a swimming pure blue the way holly and ashs eyes were completely one color except kittos eyes were blue a wonderful clear blue like a pale sapphire or a morning sky who are you hiding from today merry he asked voice gentle i smiled at him from my nest of pillows how do you know im hiding its why you come here to hide i traced the edge of his cheek but for a few chance genes he would have been like holly and ash tall and sidhe beautiful with the extra strength and stamia of the goblins i told you im not feeling well he smiled and propped himself up on one elbow so that he was looking slightly down at me that is true but there is a sorrow to you that i would lift if you only tell me how just dont make me talk of politics i need to rest if i am to do my duty tonight he traced his finger down the side of my face from temple to chin it was a long slow movement that made me close my eyes and catch my breath is that how you see the goblins you will bed tonight as a duty i opened my eyes it is not that they are goblins that makes them a duty he smiled sliding his hand into my hair i know that it is who they are what they are and you do not feel your best they frighten me kitto his face was sober i fear them too did they ever use you ill they have not much liking for male flesh i have serviced them a time or two when they came to bed my master kitto had survived in a culture more violent than any in faerie by doing what some people have to do in prison to survive they choose someone powerful or are chosen and become their property it was looked down upon but strangely was honored as a profession on one hand goblins like kitto were the victims of cruel humor on the other hand they were highly valued by their masters master was not a sexist term in goblin nomenclature it could be male or female it was simply the term for one who owned a slave serviced them i made it a question i believe in pornography i would be what is termed a fluffer they do everything together do the brothers i helped keep one ready while the other finished he said it as if it were the most normal thing in the world there was no condemnation no anger nothing it was the way of his world once the only world hed known until his king gave him to me i tried very hard to give kitto choices in his new life but i had to be careful because too many choices made him anxious his entire world had literally changed he had never seen electricity or a television he was now living on the estate of one of hollywoods leading actresses though hed never seen a single one of her movies he was much more impressed that she had once been the goddess conchenn a secret that hollywood did not know i will be with you tonight merry i will help you i cant ask you he put his fingers against my lips you do not have to ask none of your other men will know goblin culture as i do i do not say that i could protect you from them but i can keep you from falling into traps of custom i kissed his fingers and moved his hand away from my mouth so i could lay another kiss against the palm of his hand i wanted to say i cant let you because they abused you but he didnt see it that way to tell him it was abuse when he didnt think it was seemed wrong it was his culture not mine who was i to throw stones after what id seen in andaiss bed today poor crystall there was a soft knock on the door i sighed and snuggled deeper into the pillows i did not want to deal with another crisis today i had one all nice and scheduled for later tonight when the goblin twins arrived kitto leaned over and whispered against my hair you are princess you can tell them to go away i cant tell them to go away until i know what they want i called out who is it its rhys kitto and i exchanged a look he widened his eyes his version of a shrug he was right it would have to be something important for rhys to willingly see me in bed with a goblin any goblin he even liked kitto or at least had sat up late with him introducing him to marathon film noir movie sessions hed gone along with galen when the two of them took kitto shopping for modern clothes but rhys always left if it got physical with kitto whatever would bring rhys willingly into this room had to be important important today meant bad shit out loud i said come in kitto started to move away from me as if he were going to leave but i grabbed his arm and kept him propped on his elbow above me this is your room you dont leave kitto looked doubtful but he stayed where i wanted him he was good that way he followed orders beautifully which was more than i could say for most of the other men rhys walked in closing the door quietly behind him i studied his face and he looked peaceful enough doyle is a very stubborn man even for a sidhe youre just figuring that out i asked rhys grinned fair enough i knew it already he still wont let merry sit by his side kitto asked he looked perfectly at ease beside me now as if he had never considered moving away rhys moved farther into the room as he spoke he says i am to protect her not she me he further says that you need your rest for tonight not to sit and worry over him i would have cuddled him while we both slept i said his loss our gain rhys said grinning again he took off his jacket our gain kitto said a lilt of surprise in his voice rhys paused jacket in one hand his shoulder holster was very stark against the pale blue of his shirt though shoulder holster implied that it was just for guns and that wasnt true at all all the men who had been with me for a few months had custom rigs made i suspect by one of the leather workers inside faerie no human could have made them so quickly and so perfectly there were also intricate designs worked into the leather and nearly ingenious ways to carry as many weapons as possible and still be able to slip modern jackets over them all rhys stood there with a gun under one arm and a knife on the other a second gun rode at his waist there was also a short sword belted somehow across his back so that the hilt stuck a little out from behind his back on one side he could grab it sort of like a gun worn at the small of the back i touched you in the lawyers office and didnt feel all the weapons i said theres a spell that affects sight and touch if you didnt pick up on it then its as good as promised rhys replied why did i see the swords at frost and doyles back the enchantment only works if you dont break the line of the clothing covering the holster they keep insisting on huge swords that show around the edges of the jackets so you see the swords it also makes it more likely that people will notice their guns and other weapons once you draw attention to what amounts to an illusion it begins to break down you know that but i didnt realize that was what the leather rigs were bespelled he shrugged it must have cost a pretty penny they were gifts he said i gave him wide eyes not this much magical work you made yourself pretty popular among the lesser fey when you gave your little speech in the hallway about how most of your friends were below stairs when you were a child not among the sidhe its true i said yes but it also helped win them to you that and you being part brownie a lesser fey did the leather work i asked he nodded while the sidhe have lost most of their magic the lesser fey have held on to more than we knew i think they were afraid to point out to the sidhe that the lesser fey hadnt faded as much as the greater fey wise of them i said rhys was at the foot of the bed now not that i dont like my nifty new leather rig but are you delaying so you can think of a polite way to send me away or is there a question you dont want to ask actually i am interested in the magic on the leather we may need all the magical help we can get soon but this is the first time youve willingly come into kittos room when ive been with him were wondering whats up he nodded and looked down as if gathering his thoughts unless you object either of you id like to join you for afternoon cuddling he raised his face and displayed one of the most neutral expressions id ever seen from him he usually hid his emotions behind a wry humor today he was serious it wasnt like him my opinion doesnt count kitto said but he scooted down beside me pulling the sheet up to cover most of himself rhys put his jacket over one arm weve been over this kitto youre sidhe now which means you get to be as opinionated as the rest of us oh please i said not as opinionated as all that kittos sort of refreshingly undemanding rhys smiled at me are we that bad sometimes i said youre not as bad as some like doyle he said frost said kitto then seemed shocked at his insult of the other man he actually covered his face with the sheet snuggling tightly against the side of my body but there was a tension to him now that had nothing to do with sex he was frightened was he frightened of rhys he had tried to hurt if not kill kitto on at least one occasion when i first brought him to los angeles apparently a few movies and shopping trips couldnt make up for earlier hostility sort of like parents trying to win over kids in a divorce if youre mean all the treats in the world dont make up for it later rhys had been mean and kitto had been hiding that he was still afraid of the other man i had missed it completely i had thought we were as much a big happy family as we were going to get how could i rule these people if i couldnt even keep peace and safety among my own lovers i dont think kittos comfortable with you being here rhys i said i stroked kittos back under the covers he snuggled harder against me as if afraid of what i would ask him i didnt understand why servicing holly and ash didnt bother him but rhys did maybe it was a cultural thing that i didnt understand because i wasnt goblin enough i would be their high queen but i would never truly be goblin they were our foot soldiers our strong arm and most likely to be cannon fodder the red caps were our shock troops but i was missing something right this minute about the goblin in my bed he was truly sidhe by birth of his magic but in his heart he was and always would be goblin just as there was more human to me because id gone to human schools and had human friends that more than genetics made me more human than i would have been more american than i would have been in the way i thought sometimes i wondered if my father would have found another excuse to raise me outside of faerie if andais hadnt tried to kill me father had felt that it was very important that i understand our new country kitto rhys said i know i was awful to you once but ive tried to make up for it kittos voice came out muffled did you do all of it just to make up rhys seemed to think about it at the beginning but youre the only one who will watch more than two gangster movies in a row with me and actually enjoy them the others tolerate it or were you just being polite kitto spoke still under the covers i like james cagney hes short yeah i like that about him too rhys said you are not small kitto said for a sidhe i am kitto pulled an edge of cover down so he could see the other man i lay there unneeded this was a guy moment that had strangely turned into a girl moment id noticed with kitto that the guy silence didnt quite work he had an almost feminine need to talk to express his thoughts and feelings or they werent real to him edward g robinson is short too kitto said softly rhys smiled bogart wasnt all that tall either really they make him look tall apple crates and camera angles rhys said kitto didnt ask what he meant by apple crates which meant that theyd already had a talk about shorter actors standing on things to look taller for the camera it was also a cheap way to make your villain or hero look like he was strong enough to lift someone onehanded ah bmovie magic kitto came a little farther out of the covers what do you want rhys i want to apologize that i ever thought you were like holly and ash and the rest i am not strong like they are kitto said rhys shook his head you are kind and you crave kindness that isnt a sin you have explained this concept of sin and if i understand it then yes rhys it is a sin to be weak among the goblins a sin that most often ends in death rhys sat on the corner of the bed kitto didnt flinch which was a big improvement i heard that youre going to help merry with the goblins tonight said rhys yes kitto said we took another call from the goblins since merry came in here ah here it comes i thought kitto sat up drawing his knees tight in a hug sliding the covers around him and a little off of me what has happened kurag goblin king was surprised that you would be willing to help with the brothers tonight he said that holly used you as a trollop when he couldnt find a female he liked a lot of them used me when i was between masters kitto said it as if it were just ordinary he said one of your masters was a favorite of the brothers and that you helped with that too i knew kurag hadnt used the word helped goblins were blunt about sex except for ones like kitto who had spent their lives having to be servile strangely the weaker goblins were the ones who were best at diplomacy among their kind when a mispoken word can get you killed or maimed i guess you learn to mind your tongue i know it had helped make me cautious my last master enjoyed their company what happened to your last master rhys asked she grew tired of me and set me free to find a new master he touched my arm you see merry as your new master rhys said yes that was news to me kitto i said and he looked at me do you feel you have no choice when i ask you to do something what you ask of me is pleasant you are the best master i have ever had it wasnt quite the answer id wanted i looked at rhys trying to convey with my eyes help me figure out how to ask this question rhys answered it himself you arent going to break a lifetime of habit with a few months of safety merry he was right but i didnt like the fact that kitto felt that he had little choice in his new life you are sidhe kitto i said but i am also goblin he said as if that settled it maybe it did why would you volunteer to be with merry tonight with ash and holly rhys asked no one else here truly understands what they are capable of i must be there to see that if harm happens it is not merry that it happens to you mean youll take the abuse so she doesnt have to rhys said kitto nodded i sat up and hugged him i dont want you to be hurt either he leaned into the hug and that is why i would take the hurt willingly besides i am harder to hurt than you are if you will allow me i will join you and merry this afternoon rhys said tonight you mean i said no i dont know if im that strong yet he looked down then up but it was not me he looked at i dont know if i am as strong as my friend friend kitto made it a question rhys nodded how can you say you are not as strong as me kitto asked i was the victim of the goblins who hurt me for a single night yet i have feared and hated all goblins for years you have taught me that it was wrong but i still dont know if i am strong enough to be in the room when merry goes to the goblins tonight i dont know if i can stand to be in the room and watch and guard her you had years of hurt by the very goblins who will be here tonight yet you will give yourself to them to protect merry i say to you kitto that is a kind of bravery that i do not have his single beautiful eye shimmered in the dimness kitto reached out and touched his arm you are brave i have seen it rhys shook his head and closed his eye one lone tear trailed down his face shining more than any human tear would have in the twilight of the room kitto touched that single tear with one fingertip he offered the trembling drop to me but i shook my head he raised it to his lips and rhys watched him lick his tear off of his finger tears were not as precious as blood and other fluids but they were still gifts i knew that sometimes the goblins tortured simply to gather tears the sidhe would make you cry but they didnt value the tears can i join you rhys asked and i knew it wasnt me he was asking kitto gazed into his face and finally nodded yes chapter rhyss clothes and weapons ended in a heap by the bed stripped he was as amazing as ever there were guards who had longer waists or broader shoulders but no one had the sculpted muscles in stomach chest arms and legs that rhys did all of him was smooth and hard and strong the bed wouldnt have been big enough for me and two of most of the other men but kitto and rhys both took up less room than most there was room for the three of us i lay between the smooth muscled weight of the two of them and it felt so good the sensation of it made me close my eyes and simply concentrate on the feel of their bodies against mine i had needed this to be comforted by people who cared for me to be held and not to have to worry had doyle understood that i would have lain there tense listening for his pain sounds and not truly rested perhaps he had only now as rhys and kitto ran their hands over me laid a kiss on first one shoulder then the other did i realize that it wasnt about sex today it was about needing to be held needing to be cared for was i so weak that i needed this even when the man i said i loved was injured would i ever be truly content with the touch of just one man no matter who it was i didnt love doyle any less as i lay between the two men but they gave me something he could not they gave me uncomplicated touch i did not love either of them in that way i loved them but but their tears did not cut my heart their sorrows made me sorrow but i did not bleed as they bled love makes you weak and strong there had been that moment earlier today when id thought my darkness was no more it had been like losing a piece of myself it had frozen me made me lose focus dangerous it was but hadnt i done the same thing when galen had nearly died by assassination in faerie yes i had id loved galen since i was a child a part of me would always love him but it was the love of a child and i was no longer a child youre not paying attention rhys said i blinked up at him where he lay beside me i must have looked surprised because he laughed your body was enjoying being touched but your mind was a thousand miles from this bed the humor died leaving his face a little sad has it happened already do doyle and frost get all of you now it took me a moment to understand what he meant no its not that shes thinking of politics and power kitto said from where his head lay on my hip and thigh rhys looked at the other man in the middle of foreplay shes thinking about politics oh thats even worse she often touches me and thinks at the same time it seems to clear her mind rhys looked down at me from where he was propped up on his elbow did all that touching simply clear your head it was an insult to have not been paying attention i was enjoying it rhys honestly but my mind is racing a thousand miles an hour i cant seem to make it still i looked down my body to kitto do i truly use you simply to clear my mind i cannot be king for you we all know that i am content to have a place in your life merry i wait upon you and do tasks that most of your nobleborn lords deem beneath them i can be your ladyinwaiting and no one else could do that for you we have several sidhe women now rhys said if merry wanted more ladiesinwaiting she could have them we do not trust them alone with our princess after only a few weeks out of cels service kitto said rhyss face darkened no we dont not yet i love that no one can do these things for merry but me kitto said i stroked his curls really i asked he smiled at me and it filled his eyes with something more than just happiness he had a place in my life he belonged it is not merely happiness we all seek we seek some place where we belong for the lucky few we find it in childhood with our own families but for most of us we spend our adult lives seeking that place or person or organization that makes us feel that we are important that we matter and that without us something would go undone and undoable we all need to feel that we are irreplaceable you do not touch anyone else but me to simply clear your head you come to my room when you need to hide from the demands that the others put upon you you come to me when you want to think you touch me i touch you sometimes there is sex but often there is just the holding he snuggled his cheek against my thigh no one has ever held me for comfort before i find that i like it very much i thought about everything hed just said and couldnt argue with it i thought you hid in kittos room because it was the only one without a mirror rhys said that too i said she does not just come to me in my room she pets me when i am sitting under her desk she has gone from seeing me always at her feet as a burden to counting on me being there to touch and be touched do the dogs ever crowd you under the desk rhys asked the dogs dont seem to stay under the desk when kitto is there i looked at him my fingers playing in his hair did you do something to the dogs my place is at your feet merry they cannot have my place they are dogs kitto no matter how special and magical they may be they are dogs you are not he smiled and it was a little sad around the edges but dogs fill many of the needs i fill for you i have seen you stroking them watched it calm you are you more jealous of the dogs than of the rest of us rhys asked yes kitto said that made me sad that he would see himself as so unimportant to me kitto you are important to me touching you is not like petting the dogs he moved his face so i could not see his eyes he hid it by kissing my thigh but he didnt want me to see his expression you are my princess id learned that the phrase you are my princess meant various things that i was being stubborn and i was wrong but since he couldnt change my mind hed stop trying it could also mean that hed thought of something frightening and didnt want to share or that id done something to hurt his feelings but he didnt feel that he had a right to complain so much one small phrase the goblins dont keep dogs they never have rhys said i looked at him but faerie dogs are precious to all of faerie the goblins used to eat them i looked at kitto who still wouldnt give show his face he kissed a little lower on my thigh which meant rhys was probably right if any of the dogs turn up missing i wont be happy see kitto said they are important enough for you to threaten me over them they are our pets and a gift of the goddess and the wild magic i know what they mean to all of you but it is not me who you should caution holly and ash will likely be too busy to worry over fresh meat but they are bringing the red caps to guard them the red caps will be wandering about while you have sex with the brothers the red caps like their meat fresh and wriggling crap rhys said i knew that but its been so many years since ive had any dealings with the red caps i forgot they didnt help torture you i asked before i could catch the thought no they remembered me before as cromm cruach when i shed much blood for them to play in they still feel that they owe me from back then that must have been some bloodbath for them to feel they owe you anything after so many centuries i said it was rhyss turn to look away so i couldnt see his expression one of my names translated to red claw it was a true name i understood that true name meant it was accurate in its description i gazed at him so pale and handsome beside me his face was that boyishly handsome with that full kissable mouth the scars were the only thing that made you see past the artifice of youth and humor without them to remind you that serious things had happened to this unaged man you might mistake him for someone casual someone to be dismissed he had certainly played that part for years at the court i traced the edge of the scarred area once he would have pulled away but he knew now that to me the scars were just another texture on his body just more things to touch and kiss he smiled down at me and it made his face even more beautiful in that way that a lovers face can suddenly shine down at you not with magic but simply with pleasure in something you said or did what i asked voice soft in all the long years since they took my eye you are the only person who ever touched me like this i frowned up at him and laid my hand against his face the edge of the scar just another area under my hand like what he gave me a look as if i knew exactly what we are unseelie things that others consider imperfections are marks of beauty among us i said only if you are not sidhe rhys said to be truly scarred and sidhe is to be a living reminder that their perfect beauty could be forever marred i am the ghost in the mirror merry i remind them that we are only longlived mortals not truly immortal me too i said he smiled down at me again pressing his face harder against my hand its one of the reasons i always thought wed make a good couple i frowned at him what dont you remember i took you on a date when you were sixteen i remember i let my hand fall back to the sheet i remember that you tried to persuade me to have sex with you which would have gotten us both executed i didnt actually try for intercourse i just wanted to see which flavor of your family you took after i was frowning harder what does that mean he smiled gently this time depending on how you responded to my overtures he waggled his eyebrows at the last word and made me laugh i would decide whether to approach your father i had an inkling of where this was going you asked my father if you could be my fiancé i asked him to consider me you or he never told me that it seemed clear from the beginning of all this that i wasnt a frontrunner for your heart you loved galen more than me even when you were sixteen then your father gave you to griffin and if you had gotten pregnant that would have been that my face clouded over at the mention of my exfiancé hed dumped me after years said i was too human not sidhe enough for him what he hadnt realized was that once he dumped me andais would force him back into celibacy with the rest of the guard he tried to join my little harem and i turned him down the only reason he wanted to join was to have sex with someone anyone he didnt love me i knew that what i hadnt expected was him selling some rather intimate photos of the two of us to the tabloids i had loved him once i wasnt certain he had ever loved me he had sold the pictures and fled faerie to my knowledge the long arm of faerie had never caught up with him to my knowledge i hadnt asked i had loved him once i did not want to know how hed died or be presented his head in a basket aunt andais was capable of both or worse rhys touched my cheek made me look up at him i shouldnt have mentioned his name im sorry but i hadnt thought about him in a while until i brought him up rhys said kitto moved minutely on the other side of me until that moment hed been so still i had almost forgotten that he was there he was very good at that but naked in a bed with me and rhys and still able to be nearly unnoticed i was beginning to wonder if it was a sort of magic if it was then it wasnt sidhe snake goblins were used mostly for scouts spying the lay of the land maybe they all possessed a natural talent for going unnoticed if they wished i looked at him but didnt ask out loud if it was magic kitto would not believe it was magic even if it was he saw himself as powerless and that was that perhaps i should leave the two of you alone he said its your room and your bed rhys said yes but i will share it with my friend even if im not included rhys reached across me and patted the other mans shoulder that is a generous offer kitto but i think there will be no sex this afternoon what i asked he smiled down at me your mind is full of all that has happened today as a queens mind should be it makes for a good ruler but bad sex i started to protest but he cradled my chin in his hand its okay merry maybe what we all need right now is to hold each other maybe its about closeness rhys his hand moved so that he covered my mouth lightly with his hand its all right really i kissed the palm of his hand then moved it away from my mouth i understand now why not galen hes a political disaster but you you do politics just fine thanks for the compliment so why i asked why did your father not choose me he asked i nodded kitto slipped out of the bed this is sidhe business stay rhys said kitto hesitated prince essus told me that there was enough death in your life he wanted you paired with someone whose magic was about life griffins magic was beauty and sex it complemented what your father hoped you would grow into magically rhys played with the edge of my hair he was right if you were goblin kitto said beauty and sex would be useless it would condemn you to be a slave to someone stronger and more able to fight your powers rhys they would be valued above such soft things essus wanted something softer for his daughter rhys said he would never have chosen doyle would he i asked it would never have occurred to him that the queens darkness could ever be parted from her side but no i think if i was too harsh for his daughter to marry then doyle would have been out too i hadnt thought about who my father might have chosen for me among my guards hadnt you he asked no kitto had picked his jeans up off the floor where hed let them fall i will leave you two to talk stay rhys said help me understand why its you merry comes to when she wants to relax im not her hearts desire im not even the one who makes her heart beat fast by a feathers touch i need to find a place in her life too help teach me how to be something new i will not teach you my place for you will replace me i will never be as undemanding of merry as you are i have neither the personality nor the patience but teach me to be a little less pressure so that she might turn to me for something oh rhys i said he shook his head sending all that curly white hair sliding around his shoulders you like me youve always liked me you enjoy sex with me but you do not burn for me strangely you burn for colder things even than my powers i am unseelie sidhe you are also seelie sidhe i am part that yes but i am also part human and part brownie but if you pushed me to name myself what i am i am unseelie he smiled a sad sort of smile i know that andais accused me of remaking the unseelie court into a mirror of the seelie i am not doing it on purpose remember what i said about you when you were sixteen that i wanted to see which side of your family you took after rhys asked yes i wanted you to take after the seelie side of your family my grandfather is an abusive bastard my uncle is mad my mother is a cold envious social climber why would you want that in your life i dont mean their personalities and i dont even mean the ones you referred to remember i knew your ancestors before they were lost in the great wars in europe i knew some of the women of your mothers line they were goddesses of fertility love lust they were a warm lot merry in that good earthy way so what you wondered if i had taken after my greatgreat aunt aunts rhys said and a greatgrandmother or two you reminded me of them the hair the eyes i saw them in you no one else did i said no one else was looking i rose and gave him a kiss the kiss grew until i felt his body grow hard again where all the talk had made it soft he broke from my lips with a sound that was almost pain i cant keep being the gentleman if you keep kissing me like that then dont be the gentleman be my lover kitto finished fastening his jeans i will leave you to what the sidhe do best other than magic you are my friend rhys i believe that but you are not comfortable with me in the bed with you and the princess rhys started to protest it was my turn to put my fingers on his lips hes right he moved my hand i know dammit i know i thought if i could have sex with kitto and you i could guard you tonight with the goblins but i cant you have come a long way on the subject of goblins rhys its all right who will guard you tonight if doyle is injured and my sensibilities are too delicate i dont know i said and right this second i dont care make love to me rhys now just you be with me help chase my thoughts to stillness i rose and kissed him again and drew him down to me with arms and hands and eagerness i did not hear the door close quietly behind kitto but when next i opened my eyes we were alone chapter rhys made me lie on my stomach and began to breathe his way down my back i would have said kiss but it was too gentle for that he caressed the skin with the barest touch of lips and breath when he got low enough he began to breathe and work those tiny nearinvisible hairs on the lower back so that my body ran with goose bumps and involuntary shivers i raised my hips minutely from the bed in a silent invitation for him to do more he laughed that laugh of his that was masculine pleasure and his own amusement but for once there was nothing of selfmockery in it he laid a more solid kiss against the small of my back i writhed for him letting him know without words how wonderful it was he laid his weight on top of me resting the hard long length of himself between the cheeks of my ass the feel of it made me cry out he wrapped his arms around me forced me enough off the bed so he could cup my breasts in his hands he held me tightly and firmly in the strength of his body if i truly loved you he whispered i would do what kitto has done i would refuse to have intercourse with you i would take myself out of the race for king kitto did it because he knows that neither court would ever let a half goblin sit as your king theyd kill you both first he settled himself more firm against me pushing his hips just a little it made me writhe as much as the weight of him would allow but the seriousness in his voice didnt match what his body was doing rhys continued to whisper against my hair i know you love doyle and frost hell you even love galen more than you love me even now when youve both realized what a political liability he would be as king sometimes we have just oral sex now when we are together rhys tensed above me and not in a sexual way but as if he was thinking has he taken himself out of the race for king not completely but sometimes we dont do anything to make babies we just pleasure each other interesting he said and it wasnt a seductive whisper this time i tried to rise but he kept me pressed to the bed with a squeeze of his arms a flex of his hips i spoke trapped underneath him why is it interesting galen has taken himself out of the running for king because he knows he isnt strong enough to help keep you alive but he loves you utterly loves you he loves you enough to give you up if thats whats best for you gallant galen i hadnt thought about it that way but rhys was right it was gallant and horribly brave galen still had a chance to be the father of my child but the last few times wed made love he had only used his chance for intercourse once the rest had been amazingly fun but nothing that would have made a baby rhys wrapped those strong arms tight so tight it was almost hard to breathe he whispered against my ear his breath hot if i truly loved you i would take myself out of the running for king i would help you get your hearts desire which is doyle and frost but i am too selfish merry i cannot give you up without a fight i spoke in the voice that his grip allowed me breathy it isnt a fight yes he whispered fiercely yes it is not of strength of arms maybe but it is a battle for some of us the prize is to be king but for most of us merry we would want you as our prize even if there was no throne he shoved his body against mine hard and fierce until i cried out for him then he squeezed me even tighter until i thought i would have to ask him to stop so i could breathe his voice was somewhere between a whisper and a hiss against my ear so fierce so full of emotion i want to win merry i want you even if it breaks your heart i am a selfish bastard merry i wont give you up not even to see you happy i lay underneath him and didnt know what to say he squeezed harder and i finally had to protest rhys please he eased the grip of his arms just enough so that i could draw a good breath but his fingers squeezed my breasts hard and firm the harshness of it drew small noises from me you like sex rougher than i do things that are simply pain to me make you shiver with pleasure his grip on my breasts eased the goblins will do worse than that tonight to you and you will enjoy it wont you ive negotiated for pleasure tonight rhys he rubbed his face against my hair i could give you up to doyle or frost or galen if i had to it would kill something in me but i could do it but i could not bare to lose you to ash and holly i could not bear to have my merry married to goblins fucking goblins every night a sound escaped him that was almost a sob rhys i said i no dont say it whatever it is let me finish i may never have the courage to say it all again i went still under him i lay there with his body wrapped around me and let him talk if that was what he needed i hate the thought of them with you tonight merry i hate more that you are excited by the thought of them tying you up and fucking you god i hate that maybe most of all his arms tightened around me once more see i dont love you not really if i loved you truly loved you id want you to be happy id want you to have the sex you enjoy not just the sex i think you should have but thats not what i want for you i want you to be gentler than you are i want you to want sex the way i make it the way i like it i hate that you want things that i think are pain and not pleasure i hate knowing that though you enjoy sex with me its not everything you need or want he dug his fingers into my breasts again until i cried out again and my body bucked under his he let go of me abruptly pushing himself above my body so that his arms framed me on either side but his hips were tighter against me because i hate the thought of the goblins with you tonight because i want you with me more than i want you happy because i am a selfish bastard im going to fill your body with my seed and im going to pray while i do it im going to call power while i do it i want you pregnant with my child consort help me but i do goddess help me but i do not so we will all live not so cel wont sit the throne and divide us in civil war no nothing so noble merry i want it because i want you even knowing you dont want me i do want you i said and turned so i could look at him over my shoulder the look on his face was one that i would never forget so fierce so desperate so wild but not with sex or even lust or love the look on his face was full of an awful loss if id been sending him out to do battle with sword and shield i wouldnt have let him go because the look on his face was the look of a man who knew he wouldnt be coming back the face of a man who knew he would lose this day die this day i would have held him back from the battle i would have made him stay by my side and kept him alive another day but this was not a battlefield i could protect him from it was my body and heart and they had already chosen he shook his head no pity merry at least save me that i turned away then turned so he could not see the tears that shimmered in my eyes it was the only way i could save him from my pity i did love him but not the way he needed me to love him he was right even our sexual appetites did not match he jerked my hips up off the bed i tried to get up on all fours for him but he forced my head down so that my lower body was raised like an offering to him i felt the head of him pushing against me but i was still too tight for the angle i said youll need to use a finger to start im too tight with no foreplay for this position he kept pushing at my body harder fiercer youll hurt yourself rhys i said from where my face was almost buried against the pillows i want it to hurt he said then i felt him break the surface of me find the barest part of himself inside me and i stopped protesting he forced himself inside me fighting the tightness and the lack of wetness of my body if i had been wired differently it would have hurt it wasnt that i couldnt be hurt i could even intercourse for me could be done so it was only pain but you had to work at it you had to be bad at it bad in a way that rhys was not i started screaming for him my body orgasming simply from the feel of him forcing his way inside me not just one orgasm but waves of them rolling over and over my body making me writhe and push myself against the force and strength of him the pleasure of it spilled out of my mouth in one ragged scream after another i screamed yes and god and goddess and finally at the end i screamed his name over and over and over rhys oh god rhys the dim room filled with the light of our bodies glowing like twin moons of rising power he made my skin run with light he dug his hand into the shining garnet of my hair and jerked my throat backward as he rode me the roughness of it made me scream again but he let go of my hair as his body began to fight him for rhythm his breathing changed and i knew he was close close and fighting to last that little bit longer so that i would scream underneath him for just a little bit longer i was on all fours where his grip had moved me my breasts hung down slapping together from the fury of his sex i screamed my pleasure i filled the room with his name like a prayer to some angry god then his body made one last tremendous thrust so deep inside me that i knew it should have hurt but there was too much pleasure for real pain his body shivered above me thrusting again deep inside me i felt him spill himself inside me in a hot wash of seed and power hed said he would pray while he fucked me hed said hed use his power to make me his i should have been afraid but i wasnt i couldnt be afraid of rhys i collapsed underneath him with his body still buried inside me he lay on top of me both of us too spent to move our breathing a ragged sound our hearts still in our throats the glow of our bodies began to fade as our pulses slowed he finally rolled off slowly i lay where i was too limp to move yet he lay on his back still breathing heavily he spoke in a voice still harsh from exertion the way you react to roughness urges a man on merry even when you didnt think youd like it you were amazing i whispered my own voice a little rough from the screaming he smiled at me you really dont have any idea how good you are at this do you im good or so im told he shook his head no merry no joke you are amazing in bed and on the floor and on a sturdy table i laughed he smiled at me and it was almost the old rhys before he got so serious on me then that seriousness peeked out again i know that the goblins will have you tonight and there is nothing i can do about it his face went from serious to angry but when they shove themselves inside you tonight theyll be shoving my seed farther in rhys no its all right i know youre doing your duty as queen we need the goblins as our allies and this is the way to get the treaty lengthened i know politically that its a good idea a great idea he stared at me and there was such pressure to that gaze that i had to fight to meet it but the idea of the two of them having you tonight the way its planned excites you doesnt it i hesitated then told the truth yes that is not seelie court that is most definitely unseelie court its the part of you that i dont understand its the part that doyle understands best better even than frost he may be your darkness but he also holds your darkness as precious to him i dont want your darkness merry i want the light of you you cant separate the light and the dark rhys theyre both a part of me he nodded i know i know he sat up and eased himself off the edge of the bed im going to go clean up you were magnificent i said im already sore i warned you foreplay isnt just for my bodys comfort you did warn me he gathered his clothes from the floor but made no move to put them on enjoy your shower i said want to join me i smiled no i need some actual sleep before tonight i think i tire you out yes but in a wonderful way i curled on my side pulling the sheet up rhys went for the door i heard him talking to someone outside i heard him say ask her yourself kittos voice came from the door may i come in yes i said he walked inside the door closing behind him he must have been sitting in the hallway the entire time do you want to hold me while you sleep he asked i looked at his earnest face so serious he was always serious our kitto yes i said he smiled then and it was a good smile a smile that wed only discovered he had in the last little bit he crawled under the sheet and slid his body against the back of mine he spooned his nakedness against my body and it was simply comforting i would have turned down almost any other man at the door in that moment kitto knew he would not be king so the sex wasnt such a press to him but more than that he valued the gentle cuddling almost more than the sex after all hed had sex before but i wasnt certain hed ever truly been loved just for himself i did love him i loved them all but rhys was right i didnt love them equally the constitution of our country says that all men are created equal but its a lie ill never be able to make a jump shot like magic johnson or drive a car like mario andretti or paint like picasso we are not created equal in talent but the place where we are least equal is the heart you can work at a talent take lessons but love love either works or it doesnt you love someone or you dont you cant change it you cant undo it i lay there drifting on the warm edge of sleep with the wonderful edge of good sex coating my body kittos warmth and clinging shape held me as i drifted off i felt safe loved and content i wished rhys would feel as good about this afternoon as i did but i knew that was a wish that wouldnt come true i was a faerie princess but there were no faerie godmothers there were only mothers and grandmothers and there was no magic wand to wave over a persons heart and make it all better the fairy tales lied rhys knew that i knew that the man who was breathing at my back as he began to fall deeper to sleep knew that fucking brothers grimm chapter while maeve reed was off in europe staying out of taraniss reach shed given us full use of her house she said it was a small price to pay for us saving her life and helping her become pregnant before her human husband had died of cancer so for once good deeds had been rewarded we had a mansion on a huge plot of land in holmby hills with a guesthouse a pool house and a smaller cottage near the gate for the caretakergardener i still slept in the master bedroom of the guesthouse but there were now enough of us to fill the bedrooms of both houses the men were having to double up in some of the bedrooms kitto had gotten a room to himself because it was too small a room to share with anyone much above my and rhyss size which meant no one wed planned on using the main houses dining room for the initial meeting with the goblins it was a huge room that had begun life as a ballroom so it was light and airy and full of marble it looked like something out of a human fairy tale the seelie court would have approved but then maeve was exiled from there so maybe the ballroomdining room was a piece of home for her most of my bodyguards looked as at home here in the brightness as the glittering chandeliers above us the guards whom ash and holly had brought didnt look at home at all the red caps towered over everyone else in the room seven feet of goblin was a lot of goblin but that was short for a red cap most were closer to the twelvefoot mark the average height was eight to ten feet their skins were shades of yellow gray and sickly green id known that the goblins were bringing red caps as guards kurag the goblin king had felt that if he sent ash and holly without guards to us and something happened to them it would be seen as a plot between him and me to rid himself of the brothers since the only way for him to step down as king and them to step up was for him to be dead at their hands their deaths would be very convenient for him so why was he offering them to me to make them even more powerful because kurag knew how his kingship would end as all goblin kings ended he wanted to ensure that his people were strong even after he died he did not resent the brothers for their ambition he just wanted to hold it off a little longer if the twins died by our hands even by accident without goblins around them then it could be misconstrued if the goblins thought that kurag had had the brothers assassinated his life was forfeit all challenges were personal challenges there were goblins who were assassins as a sideline but they never took jobs where the victim was another goblin theyd kill sidhe or lesser folk but never another goblin the only exception was if the goblin was one of the kept as kitto had been if you had a problem with one of them their masters fought you because to be what kitto was among them was an admission that he was not fighter enough to be part of the larger goblin culture i sat in a large chair that had been set up as a sort of temporary throne the big table had been moved back against the wall along with most of the chairs frost was at my back doyle was still closeted in his bedroom with the black dogs taranis had nearly killed my darkness if wed been inside faerie proper he might have been healed already none of our magics were as strong here it was one of the reasons that exile was so feared by most because you were never as powerful outside of faerie we have brought you inside so the human reporters cannot bandy it about in the press frost said in a voice as cold as his namesake but for the press i would not have allowed you inside our wards with such an army at your back i couldnt really argue with him but i was strangely unworried in fact i felt better than id felt in hours it is done frost i said why are you not more worried about this he asked i dont know i said if they were not goblins i would say they had bespelled you rhys said ash and holly were impressed with all of the show which set them apart from the other goblins and made them so much more sidhe greetings ash and holly goblin warriors greetings also to the red caps of the goblin court who leads here we do ash said as he and his brother stepped up to stand before my chair they were wearing the court clothes that theyd worn before ash in green to match his eyes holly in red to match his the clothes were satin and the height of fashion if the year happened to between and their short yellow hair brushed their ears as they bowed theyd started to let their hair grow though it wasnt long enough to get them in trouble with the queen it had to touch their collars for that youve let your hair grow in the month since i saw you i said they exchanged a glance then ash said we do it in anticipation of your magic bringing us into our sidheside powers thats very confident of you i said we have every confidence in your powers princess ash said i looked at holly there was no confidence in his eyes just eagerness he got to bed me tonight all else was just pretense holly would give me what the brothers truly felt ash was nearly as good at playing courtier as sidhe lord i didnt trust either of them but ash could lie with his eyes and face holly couldnt good to know i looked past them to the red caps i recognized some of them from the fight weeks before they had stood by me not the brothers or kurag their king the red caps had obeyed me beyond what was required of them by treaty i had not explored that strange obedience so unlike the usual red cap attitude toward sidhe or female because i wasnt sure how kurag would take it i did not want to be seen as trying to seduce even politically the most powerful warriors of the goblin race to my service kurag desperately wanted out of the treaty with me he feared that civil war was coming either within the unseelie themselves or between both courts he wanted no part of the coming battles yet his treaty with me held him to me i would not give him an excuse to pull out we needed him too much so i had not probed further into the red caps motivations for their loyalty to me now they stood before me more of them than id ever seen in one place at one time they were like a living wall of flesh and muscle they all wore little round skullcaps most were covered in dry blood so that the wool was shades of brown and black but about a third of them had blood running from their caps to trickle down their faces and stain the shoulders and chest of their clothes once to be war leader among them you had to be able to make the blood on your cap stay fresh the alternative was to kill a foe often enough to keep your hat red this little cultural habit had made them some of the most bloodthirsty warriors in all of faerie id only met one red cap who could make his hat stay fresh and bright red jonty he stood among them in the front near the center he was about ten feet tall with gray skin and eyes the color of fresh blood all the red caps had red eyes but there are shades of red and jontys were as bright as his cap when id met him his skin had reminded me of the gray of dust but his skin didnt look dry or harsh now he looked like hed had a good deep moisturizer used on all the skin i could see since goblins didnt go to spas i didnt understand the change in his skin tone there were other changes as well his hat bled in thick runlets of blood so that his entire upper body was soaked in it the blood had trickled down his clothes and dripped off the ends of his thick fingers as he stood there making a delicate pattern of blood on the marble floor jonty it is good to see you again i meant it he had saved us he had forced the twins to join our fight the red caps had followed him not ash and holly and you princess meredith he said in that voice that was so low it was like gravel rumbling should we have greeted the killing frost and rhys ash asked i am not completely clear on the rules of sidhe etiquette you may greet them or not i greet jonty because he stood beside me in battle i greet jonty and his red caps because they helped me and mine i greet the red caps as true allies the goblins are your allies ash said the goblins are my allies because kurag cannot get out of our bargain you would have let my men die that night in the dark are you going to go back on your bargain to bed us princess ash asked no but seeing jonty and his men reminds me that is all actually i was angry ash and holly had been like all goblins and most sidhe it wasnt their fight and they didnt want to die defending sidhe warriors who wouldnt have given a damn for them i shouldnt blame them but i did anyway jonty had picked me up in his huge arms and run through the winter night toward the fight where he went the other red caps had gone because the red caps went the other goblins had to go to avoid the fight would have branded them as weaker and more cowardly than the red caps id known it was a point of pride but kitto had explained that it was more than that it would have opened the other goblins to being challenged in single combat by the red caps who fought beside me no goblin would have willingly invited such a challenge i knew what i owed jonty and his men but not why they had done it why had they risked everything for me if i could have figured out a way to ask that wouldnt have insulted them ash and holly or even their king i would have asked but goblin culture was a maze that i did not have a map for yet it had no room for asking why of a warrior why were you brave because i was a goblin why did you help me because no goblin turns from a good fight neither was completely true but it was popularly true and to say otherwise would bring into question ash and hollys lack of enthusiasm frost touched my shoulder just a light touch if doyle had been there hed have touched me sooner frost didnt like why the goblins were here tonight he didnt like me being with them but he knew we needed them as allies rhys spoke softly merry i looked up at him startled did i miss something yes he motioned with his gaze at the twins i turned to them i am so sorry but so much has happened today that i find worry overriding my duty so the darkness is still too injured to be by your side ash said he will not be here tonight i told you that earlier will rhys and the killing frost be your guards tonight holly asked no rhys couldnt do it frost id ordered not to he could not hide his feelings well enough i feared he would insult holly with a look or a sound tonight the middle of sex could be very like the middle of blood lust in battle for a goblin i didnt want to have frost start a fight by accident amatheon and adair will guard me at the mention of their names they stepped forward from the line of guards behind me amatheon was copperhaired and adair was crowned with a dark gold that had once been closer to just brown before wed had sex inside faerie and he had come back into some of his power amatheon had been a deity of agriculture adair was the oak grove but also once a solar deity i wasnt sure if hed been solar then downgraded to oak or if hed been both simultaneously it was considered the height of rudeness to ask a fallen deity what their old powers once were it was like rubbing their noses in their lost status is it true that fucking them is what turned andaiss garden of pain into the meadow it is now holly asked yes i said rhys said i wish doyle were here i really do i hate goblins everyone knows that so i dont trust my judgment with you rhys i said what is no one going to ask why they have brought every red cap the goblins have at their command i too frost said do not wish merry to do this it colors my judgment as well well i dont give a damn who she fucks as long as she eventually fucks me so ill say it why in the name of the consort do you have this many red caps with you onilwyn stepped away from the rest of my guards onilwyn was the most graceless sidhe id ever seen there was something blocky about his muscular build he was tall enough and he moved well but he just wasnt made as smoothly as the rest i was never sure why and again could not ask it wasnt his roughness that made me not want to sleep with him he was as handsome with his long green hair and lovely eyes as most of the sidhe but if pretty is as pretty does onilwyn was ugly to me id managed not to sleep with him yet because i truly didnt like him he had been one of cels friends who had tormented me when i was a child i truly didnt wish to be tied to him by a child and marriage so id refused him my bed id given him permission to masturbate which was more than the queen had allowed he could entertain himself all he wanted i just didnt want him entertaining me if i didnt get pregnant soon hed promised to complain to the queen i had until the end of this month because that was when i could bleed away my chances for a baby this cycle the queen would force me into his bed first on the chance that i could get pregnant second because she knew i didnt want to do it but sometimes its the unpleasant person who will say what needs saying i had not worried about how many red caps were in the room until onilwyn spoke that was wrong i should have worried there were enough of them that if they started a battle we might lose why hadnt it worried me my left hand pulsed so hard it brought a sound from me my hand of blood liked the red caps my power liked the red caps not good or was it ash and holly exchanged a glance the truth i said why did you bring every red cap the goblins can boast they insisted ash said the red caps do not insist onilwyn said they obey ash looked at the other man i would riot expect a sidhe to know so much of us he looked at me and gave a nod except for the princess who seems to make a study of all her peoples culture i nodded back i appreciate that you have noticed my efforts i have noticed it is one of the reasons i am here i fought in the goblinsidhe wars onilwyn said i saw the red caps ordered into battles that were sure death but they never hesitated i learned that they are oathed to never disobey the goblin king you are correct green man jonty said they are also forbidden from competing for kingship onilwyn said also correct why are you all here onilwyn asked i looked at onilwyn it wasnt like him to worry this much over my safety maybe he was worried about his own the red caps looked at jonty he looked at me why are you here jonty why did so many of your people come with you you i will answer he said in that deep voice hed insulted everyone here ash and holly onilwyn everyone but me he came forward rhys and frost moved a little in front of me some of the other guards moved out of their line behind us no i said he helped me save you all dont be ungrateful now were supposed to protect you merry how can we allow that to approach you rhys said i gave him an unfriendly glare he is not a that rhys he is a red cap he is jonty he is a goblin but he not a that my anger seemed to surprise him he gave a small bow and moved back as my lady wishes normally i would have tried to ease his hurt feelings but tonight i had other things on my mind than juggling the emotional relationships in my life i stood up and the silk robe i was wearing brushed the floor with a sound that was almost alive the highheeled sandals with their wraparound laces made a sharp sound on the marble high heels had been the only thing the twins had asked me to wear the only request i moved the robe so they got a flash of the fourinch heels the laces that curved around my calf i got a sound from holly low in his throat ash controlled himself better but his face couldnt hold it all they wanted my white flesh against their gold they wanted to know sidhe flesh and it wasnt all about power they like me knew what it was to be the outsider to be always different from those around you jonty dropped to his knees in front of me kneeling he looked me in the eyes he made me aware of how small i was jonty i said princess he said i studied his face up close the change was even more startling his skin was smoother a softer gray he smiled at me and the teeth that i remembered as a mouthful of fangs were straighter whiter less frightening more like a persons mouth than an animals what has happened to you jonty i asked you happened to me princess i dont understand your hand of blood happened to us all in that winters night i frowned a little and tried to think of a way to ask my question but how do you ask a question when you have no idea what to ask i do not understand jonty your hand of blood has brought us back into our power you have not come back into your full power holly said jonty turned an evil look on him no as the halfling says no but it is more power than we have known in centuries he turned back to me the anger fading from his eyes as he beheld me there was a softness to his look that you didnt see in most goblins eyes red caps were known for their ferocity not their kindness why have you all come jonty they want you to touch them as you touched us they want you to bring them into their power too why did you not ask me sooner would you have done it you saved us jonty i know that but more than that my job my task as princess is to bring power back to faerie all faerie that includes you and your men jonty looked at the floor and spoke as softly as his deep deep voice would allow i knew you would not refuse us if we stood before you i knew that your hand of blood called to us too strongly if we were close to you but i did not think you would simply say yes from a distance he looked up and his red eyes shimmered red caps did not cry ever a single tear slid from his eye a tear the color of fresh blood i did what i knew was custom among the goblins tears are precious blood more precious yet i touched my finger to his face and captured that single tear before it could mingle with and be lost in the blood that trailed down his face the tear trembled on my finger like a true tear but it was red as blood i raised it to my mouth and drank his tear chapter there are moments when the world holds its breath when the very air seems to pause as if time itself has taken that last deep breath before the taste of salt and sweet metal slid across my tongue the liquid seemed to grow until when it glided down my throat it was like a drink of cool clear water if it could hold the salt of oceans and the taste of blood i saw the room in pieces as if things were moving out of sync a cloud of demifey flew into the room though i knew they had been forbidden to come goblins thought them tasty but the winged fey filled the room like a cloud of butterflies and moths dragonflies and damselflies and insects that had never appeared in nature there seemed to be more of them than i knew had followed us into exile the air was alive with color from the fluttering of their wings so many of them that they made a breeze that played in my hair and touched my face the dogs came next small terriers spilling around the feet of the goblins as if the dogs did not care and the goblins did not see them the graceful step of the greyhounds next picking their dainty way through the crowded room they walked among the standing red caps as if they were a forest to move through instead of people stranger yet the red caps did not react to the dogs the dogs went to their masters the terriers went to rhys some of the hounds went to others of the guard my two hounds came to me minnie with her face half red and half white as if someone had drawn a line down her face mungo with his one red ear and the rest of him white as a swan wing they had all been waiting for us frosts voice came from behind me merry what is this it was royals voice from where he hovered above me with his moths wings that answered it is the moment of creation killing frost i stared up at the diminutive man i dont understand he smiled at me but there was an eagerness to him that i did not trust there was always something sensual even sexual about royal since he was the size of a large barbie doll it was unsettling to say the least we wait but for one piece more this came from penny royals twin sister who hovered beside him i didnt understand until the black hounds poured in like shadows with darkness made flesh whose eyes flashed red green and all the colors id seen in doyles eyes when his magic was upon him doyle came through the door leaning on the back of what looked like a black pony a little bigger than the dogs but a flash of those black eyes and i knew it was no pony it pulled its lips back to flash teeth as sharp as any goblins it was a kelpie though how it got here i had no idea the kelpies had been hunted and destroyed in europe before we ever came to this country kelpies either lurked in water and drew their prey down like crocodiles or pretended to be ponies on land then when some unwary human got on they galloped to the nearest water they drowned their prey or ate them as they drowned most of their victims were children children love ponies frost and i both said doyle together he managed a smile his face was still bandaged but hed unbound his arm he moved slowly but he moved with his hand on the back of the carnivorous pony the dogs would not let me rest any longer doyle said i held my hand out to him royal said no princess that is not the point i looked up at him you said the last piece he is the last piece but you dont have to touch him you have touched him enough for this moment to happen you have touched them all enough to call us to you i dont understand he finished for me no you will he said and it was typical royal because he made it sound ominous mungo nudged my hand i stroked his head and played with one silken ear minnie bumped my other hand as if jealous for my attention i petted them both feeling the warmth and solidness of them there is no dog for me frost said he had moved closer to me what will be will be royal said then the demifey rose toward the high ceiling sending light sparkling in rainbows from the crystal chandeliers the light bounced and played off all of us the goblins even ash and holly were still frozen out of time with us it was jonty who blinked and looked up at me he of all of them who saw his eyes went wide then the world let out the breath it had been holding chapter the world exploded if you could call light color music and the perfume of flowers an explosion i had no other word for what happened it was like standing at ground zero on the first day that life walked on the planet but it was also like standing in the most beautiful meadow in the world on a lovely spring day with the gentlest of breezes blowing it was a perfect moment and a moment of incredible violence as if we were all gently torn apart and put together again in the blink of an eye through it all the dogs pressed close on either side they anchored me steadied me kept me from breaking apart and flying into that moment they kept me solid enough sane enough to survive i clung to their fur the touch of them in my hand and thought frost has no dog to keep him here i thought about screaming then it was over only the sense of disorientation and the memory of pain and power fading in the dance of light and magic let me know that it hadnt been some sort of dream doyle gazed at me across the back of his black dogs he seemed to be healed whole he touched the kelpie but did not lean on it he stood straight and tall he reached up and pulled off the bandages to show that the burns were gone i suppose if youre creating reality a little healing isnt much because reality had changed we were still in maeve reeds ballroomdining room but it wasnt the same room it was huge an acre of marble stretching in every direction the far windows were a distant twinkling line there were demifey everywhere as if too deep a breath would make you swallow one ash and holly swatted at them as if they were flies i said if you harm them i will not be happy the red caps did not swat at them they did not threaten them the huge men stood there and let the tiny things alight on them they were covered in the fanning of butterfly wings until you could barely see their flesh through the slow dance of color jonty gazed up at me with those red eyes framed by the shining wings the tiny hands clung to his bloody hat they rolled in the blood giggling a sound like crystal chimes you remake us my queen jonty said i dont know what i would have said to that but then rhyss voice came merry that one word that note of urgency was enough i turned and knew that whatever i would see i would not like it rhys and galen were kneeling beside frost he lay crumpled on his side terribly still i remembered then what id thought he had had nothing to hold on to while reality remade itself he had been alone in the terror and beauty of it i ran to him with my dogs at my side trippingly close but the magic was still here still working and i did not dare send the hounds away the oldest magic that had ever belonged to the sidhe was in this room tonight it was a magic that could be ridden but never controlled not completely creation is always a chancy thing because you never know what it will be when all is said and done or if it will be worth the price chapter voices from around the room said that frost was not the only one down holly and ash had collapsed to the floor the demifey closed on them now that they could not resist but the other men who had fallen had only other guards to touch them to try and wake them i touched the glittering fall of frosts hair drew it back from his face what is wrong with him with all of them i asked im not sure rhys said but his pulse is fading i looked at him over frosts still form i knew my face showed the shock they didnt have the dogs galen said they didnt have anything to hold on to when you created more faerie land rhys nodded his small sea of terriers sat unusually silent and solemn around his legs as he knelt i started to say they are just dogs but mungo bumped my shoulder with his head minnie leaned against my side i looked into her eyes and there was dog in there yes but there was more they were dogs formed of wild magic they were fey creatures and that is not simply a dog i stroked her ear so velvety i whispered help me help them help frost doyle strode farther into the room with the huge black dogs milling around him one of the dogs broke from the pack and went to one of the other fallen he sniffed the hair with a loud snuffling sound then he grew taller bigger the dogs fur ran in streamers of green chasing the black away and the fur growing a little longer a little shaggier the dog was the size of a pony when it was solid green a green like new grass spring leaves it turned huge yellowgreen eyes to me cu sith galen whispered i simply nodded the cu sith hound of the sidhe was the literal meaning of its name once every sidhe mound had had at least one as guard one had been created or reborn on the night when the magic had returned in illinois now we had a second here and now it lowered its great head and sniffed at one of the fallen guards again it licked him with a huge pink tongue he gave a breath so big we heard it across the room his body shuddered with the return of life or the retreat of death the huge green dog moved from one to the other and everywhere he touched the men revived he came to onilwyn still collapsed on his side he sniffed him then growled low and deep like thunder contained in a rib cage he did not lick onilwyn back to life the cu sith let him lie interesting that i wasnt the only one who didnt want to touch him the green dog came to the twins sweeping the demifey ceilingward with its great head but it sniffed them and moved away too not sidhe enough for the cu doyles deep voice came but there was an echo in it of the god i looked at doyle and found his face distant as if he saw something other than this room vision held him or deity or both he spoke in a dialect i did not understand and one of the black dogs moved forward it went to the twins and sniffed their hair the black fur ran with a white that glowed and shimmered the white fur was thicker longer than the black even longer and shaggier than the cu siths green the dog was as large as the cu sith maybe even a little larger the fur wasnt so much long like a sled dogs as just unkempt it turned eyes the size of saucers to me huge and out of proportion to its doggie face but then the look in its eyes wasnt exactly the look a dog gives you either it was a look somewhere between a wild animal and a person there was too much wisdom in those eyes rhys said softly its a gallytrot a ghost dog i said it was supposed to be a phantom that haunted lonely roads and scared travelers not exactly he said remember some humans believe that all the fey are the spirits of the dead the gallytrot leaned its huge white head over the twins and licked them with a tongue that was as black as the fur it had started with holly stirred blinking bloodred eyes at the room ash made a sound that was almost pain as the gallytrot licked him back to life i waited for the cu sith to come to frost or even the gallytrot but they didnt the cu sith moved among my guards receiving pets and strokes it smiled in that way that dogs do with its tongue out the twins seemed unsure what to make of the white dogs attention it was holly who reached up and touched it first the dog bumped him so hard he almost fell over it made holly laugh a pleased masculine sound ash touched the dog too and they communed with the huge beast the demifey were beginning to leave the red caps the faces revealed were gentler as if the clay of their bodies had been remade into something more sidhe more human jontys words came back to me you are remaking us i hadnt meant to but there were a lot of things i hadnt meant to do i stared down at frost and saw a gleam of blue at his neck his tie had already been loosened by someone i snapped off buttons in my haste to see and found blue glowing on his skin rhys and galen put him on his back and helped me tear his shirt open there was a tattoo on his chest that glowed blue it was a stag head with a crown in its antlers it was a mark of kingship but it was also a mark of the sacrificial king the white stag was what he had made with his touch that night in the winter dark the white stag is a thing to be hunted and to lead the hero to his destiny i stared at rhyss face because he looked as horrified as i felt what does it mean galen asked once all new creation came with sacrifice doyles voice intoned but it wasnt his voice no i said no i didnt agree to this he did the voice said the look in doyles eyes was not him either why why him he is the stag no i stood up stumbling on the hem of my robe i went toward the black dogs and this stranger in doyles body merry rhys said no i screamed it again one of the black dogs growled at me my power washed over me burst across my skin i glowed like id swallowed the moon shadows of crimson light fell around my face from my hair i saw green and gold light and knew my eyes glowed would you challenge me doyles mouth said but it wasnt doyle who i would challenge if i said yes merry dont rhys said merry galen said please frost wouldnt want this my hounds bumped my hand and my thigh i looked down at them and they glowed minnies red half of her face glowed like my hair and her skin gave white light around my hand as i petted her our glows mingled mungo with his red ear and white coat looked as if he were carved of jewels the queens ring pulsed on my hand it like so many things had more power inside faerie and that was where we stood now i saw phantom puppies dancing around my hounds i knew in that moment that minnie was already pregnant the first faerie hounds to be born in five hundred years maybe more minnie bumped my hip made me look down at myself two small phantoms of my own hovering around me but i knew they were real no wonder id been tired today twins like my mother and her sister twins and faint like a thought that wasnt quite real was a third it wasnt real yet just a promise of possibilities it meant that the twins would not be all there would be at least a third child for me with someone i realized as soon as i thought it that the ring had other powers i wanted to know who the father was and i could know here with the ring inside faerie i turned and looked at doyle and found the answer i most wanted the ring pulsed and the scent of roses rode the air i turned toward frost a child sat beside him quiet and too solemn no goddess no not like this even the wonder of a child of twins could not make frosts loss a fair trade i did not know these phantom children yet i had not held them i did not know their smiles i did not know how soft their hair was or how sweet their skin smelled they were not real yet frost was real frost was mine and we had made a child goddess please i whispered rhys moved through my edge of vision and the child reached up for him it passed a phantom hand through his he reacted to it trying to see what had touched him that wasnt right i held two children inside me not three i was one father over the line but not for long unless i went to frost galen caught me in his arms and the ring pulsed hard enough to make me stagger four fathers for two babies it made no sense i hadnt had intercourse with galen for more than a month because we all agreed hed make a bad king he and kitto had been the only ones who had let me indulge my penchant for oral sex to my hearts content but you couldnt get pregnant from that the scent of roses was stronger that usually meant a yes not possible i thought i am goddess and you are forgetting your history what history are you forgetting galen asked i looked up at him you heard that he nodded the story of ceridwen he frowned at me i dont understand then comprehension slipped across his face my galen with his thoughts so easy to follow on his handsome face you mean i nodded he frowned i thought ceridwen getting pregnant from eating a grain of wheat and etain being born because someone swallowed her as a butterfly were both myths you cant get pregnant from swallowing anything you heard what she said he touched my stomach through the silk of the robe a smile spread across his face he glowed with joy but i could not join him frost is a father too i said galens joy dimmed like a candle put behind dark glass oh merry im sorry i shook my head and drew away from him i went to kneel beside frost rhys was on the other side of him did i hear you right frost would have been your king one of them i said i didnt feel like explaining that rhys had also somehow hit the jackpot it was too confusing too overwhelming rhys put his fingers against the side of frosts neck he pressed against his skin his head dropped so his hair was a curtain to hide his face one shining tear fell onto frosts chest the blue of the stag mark blinked brighter as if the tear had made the magic flare more brightly i touched the mark and that made it brighter too i laid my hand on his chest his skin was still warm the mark of the stag flared into blue flame around my hand i prayed please goddess dont take him from me not now let him know his child please if i have ever held your grace bring him back to me the blue flames flared bright and brighter they did not burn but felt more like electricity stinging and biting but just short of pain the glow was so bright i could no longer see his body i could feel the smooth muscles of his chest but i could not see anything but the blue of the flames i felt fur under my hand fur then i was not touching frost something else was inside that blue glow something with fur and not manshaped the shape stood and moved high enough that i could not touch it doyle was behind me folding me in his arms picking me up off the ground the blue fire died down and a huge white stag stood in front of us it looked at me with gray and silver eyes frost i said and reached out but it ran it ran for the far windows over the acre of marble it ran as if the surface wasnt slick for hooves it ran as if it weighed nothing i thought it would crash into the glass but french doors that had never been there before opened so that the great stag could run out into the new land beyond the doors closed behind him but the doors did not go away apparently the room was flexible still i turned in doyles arms so i could see his face it was him looking out of his eyes now not the consort is frost he is the stag doyle said but does that mean hes gone as our frost the look on his dark face was enough hes gone i said he is not gone but he is changed whether he will change back to the man we knew only deity knows he wasnt dead exactly but he was lost to me lost to us he would not be a father to the child we had made he would never be in my bed again what had i prayed that he would come back to me if i had worded it differently would he still have transformed into an animal had my words been the wrong ones do not blame yourself doyle said where there is life of any kind there is always hope hope it was an important word a good word but in that moment it didnt seem enough chapter i dont care how many gallytrots your magic calls back ash said you swore you would lay with us and you have not done so he paced the room hands pulling at his short blond hair as if he would pull it out holly sat on the large white couch with the gallytrot lying on its back in his lap or in as much of his lap as it would fit which meant it filled up a large portion of the large couch holly ruffled the dogs chest and stomach holly of the hot temper seemed more relaxed than id ever seen him the sex was so shed bring us into our powers shes brought us power not sidhesided power ash said coming to stand in front of his brother i would rather be goblin holly said i would rather be king of the sidhe ash said the princess has told you that she is with child doyle said youve come too late to the party rhys said and whose fault is that ash asked he came to stand in front of me now if you had only bedded us a month ago then we would have had our chance i stared up at him too numb to react to his anger and disappointment someone had put a blanket around me i huddled in it cold colder than i knew how to cure so funny frost was gone and i mourned him by being cold there were diplomatic answers i could have given there were many things i could have said but i simply didnt care i didnt care enough to mind my tongue i stared up at him galen slipped onto the couch beside me he curled his arm around my shoulders i snuggled in against him i let him hold me he had been standing with the others whom doyle had called into the living room standing in case ashs anger got the better of his sense the goblins anger had been so great that doyle and rhys were still standing they wanted to be up and ready in case this oh so reasonable brother lost his head galen held me closer now but it wasnt for fear of ash i think he was afraid of what i might do he was right to be afraid because i was so unafraid i felt nothing your king kurag is happy with the new strength that has returned to the red caps i said he is overjoyed at the galleytrot when your king is happy warrior you are supposed to be happy in his joy my voice sounded cold but not empty there was an edge of anger in my voice like a crimson thread in a field of white if we were sidhe but we are goblin and kings are fragile things galen moved a little forward beside me i read his mind and knew the goblin did too he would shield me with his body but it wasnt that kind of fight kurag is our ally if he dies the treaty between us dies with him yes ash said yes it does i laughed and it was an unpleasant laugh the kind of laugh you make because you cant cry yet the sound startled ash it made him take a step backward from me no anger would have gotten such a reaction but laughter he didnt understand it think before you threaten goblin if kurag dies then we are honor bound to avenge him i said the unseelie court is forbidden to interfere directly in the line of succession of its subsidiary courts ash said that is a bargain that the queen of air and darkness made i am not my aunt i have made no such agreement to limit my powers your guards are great warriors but they cannot prevail against the combined might of the goblins ash said as i am not bound by my aunts agreement i am not bound by goblin rules ash looked uncertain as if he was thinking on what i had said but hadnt figured it out yet it was holly who said it what will you do princess send your darkness to assassinate us he was still ruffling the huge dog but his face was no longer simply happy his red eyes stared at me with a weight and intelligence that i hadnt seen before in him it was a look more often seen on his brothers face he is no longer merely my darkness he will be king but that had been what i was thinking that is another thing that makes no sense ash said he pointed at doyle how can he be king and father of your child and he he pointed at rhys and he and at galen last unless you are having a litter princess meredith you cant have three fathers four i said who then a look crossed his face and the first bit of caution killing frost holly said yes i said and my voice was back to sounding empty my chest actually hurt id heard the phrase brokenhearted but i hadnt actually felt it before id come close but never truly my fathers death had destroyed me my fiancés betrayal had crushed me when i thought id lost doyle a month ago in the battle i had felt like my world would end but until now i had not truly been heartbroken you cant have four fathers for two children ash insisted but he had calmed a little it was almost as if he saw my pain for the first time i didnt think he cared that i was in pain but it made him more cautious youre too young to remember clothra rhys said ive heard the story weve all heard the story but that was just a story ash said no rhys said it was not she had a single child by all of her brothers he was marked by each of them the boy became high king he was called lugaid riab nderg of the red stripes i always thought the stripes referred to some kind of birthmark galen said doyles deep voice filled the room and held an echo of godhead i saw that the princess will have two children they will have three fathers each as clothras son did dont try your sidhe magic on me ash said it is not sidhe magic it is god magic and the same deities serve and are served by all of feykind doyle said i was running slow but i finally heard what hed said enough to say three fathers apiece you rhys galen frost and who mistral and sholto i stared at him but that was a month ago galen said a month ago doyle said and do you remember what we did when we arrived back in los angeles that night galen seemed to think about it then he said oh he kissed me on the top of my head but i didnt even have intercourse with merry wed all agreed id make a lousy king oral sex doesnt get you pregnant kiddies rhys said the raw magic of faerie was out that night i was still cromm cruach with the ability to heal and kill with a touch merry had given life to the dead gardens with mistral and abe she had raised the wild hunt with sholto wild magic was out that night we were all touched by it the rules are different when that kind of magic is out and about you were the one who started the sex when we got home rhys did you know this could happen galen asked i was cromm cruach again a god again i wanted to feel merry under me while i was still rhys put his hands out as if he couldnt quite put it into words i was just happy that everyone was alive i said and my heart squeezed harder as if it would truly break the first hot hard tear crept out of my eye he is not dead merry galen said not really he is a stag and no matter how magical and wonderful that is he is not my frost he cannot hold me he cannot talk to me he is not i stood up letting the blanket fall to the floor i need some air i started for the far hallway that would lead farther into the house and eventually to the backyard galen got up to follow me no i said no just no i kept walking doyle stopped me at the doorway i must finish this talk with our goblin allies i nodded fighting not to break down completely i couldnt afford to appear that weak in front of the goblins but i felt like i was suffocating i had to get somewhere where i could breathe somewhere where i could break down i started down the corridor at a fast walk my hounds were suddenly beside me i started to run and they leaped with me i needed air i needed light i needed i heard voices behind me my guard calling princess you shouldnt be alone the hallway changed to a different hallway i was suddenly outside the dining room only the faerie sithen itself was capable of moving with my wish i stood there for a moment outside the big double doors wondering what had we done to maeves house was the house now a sithen was the whole house now part of faerie no answers but just through these doors and through the french doors that had never been there before was outside and air and light and i wanted it i opened the doors i walked carefully on the marble in the heels that id worn to please the twins i thought about taking off the shoes but i wanted outside first the dogss nails clicked on the floor the red caps stood when i entered they went down on one knee even jonty my queen he said not queen yet jonty i said he grinned up at me and it was strangely unfinished without his pointy teeth and more frightening face it didnt quite look like him until i saw his eyes jonty was still in there in those eyes once all rulers were chosen by the gods it is the old way the way such things are meant to be done i shook my head i had never wanted less to be ruler of faerie the cost as id feared was so terribly high too high your words are well meant but my heart is heavy the killing frost is not gone he will not help me raise his child that is gone jonty i started across the vast floor toward the far doors the windows were a line of brightness i realized with a start that it had been night when we began this and was still night outside the main house but through the windows it was bright day the sunlight had moved shadows changing across the floor in the hour since it had appeared but it ran on a different time than the outside world it was as if the doors led into the heart of this new sithen was this our garden our heart of faerie mungo bumped my hand i stroked his solid head and looked into those eyes those eyes that were just a little too wise for a dog minnie rubbed against my other leg they were telling me in the only way they could that i was right rhys and doyle said that the night we had conceived the babes inside me had been a night of wild magic but this was wild magic too this was creation magic and that was ancient magic the most ancient magic imaginable the doors opened without my hand reaching out the breeze was cool and warm at the same time there was a scent of roses i stepped through the doors they closed behind me and vanished it didnt frighten me i had wanted to be outside and the hallways had changed for me inside the unseelie sithen i could call doors i didnt want a door right now i wanted to be alone the dogs were about as much company as i could stand i wanted to grieve and those closest to me were too torn between happiness and sorrow sorrow for frost but happiness at being kings i could not bear the mingling of joy and sadness in them anymore i would be joyful later but for now i needed to give myself over to other things i stood in the center of a sundrenched clearing with the dogs on either side of me i raised my face to the heat of that sun and let go of my control i gave myself over to my grief with no hands to hold me and be happy i held the grasscovered earth the warmth of the dogs fur and finally wept chapter hands slid over my shoulders i started then turned to find amatheon his copper hair was haloed in the bright sunlight so that for an instant his face was lost to the brilliance he seemed made for this new faerie of sunshine and warmth i let him hold me tired from my weeping exhausted in mind and body i had had the greatest news of my life today and some of the saddest it was like being granted your favorite wish and then being told that the price would be your dearest love it wasnt fair and the moment i thought it i knew that was a childs thought i was not a child life was not fair and that was just truth amatheon raised my face to his with a gentle hand on my chin he kissed me the kiss was gentle and i gave him gentle back then his hands on my back pressed me more tightly against him his mouth became insistent on mine asking me with tongue and lips to open for him i pushed against his chest so that i could see his face amatheon please i have just lost frost i he pressed his mouth to mine hard enough that i had a choice of opening my mouth for him or cutting my lips on his teeth i pushed at him harder the dogs gave a soft growl like music in unison i felt something around his mouth that shouldnt have been there almost like a mustache and beard the sunlight dazzled my eyes and the sensation was gone he pressed me to the ground i pushed at him again and yelled amatheon no mungo rushed in and bit his arm amatheon cursed at him but it wasnt the right voice i stared at the man above me sorrow was gone in a wash of fear whoever this was it wasnt amatheon he leaned over to force a kiss on me again i raised my hands and tried to keep his face from mine the moment the queens ring touched his bare skin the illusion vanished the sunlight seemed to dim for a moment then i was staring up at the face of taranis king of light and illusion i didnt waste time on surprise i accepted what my eyes told me and acted i said door bring me doyle a door appeared beside us taranis looked shocked you want me all women want me no i dont the door started to open he raised a hand and sunlight hit the door like a bar of steel i heard doyles voice and others yelling my name the dogs rushed him and he rose to his knees spilling golden light from his hands it raised the hair on my body and forced another scream from me my eyes were dazzled by the light i had a ruined glimpse of my hounds lying burned mungo was staggering to his feet to try again taranis was on his feet with my wrist in his hand i fought to stay on the ground to not go with him doyle and the others were just on the other side of the door they would come they would save me taraniss fist came out of the light and the world went dark chapter i came to slowly painfully the side of my face ached and my head felt like someone was trying to beat their way out of my skull the light was too bright i had to close my eyes shield them with my hand i drew the silk sheet across my breasts silk the bed moved and i knew someone was with me i have dimmed the lights for you meredith that voice oh goddess i blinked my eyes open and wished i could believe it was a dream taranis was propped up on one elbow beside me the white silk sheet rode low at his waist the hair that traced his chest was a more solid red than the sunset color of his hair a line of hair trailed lower and i truly did not want him to prove that he was a natural redhead i held the sheets to my breasts like a virgin startled on her wedding night i thought of a dozen things to say but finally said uncle taranis where are we there id reminded him that i was his niece i wasnt panicking out loud hed already proven he was crazy in the lawyers office hed proved it again by knocking me unconscious and bringing me here i was going to be calm for as long as i could now meredith dont call me uncle it makes me feel old i stared up into that handsome face trying to see some sanity that i could reason with he smiled down at me looking charming and unworldly handsome but there was no hint that what was happening was wrong or strange he acted as if nothing was wrong that was more frightening than almost anything he could have done all right taranis where are we my bedroom he made a gesture and i followed the line of his hand it was a room but it was edged with flowering vines and trees espaliered to the wall heavy with fruit jewels winked and glittered among the verdant plant life it was almost too perfect to be real the moment i thought it i knew i was right it was illusion i did not try to break it it did not matter that he used magic to make his room look lovely he could keep his decorating tricks to himself though part of me wondered how i had been so sure so soon that it wasnt real why am i in your bedroom he frowned then just a little i want you to be my queen i licked my lips but they stayed dry should i try reason i am heir to the unseelie throne i cannot be both your queen and queen of the unseelie court you never have to go back to that awful place you can stay here with us you were always meant to be seelie he leaned in as if to kiss me again i couldnt help it i recoiled from him he stopped frowning again he looked like he was thinking and it hurt he wasnt a stupid man i think it was just another symptom of his madness he knew in some part of him that he was in the wrong but his madness wouldnt let him see it dont you find me handsome i told the truth you are always handsome uncle i told you meredith not uncle as you like i find you handsome taranis but you react as if i am ugly just because a man is handsome doesnt mean i want to kiss him in the mirror if your guards had not been with you you would have come to me then i remember then why do you recoil from me now i do not know and that was the truth here in the flesh was the man who had nearly overwhelmed me numerous times from a distance with his compulsion magic now i was here alone and he did nothing but frighten me i am offering you everything your mother always wanted from me i will make you queen of the seelie court you will be in my bed and in my heart i am not my mother her dreams are not mine we will have a beautiful child again he tried to kiss me i sat up and the world ran in streamers of color nausea made me gag gagging made the headache worse i leaned off the side of the bed and was sick throwing up made my head feel as if it would explode i cried with the pain of it taranis came to the side of the bed through the ruin of my sight i saw him hesitate i saw the revulsion on his handsome face it was too messy for him too real there would be no help from him i had all the symptoms of a concussion i had to get to a human hospital or a true healer i needed help i lay on the edge of the bed my uninjured cheek resting on the silk sheet i lay there waiting for my head to stop throbbing in time to my pulse praying that the nausea would pass lying very still made it better but i was hurt i was hurt and i was mortal and i wasnt sure taranis would understand that he didnt touch me he reached for a bell rope he called servants fine with me they might be sane i heard voices he said bring the healer a womans voice what is wrong with the princess there was the sound of a hand hitting flesh he roared at her do as you are told wench there were no more questions but i doubted that any of the servants would ask again what had happened to me they would know all too well i think i passed out again because the next thing i knew was a cool hand on my face i looked carefully moving only my eyes into the womans face i should have known her name but i could not think of it she was golden of hair with eyes that were rings of blue and gray there was a gentle air to her as if by simply being closer to her i felt a little better do you know your name i had to swallow past the bitterness of bile but finally whispered i am princess meredith nicessus wielder of the hands of flesh and blood she smiled yes you are taraniss voice came from behind her heal her i must first ascertain how badly injured she is the unseelie guard went mad he tried to kill her rather than see her go with me they would rather have her dead than lose her the healer and i exchanged a look the look was enough she put a finger to her lips i understood or hoped i did we wouldnt argue with the crazy man not if we wanted to live and i wanted to live i carried our children i would not die now frost was gone but there was a piece of him inside me growing alive i would keep it that way goddess help me please help me escape in safety a male voice that was not taranis spoke from behind her do you smell flowers yes the healer said and she gave me another look that was too knowing for comfort she motioned at the male voice and he stepped into view he was tall and blond and handsome and the epitome of seelie sidhe breeding except that he didnt look arrogant he looked nervous maybe even a little afraid good i needed him not to be stupid i whispered goddess help me the scent of roses was stronger a breeze played along my bare skin made the sheets on my legs move with the touch of it the guard looked toward where the breeze was coming from the healer looked at me she smiled even as her eyes looked too grave for comfort she bore a look that you never want to see on a doctors face how hurt am i i spoke softly and carefully there may be bleeding inside your head yes i said your eyes are equal that is a good sign she meant that if one of my pupils had been fixed i would be dying so that was good news she began to mix herbs from her leather bag i didnt know what everything was but i knew enough of herbal medicine to caution her i carry twins she leaned close to me and asked how long a month a little more there are many things i cannot give you then can you not lay hands on me no healer in this court retains that power is it true that some in your court do she whispered the last into my ear so close her breath moved my hair i whispered back true ah she said and leaned back there was a smile on her face now and a new sense of contentment that had not been there before the scent of roses was stronger i half expected the strong perfume to make the nausea worse but instead it eased thank you mother i whispered would you feel better if your mother was with you the healer asked no absolutely no she nodded i will do my best to see that your wishes are met which probably translated to my mother being insistent she had never had much use for me but if i were suddenly going to be queen of the court she most coveted then she would love me she would love me with the same power that she had hated me with for years she was nothing if not fickle my mother one of my names at the seelie court was besabas bane because my conception from one night of sex had condemned her to be at the unseelie court for years it had been the marriage that had cemented the treaty between the courts no one had dreamt that if neither court was breeding a mixed marriage might be fertile the hatred and fear of the seelie for the unseelie showed in nothing so much as the fact that with my birth there had not been offers from the seelie court for more unions they would rather die out as a people then mix with our unclean blood looking into the healers face i wasnt certain that all the seelie agreed with that decision or maybe it was the scent of roses growing stronger all the flowers and vines of taraniss room and there had been no scent it had looked pretty but it wasnt real i knew in an instant of clarity that it was like much about the seelie court illusion illusion you could see and touch but it was not true the healer stood and whispered to the guard he took up a post beside me two servants came and began to clean the mess id made trust the seelie court to be more concerned for appearance than truth they would clean up the mess even before i was healed or before they were certain that i could be healed one of the servants had a fresh cut on her cheek and the beginnings of swelling her eyes were brown and her face though pretty looked too human was she like me someone of part human parentage or was she one of the mortals lured into faerie centuries ago they got immortality but if they ever left faerie all their long years would catch up with them instantly they were more trapped than any of us for to leave faerie was true death to them she gave me a frightened look as she cleaned when i did not look away she held my gaze there was a moment of great fear in her face fear for herself and maybe fear for me fear of taranis someone had said that the cu sith had stopped him from striking a servant where was the cu sith now something scratched at the door i did not need to see the door to know that it was something large wanting inside taraniss voice chase that beast away from my door king taranis the healer said princess meredith is beyond my ability to heal heal her many of the herbs i would use would harm the children she carries did you say children he asked and he sounded almost normal almost sane she carries twins she had simply taken my word for it i appreciated that my twins he said and his voice was back to that arrogant crowing he came back to the bed sat on it made me bounce the headache and nausea roared back to life i cried out as he scooped me up in his arms the movement was agony i screamed and the sound hurt me too taranis seemed frozen by my scream he stared down at me almost childlike in his lack of comprehension do you want your children to die the healer said from beside him no he said still frowning and confused she is mortal my king she is fragile you must let us take her somewhere where they can heal her or your children will die unborn but they are my children he said and it was more question than fact she looked at me then said whatever the king says is truth she bears my children he said and he still sounded a little unsure of himself whatever the king says is truth she repeated he nodded hugging me a little more gently yes my children lies all lies i was right i just needed the right queen he leaned down and laid the softest of kisses on my forehead the scratching at the door was louder taranis screamed and stood with me in his arms go away foul dog the movement was too abrupt and i threw up on him he dropped me to the bed while i was still vomiting the browneyed servant girl caught me steadied me so i did not fall from the bed to the floor she held me while i threw up until there was nothing but bile and bitterness blackness tried to swallow the world again but the pain was too great i lay in the maids arms and moaned with the pain of it goddess and consort help me the scent of roses came like a soothing wave the nausea eased the pain became a duller ache instead of a blinding thing the browneyed maid and the healer began to clean me again most of it had gone onto the king but not all let us help you clean up my lord the other maid said yes yes i must clean myself the browneyed maid looked up at the healer and the guard the healer said go with your fellow servant help the king to bath make certain he has a long relaxing bath the maids body tensed a little then she said as the healer wishes so shall it be the healer directed the blond guard to take me from the woman he hesitated you are a battlehardened warrior does a little sickness make you flinch he scowled at her his eyes flared with a hint of blue fire before he said i will do what is needed he took me from the maid he took me gently enough while the healer said support her head most carefully i have seen head wounds before the guard said he did his best to keep me still when the far door to the bathroom closed behind the king and the maids the guard stood just as carefully with me in his arms the healer went for the door and he followed without a word the scratching at the door held whining now and when they opened the door the cu sith stood there like a green pony it gave a soft woof when it saw us the healer whispered hush the dog whined but quietly it came to the guards side so that its fur brushed my bare feet the touch of it sent a thrill through my body i waited for my head to hurt but it didnt i actually felt a tiny bit better we stood in a long marble corridor lined with giltedged mirrors there were two lines of seelie nobles in front of those mirrors each man and woman had at least one faerie dog at their side some were the elegant greyhounds like my own poor dogs i prayed that minnie would be all right she had been so still some of the dogs were the huge irish wolfhounds as theyd been before the breed had almost died out these were nothing that had ever mixed with other breeds they were giants huge fierce things some slick of fur some rough the looks in their eyes had nothing to do with sight and everything to do with battle they were war dogs fierce enough that the romans had feared them and collected them for the arena two of the ladies and one of the men held small whiteandred dogs in their arms all nobles love a good lapdog i didnt understand why they were there but there was again something about the presence of the dogs that calmed me it was as if a soft voice said it will be all right do not fear we are with you i recognized hugh of the fiery hair how badly hurt is she he had a brace of the huge irish hounds they were tall enough to look me in the eye with room to spare as i lay in the guards arms a concussion and she is with child a month gone with twins he looked startled we must get her away the healer nodded yes we must the nobles with their dogs closed behind us so that if taranis had opened his door he would have seen a solid wall of sidhe nobles and i would have been hidden from sight did they truly mean to defy their king for me we continued to hurry down the corridor as they spoke of treason a woman with hair that flowed in shades of blue and gray like sky or water spoke it took me a moment to recognize her as lady elasaid the press secretary has already spoken to the human media what did they say in answer to queen andaiss accusations he said that we have offered the princess sanctuary after she was viciously attacked by her own guards so they are telling the lies that taranis told them hugh said lady elasaid nodded does the media know that he attacked us in the lawyers office i asked they looked startled as if they hadnt expected me to speak i think that for them i was an object and not quite real yet they werent joining my cause because they liked me or believed in me they just believed in the magic and power i was helping bring back to faerie i was simply the vessel for that power yes hugh said we made certain that it was leaked they have pictures of your injured guards coming and going from the hospital we had come to a pair of huge white double doors i had never seen this hallway i had never before been honored with a trip to the kings bedroom i hoped to never be so honored again lady elasaid came to my side princess meredith i would give you my shawl to cover yourself if you would like it she held out a silken cloth in a brilliant green with gold designs it matched my eyes i looked at her moving my eyes careful so that nothing hurt they had a plan i didnt know what it was but the shawl matching my eyes said that they had one if even my clothes were being coordinated then they had a plan it would be most welcome i said and again my voice was soft because i feared what my head would feel like if i spoke too loudly i had been healed of worse injuries in vision but this time the goddess seemed content to make me feel better in inches rather than all at once hugh spoke as lady elasaid and another noble lady helped me slip on the robe for robe it was not shawl with a little persuasion from some of us the king demanded a press conference so that he could tell his side of the story he wanted to override the monstrous lies that the unseelie were telling the conference was scheduled to speak about the earlier attack in los angeles but they are still here princess they are now waiting for the king to speak to them about the accusation that he has kidnapped you he let press into the seelie mound i said how could he allow the unseelie to be more progressive than we andais had called a conference to demand your return he would appear guilty if he did less i thought i understood now why deity had healed me only in small bits enough to function but not enough to be well i needed to look hurt for the press does he honestly believe what he said earlier that he rescued me i fear so lady elasaid fastened a gold pin at the neck of the robe i would do your hair if there was time we want her to look disheveled and injured hugh said i managed a smile at lady elasaid thank you for the robe i will be fine just get me to the press i assume its a live feed lady elasaid frowned i do not understand yes hugh said it is live let us not linger here the blond guard said only the king can see us here and he no longer cares enough to use his mirrors for such things we are safer here than in the next corridor hugh said no one would dare spy on the king a woman said so we stood in taraniss own place of power safe safe to plot behind his back safe from prying eyes because they feared that he would see them but his madness had made him blind i wondered who had first been bold enough figure out that the kings own inner sanctum was the place to plot treason whoever it was would be someone to be careful of if you plot the overthrow of one ruler it makes the idea easier next time or so it seems we wanted to see how sensible you were before we told you our plan lady elasaid said hugh said head wounds can make a person unreliable and this is too dangerous a game to have you privy to our secrets if you will blurt them out may i speak freely here i asked yes he said get me in front of the cameras and ill play damsel in distress for you hugh and several others smiled you do understand ive been in front of the press my whole life i understand their power we made him swear a most solemn oath that he would not reveal himself to you until we were certain you would not spoil the plan if you knew him near i frowned at hugh but it hurt so i stopped i said i dont understand there was movement near the far door hidden by the crowd of people and dogs the crowd moved to either side revealing a huge black dog not as huge as some of the irish hounds but the black dog trotted toward me his nails clicking on the marble i almost whispered his name but stopped in time i held a hand out toward him he laid his great furred head in my hand then there was an instant of warm mist and prickling magic doyle stood before me nude and perfect he wore the only metal that seemed to have survived the transformation the silver earrings that peeked from the fall of his anklelength hair even the tie for his hair was gone he was unarmed and alone inside the seelie mound the danger he had exposed himself to made my stomach clench tightly in that moment i feared for him more than for myself he took me in his arms and i clung to him clung to the feel of his skin the strength of him i moved my head too quickly and a wave of nausea blurred my vision he seemed to sense it because he moved me to lay more prone in his arms he knelt in the whiteandgold corridor his darkness repeated in the mirrors as he held me there was a glitter on his cheeks and i saw the darkness cry for only the second time ever chapter i knelt on the marble in doyles arms my head resting on his chest just his touch seemed to ease some of my pain how i asked he seemed to understand exactly what i wanted to know as he often did this is not the first time i have come here in this guise many of the fey hounds began as black dogs i am just one who has not chosen a master i am quite the favorite among those who have not been blessed with a dog they offer me choice tidbits and call me sweet names he is skittish and will not let them lay hands on him lady elasaid said he plays the dog to perfection hugh said doyle looked up at them it is not play it is a true form for me there was silence for a second then hugh asked is the darkness truly the father of one of your children yes i said i held him as tightly as i could without moving my head too much it is too dangerous for you to be here if you are discovered he kissed my forehead as gently as a feathers touch i would brave much more than this for you my princess my fingers dug into his arm and back i could not bear to lose you and frost i could not bear it we have heard rumor of the killing frost but we thought it only rumor hugh said is he truly dead lady elasaid asked he is the white stag in truth doyle said hugh knelt beside us smiling he is not dead then princess in three years or seven or a hundred and seven he will return to his true self what good is a hundred years to a mortal lover sir hugh his child will never know him while i still live hughs eyes flared as if someone had struck the embers of his power there was a moment of fire in his eyes like looking into two small fireplaces he blinked and his eyes were only the colors of fire i have no words of comfort then but the black dogs presence is one of the things we nobles have done to keep your aunt from starting true war with us he will remain close to your side i grabbed hughs sleeve he is weaponless in this form if discovered can you protect him i am the captain of your guard merry i protect you doyle said i leaned harder against the solidness of him my hand on the other mans sleeve you are one half of a breeding royal pair you are king to my queen if you die the chance of other children dies with you she is right darkness hugh said it has been too long since there was life in the royal bloodline i am not of the bloodline doyle said his deep voice seemed to echo off the mirrors we know the princess has made maeve reed once the goddess conchenn with child by her human husband we also hear rumors that one of your male guards has made a female guard pregnant hugh said truth i said if you could make one of us who is of the pure seelie line pregnant then all the kings support would fall away from him i am sure of that hugh said lady elasaid knelt on the other side of us most of his supporters are convinced that only the mongrels are breedable they have decided that they would rather die as a race than pollute their blood if you could prove them wrong on this they would follow you some hugh said but not all some hate too deeply she nodded as you say hugh there was something intriguing about the way she said it the way she lowered her eyes you want you and hugh to be the experiment i said she blinked at me experiment hugh took her hand in his yes we would like very much to have a child of our own when i am healed and safe and my people are safe then i would be happy to try a spell for you i said some tension went out of them and they smiled at me as if id told them that tomorrow was yule and their most longfor present was under the tree i wanted to warn them that until the ring and the goddess had told me they were breedable i could guarantee nothing doyles arms tightened around me he was right now was not the time to undermine our allies confidence in us we needed them to get us out of here i needed a hospital or a healer who could lay hands and i never ever wanted to go back to taraniss bed i shivered and fought to not move my head when i did it are you cold doyle asked nothing that a blanket can help i will slay him for you no no you will live for me vengeance is cold comfort on a winters night i want you warm and alive beside me more than i want my honor avenged i moved as carefully as i could until i could see his face as your princess and future queen i order you to forget vengeance for this i am the injured party not you if i say its not as important to me as the feel of you in my arms you must honor that he stared down at me with those black eyes his hair was a wild mass of thick blackness with the hint of silver rings peeking like stars from the blackness of his hair he looked like the doyle who came to my bedroom not the braided and buttonedup doyle who guarded me but the expression on his face was all about the guard and something else something i hadnt expected to see though i should have there was a mans feelings for his love who had been violated by another man it was dare i say a very human emotion please doyle please let us tell the media what he has done let us bring him down using the human law he sought to use against us it has a certain poetic justice hugh said doyle stared down at me for a breath then gave one small nod as my queen wishes so shall it be it felt as if the world took a breath as if it had been waiting for him to say those words to me i had no idea why those words now were so important but i knew the sensation of reality changing those words spoken here had changed something large some event had stopped or begun because of this moment i felt it knew it but not what it meant or what the end would be so mote it be the healer said the other nobles echoed her so mote it be so mote it be down the corridor and just like that i understood they had acknowledged me queen once you only needed so many nobles and the blessing of the gods to rule in faerie once even longer ago you had only needed the blessing now i had both i would carry you to the ends of the earth and beyond doyle said but i must trust my most precious burden to others he reached out as if he would touch the spreading bruise where taranis had struck me then he bent over and laid his mouth against mine his hair slid over me like a warm cloak to help hide me he whispered more than life more than honor i love thee what do you say when a man whose entire existence had been his honor offers to give it up for you you say the only thing you can more than any crown or throne or title i love thee i said more than any power in faerie i love thee the scent of roses and deep forest was suddenly present as if wed stepped into a forest glade where wild roses had managed to grow i smell flowers again the blond guard said the goddess moves around this one a woman said let us take her to the humans and see if they can do what we cannot lady elasaid said get her far away from here she turned tricolored eyes shiny with unshed tears away as hugh helped her stand doyle stood up carefully holding me close and trying not to move my head he succeeded i clung to him not wanting him to let me go even as i knew we had to separate doyle and hugh looked at each other know that you carry the future of all of faerie in your arms sir hugh if i did not believe that i would not be here now darkness doyle lifted me away from his body and hughs arms slid under me my hands trailed over doyles bare flesh so warm so real so mine hugh settled me as gently as he could in the curve of his arms and the strength of his body it wasnt his power as a warrior that i doubted not really it was simply that his arms were not the ones i wanted i will be close by my merry doyle said i know i said then he was the black dog again he came to nudge my foot with the fur of his head i touched him with my fingers and the eyes were still doyles eyes let us go hugh said the rest formed a group around us they closed in front as they opened the door so that if there was an attack waiting it would hit them first and not me they were risking their lives their honor their future they were immortal which meant they had a lot of future to risk i prayed mother help them keep them safe do not let them pay a hard price for what we are about to do the scent of roses was fresh and so real that i thought i felt a petal brush my cheek then i felt another i opened my eyes to find that it was raining rose petals there were gasps of joy and wonder from the nobles of the seelie court the dogs capered and danced in the fall of petals the petals looked very pink against the blackness of doyles fur lady elasaid said once the queen of our court walked everywhere in a shower of flowers her voice was soft with wonder thank you goddess hugh said tears glittered on his face as he looked at me tears that sparkled like water reflecting fire he whispered thank you my queen he walked forward with me in his arms tears of fire glittering on his face we walked into the next room with pink rose petals floating down from nowhere like sweet rain chapter we moved through rooms of marble and gold rooms with cold pink walls with veins of silver and pillars of gold rooms of white marble with veins of pink and lavender and pillars of silver rooms of gold and silver marble with pillars of ivory we moved always in a circle of falling petals pink petals pale as dawns first blush dark as days last salmon blaze and a color deep enough to be purple they fell around us and i realized that the petals were the only living thing we passed there was nothing organic in this place of marble and metal it was a palace but it was not a home for beings who had begun life as nature spirits we were meant to be a people of warmth life and love and there was none of that here i dont know what the other nobles would have done if we hadnt moved in the circle of that flowered blessing they matched the rooms dressed in stiff clothing of gold and silver and subdued color they stared openmouthed some began to follow us like a parade that grows from sheer joy and wonder it was when i heard the first laugh that i realized that there was more to the nobles being won over than simply seeing the fall of petals the touch of the flowers seemed to make them happy they came to us with smiles and voices of protest of where is the king what have you done when the voices died out they simply followed us smiling hugh whispered i remembered loving queen roisin i never realized that that love was partially glamour i almost told him that i wasnt doing this but with that thought the scent of roses suddenly grew stronger id learned that it usually meant either yes or dont i guessed that i should not tell hugh that i wasnt creating the flowers on purpose and with that thought the scent of roses dimmed i took it to mean that id done what she wished i was content with that doyle had had to drop back so that he was not right next to me i understood that it was so no one would see and perhaps make a connection but i had to fight both my feelings and the head injury not to look around for the big black dog hughs huge shaggy hounds helped both by partially blocking my view and by brushing me with their muzzles touching my bare feet and hands one was almost solid white the other almost as solidly red with only small white markings every time they touched me i felt a little better the petals rested on their great heads then fell to the ground as they moved and snuffled at me it was almost as if the dogs were more real to me than the nobles in their beautiful clothes the dogs had been created from the magic that i had raised with sholto they had come from the same magic that had finally gotten me with child the dogs had come from the same night and the same magic a magic of making and remaking there were guards at the doors at the end of the room where we stopped this room was formed of red and orange marble with veins of white and gold glittering through the stone the pillars were silver with gold vines carved to look as if they bloomed with golden flowers as a child i had thought the pillars one of the most lovely things in the world now i saw them for what they were a standin for the real thing the unseelie court even without the new magic had held the remnants of real roses there had been a water garden in the inner courtyard with water lilies yes it had also held a rock with chains fixed to it so you could be tortured in a scenic setting but there had been life in the court it had been fading but it hadnt faded completely when the goddess began to move through me through us in all the seelie court there was no life even the great tree in the main chamber was formed of metal it was a thing of great artifice amazing artistic achievement but such things were for mortals the immortal werent supposed to be known only for their art they were supposed to be known for the reality that the art was based upon there was nothing real here the guards wore business suits they looked more like secret service agents than seelie nobles only their otherworldly beauty and eyes formed of rings of color showed them to be more than human hugh held me a little closer his hounds moved in front of me i realized that they were tall enough to partially block me from the sight of the guards lady elasaid moved to the front of the group she spoke in a ringing voice let us pass the kings orders are clear mlady no one else is allowed into the press conference without his express permission do you not see the blessing of the goddess before you we are immuned to illusion by the kings own magic do you see the fall of petals she asked we see the illusion of it mlady i could not see what she did but she said touch them the king can make illusion touchable too mlady elasaid i realized that they had seen lies so long that they no longer recognized truth all was doubt for them the blond guard had stepped a little in front of us helping the dogs hide us from view he turned to hugh and whispered shall i call hugh gave a small nod i expected the guard to take out a hand mirror or use the shiny surface of his blade but he didnt he reached into the leather pouch at his side and took out a very modern cell phone i must have looked surprised because he said we have reception near this room its why we put the press in here it was perfectly logical he moved back and others moved gracefully to help hide him from the view of the guards before the doors he spoke quietly we are outside the doors with the injured princess the guards will not let us pass one of the guards near the door said go back to your rooms none of you have any business here the blond guard said yes yes no he folded the phone shut placed it back in his leather bag and took his post at our side he whispered to hugh so quietly that even i couldnt hear it the group of nobles and their hounds bunched up around me if it came to an actual fight with swords and magic they had left themselves no room to maneuver then i realized what they had done they were shielding me shielding me with their tall slender bodies shielding me with their immortal beauty me who they had once despised and they were risking all they were all they had ever been to keep me safe they were not my friends most did not know me some had made it clear when i was a child that they did not like me they found me too human too mixed of blood to be sidhe what had taranis done to them to make them so desperate that they would defy him like this for me there was a stirring in the front of the glittering throng around me almost the way a field of flowers moves in a strong wind i heard the guard near the door his voice rough enough to recognize among all the sweeter voices you are not allowed farther into our sithen sir by order of the king unless you want to fight us we are coming through this door i knew the voice it was major walters head of the special branch of the st louis police department that specialized in dealing with the fey it had been an honorary title for years until i came home i didnt know how hed gotten invited to a press conference and i didnt care a second male voice came we have a federal warrant to bring the princess into protective custody it was special agent raymond gillett who had been the only federal agent who had kept in touch with me after the investigation of my fathers death had gone cold when i was younger i had thought he cared what happened to me lately i realized it was more about not leaving such a highprofile case unsolved i was still angry with him but in that moment his familiar voice was a good sound the princess is not here officers said a second guard please go back to the press area the princess is here lady elasaid said and in need of human medical attention you could feel the increased tension in the group of nobles like a spring that had been wound once too often to the human officers they would be beautiful and unreadable but i felt their energy rise like the first spark of heat from a match the guards at the door would feel it too the great black dog moved up on one side of hugh it didnt make me feel better weaponless against the might of sidhe guards all he could do was die for me i didnt want him to die for me i wanted him to live for me we have doctors with us major walters said let them look at the princess and well go from there the king has ordered that she not be given back to the brutes who injured her she cannot go near the unseelie again did he forbid her going near humans agent gillett asked there was a moment of silence while the murmur of power began to build among the sidhe around me slowly almost imperceptibly as if they were whispering their magic the king said nothing about humans looking at her a new guard voice said we were told to keep her away from the press why would the princess need to be kept away from the press agent gillett asked she will tell them firsthand about being rescued from the evil unseelie by your brave king i do not know unless you think the princess will have a different story major walters said the king has given his oath that it is so the talkative guard said then you have nothing to lose by letting our doctors look at her agent gillett said the guard who had sounded agreeable said if the king is true to his word then there is nothing to fear barri shanley you do believe him dont you there was the first real doubt plain in his voice as if even among the kings most loyal the lies were becoming too heavy to bear if she is truly here then let her come forward shanley said he sounded tired hugh held me closer as the nobles parted like a glittering curtain only hughs hounds and the blond guard stayed in front of me doyle stayed to our side i think that he like me was worried that the already suspicious guards would figure out who he was they might let us go into the press room but if they suspected that the darkness was inside their sithen they would go wild finally hugh said let them see both the guard and the great dogs moved doyle moved a little behind hugh so that he blended in with the other dogs aside from his color he was the only black one among them to my eyes he stood out almost painfully so black among all the seelie color i must have looked even worse than i felt because both the men were wideeyed they controlled it after that first glimpse but id seen it i even understood it and it was as if that look let me feel again i dont know if it was the magic the fear for doyle or the fear that taranis would find us or maybe the little screaming voice in my skull that had been growing louder the voice that finally let me think the thought all the way through to ask in my own head at least did he rape me did he rape me after he beat me unconscious was that what the great king of the seelie considered seduction goddess let him have been confused when he thought it possible that i carried his child it was like knowing that you were cut but only feeling pain after you saw the blood id seen the blood on the faces of the police i saw it in the way they moved toward me the left side of my face ached and was swollen i knew that it must have hurt before but it was as if only now could i feel all of it the headache came back in a roar that closed my eyes and brought a fresh wave of nausea a voice said princess meredith can you speak i looked up into agent gilletts eyes there was that old compassion there that look that had made me trust him when i was a young woman i looked into those eyes and knew it was real id felt used by him recently realizing that hed kept in touch with me in hopes of solving my fathers murder not for me but for some purpose of his own i had told him to stay away from me but looking up into his face now i understood what id seen in him when i was seventeen for this moment he cared deeply maybe he was remembering the first time he saw me collapsed in grief clutching my dead fathers sword as if it were the last solid thing in the universe doctor i whispered i need a doctor i whispered because the last time id felt this sick talking had hurt my head but i also whispered because i knew it would make me seem more pitiful and if sympathy would get me in front of the press i would play that card for all it was worth agent gilletts eyes hardened and i saw again that purpose that had made me believe he would find my fathers killer tonight that was all right i carried my fathers grandchildren inside me but i had to get to safety strength of arms and magic are so often what the sidhe rely on but they have never been weak they do not understand the arsenal of the powerless i understood because i had lived in the land of the helpless most of my life i stopped fighting to be brave i stopped fighting to feel better i let myself feel how hurt i was and how frightened i let myself think the thoughts id been shoving back i let them fill my eyes with tears the guards at the doors tried to move in front of us but major walters used his officer voice it echoed in the marble room and into the open door beyond you will move aside now the talkative guard said shanley we have no healers who can cure this let the humans treat her he had hair the flame color of autumn leaves just before they fall to the ground and eyes of circles of green he seemed young though he had to be over seventy because that was galens age and he was the next youngest sidhe to me shanley looked down at me his eyes were two perfect circles of blue i lay in hughs arms and gazed up at him through tearsoaked eyes and a swelling bruise that covered me from temple to chin shanley spoke quietly what story will you tell the press princess meredith the truth i whispered a look of pain went through those inhumanly lovely eyes i cannot let you into that room his words were his admission that he knew that my truth and taraniss truth were not one and the same he knew that his king had lied and given oath on it he knew and yet he had made oath to serve taranis as guard he was caught between his vows and his kings treachery i might have pitied him but i knew that taranis would not be distracted forever in his bath not even with servant girls to abuse we were inches away from the press and relative safety but how to travel those last few inches major walters pulled his radio from a coat pocket and hit a button we need backup out here if they come through we will fight them shanley said she is with child the healer said she carries twins he looked suspiciously at her you lie i have few powers left me that is true but i have enough magic left to sense such things she is with child i felt their heartbeats under my hand like the fluttering of birds you dont get heartbeats this quickly the guard said she entered this sithen pregnant with twins she was forced into the kings bed to be raped pregnant with someone elses children do not say such things quinnie he said i am a healer she said i must speak out at last if it costs me all i am all i have i swear to you that the princess is at least a month gone with twins you will take oath on it he asked i will swear any oath you wish me to take they stared at each other for a long moment there was pounding on the door behind the guards and the sounds of struggle the rest of the police and agents were trying to come in the seelie guards didnt want to injure the police in front of the press with live cameras on them it sounded like the police didnt have the same compunction about the guards the door shuddered under the weight of bodies hitting it the talkative guard went to stand by his captain shanley listen to her the king took oath too he said and nothing came to brand him an oathbreaker he believes what he says the healer said you know that he believes so he does not lie but that does not make it true we have all seen that in these last few weeks shanley looked from his fellow guard to the healer then finally to me were the unseelie raping you when our king saved you no i said his eyes glittered but not with magic did he take you against your will yes i whispered a tear trailed from each of his beautiful eyes he gave a small bow command me i hoped i knew what he wanted me to do i spoke as loud as i dared with my head pounding i princess meredith nicessus wielder of the hands of flesh and blood granddaughter of uar the cruel command you to step aside and let us pass he bowed lower and moved aside still in that bow major walters spoke on his radio again were coming through repeat were bringing the princess through clear the doors the sounds of fighting grew louder the blueeyed guard spoke into the air stand down men the princess is leaving the fighting slowed then there was no sound the blueeyed guard nodded at the other guards and they opened the great doors doyle moved up closer to me as hugh carried me forward for a moment i thought it was a magical attack of light then i realized that it was lights for moving cameras and flashes for still ones i closed my eyes against the blinding glare and hugh carried me through the doors chapter i was blind from the lights my head felt like it was going to explode from the assault of it all i wanted to scream at them to stop but was afraid that would only make it all hurt worse i closed my eyes and tried to shield them with one hand there was shadow against the light and a womans voice princess meredith im doctor hardy were here to help you a mans voice princess meredith were going to put you in a neck brace its just a precaution there was a wheeled stretcher beside us suddenly as if it had just sprung into being the medical team started to swarm me dr hardy was shining a light in my eyes trying to get me to follow it i could follow it but the other hands that i couldnt see lifting me starting to do things to me panicked me i started to slap at them to make small helpless sounds i dont know what it was about what they were doing but it was too much i couldnt see who was touching me i couldnt see what they were doing i didnt understand what was happening i could not bear it princess princess meredith can you hear me dr hardy asked yes i said in a voice that didnt sound like me at all we need to get you to a hospital dr hardy said to transport you there are things we need to do can you let us do those things i wasnt so much crying as tears just seemed to be sliding down my face i need to know what youre doing i need to see whos touching me she looked behind me at the barrage of media the police had moved in to form a wall against them but they would hear most of what we said the doctor leaned very close to me princess were you raped yes major walters bent close too i am sorry princess but i have to ask who did it a sidhe guard by the door said the unseelie did it as they raped lady caitrin shut up major walters said then he turned back to me is that true no i said then who taranis knocked me unconscious and i woke naked in his bed with him beside me liar the guard behind us said shanley who was in charge of these men said she took oath on it so did our king i cannot help that he said taranis hurt me he and no other i swear it by the darkness that eats all things you are mad to make such an oath a voice i didnt know said only if she lies i think that was sir hugh but there was so much noise so many voices the press had begun to yell at us they shouted their questions their theories we all ignored them dr hardy began to speak quietly to me to explain what was happening to me she began to introduce me to her team she would explain and only then would they touch me it began to help me lose that edge of hysteria only when a voice sounded on the microphone that i still had not seen did i make them stop the voice said we have told you what happened to the princess the unseelie guard who were supposed to protect her beat and raped her our king saved his niece from them and brought her to sanctuary here it was too much no matter how i felt i could not let them ship me to a hospital and leave that lie in the ears of the media i need a microphone please i need to tell the truth i said dr hardy didnt like it but hugh and others backed me up and they rolled me to the front of the room they insisted that i keep the choking closeness of the neck brace on i was already hooked up to an iv apparently my blood pressure was low and my body was a little shocky the doctor stepped up to the microphone i am dr vanessa hardy the princess needs to get to a hospital but she insists on talking to you she is injured and we need to get her to a hospital this will be quick i hope that is clear several of them said it is clear the press secretary was all pink and gold and sidhe beauty she didnt want to give up the mic shed heard enough from the doorway to worry her it was agent gillett who took it from her and held it for me you could feel the eagerness of the press like a sort of magic of their own a voice called who hit you taranis i said there was a collective sigh of eagerness and an explosion of flashes i closed my eyes against it did the unseelie rape you no were you raped princess taranis knocked me unconscious and kidnapped me and i woke nude in his bed he says we had sex i will be taking a rape kit at the hospital if it comes back positive for an unknown then yes my uncle raped me the police were holding the press secretary and some of the sidhe back by force some of the nobles and the dogs were helping them mind the crowd i heard growls around me the loudest was next to me the great black head touched my hand i raised fingers to stroke doyles fur that one small touch was more comfort than anything else had been dr hardy yelled above the chaos the princess has a concussion i need to get her to xray or a cat scan to see how serious it is so were leaving now i said no princess you said youd go quietly if you told the truth no its not that i cant have an xray im pregnant agent gillett was still holding the microphone close enough that the room had heard that if we thought there had been chaos before wed been wrong the press were yelling whos the father did your uncle make you pregnant dr hardy leaned close and whisperedshouted above the cacophony how far along are you four to five weeks i said we will treat you and your baby like gold she said i would have nodded but the neck brace kept me from doing so i finally said yes she looked up at someone i couldnt see and said we need to get her to a hospital now we began to push our way toward the door there were two main reasons we were having problems moving one was the press they all wanted one last image one last question answered the second was the seelie guards and nobles who opposed hugh they wanted me to stay with them they wanted me to recant inhumanly beautiful faces kept hovering over me saying things like how can you lie about our king how can you accuse your own uncle of such a crime liar lying bitch was the last one before the police got very serious above keeping the golden throng away from my face they tried to chase away the black dog but i said no hes mine no one questioned it dr hardy only said he doesnt go in the ambulance i didnt argue just doyle beside me in any form was an improvement every brush of his fur against my hand was better there were so many people around the stretcher so much light that the only way i knew we were finally outside was the brush of night air against my face it had been night when taranis took me was it the same night or the next night how long had he had me i tried to ask what day it was but no one heard me the press had followed us outside the sithen they trailed us with shouted questions and mobile lights the wheels of the gurney didnt like the grass the bumps made my head ache more i fought not to make small sounds of pain and was able to do it until the medics closed around us so that i could no longer touch doyles fur the moment i lost contact with him the pain was worse i spoke his name before i could stop myself doyle i said softly a plea the huge black head shoved its way under the doctors arm it made her stumble she tried to shove him away saying shoo i need him please she frowned at me but she dropped back a step so the dog could be closer to me close enough that my hand could caress his fur on most of the bumpy ride id never realized how uneven the grass around the mounds was until smoothness was what i needed it had always seemed like such level ground until this moment one of the cameras peered over the shoulders of the medics the light blinded me the pain spiked hard and sharp and nausea came with it im going to be sick they had to stop the gurney and help me lean over the side of it between the tubes and board and neck brace i couldnt have moved myself id never rolled onto my side with this many hands helping me dr hardy yelled while i threw up she has a concussion bright lights arent good for her being sick made the inside of my head explode or thats what it felt like my vision swam in ruins a hand touched my forehead a hand that was cool and solid and felt like i should know it my vision cleared to find a man with a blond beard and mustache peering into my face it was his hand on my forehead a baseball cap was pulled low on his face there was something about the blue eyes that looked vaguely familiar then while i still looked at this strangers face the eyes changed one eye held three rings of blue cornflower blue around the pupil sky blue then a circle of winter sky i whispered rhys he smiled through the fake beard hed used glamour to hide his eyes and other things but the beard was simply a good fake he had always been the best of the men at undercover work when we were with the detective agency i was crying and not wanting to because i was afraid it would hurt a voice came from behind him remember our deal rhys answered without turning around youll get your exclusive televised interview as soon as shes well enough i gave my word i must have looked confused because he said they let us come in as part of their crew for a promised interview or two i reached for him with my free hand he took it and kissed my palm the camera that had made me sick was back to recording just at a slightly better distance is he one of your guys dr hardy asked yes i said great but we need to keep moving sorry rhys said and he put a hand on my shoulder as they moved me back to my back my other hand searched again for the touch of fur and found it for a moment then a hand found mine i couldnt turn to see and he seemed to understand because galens face hovered over mine he had a hat on too and hed used glamour to make his green hair look brown and his skin look human he let the glamour go while i watched and it was smoother even than rhyss one moment a nicelooking human guy the next galen magic hey he said and his eyes filled with tears almost immediately hey i said back i had a thought for what might have happened if theyd been recognized earlier inside the mound but it was a small thought in that moment i was too happy to see them to worry about it or maybe i was just that sick dr hardy said any more romeos going to come out of the woodwork i dont know i said which was the absolute truth one more was inside with us galen said i couldnt think who else had glamour good enough to risk going inside before cameras and the seelie some peoples glamour actually didnt hold on camera and the seelie court was ruled by the master of illusion he was a bastard but he would have seen through their disguises my chest hurt with the thought of what might have happened i clutched galens hand tighter and wished i could move my head to look at rhys instead i was trapped staring at the night sky it was a good sky black and full of stars it was the end of january almost february shouldnt i be cold the thought was enough to let me know that i wasnt nearly as aware of everything as i thought i was hadnt someone said i was going into shock or had i dreamed that we were at the ambulance it was as if it had suddenly appeared to me it wasnt magic it was injury i was losing little bits of time that couldnt be good it was at the door of the ambulance that i found out who had had enough glamour to brave the press and the seelie sidhe he had short blond hair brown eyes and a nondescript face until he bent over me he gave the illusion that the short hair grew into a long braid that i knew would sweep the ground the brown eyes were three different colors of gold the nondescript face was suddenly one of the most handsome in all the courts sholto king of the sluagh kissed me ever so gently the darkness told me of his vision from the god i am to be a father he looked so pleased all that arrogance softened yes i said it softly he was so pleased so quietly happy he had risked all to come and rescue me even though i hadnt needed the rescue but i barely knew sholto i had been with him once it was not that he was not lovely but i would have traded much for it to be frost leaning over me speaking of our child i dont know who you are exactly but the princess needs a hospital dr hardy said i am a fool forgive me sholto touched my hair with such tenderness tenderness that we had not earned as a couple i knew he meant it but somehow it seemed wrong then they lifted me and slid me inside the ambulance the doctor stayed with me and a male nurse the rest went to a second ambulance or the drivers area of this one galen called well follow you to the hospital i raised a hand because i could not rise to see them off the black dog looked down at me he had jumped inside the look in those black eyes was so not dog dr hardy said no absolutely not out dog now the air was cool as if mist touched me then it was doyle in human form kneeling beside me the nurse said what the hell ive seen your picture youre doyle dr hardy said yes he said in his deep voice if i tell you to leave i will not she sighed give him a blanket and tell them to get us out of here before more naked men show up doyle draped the blanket around one shoulder and enough of him to make the humans comfortable the other arm he kept out so he could hold my hand what would you have done if hughs plan had not worked i asked we would have rescued you not tried just we would have such arrogance such surety it wasnt human more than the magic more than the otherworldly beauty that was sidhe and so not human the arrogance wasnt pretense neither was the certainty he was the darkness he had once been the god nodons he was doyle he had moved so i could see him easily as the ambulances wheels hit the road in a sound of gravel i stared up into that dark dark face i looked into those black eyes there were pinpoints of color in that darkness that were not reflections he carried colors in the black depths of his eyes that were no colors in the ambulance once he had used those colors to try to bespell me at my aunts orders a test to see how weak i might be or how strong the colors were like multicolored fireflies flitting and dancing in his eyes i can let you sleep until we reach the hospital he said no i said i closed my eyes against the pretty lights you are in pain merry let me help you im the doctor here hardy said and i say no magic on the injured until its explained to me i do not know if i can explain it doyle said no i said eyes still closed i dont want to be unconscious doyle the last time that happened i woke up in taraniss bed his hand convulsed around mine clutching at me as if he were the one in need of comfort it made me open my eyes the colored lights were fading as i looked into them i failed you my princess my love we all failed you we did not dream that the king could travel through sunlight we thought that a lost art he surprised us all i said then i thought of something i wanted to know my dogs he hurt them they will live minnie will bear a scar for a time but she will heal he raised my fingers to his lips and kissed them the veterinarian we took her to said she is going to have puppies i stared at him the puppies werent injured he smiled they are fine for no reason i could think of that one bit of news made me feel better my hounds had defended me and the king had tried to kill them but he had failed they would live and they would have puppies the first faerie hounds to be born in more than five centuries taranis had tried to make me his queen but i was already pregnant i already had my kings taranis had failed in every way if the rape kit came back positive though positive seemed the wrong word then i would see king taranis king of light and illusion in jail for rape the press were going to eat him alive charged with the abduction beating and rape of his own niece the seelie court had been the shining star of the human media that was about to change it was the unseelie courts time to shine even if it was with a darkling light we would be the good guys this time the seelie had offered me their throne but i knew better hugh and others might want me but the golden throng would never accept me as queen i carried babies whose fathers were unseelie lords id been the child of an unseelie prince and they had treated me as worse than nothing there would be no golden throne for me no if throne there be then it would be the throne of night maybe the throne needed a new name throne of night sounded so sinister taranis sat on the golden throne of the seelie court it sounded so much more cheerful shakespeare said that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet but i didnt believe it golden throne throne of night which throne would you rather sit on id survive tonight i even knew i was trying to think of anything everything to keep from dwelling on what taranis had done and the fact that frost wasnt going to be waiting for me at the hospital i was finally pregnant and i couldnt be happy about it for political reasons the rape kit coming back positive would be good it meant we owned taranis but for my own reasons i hoped hed lied i hoped he hadnt had his way with me while i was unconscious had his way with me nice euphemism i hoped he hadnt raped me while i was unconscious i hoped he hadnt raped me while i bled into my skull from the blow he had dealt me i started to cry hopelessly helplessly doyle bent over me whispering my name and that he loved me i buried my hand in the warmth of his hair drew him close so i could breathe in the scent of his skin i buried myself in the feel and smell of his body and wept i had won the race to sit on the throne of the unseelie court and it was bitter ashes on my tongue
